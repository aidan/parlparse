</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) to continue moving the amendment, I should remind members of the Committee that, should there be a Division in the House during our proceedings, the Committee will adjourn for 15 minutes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): At the end of the previous sitting, I was being intervened on by one of my colleagues, who is temporarily not with us. He was making a substantial point about the need to consider the real-world implications of the issue. Those implications include the fact that any attempt to introduce or prescribe a national minimum wage for young persons will make their employment relatively less attractive. Whatever the good intentions behind such an attempt, it may end up with them not being employed at all. I endorse that point.
<P>
I return to the complex series of points that I was making about the amendment. I had already discussed the fact that, perhaps accidentally, the provision of separate school leaving dates in Scotland and England--I am using those as a shorthand and excluding the other parts of the United Kingdom--is likely to create an inequity between young persons affected by them.
<P>
I also noted that there was a series of practical problems. Rather uncharacteristically, the Minister was not helpful when he intervened to speak about pensions in Berwick. Plenty of legitimate traders in Berwick, Carlisle or elsewhere would have to sort out the practical problems that we discussed.
<P>
I had begun to explain some of my concerns on the European side. The Committee will know that there is a growing interchange of young persons across Europe, which is entirely welcome--I have encouraged it myself in several ways. Those persons are caught up either in the treaty under the freedom of establishment provisions or under the posting of workers directive if they come to work in Britain for a limited time.
<P>
The Bill is silent--although the notes on clauses are not quite silent--about exactly how the compulsory school age will be determined. I made the working assumption that it related to the young person's place of residence and that it would be assessed on that basis rather than on the basis of his place of employment. Clearly, matters become even more complex once one considers the position of young European workers. A young person may come from a country with a much higher school leaving age--let us say 18. He would not, in the Minister's terms, be able to avail himself of the benefits of the national minimum wage. At the same time, UK-based young people of exactly the same chronological age would be able to do so. That is an anomaly. It may be unintended or--I do not believe this to be the case--inevitable, but it is also a measure of discrimination. Partly for the reason that I mentioned earlier, I am anxious, as a former Minister with a keen eye to the dangers of being caught in judicial meshes, that the Government should not entrap themselves without considering my point.
<P>
The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry will no doubt be familiar with the 1991 social security case of Thomas v Chief Adjudication Officer--I am sure that she thinks of no other case, although perhaps she thinks of many cases. That and other cases have established the principle that discrimination is justified only when it is necessary to achieve another legitimate purpose in Europe. Indeed, any discrimination should be proportional to the case in point. Even in our own families, we are very conscious of whether something is equally fair to siblings A, B and C--however fair and decent one was as a parent, things were not always fair for them all.
<P>
One can imagine not only practical problems for an employer. Of a series of young people who are employed or employable, some might be litigious or might have access to litigious persons whose sole job is to embarrass Governments. There might be Peter, say, from south of the border, Patrick from Northern Ireland, a third person from Scotland and Pedro from Portugal. Some of those young people fall within the national minimum wage, others do not. It does not look straightforward. One of them might go to the European Court and say, ``Sort this out.'' The Government have contrived a situation of discrimination between those young people, although I can see that they did not intend to, and they might well have difficulty in justifying it.
<P>
I tabled amendment No. 58 not simply because it is important to make the real-world point that young people may not get the minimum wage at all because they may not be offered it--employers may instead choose someone below the compulsory school-leaving age--but to draw attention to the application of the law. Given that there are different compulsory school-leaving ages within the United Kingdom, let alone in Europe, where one must consider workers who have a right to establishment within the European Community, we need to be more precise, if there is to be a distinction between the ages, as to which applies in what circumstances. I want to make the modest suggestion to the Minister--somewhat trailed in our amendment, which is not the end of the story--that it might be better and safer to take a chronological date and drop the idea of compulsory school-leaving age. As I said, it does not bear on the issue of whether young people at school should be in work and what rates they should be paid; it is merely an attempt to provide a starting point. I hope that I have shown it to be a somewhat shaky starting point, which the Government might want to reconsider, if not now, perhaps at their leisure.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> Unfortunately, the Minister has to date subjected us to a diet of verbal aggression and intellectual inadequacy. I hope that he will feel able to do something to remedy that and to enable the remainder of our sitting to be more constructive.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has just made a powerful argument. I want first to anticipate what I fear might be the comeback from the Minister, which is to say what he has consistently said--that we are trying to wreck the Bill. I want to put on the record once and for all that, in relation to this amendment, that is not our intention. I say that now so it is clear beyond doubt, even to the Minister. We know that he and his colleagues will win and that in due course, the Bill will reach the statute book--of that there is no doubt. I am not complaining about that. My hon. Friends and I are trying to improve the Bill. Let that be clear so that it is not a matter of debate or doubt. The Bill will happen, but we want to mitigate its worts effects.
<P>
One of the arguments that the Government have advanced to justify the very few exemptions that are proposed is that the Bill should be simple, clear and readily enforceable. I accept that that is an argument against great numbers of exemptions or large-scale variations. It is a perfectly respectable argument, although it is not necessarily conclusive. In this context, it runs in our favour because my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has identified in the Bill the potential for discrimination, unpredictable circumstances and inappropriately unequal treatment. We want to avoid those effects. I am not suggesting that the Government intended that there should be unequal treatment, discrimination, complexities and the potential for legal wrangles, but those are possible outcomes for precisely the reasons advanced by my hon. Friend. He pointed out that there are different school-leaving ages here and there and that it is not clear whether we are to take into account the country where people went to school or that in which they are proposing to work.
<P>
It makes sense for the Bill to cover people from age 17. Simplicity, transparency and intelligibility would become the hallmarks of the Bill, which sadly and, no, doubt, unintentionally, they are not at present.
<P>
My second observation, which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry was far too polite and self-effacing to make himself, is that we are being moderate. There is nothing new about that; we are frequently moderate and we are certainly moderate in this instance. We are simply suggesting the insertion of the criterion of age 17. We have not suggested anything more radical than that.
<P>
The British Chambers of Commerce, which I am sure the Minister will agree is an estimable organisation, makes a different suggestion. It may well--I have not asked it--find the amendment preferable to the status quo, as accepted by the Government. That organisation is making a different argument about age. It says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``everyone under the age of 19 years should be exempt, with no further age threshold applying, making all those above the age of 19 eligible for the full national minimum wage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not arguing that case; we are arguing for regularisation for simplicity and predictability. That will benefit actual and potential employers, employees and all those with an interest in minimising the damage and maximising the potential of the Bill. It is sensible, constructive and reasoned. If the Minister disagrees, we shall no doubt hear why. I hope that he will be able to prevail upon himself to argue the case fairly, in a mild-mannered fashion and with comparable reasonableness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond (Runnymede and Weybridge):</B> I should like to make a different point in support of the amendment by focusing on what is at the heart of the different approaches of the two sides of the Committee: a disagreement about the economics of the labour market. The Minister clearly believes--he said so on Second Reading and has said so subsequently--that the introduction of the minimum wage and the increase in wages that that implies may lead to an increase in employment. Conservative Members, however, believe that the increase in wages that the minimum wage will impose will lead to a decrease in employment. That is the classical view of the economics of the employment market.
<P>
It follows that the Government believe that including people within the scope of the minimum wage is a benefit to them because they will get paid more. The Minister appears to believe that the situation is that simple. We, on the other hand, take the view that by including marginal workers within the scope of the minimum wage, we will effectively be putting their jobs at risk, so that is a disbenefit.
<P>
My point, which is somewhat different from those raised by my hon. Friends, concerns the effect that the clause will have on the incentive for pupils to stay in school beyond the compulsory leaving age. The Opposition argue from the premise that the national minimum wage is a disbenefit that is imposed on marginal workers. Most people would agree that 17 or 18-year-olds are marginal workers. If that is accepted, it is possible to envisage that people who choose to stay on at school after the age of 16 risk finding that their Saturday and vacation jobs are taken over by people below the compulsory school leaving age.
<P>
Creating an unfavourable contrast between earnings that people could achieve in school by remaining there and jobs that their colleagues below the compulsory school leaving age may take is a disincentive to people at the margin who may stay on at school. That should be avoided, if possible.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would go some way towards mitigating the effects of the disincentive created by the inclusion of the compulsory school leaving age as the relevant threshold. I would prefer that all people at school, of whatever age, were excluded from the scope of the Bill. That has a significant logic, and would avoid a very real risk to what I am sure all members of the Committee want--namely, as many pupils as possible staying at school to the age of 18.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> I apologise for being unable to hear the whole of the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, but I have gathered from him the gist of his comments. It struck me that the amendment would be a useful improvement to the Bill. When examining the notes on clauses, I was struck by the implications of different school leaving ages in different parts of the United Kingdom. The Minister will, perhaps, correct me if my interpretation is wrong.
<P>
It seems that the differences between England and Northern Ireland are not very significant, as the relevant dates occur between the last Friday of June and 1 July. For Scotland, however, the implications are substantial. For example, my birthday is in December. If I were a pupil in Scotland and chose to leave school at the earliest possible date, I could do so at the beginning of the Christmas holiday, if the notes on clauses are correct.
<P>
That is in contrast with the rules in England, according to which I could leave school on the last Friday in June. That is a very substantial difference. I stand to be corrected by the Minister, but I think that that six-month difference gives force to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry about some of the comparisons that will be made across borders within the United Kingdom. Any law that is perverse in this way brings itself into disrepute and can damage the import and effect of the Bill. For that reason alone, there is merit in pursuing the route to which my hon. Friend referred.
<P>
I also endorse the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) that there may even be more to be said in favour of looking beyond the amendment to the question of whether people who are in full-time education up to the age of 18 or 19 should be excluded altogether from the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making those points with his characteristic lucidity. Does he agree that it would be possible--Ministers may like to consider this point--to table an amendment that gave a chronological starting point and a revision-making power that would enable it to be adjusted upwards, or otherwise, in line with changes in the compulsory school leaving age?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, that would be a good way of proceeding, if Ministers were happy to do so. When the Minister responds to the debate, perhaps he will take that very good advice. The Bill is enabling in character and there may be such teething problems associated with the introduction of so wide-ranging an interference in labour market practices as is implied by the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Might it not also be a good idea to have a power to vary the age at which the full rate will apply, based upon our experience of the evidence over a number of years? If it became clear after one, two or three years after the application of the national minimum wage that among young people, for example, it was causing substantially increased unemployment, the President of the Board of Trade would then have the power to adjust upwards the age at which it would apply to take that into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, that further illustrates the benefit of proceeding in a different way from that proposed in the original text of the Bill. There is a danger that the application of the national minimum wage to people from as early as the compulsory school leaving age will mean that for 17 and 18-year-olds, employment at the national minimum wage is substantially harder to achieve than at present. That may not be wholly bad. Young people may be encouraged to remain in full-time education for longer--a positive, though presumably unintentional, consequence of the measure. However, many young people may want to combine education with employment, and the availability of part-time, vacation and casual work for young people who are otherwise primarily devoted to education and schooling will dry up and those opportunities will be lost.
<P>
The application of this measure may in years to come result in substantial pressure for the exemption of young people in full-time education up to the age of 19. On those grounds, there is everything to be said for encouraging Ministers to take a different approach.
<P>
As we said earlier, we may have to legislate not only for current but for changed circumstances. If, for example, the Chancellor of the Exchequer were to remove child benefit from 16 to 18-year-olds, there may be increased pressure for young people to support household incomes and the costs of their maintenance through part-time or casual work which may be drying up at exactly the same time, so they may feel squeezed by the Government on two counts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): My hon. Friends have made a number of cogent points, so I shall be extremely brief. I should like to address two issues that have not been fully explored. First, is it appropriate in principle to use the compulsory school leaving age in legislation designed to affect the labour market? It seems for several reasons that the Government may well wish to think again and possibly introduce amendments at some stage during the Bill's passage through the House.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred earlier to some of the possibly unfortunate consequences of using the school leaving age as the basis for this type of legislation. As time goes on, it will not be a matter of controversy between both sides of the Committee that the idea of a compulsory school leaving age, after which something happens to change the status of large numbers of young people, is wrong and sends out the wrong signals. It is surely not a matter of controversy between us that we all wish children to stay on in education for as long as possible--and not just children, for the concept of lifetime learning is now widely acknowledged as sensible. It is foolish if a piece of legislation designed, I assume, partly to increase the amount of employment in this country--although we disagree with that premise--sends out the signal that something different happens to people after the compulsory school leaving age and they begin the working part of their lives.
<P>
Moreover, if one accepts the Minister's presumption that introducing the minumum wage will have little or no effect on employment, then one has to accept that, in times of economic growth, the introduction of a minimum wage will harm those who have passed the compulsory school leaving age. Young workers who become employable at the national minimum wage will find that option more attractive than staying in education. So in boom times such as we have experienced in the past couple of years, when it has been comparatively easy to find work, 17-year-olds will be attracted into jobs just when the country should take advantage of the strong economy to keep them in education or training and increase their skills. That would make them more employable in later life and improve the competitiveness of the economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered what the consequences would be if the compulsory school leaving age were to be changed by the Scottish Parliament, but not by the Parliament covering England and Wales? If the age were to be raised, people who had already left school and who were deriving benefit from the national minimum wage might not be recalled to school but they might have those benefits taken away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend has made two points in one. The introduction of the Scottish Parliament may increase the existing differences between the English and Scottish education systems and may result in radically different approaches in the two countries. Who is to say whether, in time, the same may not happen in Wales? The Government would have to return to this legislation as the concept of a national minimum wage, as it affects young workers and school leavers, would be otiose. Any effect that it had might only be perverse.
<P>
My hon. Friend's second good point is that people involved in a possible change in the compulsory school leaving age should not be disadvantaged. There are practical difficulties as well as difficulties in principle in using the compulsory school leaving age as the basis for this part of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that rejection of the amendment would discourage 17-year-olds from remaining in or entering full-time education, and that that would break faith with another of the Government's policies? The Government's target 2000 programme aims to make recognised forms of training or full-time eduction available to all 16 to 18-year-olds. Does not the Bill conflict with that policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend leads me, with uncanny precision, to the next point that I was about to make. Other elements of the Government's policy seek to blur the distinction between full-time education and long-term training. The Government are setting up several expensive programmes--we all hope that they will work, but some of us doubt it--to encourage people of 17, 18 and 19 years, and more, to stay in some kind of full-time education. It is perverse of the Government to introduce this dividing line between those who are required to earn the minimum wage on entering the labour market and those who are not so required.
<P>
In other clauses, it is accepted that younger workers may be less skilled and profitable than others and that it should therefore be easier for them to price their way into jobs. The compulsory school-leaving age is not an appropriate line to draw.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My second point is about job substitution, which my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge touched upon. The notes on clauses are extremely illuminating, partly because they are unusually tortured in their prose. Care is required when working through them, because the unfortunate fact that faces the Government is the ludicrous requirement to pay young workers different rates for the same job, depending on whether they are in full-time education. People who go over the compulsory school-leaving age will lose jobs and be replaced by those who are under that age. That is not only an unwelcome and unhelpful intervention in the labour market, but bad news for many young workers.
<P>
Money brought into certain households by children working after school or on Saturdays is welcome, not just because it increases young workers' independence, but because it relieves the economic burden on parents. The arbitrary guideline of the compulsory school-leaving age may be damaging and I cannot believe that the Government intend such an effect.
<P>
I would prefer a more radical approach, but I urge the Committee to support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry because it would improve the clause considerably.

<P>

<B>Barbara Follett </B>(Stevenage): I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the amendment, though I wish that we had discussed something other than age today. We have discussed old age and are now dealing with school-leaving age. Perhaps that is to do with the fact that the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) turned 35 yesterday. On behalf of Labour Members, I wish him a happy birthday and congratulate him on having kept his boyish good looks, though I could wish that that extended to him losing his boyish sense of humour. Maturity is necessary here.
<P>
The clause establishes the entitlement of all workers to a national minimum wage from school leaving age. I cannot understand Conservative Members' obsession with that age and the nine-month variance within the United Kingdom. A dose of common sense, which perhaps was not taught at Eton when you and I were at school, Mr. Boswell. Excuse me for saying ``you''. I was referring to the hon. Member for Daventry. I seem to share a problem with my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)--put it down to our age.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for making those points. Will she accept that I was not at Eton college and--I hope that no one on either Front Bench will take grave offence--that our reason for tabling the amendment was our severe worry about the capacity of lawyers to upset the Bill despite the Government's good intentions? There is no more to it than that, although a fruitful discussion of other matters has been sparked.
<P>
<B>Barbara Follett:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman, and Eton school, will accept my apologies.
<P>
Common sense can get one through the arguments about the compulsory school-leaving age put across by Conservative Members. The amendment of the hon. Member for Daventry undermines the aim to establish that entitlement because it would exclude a group of workers--those who have reached the compulsory school-leaving age but who are not yet 17. There is no justification whatever for excluding that group. On the contrary, there are strong reasons for its inclusion, not least the fact that 8,000 young people in this country are currently working for less than &#163;2.50 an hour.
<P>
	The first reason for the group's inclusion is that we would ensure a general floor for wages which is clear and easy to enforce. It is true that workers under 17 have less experience than their older colleagues, but I remind Conservative Members that we are talking about a minimum wage, not an average wage. Many young people do exactly the same work for exactly the same number of hours as their older colleagues. I believe that that entitles them to exactly the same minimum reward. I emphasise the word ``minimum''. A good employer will reward experience and ability, but that reward must start from a minimum floor if we are to rid this country of poverty pay.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B> <I>rose</I>--
<P>
<B>Barbara Follett:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
Far too many employers use taxpayers' money to subsidise their older paid workers through family income supplement and even more employers use housing benefit to subsidise their low-paid workers. Those are not merely unscrupulous employers; they are inefficient. I want to rid this country of inefficient employers who use the tax system to subsidise their poor business practice. Followed to its logical conclusion, the argument about experience would lead the United Kingdom into a heavily tiered minimum wage system similar to those in Belgium and the Netherlands. It would be a bureaucratic nightmare. I hope that the Opposition are not advocating that.
<P>
The second reason for rejecting the amendment is that a minimum floor protects older workers. It means that younger workers cannot be brought in to replace them at lower wages. It means that their jobs are safeguarded. It also safeguards the younger workers from being sacked when they reach 17 and replaced by even younger workers between 16 and 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does not the hon. Lady appreciate that that is exactly the point about which we are concerned? If we create an artificial threshold of the minimum school-leaving age, those above that age who choose to stay on at school and who are required to be paid the national minimum wage will find their opportunities for doing Saturday jobs or holiday work displaced by those just below the compulsory school-leaving age who are not subject to any such minimum wage. Does she not think that that would cause bad feeling, create an absurd situation and provide a heavy disincentive to people to stay on at school and complete their education?
<P>
<B>Barbara Follett:</B> No, I do not think that it would provide a heavy disincentive. I have raised five children, the youngest of whom is 22. There is a rule in our house that those children who are not in full-time education have to be in full-time work. No work, no allowance. All my children have had to work. They have all managed to find jobs, one of them in Tesco at more than &#163;4 an hour. In my constituency, Tesco pays its young workers more than &#163;4 an hour. I do not think that an efficient and good employer wants to have young people working for poverty pay. We are setting a minimum standard to which I hope and expect employers will aspire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Barbara Follett:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
The measure will allow young workers to earn enough to spend some of their wages on items other than total necessities. I believe strongly in the multiply effect. If young workers earn enough to enjoy their leisure and to buy goods and services, they will benefit both the local and the national economies. I therefore oppose the amendment. I did not give way because whatever assurances the hon. Member for Buckingham may give, I know that the Opposition's function is to delay legislation, especially when they have no chance of wrecking it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Numerous Opposition Members have invited me to be reasonable. I am never anything other than reasonable, but that does not mean that I am a patsy who rolls over for every daft idea that comes from the Opposition.
<P>
I will deal with the issues seriously, as I always do. Before I do so, however, I too, congratulate the hon. Member for Buckingham--I did not realise that it was his birthday. Tebbit the younger is, I think, his title--[Interruption.] It was a compliment.
<P>
To return to the amendments, I should say at the outset that the point of the clause is to ensure universality in the principle of the minimum wage. Other clauses deal with issues that relate to the recommendations that may come from the Low Pay Commission. Some of the issues that have been raised may, therefore, be dealt with in more detail on those clauses. I am sure that hon. Members will not take it that I am trying to avoid issues when I say that some of those more detailed debates are best held later rather than on the narrowly defined proposition before us.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymead and Weybridge raised the issue of job losses. The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) dealt with young people and education. Over the years, the Conservatives have consistently argued as a matter of course that the minimum wage would cause job losses--the hon. Member for Buckingham nods. Nothing that I can say or do will remove that scurrilous allegation from their position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will just finish my point. The hon. Gentleman should curb his enthusiasm.
<P>
We should consider what happened in the United Kingdom in terms of wages councils and international comparisons. The previous Government decided to abolish wages councils. In the process, they came up against opposition from farmers and farm workers in regard to the agricultural wages boards. The Government decided to test the situation and had an independent academic research paper produced. It was to form the basis for their position on the continuation or otherwise of the agricultural wages boards. That independent analysis showed that the proposition of minimum standards in the labour market for agricultural workers and workers in general would not lead to job losses. So the previous Government punctured their own intellectual argument on job losses.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I have a little string under the desk.
<P>
On international comparisons--
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the Minister give way on job losses?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I know that it is on job losses-- I know exactly what the hon. Gentleman is going to say. I will not give way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister is not giving way yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Not yet. I am still standing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Prove it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked me to prove it, but he will just have to take my word for it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mrs. Dunwoody may be absent, but I assure members of the Committee that her spirit remains in the Room.

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I would not for a moment suggest that you, Mr. Atkinson, were softer than the hon. Lady.
<P>
The Financial Times recently contained a detailed article about the minimum wage which described the United States' experience and discussed the setting of a sensible level for the minimum wage. In the article, Mr. Bernstein concluded that the increase in the minimum wage in the United States had the desired impact in that it raised the incomes of low wage workers with the incomes of families and in spite of opponents' claims did not lead to job losses. My hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett) was making a point about the impact on spending power of raising the incomes of low paid workers.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bernstein went on to say that an increase in October 1996 had no significant effect on the employment of teenagers and young adults. The balance of evidence for the year was that at the level set there was little impact on employment. An international comparison showed therefore that a significant increase in the level of the minimum wage had not led to job losses and in the American economy overall there were many job gains during the period of the increase.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister cited the example of the United States to back up his argument and that example will undoubtedly be used throughout the debate. Does he accept that the minimum wage as it operates in the United States has distinct differences from what is proposed in the Bill?
<P>
Does the Minister also accept that the example he quoted in the agriculture sector is distinct from what operates in many other sectors of the economy? Under the common agricultural policy, agricultural markets are not free markets and are not subject to competition. Jobs in agriculture in this country are not vulnerable to competition from imports as are jobs in manufacturing.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I do not know if the hon. Gentleman studied history at school but to my certain knowledge, agricultural wages boards pre-date our involvement in the common agricultural policy and our entry into the European Community. They date back to 1906. The hon. Gentleman is weak on history and his argument does not stand up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will give way in a minute.
<P>
On the subject of the United States, the way in which individual countries operate their minimum wage is a matter for them, but what is at stake here is the concept that a minimum standard in the labour market has either a negative or a positive impact. International comparisons do not show the negative impact that Conservative Members say will result from a minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I wonder whether the Minister read the article by Timothy Hatton on agricultural wages boards in the inter-war years in the Institute of Economic Affairs journal. The study makes a comparison between district and county, so one can see within the economy as a whole the variation in employment occasioned by different levels of minimum wage. The article says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``By correlating the changes in local rates with changes in employment data for the same localities, it is possible to make a cross-sectional comparison (across counties) .
.
. The results show a significant negative relationship between the minimum wage and employment--a wage increase of 1 per cent. is associated with an employment decrease of about half of 1 per cent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister comment on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I made it clear that the most recent evidence about the effects of agricultural wages boards was produced under the previous Government in relation to their consideration about whether to continue the agricultural wages boards and a minimum pay level in that sector of the economy. The evidence was that a minimum wage did not have a negative impact. The consequence was that the previous Government retained the agricultural wages boards because they could not prove in intellectual or practical terms that having a minimum wage in that labour market had a negative impact on jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh):</B> Is the Minister aware that research has been going on across the United States for some 10 years? The United States is a federation of states, with many different economic characteristics in different parts of the country. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in seven different studies throughout the United States carried out in states with vastly different economies, it has been found that the introduction and uprating of the national minimum wage over time has led in no measurable case to a decrease in employment. In some cases, employment has risen by as much as 15 per cent. The key factor to come out of that research, as the Minister may confirm, is that the increase in the very lowest levels of wages has stayed within the local economy. The increased spending power of the lower paid families has gone straight back into the local economy to create local wealth and has been shown to create employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The academic work that has been done in the United States has, except in one instance, been positive about both the potential impact on jobs growth and spending power in the community. That is critical, because one of our arguments is that a minimum wage will assist the process of economic regeneration. That is because, for a range of diverse reasons, the overwhelming majority of low-paid workers spend their disposable income in the local economy. They spend their disposable income on goods and services in the local economy for the benefit of local businesses. That is a long-understood fact. A minimum wage assists the increase in purchasing power, particularly in areas of low economic growth. It helps regeneration, rather than detracting from it.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will give way, but I do not want it thought that I am filibustering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sure that not even the Minister's harshest critic would accuse him of filibustering his own Bill.
<P>
This issue requires more analysis than simply saying that the increase in purchasing power will improve the local economy. The logic of that position is that if the minimum wage were doubled, purchasing power would be increased so much that there would be net employment gains. If it were trebled, there would be even more, and quadrupling it would mean even more than that. This is clearly economic nonsense. A balance must be struck, even in the Minister's terms, between the amount at which the minimum wage is set and how much effect that has on wage levels and on the general competitiveness of local firms.
<P>
Has the Minister considered the study by Mr. De Long, professor of economics at Berkeley university in California? It says that a 10 per cent. boost to the minimum wage will reduce employment among affected workers by 0.5 per cent. to 1 per cent. even after taking into account the purchasing effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Perhaps I can intervene in the hon. Gentleman's speech. When we were in Opposition, I used to sit exactly where the hon. Gentleman sits. It may please him to note that I also used similar tactics on numerous occasions.
<P>
The purpose of the Low Pay Commission, as its terms of reference set out, is to ensure that wider economic and social consequences and implications were part and parcel of the commission's responsibilities in coming to recommendations. The Government have given the commission a wide remit in these matters.
<P>
I said at the outset that one survey carried out in the United States was less than positive about the minimum wage; but 15 professors of economics in one room could produce 15 different views. However, the view on the impact of a minimum wage in the United States has been overwhemingly positive rather than negative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentlman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Not for the moment--let me carry on. There will be ample opportunity for the hon. Gentleman to intervene over the next three years--and, at the Committee's present rate of progress, it probably will be three years. However, I am sure that people elsewhere will make sure that we move a bit quicker than that.
<P>
The amendment attempts to prevent young people from being covered by the Bill, even after they have left school, with an arbitrary cut-off point of 17 years. The Government have not drafted the Bill arbitrarily. We have taken a common sense approach. Young people should become entitled to the national minimum wage when they are able to join the permanent work force. That approach will apply universally throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>
The Government do not aim to change education systems in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. We know that school leaving ages are different. That does not add to the anomalies of the different systems--the effects will be marginal. The practical cases are marginal for two reasons. The differences in school leaving age are small. I understand that the difference between Scotland and England is three months at the most. The number of children involved will be tiny. If I am wrong, I shall apologise to the Committee and correct myself.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry made a point about some Portuguese twins. I am not sure whether they are identical twins. One of them was called Pedro; I am not sure what the other was called.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Pepe.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Pedro and Pepe. Irrespective of the youngsters' position under Portuguese law, their entitlement will be determined by the political law of the United Kingdom--it does not depend on Portuguese law. If under Portuguese law, a youngster was entitled to leave school, and even if under UK law the youngster could not be forced to attend school, his or her entitlement to the minimum wage would depend on whether he or she had reached the school leaving age under the law applying to the relevant part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether when he refers to the law applying to the relevant part of the United Kingdom, he means the law related to employment in that part of the United Kingdom, or to residents? The two may not be the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> If the youngsters are in England, the school leaving age in England will apply; the same would be true in Scotland or other parts of the United Kingdom. That is relevant because the young peoples' directive, about which the hon. Gentleman knows and which the Government will soon sign, defines a young person as someone over compulsory full-time school leaving age. Under national law, that person would have to be under the age of 18.
<P>
The directive sets out clearly and specifically that there are different school leaving ages across Europe. The matter relates not to European law but to national law about school leaving ages. The matter is not, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, a very difficult one of international law and potential disagreements. The European Community already recognises that a range of matters--especially those that concern young workers and school leaving ages--are for national law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I think that the Minister ought to be aware of praying in aid the American example, because he is setting his face like flint against any variation for young people other than those in the under-26 trainee category for which provision has already been made. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in the United States, employees under the age of 20 may be paid the youth minimum wage for the first 90 consecutive calendar days after they commence employment? Is he prepared to allow the Low Pay Commission to consider the appropriateness of such an arrangement for the United Kingdom? It appears to have been ruled out by the hon. Member for Stevenage, who I suspect is unaware of the situation in America. Will the Minister consider it?

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I thought that the Committee had moved on from that point. I apologise, Mr. Atkinson; it is my fault for giving way to the hon. Gentleman. I should trust myself not to trust the former secretary of the Monday club. I am far too soft.
<P>
On 23 September last year, the President of the Board of Trade wrote to Professor George Bain, chairman of the Low Pay Commission. Her letter will answer the hon. Gentleman. She stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I am writing to set out the terms of reference of the Low Pay Commission.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Commission is asked to:--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) recommend the initial level at which the national minimum wage might be introduced;
<P>
(ii) make recommendations on lower rates or exemptions for those aged 16-25;''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is the issue that the hon. Gentleman raised--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(iii) consider and report on any matters referred to it by Ministers.
<P>
 In making its recommendations, the Commission should have regard to the wider economic and social implications; the likely effect on the level of employment and inflation; the impact on the competitiveness of business, particularly the small firm sector; and the potential impact on the cost to industry and the Exchequer.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point is erroneous. The Government set out the conditions to be considered during the setting of the minimum wage, and Professor George Bain and his colleagues on the commission had to take account of a range of measures before making a recommendation about the starting rate.
<P>
The amendment is another of those families of measures on which Conservative Members procrastinate because they are completely opposed to the minimum wage. They use any method that they can to undermine the principle, concept and universality of the minimum wage--in their view, groups of workers should be excluded. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I could not disagree more with the Minister's last remarks. They go to the heart of our concerns. We shall press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
I thought for a moment--you are very indulgent, Mr. Atkinson--that we had slipped back in a time warp, not to below the compulsory school-leaving age but to Second Reading. I am flattered that my modest amendment has triggered such an interesting debate on the wider philosophical issues. It would be inappropriate, particularly because both sides want to make progress, to rehearse those matters, but I shall pick up on two points made by the Minister.
<P>
First, the American national minimum wage, which amazingly has not barked previously, is very low, even after the relatively recent increase to $5.15--about &#163;3--an hour and given the greater incomes in the United States. Perhaps that fact should play in the debate. Secondly, the Minister accurately read out the President of the Board of Trade's remit letter to the chairman of the Low Pay Commission. It is a pity that Ministers have not yet given evidence to the commission. Will any commission recommendation be enactable, given the constraints that Ministers have put on themselves? For example, there will be genuine difficulties in dealing with older trainees, an issue to which we must return.
<P>
The Minister wants universality but, as my hon. Friends and I have exposed, an exactly equal set of provisions will not apply, so we have tabled the amendment. A simple chronological test or, if the Minister is concerned about leaving people out, the age of 16 could have been used. We would then have had a principled basis for proceeding. However, young persons in one country might benefit, as the Government see it, from the national minimum wage while those in another country, who are the same in all other respects--their school hours will not be cut into--might not. That is not universality or a national minimum wage; it is discriminatory. The Minister has confirmed that that is no accident, nor do we totally accept his figures over my hon. Friend's analysis of the potential disparity between Scotland and England.
<P>
That brings me to the European situation. The Minister gave half a reply. He might just keep himself out of the European Court on the matter and has clearly taken advice. I return to my mythical analogy of Pepe and Pedro. One was to be posted to Scotland, the other to England. We now know that their circumstances would be different not because the Government accidentally made a mistake but because they decided not to carry through the principle of universality by which they set such great store.
<P>
It is a small matter and I shall not dilate on it. However, a mess remains, and the way out of it is easy and would not subvert the Bill. Conservative Members wish to make clear, in the Division that will follow, our enthusiasm for resolving that mess.

Government amendments Nos. 32, 33 and 57.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is nice to engage the Government in a direct debate on matters of principle. From what your learned colleague, Mrs. Dunwoody, said this morning, Mr. Atkinson, and from the tenor of today's debate, I have the sense that there will be some limitations on debate. Clearly, we can debate the amendments in order. There is, however, not much steam--including on the Opposition Benches--behind debating the whole lot on clause stand part, so I am relaxed about that.
<P>
The amendments go to the heart of what the Government are trying to do in clause 1, so the principle should be briefly summarised and discussed. As usual, the notes on clauses express matters lucidly. They say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The purpose of clause 1 is to establish a universal entitlement to a single national minimum wage which applies to all workers above compulsory school age in the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no problem with that interpretation of the intention behind clause 1. We have just had a minor flurry about the details of clause 1 in action because the Government have shown that they are prepared, in certain respects, to countenance differences in treatment in the various countries of the United Kingdom. We have also had a long debate about whether trainees should be included in the Bill and, by inference, whether there should be a training rate if they are included.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to open the question more widely to determine whether there should be more than one rate. The essential difference in Committee is that the Government clearly believe that the best way of safeguarding what they would call labour market minimum standards is to have a single rate. I concede, before the Minister intervenes, that the potential exists for different treatment of under-26s. It is, however, pretty clear that the Government think that they should have a single rate. Conservative Members have severe reservations in principle and in practice about whether a single rate is appropriate. The purpose of the amendments is to open up the issue of whether there should be one rate or more.
<P>
Before we go any further, I should tell the Minister that I clearly understand--as I would if I were in his shoes and were introducing the Bill--the interest in having a degree of relative simplicity. I am sure that, even if he wanted to, he would not want to go back to the wages council structure. In defence of the wages councils it should be said that they were at least designed to take up the issues and problems of the industries or sectors involved. They could tailor arrangements and statutory minima to the benefit or the circumstances of those industries. The same can be said in support of the Agricultural Wages Board, which still exists, as it did under our Government. Nevertheless, the Minister has said that he wants a universal approach and we can see that that is broadly what he is trying to do. I need to convince the Committee, through the amendments, that that is not a wise course of action and that the Minister should think twice before pursuing it.
<P>
Our objection in principle is that the Minister wants to impose a statutory minimum on all sorts of employment--which is widely interpreted--in the United Kingdom. That is, by definition, likely to have an effect on all sorts of employment in the United Kingdom. It will either have a significant effect or it will not. Given that all those circumstances are different, our worry is that a single statutory rate will either have no material effect--although, as the Minister knows, the Confederation of British Industry and others have expressed concern about potential job losses resulting from rates as low as &#163;3 an hour--and therefore many people will feel severely short-changed by the Minister's aspirations in seeking a statutory minimum wage, or it will have a material effect, in which case it will be an inappropriate effect on some sectors.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Those who employ investment bankers, for example, will not be sweating much about a national minimum wage because they could not get anyone even to stir the tea at anything less than double the national minimum wage, on whatever basis it is introduced. In other sectors, many more people are comparatively low paid, not always in sweated labour, not always with bad employers and not always in cowboy operations. One thinks of the implications of the proposals for the hairdressing industry and the restaurant and catering industry among others, where, whatever rate is chosen, a statutory single rate is likely to have industrial consequences.
<P>
This debate allows us to put on the record some points of principle, but I do not want to prolong it. We do not see the imposition of a single rate as meeting the wide range of circumstances in the economy--nor is that inherently implausible. The nature of a market system, which the Government now seem broadly to accept, is that it tailors certain factors--in this case remuneration and pay rates--to a particular combination of circumstances where supply--that is, the readiness of someone to supply their labour services--meets demand--which is the readiness of someone to pay for those labour services. Unless we have a system where every single employer meets every single employee at a single going rate--the market clearing rate--there will be disparity and difficulties. Of course, as I shall show, we do not have such a system. Intervention by the Government in the operation of the market is likely to have certain consequences and to make things more difficult for some.
<P>
First, there is the question of different occupations. In a sense, I am reversing the Government's list in clause 2. I shall just touch on this now because we will debate it in detail under the amendments tabled to clause 2. Different people have different jobs at different rates in different places. The impact of a statutory minimum wage will be very different according to occupation. There is also the question of different sectors of employment, which presumably means people doing the same job in different sectors--for example, someone could be a lawyer in Government service, the private sector or private practice, to take three cases. In my experience--I do not want to be bitter--lawyers are not too worried about the national minimum wage, either, unless they are unemployed barristers. Those are two different categories.
<P>
Then there is the question of whether there are trainees, which relates to the productivity of the particular individual. We have debated that extensively and I am sure that you will be relieved, Mr. Atkinson, if we do not revisit that now. There are also interesting questions about size. We know from the evidence that has been collected that there is a tendency for smaller employers and small businesses to have rather lower-paid employees. There may be reasons for that, including the other, non-monetary benefits that people derive from working for small businesses as opposed to large, impersonal organisations. I can understand that. It can also include the pattern of involvement in family labour, but clearly there is a slight tendency in that direction. It may also be aggravated by the fact that many of those small businesses are in sectors such as catering and personal service trades which have a high concentration of relatively low-paid people. The likely effect of imposing a single rate is that small businesses, particularly in those trades, will be harder hit and people affected by the minimum wage will be less attractive to their employers than will be the case in trades that have larger businesses.
<P>
I remember, because they were a defining moment in the Committee's proceedings, the remarks made by the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor). She implied that people are employed at proper rates in the businesses in her town and that the Bill would not cause a problem. I am not caricaturing her remarks; I certainly do not seek to do so.
<P>
Engineering employers have concerns about the Bill but have said positively that they wish to collaborate with the Government in making it work as well as they can, although it is not the measure they would have chosen. Nevertheless, they concede generally that there are not many people in full-time engineering employment who would be affected by the Bill. We are talking not about trainees, but about full-timers.
<P>
Responses vary but there is concern that the Bill will target smaller businesses which, as the Committee will know, are typically in sectors in which employment is growing quickly. Indeed, they are the only sectors in which there is expanding employment and in which the chances of jobs will arise in the future. Commendably, but with a degree of implausibility, the Government are relying on smaller businesses in their welfare-to-work programme.
<P>
There are differences between industrial sectors, and the pay of employees within individual firms differs, but there are characteristics within the sectors which suggest that we should pause before taking a standard, universal approach.
<P>
Although this is not my sole point, the argument for universality against a degree of differentiation comes to a head in relation to regional pay. Many members of the Committee will know that there are significant varieties in pay, costs and, therefore, disposable income between different parts of the country. Not everyone, whether in Newcastle or Newhaven, is in the same circumstances. For any given wage rate, different factors will apply. To take an obvious point, the likely pay-out in mortgage interest is about twice as much in the south-east of England as it is in the north-east. A single universal rate, which imposes the same hourly rate, will therefore mean something different in Newhaven from what it means in Newcastle.
<P>
I shall cite a general example and then a specific one. We know that there are large variations in the employment pattern. The CBI's evidence to the Low Pay Commission, which I am sure many hon. Members have seen, defines low wages as under &#163;4 an hour--that is neither a prescriptive nor a prospective figure--and contains a table showing that there is considerable regional variation in rates of pay. In Greater London, 15 per cent. of employees earn under &#163;4 an hour, but the figure is 35 per cent. in south Yorkshire. It is no accident that the figures for many of the regions that have traditionally experienced economic disadvantage--the north-east, Wales and parts of Yorkshire--tend to be clustered together.
<P>
Given that no hon. Member representing a Northern Ireland constituency is in the Committee, it is also fair to point out that a large disparity exists with the Province. An average wage is not the same as a minimum wage, but it is indicative, and the average wage in Northern Ireland is only 60 per cent. of the average in inner London, Britain's highest paid region. That is a very large spread.
<P>
Let us assume that the commission comes up with a minimum figure of &#163;3.50 an hour. People in London would accept that figure only in exceptional circumstances, but it would be a different kettle of fish in the north-east of Wales, where it would much more closely approach the going rate for significant numbers of people.
<P>
The example that I wish to share with the Committee springs from my experience as an education Minister. That Department used to be almost entirely policy driven. The structure has been changed, in some ways for the better, by the adoption of responsibility for employment. One part of the Department was concentrated in a block in one building just a few hundred metres from here, and the other part of the Department occupied several buildings in Darlington. About 40 per cent. of the staff of the Department was outposted in Darlington.
<P>
I always enjoyed my vists to Darlington and found the staff there to be of a very high calibre. The structure of their work was not always optimal, but the people in the Darlington outpost did an excellent job. The London-Darlington example is relatively simple and worth the Committee's attention. In a parliamentary answer on 2 December, my birthday--and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) also has a December birthday--the Department for Education and Employment stated that the lowest rate for staff directly employed in London was &#163;4.91, while the rate in all other regions was &#163;3.59.
<P>
The figures relate to the lowest hourly rates; they do not deal with averages, so they do not reflect London's greater number of senior civil servants. They compare the difference between the rates earned by the least well paid people, such as those in the clerical or administrative grades, or those who work as cleaners.
<P>
The figure of &#163;3.59 covers the Department's employees in Doncaster. Since the Department's expansion, it may also apply to those in Sheffield. The &#163;4.91 figure in London is almost one third as high again, and that is in the context of an employer that is reckoned to be a good one--certainly, there is nothing cowboy about the Department's operations. Even so, that huge difference still exists.
<P>
The rate that the commission comes up with cannot suit both cities. It will either be a farce in Greater London or an embarrassing difficulty for the Government and the Department in Darlington. Traditionally, the public sector does not have so many people who may fall within the potential target zone for the minimum rate. The distribution of low pay shows an average in the various cells of income of about 10 per cent. within the public sector. That is lower than the public sector proportion of the total payroll, but it still accounts for a significant number of people.
<P>
There is a big difference between what is paid to those employed in the north of England and to those employed in Greater London. No single rate will bridge that gap. That is why we are concerned about the concept of a universal rate. I have emphasised in particular the regional consequences. I do not wish to confine my remarks to them because the same applies in greater or lesser degree to matters that we have already discussed about training or sector employment. If I can find the relevant quotation, I should like to say one other thing to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Make it up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister invites me to make it up. I hope that he realises that I wish to refer to David Donnison. Even in times when the Minister for Welfare Reform makes ex cathedra pronouncements at the Centre for Policy Studies--that Thatcherite institution--I do not think that David Donnison could seriously be thought of as a right-wing academic. He produced a fascinating analysis, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. I am looking for the relevant question.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): It is not common for the silent ones to contribute in Standing Committee debates. However, I felt compelled to do so at this particular juncture in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the silent one is going to contribute, could he be brief in his intervention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I rather over-ran my intended remarks.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was an extraordinarily helpful intervention, which enabled us to restore the Committee very crisply to the point. I am indebted to my hon. Friend, as is the Committee.
<P>
David Donnison produced an interesting analysis in a magazine ``Prospect'', which I commend to Members of the Committee. He did not talk solely about the national minimum wage, but about welfare to work and other aspects of the Government's strategy. As I mentioned some little time ago, I have serious concerns about whether the national minimum wage strategy is antagonistic to other elements of the Government's strategy designed to get people back into jobs.
<P>
David Donnison says in the article that there is clearly a jobs problem in some of the outer parts of the kingdom that is not quite so evident in the south-east and not always well understood there. Some of us have constituencies in the midlands and do not regard ourselves as entirely emotionally committed to this part of the world.
<P>
The article lists the many leading figures in the Government--including the Prime Minister--who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``represent northern constituencies where these facts are well known. So what is going wrong?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then says--and I hope that those in the Box will not be offended by this, because I am sure that it does not apply to them--that policy advisers may be the source of error because they all live in and around London. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``When I put this argument to one of the best of them,''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
who may indeed be beside the Chair at the moment--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``he replied: `But surely nearly every unemployed person lives within one hour's journey of a major centre of employment?' ''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is partly true--indeed, it could hardly not be true. He goes on to point out that it is not always culturally easy for people to venture into what he described as foreign territory. He mentions some of the violent tribal worlds of one or two of the northern cities, referring to them as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``worlds unknown to advisers commuting to Whitehall from Wimbledon or Woking.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a real issue of unemployment in areas of economic deprivation and strain. In an effort to deal with a minority of employers or practices which neither I nor my hon. Friends would wish to condone--often anomalously, because I do not know why people work for these rates when other jobs are available--along comes the Minister and the new Government with a commitment and a Bill which is destined pretty largely to introduce universality.
<P>
I do not think that jobs will be created in the areas where they are needed. I do not believe the analysis that the national minimum wage will in some way increase disposable income. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford has already perceptively pointed out, if it is going to increase, why not double the minimum rate from whatever figure the Low Pay Commission comes up with to result in an even greater increase. We know that that will not happen: the Minister himself keeps talking about a reasonable and a moderate rate, but that will not enhance job prospects--other, difficult things need to be done and to some extent, all Governments seek to do them.
<P>
The minimum wage will miss its targets in London and the south-east, but any rate that is plausible north of Watford gap, which is in my constituency, is likely to be far too demanding for employment in the north. Fitting the Government's aspirations to the realities of the labour market and the likely, intended consequences of their proposals will create a series of difficulties.
<P>
The amendment is drafted permissibly. It invites the possibility of there being, more than one rate and would allow the commission to vary those rates according to circumstances. We are not saying that more than one rate is essential, but it should be open to the commission and, ultimately, the Government, to tailor a minimum rate strategy to the circumstances of the labour market. The amendment is in no way designed to produce an impossible agenda of a gross complexity of rates or gross inequity between rates in different parts of the country, but unless the Government come to terms with the reality of the economy, they will prescribe a series of inappropriate rates--and that is before knock-on effects have even been considered.
<P>
I notice that the Minister's favourite journal, the Financial Times, reported yesterday that the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union submitted oral evidence to the Low Pay Commission. There can be knock-on effects on differentials, but I do not rest my case on that. Unless the Government--we offer them the option in the amendment--are prepared to consider having more than one rate to enable them to tailor for particular circumstances, the enterprise will fail because it will not meet the needs of the people for whom the Government have tailored it, and those people will be disillusioned by its fall. I therefore invite the Government, even at this stage, to build flexibility into the Bill, which might help them to achieve their objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I shall speak primarily to amendments Nos. 1, 2, 79 and 81, which are in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter).
<P>
Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 would allow the Secretary of State to treat areas and sectors differently, permitting regionally varied minimum rates. The Minister argued passionately on Second Reading that the Government have a mandate for a national minimum wage with no variations. I understand that, but it begs the question: what regional wage rate variations exist? We should examine what impact a national minimum wage would have on the less prosperous regions of the country.
<P>
We know that the gross domestic product in Cornwall is 70 per cent. of the average--[Interruption.] From a sedentary position, the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) makes my point. We should be examining the variation in the total number of people on low wages and the proportion of people in any one region who are on low wages. The Minister pointed out on Second Reading that there were similar numbers of people on low wages throughout the regions, but that is only part of the story.
<P>
He also declared that as the Government had a mandate for a national minimum wage, it should be outside the scope of the Low Pay Commission to consult on the possible impact of regional variations. If the Government are so confident that regional variations are not significant and do not affect the case for a national minimum rate, surely it is in their interest to allow the Low Pay Commission to consult, in the certain knowledge that it would re-endorse their policy. I questioned that at the time.
<P>
The new earnings survey of the Office for National Statistics, particularly the figures that it produced for me on the north-east region, the south-west and London, demonstrate that quite a variation exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I understood the hon. Gentleman to say that there was not much variation in the proportion of low-paid workers in the regions, but the exact opposite is the case. The proportions are different--they range between 9 and 17 per cent. in different regions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm is such that he has run ahead with my argument. It is as he says--that is the argument that I want to make. Although the totals are similar, the proportions vary tremendously. I will use the figures from the new earnings survey of the Office for National Statistics to demonstrate that.
<P>
In the north-east region, 8.4 per cent. of the working population earn less than &#163;3.50 an hour. In the south-west, the figure is 6.8 per cent., while in London, the figure is 2.1 per cent. It is clear that more than three times as many people, as a proportion, are earning less than &#163;3.50 an hour in the north-east than they do in London. Thus, regional variations exist.
<P>
The Trades Union Congress provided figures showing, similarly, that in the north-west, 14 per cent. of full-time workers earn less than &#163;4 an hour, yet in the south-east, the figure is only 7 per cent. The Minister will know that I was industrious in tabling a range of questions last year to tease out more details of regional variations in the public sector. I discovered that the average lowest public-sector rate of pay in the Government Departments that I questioned was some &#163;3.50 per hour. The lowest payer was the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, which paid about &#163;3.25 per hour. The average lowest rate in a Government Department in London, however, was &#163;4.30 per hour. The actual lowest rate was &#163;4.03, which was paid by the Ministry of Defence.
<P>
The point that I want to stress is that the lowest rate in London paid by Government Departments was 25 per cent. higher than in the regions. A variation therefore exists. It is important to put in context how relevant that variation is. The Government are in a good position to analyse that through the work of the Low Pay Commission. I make no massive claims that such variation will bring the whole essence of a minimum wage grinding to a halt, but it is folly to exclude it from the analysis, particularly as independent work by the economists Oswald and Nawaz shows that it is mainly small firms of fewer than 10 employees that pay low wages. The effect of the national minimum wage could be strongest on those firms, which are located in the regions in many cases.
<P>
The Government have argued that a regionally varied national minimum wage is too cumbersome and too complex to foist on employers across the country, but regional variations in pay already exist. If the employer were a small firm with only one outlet in its local town--it could be Bodmin or anywhere else--it would have no difficulty applying a different minimum rate. The same would be true of a similar, quite separate firm that operated from a single outlet in, say, Slough. Those firms would be quite independent and quite different and would have no problems applying the Government's requirements. The essential point is that a national minimum wage of &#163;4 an hour could raise staff costs for the firm or shop in Bodmin by up to 18 per cent., while for a similar firm in Slough the rise would be only 7 per cent. There are variations in costs between the regions and between different enterprises.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
What is the Low Pay Commission to do, given its instruction to consider only a national single minimum rate? If it fixes a national minimum wage rate at a level that will not damage small firms in the south-west or north-east, it will be so low as to be no help for the low waged in the more prosperous areas of the south-east, where costs are so much higher. If, however, it fixes the national minimum wage at a rate that lifts the low wages in the south-east out of poverty in real terms--I would certainly subscribe to that--it will inevitably place significant and possibly unbearable costs on small firms operating in the less prosperous regions of the country.
<P>
I urge the Minister to reconsider the relationship that he will have with the Low Pay Commission when he makes recommendations to it. Perhaps he could ease the constraints a degree so that we can have some reassurance that the impact of regional variations in our economy on costs and wages will not be compromised by imposing a single national minimum wage.

<P>

<B>Ms Candy Atherton: </B>(Falmouth and Camborne): The Liberal Democrats in my area of Cornwall usually spend a great deal of time arguing that the country should be treated like much of the rest of the country. They argue that we should have extra help to solve our low pay and high unemployment problems--[Interruption.] This is clearly not of interest to Conservative Members; they are not interested in what is going on in Cornwall.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats argue that we need to consider ways of resolving our low pay and high unemployment problems. They say that we should revisit the Barnett formula to ensure that all English regions receive equal funding, like Scotland and Wales. On tourism, health, farming and fishing, they argue that Cornwall should get special treatment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Atherton:</B> Could I just make a start on my speech?
<P>
I agree with the Liberal Democrats. It therefore baffles me why, on the vital issue of a national minimum wage, they want to perpetuate regional differences and poverty. If we allowed regional rates, Cornwall would become the low pay capital of Britain for all time. I see no advantage in that. As I explained on Second Reading, my area is losing jobs and faces high unemployment while still enduring low pay. If low pay created jobs, I would be knee deep in Japanese companies beating their way across the Tamar bridge, desperate to open new businesses in Cornwall. That is blatantly not the case. The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) said that the American experience had been that a national wage had increased the amount of money entering and circulating in the local economy, which was good for the workers, the low paid and local businesses. Why should Cornwall not experience that benefit? Why should we have to have a regional rate?
<P>
I want to give an example of the levels of pay in the Cornish economy. Just last week, there was a card in the job centre in Penryn, which is in the heart of my constituency, advertising a job in Mylor, which is a small village and sailing port in my constituency--I believe that one or two Opposition Members know the area. The advert asked for a fully trained and professional sailing instructor. The pay was &#163;40 a week for 40 hours a week. There was nothing about living in; the pay was simply &#163;1 an hour for a fully professional and trained person. I find it bizarre that the Liberal Democrats should argue for poverty rates of pay to continue in regions such as mine. I look forward with relish to campaigning in Cornwall in future and to highlighting the fact that the Liberal Democrats and the Tories are arguing to keep Cornish workers in poverty.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 and similar amendments are wrecking amendments. This is a national minimum wage Bill, not a regional mimimum wage Bill. The sooner we are able to get on with introducing it, the better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell Brown </B>(Dumfries): Like my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne, I want to concentrate my remarks on the amendments that deal with regional variations.
<P>
I know that the hon. Members for Eastleigh and for Weston-super-Mare will concentrate on having different rates for different localities. My experience prior to coming to the House, when I served on a Liberal-Democrat-controlled council, clearly showed that people could have a say in what went on in their local communities, and I am enthusiastic about that. Pay rates should not, however, be determined at a local level. I therefore firmly believe that a national minimum wage should be just that--it should not be regional or area based.
<P>
Coming from a low pay area, I am disappointed that the Opposition have attempted over the past few days to keep the people whom I represent in the low pay bracket. There seems to be a weird perception among those who oppose a national minimum wage that low pay will allow us to compete in the open market and generate additional jobs.
<P>
My local enterprise company--which is also in the area of my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan)--has made efforts to attract inward investment. It has stated on many occasions that wage rates are competitive, but what it is in fact trying to say is that low pay abounds. From what I have seen, it has failed to attract almost any of the inward investment that the area needs.
<P>
Most Members of the Committee--perhaps all of them--should be able to give examles of extremely low-paid jobs in their area. My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne has just done so. I also want to give some quick examples. A couple of weeks ago in my locality, there was an advert for a trainee outdoor activity instructor. The pay was &#163;1.50 an hour. The advert added: ``Previous experience needed''. Another advert, for a nursery nurse, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Must be experienced. Must hold recognised certification.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The pay was &#163;2.75 an hour.
<P>
I mention those examples because they involve responsible positions, not ones in which menial tasks are carried out. Having looked at those vacancies, I contacted other parts of the country. It was no surprise to find that the rates of pay offered in those adverts were considerably less than those offered in almost all other areas.
<P>
Last week, the hon. Member for Buckingham said that he paid his cleaner &#163;7 an hour. I sincerely hope that he would pay the same rate irrespective of the location of the property being cleaned. Earlier today, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge spoke about his father working in retirement. Is the right hon. Gentleman's father the cleaner for the hon. Member for Buckingham?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his unintended elevation of my status to right hon. Member. When I referred to my father, I think that I said that he worked not because he needed the money--although I am sure that it comes in handy--but because he likes to keep fit and active and to retain a discipline and structure in his life in retirement. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that that is an entirely worthy objective?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brown:</B> I fully agree that people have a right, wherever possible, to lead structured lives.
<P>
Different regional rates are not feasible. Such variations would make an already complex Bill even more complex. For example, it would be a nightmare for some companies to accommodate people who do the same job in different locations. No employer would want to operate a host of different pay rates. In fact, employers would probably claim that other regions enjoyed an unfair advantage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that no employer would want to pay different rates in different parts of the country for the same job. Does he deny that many employers at present do precisely that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brown:</B> Of course they do, but many others would prefer not to do so. That is my point.
<P>
The increased regional concentration of low-paid jobs poses another problem. That concentration is more than a possibility; it is happening already in my area and in many others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brown:</B> No, I have almost finished. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will get another opportunity.
<P>
The establishment of a truly national minimum wage without regional variation offers great opportunities for people. My hon. Friend the Minister and my hon. Friends the Members for Stevenage and for Falmouth and Camborne all noted that the additional spending power will allow people, as individuals and families, to spend their money in the local economy. The figures show clearly that putting, say, &#163;1 million into the local economy through low-paid families will in turn generate other jobs--many more than would be generated if the same money were given to people in a higher pay bracket.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will oppose any notion of regional variations in the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Clause 2, to which many of the amendments in this group relate, restricts the Secretary of State to prescribing a single hourly rate for the minimum wage. The bulk of the amendments would broaden the Secretary of State's power and allow him to consider other than a single hourly rate.
<P>
The single hourly rate is the Bill's greatest weakness. It is on that single practical problem that the Bill, when it is enacted, is likely to founder. However, it is also at the very heart of the ideology that underlies the Bill. It is a dogmatic point that there is to be a single national minimum wage. Several Labour Members have made that point. The Minister may have seen the article in The Times last Thursday, by Graham Sergeant, which referred to the minimum wage proposal. He stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the policy is a relic, a sop to old Labour and trade unions. To new Labour, it is an embarrassment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would my hon. Friend concede that, interestingly, the author of that article very firmly and eloquently made the point--I do not necessarily wish to advocate it--that it would be morally inept to set a rate for the national minimum wage in a way that would allow the wage to be taxed? In other words, he suggested that it should be kept in line with the tax threshold.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. I hope that the Committee will be able to return to it.
<P>
I wished to emphasise that the Labour party, when in Opposition, got itself on a hook over the definition of a single national minimum wage. As the debate has progressed, it has become clear that the idea of a single national minimum wage does not much appeal to common sense. Many of my hon. Friends, and the spokesman for the Liberal Democrat party, have already addressed specifically the potential for regional variations in the minimum wage. I shall try not to go over the same ground too much. Although we do not know how the rate will be determined--there will be a debate later about clause 2, which will cover the factors that will be taken into account in determining the minimum wage--it is clear that the Low Pay Commission's recommendations are likely to allow a degree of flexibility to the Secretary of State in defining how the minimum wage will be calculated. Different practices of remuneration in different industries and sectors of the economy clearly mean that there will be some practical difference between the treatment of different sectors of the economy. The Government has already breached the principle of universality in clauses 3 and 4. The Opposition welcome those clauses, because they add flexibility to the Bill.
<P>
My anxieties relate to the limit on the Secretary of State's flexibility in exercising her powers, because of the reference to a single hourly rate. I am especially anxious about small firms and very small firms, which may have just an employer and one or two employees. The Minister has prayed in aid more than once the operation of the minimum wage in the United States. In the United States, there is a small firms exemption, which is set far above the turnover to which any small retailer, newsagent, corner post office or local pub in this country could aspire.
<P>
I am, for example, anxious about the situation of a specific newsagent--it seems to have become de rigeur to quote individual constituency cases. The newsagent works in my constituency, with his wife, and employs one person. They work seven days a week, 364 days a year. He has not had a holiday in 16 years. Why, it may be asked, does he continue in the business? The answer is simple: he is tied to a lease that has another seven years to run and from which he is unable to escape. He works very long hours for a very low rate of pay. If he is required to increase the rate at which he pays his single employee to the national minimum wage, there is only one possible place that the money can come from--out of his own pocket, thus depressing his very low rate of remuneration still further.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is it not a possibility--although I do not know the individual constituent--that in those circumstances, a self-employed individual employing one person might find himself compelled to pay his employee at a rate under the national minimum wage that would exceed any conceivable likelihood of his remuneration to himself for taking on the risks of employment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that point. That is very likely to occur. Indeed, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents has pointed out that there are already many examples of that in its industry if full account is taken of the extremely long hours that retail newsagent proprietors often work. That situation can only be made worse by the implementation of the minimum wage.
<P>
I understand that it is difficult to view the economy as a whole. When Labour Members talk about the minimum wage and bad employers, they are often thinking of large companies and factories with smokestacks--the traditional image of a large employer. Even when we talk about small firms, I suspect that they are thinking of firms that employ 20 or 30 people. I am particularly concerned--I know that the Minister for Small Firms will understand this--about the impact on the very smallest firms. If it became apparent that the legislation was having an adverse impact on that sector, the Government might want to give serious consideration, either now or in the future, to an exclusion for micro businesses in the interests of fairness between the employer and the employee. In that sector, the distinction in rates of remuneration is not clear and the working circumstances are such that a clear-cut employer-employee differentiation is not particularly relevant.
<P>
The Government or the Low Pay Commission might identify a serious and localised adverse effect on certain sectors of the economy from the imposition of the minimum wage. Once again, the constraint on the Secretary of State to provide for a single hourly rate will prevent any action being taken, even where such a case can be clearly identified. The same may also be true for groups of workers.
<P>
We have heard some arguments in favour of regionally variable rates. We all accept that there are different going rates for employment in different regions of the country. There are several reasons for that. Supply and demand for labour is one and another is the different cost of living in different parts of the country. I have some figures that have been kindly compiled by the Library. I was surprised to learn that differences in the cost of living between the regions are not routinely compiled by any Government agency. The Library had to rely on a private-sector report to produce these figures.
<P>
I discovered that the incomes required to support a range of different standards of living--standardised standards of living, if I may call them that--range from 20 per cent. above the UK average in Greater London to 14.9 per cent. below the UK average in Northern Ireland. It is clear that the cost of living is not the same across the United Kingdom. That fact underpins the existing differences in regional wage rates.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry eloquently pointed out that a single rate imposed across the nation will be either a paper tiger in the sense that it will have no teeth and be utterly meaningless in the more affluent parts of the country, or it will be a real tiger with teeth, which will do real damage in the less prosperous regions. It is difficult to see why the Government will not accept that UK wage rates differ in practice from region to region. Why will they not lay aside the underlying dogma--the principle of a single national rate--and go with the grain without losing the Bill's central purpose, which is to force out low wages, and merely acknowledge that the definition of low wages may legitimately vary from area to area? It would take the most tortuous argument to produce the result that one needed the same wage rate to support a given lifestyle in central London as one did in the north-east of England. My common sense is offended by the attempt to impose a single national hourly rate across the United Kingdom.
<P>
I have used a firm of accountants in Liverpool for many years; I will not give it a free plug by mentioning its name. I asked my accountants about their clients in Merseyside and the impact that a minimum wage would have on them. They were immediately able to identify two manufacturing clients who also import and who they thought would be forced to increase the proportion of product that they import if they had to pay higher wages. I submit to the Minister that such import substitution is, at the best of times, a potential danger from imposing a minimum wage. In the present circumstances, when sterling is riding at a high level and our manufacturing industry base is under extreme threat from imports, the cost of which is at an all-time low, it is particularly dangerous to tempt fate by raising our domestic manufacturing costs.
<P>
My hon. Friends and other hon. Members who have spoken have focused on the use of the word ``single''. I should like to draw attention to the implications of the use of the word ``hourly''. The Bill clearly stipulates that there will be a single hourly rate. That will significantly limit the Low Pay Commission's freedom of remit to consider forms of work that typically are remunerated other than by an hourly rate. My particular concern is piece-work. I know that the very word is like a red rag to a bull to many Labour Members. I am equally aware that there have been abuses of the piece-work system. I would not deny that, but I have had direct experience of piece-work on both sides of the fence--both doing piece-work and offering it--and it has a number of important advantages for the employee and the employer. I would not want the Bill to include any measure that would sound the death-knell of the piece-work system.
<P>
From the employer's point of view, piece-work has the benefit of certainty because he knows what his unit labour cost will be. From the employee's point of view, piece-work has the great advantage of giving him direct control over his earnings. If a person works in a factory with 100 other workers, economic theory tells us that that person will be remunerated at a rate based on the average productivity of all the workers. When a person does piece-work, he will by definition be remunerated at a rate that directly reflects his own productivity. I know from my own experience that people doing piece-work are able when it suits them or when the need arises--for example, in the run-up to Christmas--dramatically to increase their output, knowing that their earnings will rise in direct correlation with their productivity.
<P>
I note the Minister's quizzical look at my assertion that the use of the term ``single hourly rate'' could effectively sound the death-knell for the piece-work system. We do not know that because we do not know how piece-work is to be treated in calculating what level of remuneration has been paid, but we have to assume that the Government will impose a system that will require the piece-worker's hourly rate to be the basis for determining whether the national wage has been paid or not. I should be delighted if the Minister corrected my assumption.
<P>
The other great advantage of piece-work is that it is self-regulating. There is no need for time keeping or clocking in and out. People can be flexible in their working methodology. I urge the Minister not to allow the loss of such a flexible and effective system to be an unintended side effect of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As with other amendments, the Opposition are concerned that the Bill's unforeseen consequences will cause unintended damage, even to those whom it is most intended to assist. Wide regional variations, the differences between industries and the differing abilities of large and small firms to absorb the impact of the minimum wage demand a flexible approach. The amendment allows the Secretary of State more flexibility to deal with those issues. We want to avoid the imposition of a compromise rate, but that is the likely outcome.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister has lain awake in bed envisaging a scenario in which whatever rate the Government announce pleases no one--the trade unions will howl that it is too low, the employers that it is too high; the regions will suffer massive job losses and people in Greater London will shrug their shoulders and say, ``This means nothing to me.'' We want to avoid the dilemma that cannot be avoided if the Bill remains as drafted--setting a rate that is meaningless in some regions or sectors, but destructive in others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh has explained, we are concerned that the Bill provides for a national rate, but ignores the wide disparities throughout the country. We cannot ignore costs and the realities of life as they vary throughout the regions.
<P>
I fail to see why the Low Pay Commission could not have considered a regional approach to the minimum wage. It may be hearsay, but the chairman of the commission seemed to be attracted to the idea and would willingly have looked into it, had he been asked to do so. I am puzzled. The Bill has been introduced at a time when regional development agencies, which we support, have also been introduced. There was a golden opportunity for the RDAs to play a regional role in the introduction of the minimum wage. The concept behind RDAs is that they should be sensitive to particular regional economic concerns. A regional rate could have addressed the concerns of the small business sector. In a recent survey by the Forum for Private Business, employers in that sector in the north, the north-west and the south-west were more concerned about the minimum wage than employers in other areas.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh referred to many facts and figures--we all have them--to support the regional approach. I shall not repeat them, but simply say that I do not think that there is any reason for the Low Pay Commission not addressing this problem. I repeat my concern that there is no clear representation of small businesses on the commission by, for example, a federation member.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Apart from the intrinsic significance of the various amendments in the group, this debate has been particularly interesting because, for the first time on any amendment or group of amendments, we heard two speeches from the Government Back Benches. For the first time, we can see a pattern emerging. I particularly enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, not least for the way in which she took the points made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh, travestied and distorted them, and then announced how she was going to turn that into a campaign. To see dirty politics of that kind used against the Liberal Democrats brought a tear to the eye, as usually the boot is on the other foot. Given the relations between the two parties in Cornwall, I can only wish them a good, clean fight with no survivors.
<P>
The hon. Lady also made an extremely interesting point. She refused to let me intervene, but I was rather surprised that her hon. Friends did not intervene when she complained about the unfairness of the Barnett formula as it applied to Cornwall and suggested that Scotland and Wales were getting unfair amounts of money under the formula. I was merely going to ask whether she thought that the Barnett formula should be reduced to Scotland and Wales or should be applied to regions of England as well. Was she saying that Scotland and Wales should be disadvantaged, or that public spending should be increased? Either way, she might find herself unpopular with other Back-Bench Members or with her Front Bench. It was an interesting point.
<P>
The thrust of many of the amendments is that variations allowed to the Secretary of State would be desirable and would make the practical application of the minimum wage better than it would be under the Government's proposals. We heard a similar message from two Government Back-Bench Members. They seem to be out of kilter with their own Government's economic thinking. A danger is that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge pointed out in the newspaper article that he quoted, parts of the Bill are clearly a sop to old Labour. I was glad to have that confirmed from the Government Back Benches.
<P>
The amendments raise a number of issues which it would be worth considering, and which go to show why universality is misplaced. The notes on clauses make the point that the lowest paid 10 per cent. in the work force earn &#163;3.17 an hour or less. The implication is that an unchanging lump of the work force earns those low wages. That is not the case. There are people constantly moving in and out of this group. A Government who wished to alleviate poverty among that group should ensure a flexible labour market that allows people to get on the job ladder and move up it. Attempting to raise the bottom, as though that ends poverty for a group which consists of 10 per cent. of the work force, is a factual error.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My intervention is intended to reinforce my hon. Friend's point. Is he aware of the research conducted by Stewart and Swaffield, which found that over a three-year period 9.3 per cent. of employees were poorly paid, but only 2 per cent. of them were so paid for each and every one of the three years? That demonstrates that there is no pool of permanently low paid people. That is precisely the point that my hon. Friend is making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his detailed academic backing for the point that I was making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before my hon. Friend resumes his economics lecture, does he agree that one of the consequences of raising the bottom decile is, as the AEEU evidence points out, that the earnings of the lower paid will tend to cluster just above the minimum rate? The result is likely to be that differentials will be restored, with greatly enhanced costs right through the whole pay profile.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, the Committee has considered the question of differentials already. I am delighted that my hon. Friend has found evidence from the trade unions to support my contention.
<P>
The relevant evidence to the Low Pay Commission on amendment No. 1 comes from the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. That organisation's submission to the Low Pay Commission makes it clear that every Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country that operates a minimum wage does so with some form of variation and flexibility built in. It is assumed by most employers that have offered submissions to the commissions that such variations and flexibility will be allowed.
<P>
The ABCC survey, on which the evidence to the Low Pay Commission was based, found that 70 per cent. of businesses support the need for flexibility in the system--various forms of flexibility are proposed; about 90 per cent. consider a different rate for trainees to be essential; and just below 80 per cent. think the same about variation according to an age threshold. About 70 per cent. think that there should be some sort of regional variation, as referred to in the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. Also, about 50 per cent. regard it as essential that there should be some sort of sectoral variation.
<P>
Businesses both large and small support the range of variations proposed in the amendments. The hon. Member for Eastleigh and other Members dealt with the regional question. The key point is that there will be concentrations of job losses if the national minimum wage is implemented rigidly. The figures show that average rates of pay differ according to area. Businesses, especially small ones, will be more affected in those parts of the country where wage rates are low.
<P>
I hesitate to resort to the moral ground in this matter, but it is a moral point that those areas have had long-term economic problems. Generations of workers have found it more difficult there than elsewhere to find jobs, and there has been, inevitably, a degree of depopulation. People have moved to the big cities or to wherever finding employment is easier. It seems perverse to impose on those regions an extra burden that makes the employment of low-paid workers more difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is not the substance of my hon. Friend's argument that there is a loose correlation between low pay and unemployment in specific regions? The Government clearly believe that the relationship is causal. It is not, in fact, precisely the reverse?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman replies to that intervention, this may be a convenient time to suspend the sitting until 8.30 pm. I remind hon. Members that the Committee Room will be locked, so their papers can be safely left on their desks.
<P>
<H5>6.58 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> When we were interrupted, I was about to respond to a most thoughtful intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, who said that the incidence of unemployment and of low pay are coincidental rather than being necessarily causally related and that the Government's attempt to impose a uniform minimum wage is based on a misanalysis of the causes of those two phenomena.
<P>
We are discussing amendments attempting to introduce variations to the national minimum wage. I am discussing the merits of the variations to the minimum wage proposed for different areas. We heard a most thoughtful contribution from the hon. Member for Eastleigh on geographical variations. He said that because different parts of the country have different needs and there are variations in levels of pay and in the proportions of the labour force in each region that receive low pay, it is inappropriate to set a single national level. Indeed, in many ways, it would be perverse to do so, because the areas that suffer most from low pay often suffer high unemployment.
<P>
The imposition of a national rate for the minimum wage will exacerbate unemployment for marginal and less skilled workers in those areas where one would expect a sensible and compassionate economic policy to make the Government particularly keen to encourage people into work.
<P>
Only once, through the usual restraint exercised by Conservative Members, has anyone mentioned the Deputy Prime Minister's famous remark that any fool knows that the minimum wage will cost jobs. For the sake of debate, I concede that the Minister may argue that, even if it costs individual jobs--I assume that he agrees with the Deputy Prime Minister--a minimum wage will not cost jobs in aggregate. Even if one accepts that premise, which I do not, there will be local job losses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alasdair Morgan </B>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that over the years the existence of variable wages in some areas has singularly failed to draw extra employment to areas such as the one that I represent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extremely interesting point. It raises the question of what it takes to draw employment to those areas. If the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan) is right, low wages on their own are not enough. There may be other systemic reasons why willing workers cannot price themselves into jobs. I am prepared to admit that that might be the case. I hope that in return the hon. Gentleman will admit that the prospect of not altering anything else, but of making it more expensive for individuals to be employed in such areas, is likely to increase not decrease unemployment in those areas that find it difficult to attract work.
<P>
Even if the hon. Gentleman's premise is true--it is an interesting debate, but not one that I shall enter into, as I do not want to go beyond the bounds of this group of amendments--the national minimum wage would make the situation worse. I hope and assume that the hon. Gentleman will agree, as I am speaking in favour of an amendment that I think comes from his party. Even according to the Deputy Prime Minister's dictum--that individuals will lose their jobs but there will not be job losses in the aggregate--there will be job losses in some areas. That will be aggravated if the Government insist on having no regional variations.
<P>
Another amendment in the group suggests variations on undertakings of different sizes. That raises the important matter of small businesses. Both sides of the Committee--Opposition Members and the Government Front Bench at least--accept that these days small businesses are the engine of job growth throughout the western world; they are likely to promote job creation and bring people into the work force more successfully than large companies. We have seen that phenomenon in this country and in the United States, and it has been one of the failures of the continental European economies that it has not happened there.
<P>
That must give rise to the question whether it is appropriate to hamstring small businesses in this country by insisting that they offer the same minimum wage as larger companies, which are possibly multinationals and are likely to have more fat and be able to cope with external economic shocks such as the sudden imposition of a minimum wage.
<P>
From what we have heard this evening, there seems to be a dichotomy between the expressed view of Labour Front Bench Members and the rhetoric used by Labour Back Benchers. In the distinguished presence of the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, we will accept that the Labour Front Bench wants to promote small business and believes that small business is an important part of the economic system. However, much of the rhetoric from the hon. Members on the Benches behind her has been about ``cowboys''; there is a deep suspicion of people who run local small businesses. It is clear that many Labour Members are instinctively hostile to small business--the Government need to educate their Back Benchers.
<P>
The CBI's submission to the Low Pay Commission shows the difference in pay thresholds by what it calls establishment size--the size of the business. If small businesses are more likely than large businesses to create jobs, albeit in some cases low paid jobs, it is sensible for any Government to consider the pay levels in different-sized companies.
<P>
The CBI does not use the figure of &#163;3.50, which is becoming the norm of what the Committee considers a likely minimum wage, so I shall take the figure of &#163;3.60, which the CBI research has used. [Interruption.] If Labour Members want to suggest other figures, I would be delighted to take interventions, so that we can find out what the range is in the Labour party.
<P>
The CBI shows that 33 per cent. of businesses employing between one and 10 people use &#163;3.60 as a pay threshold, whereas that applies to only 9.1 per cent. of businesses employing 50 or more people. As one would expect, there is a range in between, hovering between 15 and 20 per cent.
<P>
That illustrates that small businesses--which create new jobs and are often the point of entry to the labour market for young or relatively unskilled people and, in many cases, for elderly people, who may want to hang on to part-time jobs--are more likely to pay relatively low wages. We can take two attitudes to that: we can either think that it is a question of typical, old-fashioned capitalists grinding the faces of the poor or--and I think it was the Minister who referred to Arthur Daley--we can characterise small businesses as being full of slightly dodgy people living at the edge of respectability.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> For absolute clarity, I think that the record will show that it was the hon. Member for Buckingham whom I compared with Arthur Daley, not small business men.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is my memory that it was the Minister who said that the hon. Member for Buckingham was using Arthur Daley as an economic guide; the use of Arthur Daley as an example--we have managed to get through several sitting days of the Committee without resorting to that cliche--came from the Minister. However, I will stand corrected if Hansard shows that I am wrong.
<P>
The point is that you can either think that the higher incidence of low pay among small businesses is a sign of some kind of moral deficiency among small business men, or you can accept that the sort of businesses that small business men run will often provide services that require--
<P>
<B>Mr. Alasdair Morgan</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If I may just finish this point, I will give way to the hon. Gentleman. Or you can accept that those businesses require low pay in order to exist, and that if they did not provide those levels of wages, they would go out of business. Instead of getting relatively low pay, their employees would get no pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alasdair Morgan:</B> Is there any sector, any region or anybody to whom the hon. Gentleman would pay the minimum wage? If so, will he tell us who those people may be, because I am beginning to doubt that anyone would benefit from the hon. Gentleman's version of the minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am fascinated by that intervention. I do not have a version of the minimum wage. I believe in an economy that creates employment and prosperity--as our economy has during the past 20 years--by not having undue restrictions on the labour market. I am sure that every member of the Committee wants high employment and high wages. I want skilled workers in competitive companies that can promote the economy of this country and their own welfare. The minimum wage would damage that. With all due respect, it is absurd to ask me to whom I would pay the minimum wage. I would not pay the minimum wage to anyone; I would ask people to make themselves as skilled and as employable as possible, and I would ask employers to take on people who can make their businesses profitable, so that they can pay them a decent wage. The more successful the company, the higher the wages that it is likely to pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morgan:</B> I asked that question because we are dealing with specific amendments and I had understood that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues were going to be constructive. That suggested to me that they would debate to whom the minimum wage should apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am doing precisely that; I am discussing the variations set out in the amendments. We have had Second Reading. We can all do the arithmetic and we know that there is likely to be a minimum wage. As we are to have a minimum wage, we seek, through the amendments, to ameliorate the effects of that bad policy, so that it does as little damage as possible to the British economy. We are trying to improve the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is the proliferation of samll businesses that is one of the most distinctive features of the modern British economy and that gives it its flexibility, which has helped us to be as successful as we are in comparison with other European economies that are more old-fashioned in structure? Is not the flexibility and dynamism of the small business sector threatened by the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend, and point to the contrast between this country and France at present. Because we do not have a minimum wage, people can get jobs in small businesses.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been following the hon. Gentleman with considerable care. I point out to the Committee that we are already debating quite a wide group of amendments. I hope that we will limit ourselves to what is on the amendment paper. I accept that the hon. Gentleman is trying hard to remain within those constraints.
<P>
While I am on my feet, I remind the hon. Gentleman that ``you'' refers to me, and I have no ideas on the minimum wage that I will express in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would my hon. Friend care to comment on whether this clutch of amendments is broadly any more or less enabling that the Bill? If anything, the amendments are biased towards greater flexibility.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The amendments would enable the Secretary of State to perform the function--which might be wrong, but it is what the Bill is intended to do--of setting a minimum wage to help the British economy. I refer especially to amendment No. 16, which would allow flexibility on undertakings of different sizes.
<P>
The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was correct. Because we have allowed undertakings of different sizes more flexibility, we have been able to create more jobs than economies of a similar size and standard of living. We have seen the effects of their failure to create jobs in actions such as the current civil unrest in France.
<P>
Amendment No. 16 is especially important because its direct effect would be to preserve the flexibility of small businesses to employ whom they want at the level they want if they can find people to take the jobs. The amendment would be directly beneficial not only to the companies involved but to the wider economy, which is why it is one of the most important amendments in the group. If the Government were to consider the amendments individually, rather than as a group, I would especially urge them to accept amendment No. 16. If they were to change their mind on any amendment, they should do so on amendment No. 16, which would allow undertakings, such as small businesses, a preferential rate or exclusion from the Bill. That would be even more important than permitting regional variations, such as those proposed under amendment No. 1.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 deals with whether there should be variations between different sectors of the economy. Again, the Confederation of British Industry's submission to the Low Pay Commission shows enormous variations between industries that have low pay. Distribution, hotels and catering, at 34&#183;8 per cent. have the highest proportion of people working for less than &#163;3.60 an hour, whereas the figure for industries such as energy and water supply is zero.
<P>
The Government could argue that that shows a deficiency in distribution, hotels and catering because those sectors have so many low-paid workers and that, therefore, those workers would benefit from a national minimum wage. However, amendment No. 1 is extremely important because it is precisely in such sectors that there has been jobs growth in the past few years. Any attempt artificially to constrict job creation in those sectors would increasingly damage important industries and make it extremely difficult for people to find their first entry into the jobs market. We all know that the jobs created in tourism, bars and restaurants are done by people who are trying hard to enter the labour market and who do not want to live on benefits. By constricting such industries, the Government will damage those sectors that they seek to help with their other policies.
<P>
There is an interaction between the sectors of industry affected and the regions affected. It seems absurd that someone who works behind a bar in a central London pub should necessarily be paid the same minimum wage as someone who works behind a bar in the north-east of England or the remoter villages of Northern Ireland. Many of us know to our cost how expensive it is to buy drinks in central London compared with other parts of the country. Clearly, that reflects the general costs imposed on establishments in central London. Therefore, it seems to be perverse and job destroying not to have any variations. I support amendment No. 1.
<P>
This group of amendments encourages the Bill to look outwards as well as inwards. During our debate, there was much talk about regional variations and the differences between Cornwall, London and other areas. I urge the Committee to look outwards as well. Not only do we live in a global marketplace, but there are certain parts of the country that are international labour marketplaces. I refer, in particular, to my own constituency, which is happily situated in east Kent with a direct rail link to Paris and Brussels. It has an influx of jobs from the continent. There is inward investment, especially from France, which does not create the high-paid jobs that Labour Members may argue have no relevance to the minimum wage. But each of the companies uses services, such as cleaning and so on, that employ relatively low-paid workers. There is an increasing cross-channel traffic in jobs and people look for jobs both inside and outside Britain. To say that we should have a national minimum wage ignores the fact that there will increasingly be cross-border job migration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I defer to my hon. Friend's greater knowledge of Kent, but is not it true that many of the inward investors from France are escapees and refugees from the high-wage levels that are wrecking the French economy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I will deal with that point very briefly, Mrs. Dunwoody, because I can sense eyebrows rising. They are refugees not so much from the high wages of the French economy, but from the high social cost of employing people in France. People create jobs in my constituency, rather than doing it in France, and I am happy about that.
<P>
The overall point that all the amendments seek to illustrate is the precise opposite of those made by the hon. Members for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) and for Falmouth and Camborne, both of whom are very insistent that there should be a national minimum wage. The amendments would improve the Bill and, more important, the British economy, by allowing a degree of flexibility. It is interesting that Ministers' rhetoric is all about flexible labour markets, new ways of doing business and how that lesson has been learnt, but that is not reflected at all by the opposition to the amendments by Labour Back Benchers. I hope that Ministers can persuade their hon. Friends to take that rhetoric seriously and to consider and support such amendments that would radically improve the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I should like to make a few remarks about amendments Nos. 79 and 81, which in their content are somewhat different from the debate we have had so far on regional variations. Therefore, I think that it is worth while to draw our attention to them. Amendment No. 79 would leave out the line referring to ``persons of different ages''. We have had an extensive--I was about to say protracted, but felt that was a little indiscreet--detailed debate about the relationship between the age of the worker and the application of the national minimum wage. The amendment would remove a constraint that the Bill places on the Secretary of State not to make provision to treat the same circumstances differently for ``persons of different ages''.
<P>
There is general agreement in the Committee that all adults should be entitled to a national minimum wage and that those workers who are under 18 and who are on recognised high-quality training schemes should attract, where applicable, a lower rate than the national minimum wage recommended by the Low Pay Commission. Some concern has already been expressed about the possible contradictions between the provisions of clause 1, entitling all adults to the national minimum wage if over compulsory school leaving age, and the provisions of clause 3, dealing with exclusion from entitlement of those under the age of 26.
<P>
Amendment No. 79 is intended to provide greater flexibility for the Secretary of State, particularly on how to treat young adults over the age of 18 and in training.
<P>
I move swiftly to amendment No. 81. I may wish to press it to a Division in due course, Mrs. Dunwoody, depending on the debate that follows. I draw on the 15 years' experience of the West Midlands low pay unit. It has undertaken research into the scale, causes and effects of low pay and has provided advice, information and training to low-paid workers and those who are trying to help them. Its work is recognised throughout the country. It receives financial backing and general support from about 15 local authorities in the west midlands, for which it undertakes detailed studies into the problems of low pay, as well as helping more than 2,000 people a year who suffer the problems of low pay and unemployment.
<P>
The low pay unit is a fairly reliable source. I hope that the Government will listen to its questions and try to accommodate its fears. The amendment is intended to help. The low pay unit knows of the potential for the low rates of pay that result from the hours that people work, particularly part-time workers, and from the structure of their employment. Such atypical workers are often paid at lower rates than would otherwise be paid.
<P>
For those reasons, I believe that clause 2 should provide greater safeguards to protect such people. The key objective is to deal with the fact that part-time workers and atypical workers are not provided for under anti-discrimination law. By excluding the hours and patterns of work from the list of explicitly protective characteristics, those disadvantaged groups risk being paid a lower level of minimum wage, and receive less protection than is provided for other workers. That will clearly fly in the face of and be against the spirit of a national minimum wage, which we believe is intended to provide greater equality in the work force.
<P>
The amendment is constructive and intended to increase the protection offered to low-paid workers who have different and unusual patterns and hours of work. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment as a constructive proposal rather than my having to press it to a Division.
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber </B>(Amber Valley): I return first to the statement made earlier by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. In my view, the single hourly rate is the greatest strength of the Bill, not its weakness. It is what makes for a national minimum wage, which is what we are arguing for.
<P>
I am fascinated that the Opposition should want to give more power to the Ministry. I am a great fan of the Ministry and of the Secretary of State, but I do not want to give them the powers suggested in the amendments. I shall come to the matter of job losses later, as much has already been said about that. First, I wish to speak about simplicity and clarity, which are so important. If the rate is clearly stated and everyone knows what it is, employers and employees will know what they are entitled to. Evasion will be more difficult and there will be no need for hordes of inspectors and a massive policing and enforcement mechanism, with all the expense and difficulty that that entails.
<P>
I do not understand what makes Conservative Members think that it would be easy to set regional boundaries for variations in pay rates that would tie in neatly with other regional boundaries. How would we deal with a low-paying area within a richer region, which is common? Would we have to have differential regional benefit rates?
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When considering differences between sectors and occupations, how would we prevent employers from reclassifying people's occupations? All the old jokes about rat-catchers turning into rodent operatives would be as nothing compared to that. We would create a lawyer's paradise. I have great respect for my hon. Friend the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, who will reply to the debate--I was the chairman of her constituency, so I am allowed to be cheeky to her--but I do not want to create a huge amount of work for her former profession. A range of rates for different occupations would create great possibilities for legal challenge and redefinition.
<P>
My second point concerns a matter that has not been discussed. If we introduced different rates for different sectors and occupations, we would be putting into law unequal pay for men and women. Equal pay legislation helped to make inroads into the gap between male and female pay. In spite of the hysterical statements at the time, it did not noticeably lead to job losses, which we should remember now.
<P>
Equal pay for work of equal value is an essential part of that legislation but comparators are necessary. When I was writing pay claims and back-up research, I remember demonstrating that if nursing was a predominantly male profession and male and female nurses were considered in terms of their qualifications, experience, skills and training, they would have a much higher level of pay. That applies across the labour market, in higher and lower paying jobs. Low-paid work tends to be in female occupations and vice versa.
<P>
If we were to allow different rates for different occupations and different sectors, we would institutionalise the gap between male and female pay, rather than viewing the Bill, as I want to do, as the second attack on that gap and an attempt to achieve equality. I do not know whether different rates could be reconciled with equal pay legislation. That would be another lawyer's paradise--I am almost reaching a lawyer's nirvana now. It would be problematic to have separate occupational and sectoral rates, and if we did so, I would jack in this job and be an adviser.
<P>
Labour Members do not like to agree with and be nice to the hon. Member for Buckingham because it is so much more fun to disagree with him and we all enjoy doing so enormously. He was proud to tell us last week how he made an incursion into a female ghetto by pulling his own staff out of that ghetto and paying his cleaner &#163;7 an hour, which is above the going rate. We would welcome him into our ranks if he were prepared to join us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Lady has referred to me and I am glad that she enjoyed the reference. She shows at least some semblance of realism on this matter, which is favourably to be contrasted with the attitude of the hon. Member for Dumfries. Does the hon. Lady agree with him that regardless of which area of the country one is dealing with, the rate paid to a particular person should be exactly the same? Does she make any allowance for differential rates in accordance with different standards of living and different prices across the country, or does she agree with her hon. Friend that whether one is in Scotland or central London, one should pay one's cleaner exactly the same?
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> I should like to see Opposition Members try to come up with a definition that deals with those disparities, which do not fit neatly into regional boundaries. It is not obvious that a regional pay rate varies hugely between different parts of the country. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> No, I have dealt with differential rates--they are completely impractical. People should be paid the same rate in different parts of the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I want to draw the hon. Lady on that point. She mentioned her experience in negotiating pay claims for nurses. Has not that group of workers experienced difficulties in areas where wages are high? Is it not still experiencing such difficulties? Can the hon. Lady enlighten the Committee as to how the pay differential works in the nursing profession?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that all Members enlighten everyone in the Committee with every contribution that they make. I am, however, also sure that the hon. Lady will remember that I want her to refer to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> I accept your strictures, Mrs. Dunwoody, and shall move on. I would happily engage in a long argument about nurses, but I do not want to dwell on the matter now.
<P>
Another argument that was made earlier was that certain sectors would suffer serious job losses if we introduced the minimum wage. I spoke on Second Reading about the textiles industry, which is important in my constituency. I should mention that, in 1979, there were 800,000 jobs in clothing, leather, footwear and textiles. Today, there are 350,000 jobs in those sectors. I do not recall that that loss of those jobs coincided with a Government who were rashly pushing up pay rates and encouraging high levels of pay. I do not recall the previous Government making a sudden conversion to high wages. Yet, over that period, the number of jobs in that low-paying sector went down from 800,000 to 350,000.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> I have not developed my argument. The problem has been that we cannot compete with the wages that are paid in the far east, or in Sri Lanka and Morocco, and we should not pretend that we can. Textiles is still one of the largest manufacturing sectors in this country, but we have to compete on the basis of niche production, marketing and quality. Speaking about the increase in the value of exports, the British Apparel and Textiles Confederation said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a growing number of companies have found that foreign markets are very receptive to design, high quality production and brand name strength of UK products''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has to be the basis on which we compete, yet the clothing industry training board says that &#163;108 million is lost in training expenditure every year because of staff turnover. That does not go with the skills, high training, quality and innovation that we need.
<P>
One hon. Member--I regret to say that I cannot remember who--waxed lyrical about piece rates. I do not hate piece rates; indeed, I have helped negotiate them. But they are not the future, and proposing them is not to move with the times. The Bill does not affect piece work, but I hope that having a minimum wage will allow a re-examination of wages structures. We must encourage the flexibility that we need to keep up with the modern marketplace. The piece rate wages structure went with the need for large-scale, speedy production of the same product. In industries such as textiles, we now need flexible lines, and we need to develop new pay structures to go with them. I hope that the minimum wage will enable us to consider that, which is not to say that it will itself affect piece work.
<P>
Last Friday, I visited Stevensons, a firm in my constituency which is part of the Coats Viyella group. It is the largest commissioned dye works in Europe. Its dyeing department was set up in 1865, at which point it produced cochineal--a bright red dye that is produced by crushing beetles. Stevensons has adapted over the decades and, as far as I could see, it no longer crushes beetles. It has got to the stage where a sister company--Precision Processes (Textiles)--makes a substantial amount of money from specifically examining quality and innovation in design and production within the textiles industry. That is the direction in which we need to go. The manager of that company, who has also worked in the other Coats Viyella companies in my constituency, did not lobby me about the minimum wage. He talked about quotas and said that he thought that too much was going to the smallest firms and not enough to his.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Lady, because we all understand the need for commercials for our constituencies, but she is now wandering a little wide of the amendment, even if she was able to agree with the manager concerned.
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The manager did not argue that we should not have standard rates, that there should be a separate rate for the textiles industry, or that it should be exempted. Our argument is that we need a standard rate from which there are not exemptions. We should be arguing on the basis of quality, skills and innovation. Making an exemption for the textiles industry would not suddenly lead to jobs in it.
<P>
We cannot compete on the basis of making exemptions for different sectors of industry. The loss of 450,000 jobs in the textiles industry proves that that is not the way forward. We want a standardised rate and a modern approach to the future. We need flexibility, which will allow us to develop new skills and to innovate. We do not need spurious arguments about flexibility with different pay rates. The arguments of Opposition Members in favour of the amendments have not been proved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> This group of amendments is relatively wide-ranging. I shall try to confine myself to those which I and my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham have tabled, because we have not yet discussed them.
<P>
However, I cannot resist responding to the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber). I defer to her, as one should, for her loyalty to the textiles industry, but from what I know of that industry, I would find it strange if its collective view was that the difficulties that it faced as a result of global competition would be solved by the Government stepping in to impose a national minimum wage rate which might distort its pay scales. For some firms, although not all, that could well lead to increases in pay up the pay scales because of the impact on differentials.
<P>
Most of those companies would say that they pay as well as they possibly can under the circumstances, but that many of their difficulties arise from the extraordinarily low level of wages that are paid in other countries. That is not to say that we can compete with them on pay--previous Conservative Governments never tried to depress wages artificially for that reason--but the hon. Lady is right--we must compete through non-wage mechanisms such as quality design, niche marketing, branding and so on. It is not for the Committee to try to evolve a corporate strategy for the textiles industry, but that industry will certainly not be helped by a national minimum wage.
<P>
There is a coherence to the amendments, which relate to an issue that has been well explored by the Committee. The hon. Member for Amber Valley reinforced the point of the amendments when she argued for the simplicity of the national minimum wage and said that the complexities of regional variations demonstrated the necessity of a national minimum wage. The amendments illustrate, by reference to several criteria--occupation, age, size of business, sector of industry and regional variation--the complexities of the pay structures and the labour marketplace into which the national minimum wage will leap, like an elephant, leaving its large prints across British industry.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh and his colleague may correct me, but I do not think that the amendments were tabled with the expectation that they would be adopted by the Government--still less that they would create a matrix of different pay rates according to all those criteria.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for another opportunity to stress the purpose of the amendment. He is correct that it is not meant to set up a matrix of rates. It merely urges the Government to give the Low Pay Commission the freedom to examine the potential impact of a rigid national minimum wage. I am not prejudging the issue, but I am raising genuine concerns about the impact of the minimum wage that have been expressed across the country. The Government are obliged to address those concerns through the commission.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The point is reinforced by the fact that it has been made on a cross-party basis. The debate has shown that the national minimum wage will have several implications. There will be differential impacts in various regions and sectors, and there may be a significant differential impact according to the size of business to which it is applied. There will also be responses to that.
<P>
In the first instance, we may not know what those impacts will be, but the Low Pay Commission has not even assimilated the evidence and expressed a view; indeed, the Minister told the Committee about the commission's remit--it has not even been invited to express a view about some of those factors. It has been made clear to the commission that it is not yet in its gift to propose differential rates by region--the mechanisms for doing that may be as troublesome as the hon. Member for Amber Valley says--but there might be clear evidence given in the first instance that the minimum wage may have a substantial adverse impact on given sectors, sizes of business or regions.
<P>
I am coming to the amendments, Mrs. Dunwoody. It may be necessary, initially or later, on the basis of evidence, to move to different rates. Ministers are not giving themselves the power, as many--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot have another Second Reading debate. I hope that hon. Members understand that they must stick to discussing the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall comply with what you say, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> One or two points have not been made in relation to amendments in this group. Amendments Nos. 67 and 68 are probing--will the Minister respond? They question the inability of the Mininsters subsequently to make regulations that differentiate by occupation. What is the import of that? The Minister may be wondering which benighted occupations Conservative Members thought would be excluded from the minimum wage and which workers would be oppressed because they would be paid less than the minimum wage. That is not the purpose of the amendments. We want to test whether including certain occupations would be purposeless, not because their pay is low but because it is so high.
<P>
If some occupations were not outside the provisions, there would be burdens: record keeping, changes to pay-as-you-earn and other systems, and the recording of hours worked and pay. That would serve no purpose, because there is no question of such occupations coming within the ambit of the national minimum wage. For example, Members of Parliament will not be paid anywhere near the minimum wage, What purpose would be served by calculating what hourly rate is paid to Members of Parliament? Records would be kept for no purpose.
<P>
The amendments all relate to the fact that Ministers want to enable themselves to set a minimum wage but they are disabling themselves from responding to evidence. Whole groups of people in certain occupations may never be affected by national minimum wage legislation and so could be excluded completely.
<P>
The amendments relate to businesses of specific sizes. I found the arguments for them persuasive, but the fullness of time may render them less so. There is good statistical evidence to show that job creation is greater among very small businesses, but also that small businesses are distributed among sectors of the economy in ways that may correlate with areas of job creation.
<P>
We may find, in time, that sectoral employment is better than size of business when it comes to identifying where the national minimum wage has had a significant adverse effect. Alternatively, we may find that there is something special about small businesses. Why do they tend to be labour intensive rather than capital intensive? It is because the costs of entry are often lower on the basis of recruitment of skills than on the basis of capital investment. Very often, such businesses move from investment in skills to a second stage involving investment in capital.
<P>
I think that my hon. Friends are right. The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, like me, has had experience of small business matters over some years. Small businesses play an important entry-level role. Raising the price of labour may bring about a disproportionate and adverse impact on the cost of entry into business for small firms.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Small businesses often operate in labour intensive sectors, so will not the minimum wage force them to try to change their ratios of labour to capital? Experience shows that very small businesses do not have access to the capital that would enable them to do that. They do not have the flexibility to respond to the challenge of the national minimum wage. The inevitable result will be a transfer of employment away from smaller businesses. The work may go abroad as imports are sucked in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. I shall not elaborate on that point, which shows that discretion to review the evidence on size of business as a basis on which to vary the minimum rate may prove useful in the long term.
<P>
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Amber Valley about regions. Trying to define regions may prove very burdensome in time, but it is not necessarily a bad idea to restrain Ministers. For example, if Ministers concluded that a national minimum wage had proved disadvantageous to Northern Ireland, and if the relationship between respective minimum wage levels in this country and in the Republic of Ireland turned out to be difficult, the hon. Lady's point would not have force. It is possible for a minimum wage to be adjusted for Northern Ireland without incurring the practical problems to which the hon. Lady referred. I am not qualified to pursue the matter further, but it seems that the scope for discretion may be there.
<P>
The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne tempted the Committee with what she had to say about regional variations in response to a point made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. I shall not go into detail, save to say that both the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale confused the impact of wage rates with other structural matters affecting unemployment in different parts of the country. As was the case in the debate on regional development agencies, in which I participated last week, issues of peripherality and of access to markets give a much more compelling reason for suggesting that there are differences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend also considered, in relation to the specific issue of regional variations, that as the Government are committed in principle to the introduction of the euro, they must either want a regional variation for the minimum wage within the euro area when Britain enters it, or a single minimum wage covering all the countries that will participate in the euro?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, but I shall not dwell on it. It is ironic that, at the same time as the Government have said that, in principle, they want to remove European countries' potential to adjust relative to each other in competitive terms through differences in currencies, they also wish to remove Britain's discretion to adjust its relative competitiveness through other factors that contribute to total cost.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne strayed furthest into the fallacy of local spending power. I am trying to think of a catchy title--the Opposition will come up with one before too long. The fallacy suggests that if people's minimum wage is raised, they will automatically spend more in the local economy and everybody will be better off. That is exposed by the reductio ad absurdum of suggesting that everybody should be paid &#163;10, and therefore they will be proportionally better off.
<P>
It is also easily demonstrated that that argument is not proven. If a person is paying more in the local economy because of a national minimum wage, and is in a globally competitive industry, prices cannot be raised in response to the increase in costs. The strain of the increases will be taken in another way--by other costs, by hours worked, by numbers of people employed, or whatever.
<P>
A business in a local service economy, in which it can adjust prices, will do so. Of course, the argument is circular. Costs go up, because more is paid in wages. Local services raise their prices, and local people pay more for the services that they were already buying. The net benefit to standards of living is negligible. Reality does not work in that way. In the long run, global competitiveness may lead to the migration of jobs away from local economies.
<P>
Much as the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne may believe in the argument, she is offering fool's gold to her constituency. The Committee should proceed on the basis of evidence--that is what the amendments are about. They offer Ministers and the Low Pay Commission the opportunity to work on the basis of evidence when constructing the national minimum wage, rather than on the basis of foolish theoretical notions.
