Chairman:
						</b> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before we
start, let me say that I have taken a look at the schedule of what we
must get through between now and a week today. Under the terms of the
agreement with the House, the Bill must exit Committee at 4 pm on that
day, and there is rather a lot to get through. Members on both sides of
the Committee will agree that this is an important Bill, and my job is
to ensure that it is properly debated. I cannot tell hon. Members what
to do or what they may and may talk about, and nor do I seek to do so,
because that is in their gift. However, what I would say&#151;clearly
and, I hope, not too fiercely&#151;is that it would be an extremely
good idea for the usual channels to talk to each other about Tuesday
evening, if they have not already done so. What happens then will
depend on where we have got to by the end of the afternoon, when I
shall also be present. We owe it to colleagues in the House to ensure
that we get through as much of the Bill as we can, even if we cannot
get through it all. Now, it is over to you.</div>

					<a name="080124103000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good morning, Mr.
Gale. I take on board your request for focus and brevity. The new
clause, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
St. Ives, seeks to define the applicability of sections 8(3) and (4) of
the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Referring to section 8, the amendment
says:</div>
					<a name="080124103000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
section applies to a contract for the letting of a house for a term of
less than seven years&#148;.</div>
					<a name="080124103000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next part of the
amendment is self-explanatory. Obviously, we are trying to ensure that
the legislation applies to the right people in the right circumstances
and in a fair way, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has
to say. Given what you have just said, Mr. Gale, there is no
great benefit in my giving a lengthy exposition, because it is the
Government&#146;s perspective that is important, not
mine.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column480" />Column number: 480</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000198"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Mr. Iain Wright):
						</b> Thank you,
Mr. Gale, and good morning to you. I take on board your
ruling on moving forward swiftly while seeking to ensure that the
important measures in the Bill are adequately scrutinised and
debated.</div>
					<a name="080124103000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would extend the obligation to ensure that a property is fit for
human habitation, as defined under section 10 of the 1985 Act, to all
rented accommodation that is let on short leases of less than seven
years. I fully understand why the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire and
for St. Ives tabled it, but it is not necessary, because we now have
more up-to-date and effective provisions in place to ensure that rented
property is let and maintained in a satisfactory and safe
condition.</div>
					<a name="080124103000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fitness standard referred to in section 10 of the 1985 Act has been
replaced by the housing health and safety rating system, which was
introduced in the Housing Act 2004. The old fitness standard was based
on criteria that were originally introduced 80 years ago and it was in
great need of modernisation.</div>
					<a name="080124103000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new rating system is a
risk-assessment process, which looks at the likelihood that an incident
will arise as a result of the condition of the property
and that there will be a harmful outcome. That approach allows
the assessment to be geared to the individual circumstances of each
case, based on the risks to those occupants who are most vulnerable to
the hazards.</div>
					<a name="080124103000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rating standard assesses 29 categories of housing hazard, such as
electrical hazards, cold, falls, fire and so on and is therefore a more
suitable tool than the old standard for improving housing conditions in
the private rented sector. The old standard did not cover all the major
health and safety problems found in a home and gave no indication of
how serious problems were.</div>
					<a name="080124103000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a property is found to
contain serious, so-called category 1 hazards, the local authority has
a duty to take the most appropriate action in relation to those
hazards. That could include serving a notice for the landlord to carry
out improvements and it may even extend to issuing a prohibition order,
the effect of which would be to close all, or part of, a
property.</div>
					<a name="080124103000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Housing Act 2004 enables local authority environmental health officers
to undertake a rating system assessment of the risks and hazards in a
property. If risks are found, the authority can instruct the landlord
or person responsible for management to undertake any works necessary
to ensure that the property is safe and decent&#151;for example, the
installation of central heating. It can instruct the landlord to
undertake such works within a set time scale. Failure by the landlord
or manager to do so can result in a fine of up to
&#163;5,000.</div>
					<a name="080124103000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, landlords have obligations to carry out repairs to keep their
properties in good condition. Under section 11 of the Landlord and
Tenant Act 1985, they are legally responsible for repairs to the
structure and exterior of their properties and for keeping the plumbing
and heating installations in proper working order. Local authorities
have powers to force landlords to carry out necessary repairs. The
rating system that I mentioned can be used by tenants whose landlords
fail to carry out the repairs for which they are responsible under the
landlord and tenant Acts.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 481</div>
					<a name="080124103000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local authorities have a range
of powers to force property owners to deal with statutory nuisance
problems relating to the condition of a property. For example, under
the Building Act 1984, they can require steps to be taken to address a
property that adversely affects the amenity of an area due to
disrepair.</div>
					<a name="080124103000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
range of powers in place from a variety of legislation, I believe that
adequate provisions are already in place to address the condition of
rented accommodation. Indeed, the new housing health and safety rating
system has many advantages over the old fitness standard. As the new
rating standard can give full consideration to problems
caused&#151;for example, by damp and a lack of central
heating&#151;in the way that a fixed set of minimum standards cannot,
it provides more protection for
tenants.</div>
					<a name="080124103000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have set out the position clearly and reassured the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire and that he will withdraw the
motion.</div>
					<a name="080124103000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000199"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> I applaud the Minister&#146;s faith in
existing legislation. He is right to highlight the housing health and
safety rating system and to point out that, in theory at least, a
tenant can evoke it to secure improvements in the standard of
accommodation that they rent. However, in any practical sense, often
that is not the case. We are dealing with individuals who frequently
feel disfranchised and quite often feel intimidated by their landlord.
As such, although theoretically an individual who rents a property can
use existing legislation to improve the conditions in which they live,
in practice that is often unlikely. To list 29 categories of hazard in
legislation is fine, but I would be willing to bet that 99.9 per cent.
of the public have no idea what those 29 categories are. The new clause
would make it a little easier for tenants to see their rights
protected.</div>
					<a name="080124103000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear
what the Minister says, and to save time and to consult Shelter and
other organisations I will not press the new clause to a vote now, but
I may bring it back on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I beg to
move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="080124103000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the new clause, we are using the opportunity provided by this aspect of
the Bill to press the Government to extend mandatory licensing beyond
what is outlined in the Housing Act 2004. There is clear evidence from
Shelter and within the House from the all-party group on balanced and
sustainable communities that the current threshold leaves thousands of
vulnerable tenants in very difficult circumstances and at risk, because
they fall outside the scope of the mandatory licensing
system.</div>
					<a name="080124103000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also know
that many local authorities, which can have an additional licensing or
selective licensing scheme for housing, refuse to do so even when there
is a strong local need, such as in my city of Durham. In Durham, there
is an extensive private rented sector because of the student population
and because Durham is a centre for the county. There is a real need in
the area for an extended licensing scheme, but that has not been
undertaken by the people in the local authority, for reasons best known
to
themselves.</div>
					<a name="080124103000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
landlords have assured me that they have nothing to fear from an
extension of mandatory licensing, so the new clause pushes the
Government to introduce mandatory licensing for all houses in multiple
occupation with more than four occupants or with three storeys or more.
Currently, licensing is mandatory for dwellings with five or more
occupants and three storeys or
more.</div>
					<a name="080124103000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
previous Minister for Local Government, now the Minister for the
Environment, gave assurances at an Adjournment debate last June that
this situation would be considered seriously. I know that the
Government announced a review of the private rented sector yesterday,
but I want to press the Minister on this. The Government should
seriously consider making changes to the mandatory licensing scheme so
that tenants are better protected and there is better management across
the whole private rented sector.</div>
					<a name="080124103000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080124103000201"></a>
							<b class="B">Lyn
Brown</b> (West Ham) (Lab): I support the new clause in the
hope that we might broaden the coverage of the current licensing
scheme. Even Government figures estimate that the scheme covers only
120,000 houses in multiple occupation&#151;only 19 per cent. of the
638,000 estimated HMOs in England. The mandatory scheme for larger
houses places an onus on landlords to register properties, and gives
councils a chance, at least, of regulating the circumstances in their
areas.</div>
					<a name="080124103000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
principal reasons why I support the new clause. First, the mandatory
scheme covers only homes with three storeys or more. In my
constituency, most houses have two storeys and there is very little
accommodation with three storeys. My hon. Friend the Member for City of
Durham talked about the students who occupy such homes in her area, but
in my area we are talking about migrant workers who have come to build
the new city at Stratford and the Olympic site. My constituents and I
are in a borough with the largest building site in Europe.
Understandably, for such a large-scale property development and
project, the migrant workers will be with us only temporarily. They
tend to secure accommodation close to the site where they work, in
small houses with many people to a room. As construction efforts
ratchet up, more workers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 483</div>are required on site, and that has led to overcrowding as workers share
accommodation to keep costs down. Constituents have told me that
hot-bedding is rife. That is when a bed is shared by many people on
different shifts.</div>
					<a name="080124103000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080124103000202"></a>
							<b class="B">Margaret
Moran</b> (Luton, South) (Lab): May I emphasise the point that
my hon. Friend is making? In the 1950s and 1960s, in Luton, hot-bedding
was the norm when Irish construction workers came over to build Luton,
and subsequently. That has not happened for generations, but is now
happening again in areas such as mine that are part of the new Milton
Keynes/south midlands growth area. We are starting to experience
exactly the same
problems.</div>
					<a name="080124103000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000203"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend. Hot-bedding might be
acceptable on a nuclear submarine, but it does not make for sustainable
communities. The pressure on accommodation is so great that lock-up
garages and garden sheds have been illegally converted into
accommodation. On 2 January, the <i class="I">Newham Recorder</i>, a fantastic
local campaigning newspaper, reported the death of an individual who
had been living in a lock-up garage on the Romford road. It seems that
a heater in the garage caught fire while he was asleep. The
conflagration was so intense that it has not yet been possible to
identify his body, but he clearly was sleeping and had furniture in a
lock-up garage.</div>
					<a name="080124103000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Migrant
workers are being charged a huge amount for the privilege of
hot-bedding and, we think, sleeping in lock-up garages. They are in
poor-quality accommodation and seriously overcrowded houses. Last
night, at a meeting in my constituency, a constituent told me of a
two-bedroom house in Plaistow in which more than 14 men live. The
problem is not small; it is widespread. Given that the homes are too
small for the number of people staying in them, mere living is being
exported outside the confines of the house. Living happens in the
street and the garden. It is insanitary.</div>
					<a name="080124103000172"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15 am</div>
					<a name="080124103000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have lost
sight of the number of complaints that I have received from
constituents about this issue, which is leading to home occupier
flight. While the population temporarily rockets, long-term residents
find the associated pressures too great. I am repeatedly told by
neighbours and friends in the community that they have had enough. They
are putting their homes up for sale, but the problem is that when they
do so they sell to people who then rent the house out, so the situation
gets worse and worse. The exceptionally high occupancy levels cause
real stress, and the current licensing scheme does little to protect
those in smaller houses in multiple occupation. More than 80 per cent.
of such homes are not covered by the mandatory licensing scheme, and
the majority of those in my constituency fall outside the mandatory
threshold.</div>
					<a name="080124103000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would increase the number of properties that came within the
scope of the regulations. As I stated earlier, very few of the houses
in multiple occupation in West Ham are three or more storeys high, so
the current legislation ignores large swathes of the sector. Those
smaller properties are much more likely to be owned by smaller-scale
and more informal landlords, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>and to have a greater impact on the area in quieter more residential
neighbourhoods; under the new clause, instead of a property being
required to have three or more storeys and a significant number of
residents, either criterion would qualify it to be an HMO eligible for
regulation.</div>
					<a name="080124103000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that we cannot overburden the sector with unnecessary
regulation and local authorities with additional properties to inspect
and regulate. However, as I have outlined, the problems caused by HMOs
are significant enough to justify the new clause. I urge the Minister
to accept it, and to place an onerous financial burden on landlords
caught flouting the law. The last thing that is needed is for the
Minister to accept the provisions but for a derisory penalty to be
imposed on landlords, given the amount of money that they rake in by
overcrowding homes and burdening
communities.</div>

shall give the Committee the context. The Labour party manifestos of
1997 and 2001 made a commitment to introduce the mandatory licensing of
HMOs to raise standards in such housing, which, as we have heard, is
often poor quality and badly managed. Consultation on those pledges
indicated widespread support for that approach. However, the Government
were keen to avoid the excessive regulatory burdens to which my hon.
Friend has alluded and therefore wanted licensing of HMOs to be a
properly targeted measure. It was decided that mandatory licensing
should apply to those properties with the highest risk, which often
provide the greatest management
challenges.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000205"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that the greatest risk
is not necessarily a question of the size of the building; it may be a
question of the area in which it sits and the local
circumstances?</div>
					<a name="080124103000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000206"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend has raised a good point, and I
shall come on to
that.</div>
					<a name="080124103000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
1997 report commissioned from the consultants Entec entitled
&#147;Fire Risk in HMOs&#148; concluded that the fire risk in HMOs
is greatest for occupants in properties of three or more storeys, and
that the level of occupancy also influences risk. Given that the
legislation is designed to catch those properties that pose the
greatest risk to occupiers, if the largest HMOs pose the greatest risk,
drawing the line at three storeys and five persons, which is the
current position, was and is right, notwithstanding the concerns
expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham. However, the
&#147;prescribed description&#148; of a mandatory HMO is contained
within an order, so if further evidence suggests otherwise&#151;the
evidence that my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham has provided is
top notch&#151;it can be easily changed, which is why the measure was
not included within the Housing Act 2004. It was important to explain
why the definition is as it currently is, and why it is based on the
risk to occupants.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>
					<a name="080124103000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now I will turn to some related
issues that are not directly connected to the risk to the occupants of
HMOs, but that will resonate with my hon. Friends the Members for City
of Durham and for West Ham, who tabled the new clause. My hon. Friend
the Member for City of Durham has concerns about balanced
communities&#151;I know that, because she is a near neighbour of mine
in the north-east and a tenacious campaigner for affordable housing. At
her invitation, I attended a seminar in her area on affordable housing,
and I pay tribute to her work. That work is sometimes in conflict with
the local authority, which does not seem to prioritise housing as my
hon. Friend does&#151;I think that she has the measure of her
constituency absolutely
right.</div>
					<a name="080124103000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
has a beautiful city as her constituency, and she has a beautiful and
extremely prestigious university in her constituency. Most student
housing that is owned and managed by the educational establishment
providing courses in higher or further education to students is exempt
from mandatory licensing, due to three nationally approved codes of
management practice for that particular
sub-sector.</div>
					<a name="080124103000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
student accommodation that is not owned and managed by educational
establishments, my hon. Friend will no doubt be aware of, and will no
doubt contribute to, the measure that we are about to consult on,
namely the changes to the use classes order in relation to HMOs. We
need that consultation to allow the Government to consider whether
local authorities need to have more planning control over the future
establishment of HMOs and their density. A small working group is also
being set up to examine how the relevant agencies can better work
together on the concentration of that particular sub-sector&#151;the
so-called &#147;studentification&#148; of an area&#151;via a
non-legislative route. I hope that my hon. Friend will contribute to
that consultation and feed in her concerns through that process to me,
which I am sure that she will
do.</div>
					<a name="080124103000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
the contribution that students make to the economy of a town or
city&#151;I certainly want to see a university of Hartlepool, and I
think that a university is important for generating prosperity in an
area&#151;there can be management issues in relation to properties
predominantly housing student tenants, such as smaller HMOs, perhaps in
targeted, specific areas. That is why the Housing Act 2004 gave local
authorities the power to designate areas subject to additional
licensing, where proper local consultation has been carried out and
consent has been given by the Secretary of State. Additional licensing
allows licensing to be focused on particular circumstances and in
particular areas where there are problems for members of the wider
local community caused by the poor management of privately rented
property.</div>
					<a name="080124103000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision for the introduction of additional licensing schemes will
also apply in the instances that my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham
outlined today&#151;she also outlined them on Second Reading and in
an Adjournment debate last year about housing in West Ham to which we
both contributed. Indeed, many hon. Members have encountered problems
involving smaller houses, which were perhaps initially designed for
families but have now been let by landlords to multiple individuals. As
a result&#151;my hon. Friend put this far more eloquently than I
could&#151;those houses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>are often overcrowded, causing health and social problems to the
detriment of their occupants. They are also a nuisance for the wider
area, causing issues such as excessive car parking, which sometimes
occurs in student areas, and waste collection problems. My hon. Friend
will recall that I wrote to her on 14 January outlining how the
proposed changes and new regime might work in her constituency, and I
am keen to work with her to follow that up.</div>
					<a name="080124103000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">If additional licensing is
introduced in a local authority area and a landlord refuses to obtain a
licence for a property, the local authority could prosecute the
landlord, and the courts could award a fine of up to &#163;20,000. I
think that that addresses the point made by my hon. Friend the Member
for West Ham that the level of punishment needs to be commensurate with
the level of rents that the landlord may be fleecing from the tenant.
Similarly, if a landlord breaches the conditions of a licence, such as
the level of occupancy, for example, the courts could fine the landlord
up to &#163;5,000 for committing a criminal offence. I imagine that
my hon. Friend agrees that the penalty will have a real bite on
non-compliance.</div>
					<a name="080124103000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080124103000207"></a>
							<b class="B">Grant
Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): I support the direction of
the new clause, inasmuch as I know from my experience of representing a
university town&#151;Hertfordshire university is in
Hatfield&#151;that many of the problems mentioned by hon. Members are
very real. Will the Minister accept that many local authorities do not
have the resources to do the kind of checking or to make the sort of
investigations that would lead to the severe fines and penalties that
he outlines? Is that not one of the problems with the existing
legislation, let alone with further amendments to
it?</div>
					<a name="080124103000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000208"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I suggest that local authorities need to target
resources according to the particular concerns of the residents and
pressure from elected members and hon. Members. The approach that my
hon. Friends have taken is, I know, close to hand because of the media
interest. Indeed, because of the tremendous campaigning work that my
hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham has done, I know that she is
pushing a reluctant local authority, and I pay tribute to her for what
she has achieved. That is the way to deal with possible
burdens.</div>
					<a name="080124103000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
the Housing Act 2004 offers local authorities the power to serve
overcrowding notices on non-licensable HMOs, such as houses that do not
fall under mandatory selective or additional licensing schemes, should
there be a risk to the safety and welfare of occupants. We will talk
about overcrowding later, but the overcrowding notice must specify the
maximum number of persons for which a room is suitable for use as
sleeping accommodation, or that a room is unsuitable to be used as
sleeping accommodation.</div>
					<a name="080124103000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local authorities can develop
their own overcrowding standards on room sizes for privately rented
HMOs, and houses that do not comply with the standard can be served
with an overcrowding notice. If the landlord or manager of the property
breaches the notice conditions, an offence is committed, and they can
be fined up to &#163;2,500.</div>

							<a name="080124103000209"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> Will the Minister accept that it is difficult for
councils to identify those homes that are currently massively
overcrowded, as they do not need to be licensed? There are many streets
in my area where people live in temporary accommodation or houses in
multiple occupation, because of the way in which the housing market is
going. That is the result of, first, the pressures caused by property
in east London being cheaper than property elsewhere in London, which
makes it an attractive buy for people who want to get their first foot
on the housing ladder in London, and, secondly, the building work
taking place in Stratford. Because of those concerns, it would be so
much easier if all HMOs needed a licence. It is harder for the council
to identify those houses that are not expected to have or do not need a
licence.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000210"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend has brought me nicely on to my next
point, which has also been alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for
City of Durham, namely the review of the private rented sector that my
right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing announced
yesterday&#151;she may have referred to it when giving evidence in
December. I do not expect it to act as a magic wand&#151;the review
will not solve all the problems overnight&#151;but it will be
important to collect the evidence, as it will allow us to move forward
on future legislative proposals. In a moment, I shall mention certain
things that are in the terms of reference of the private sector review
that will help with my hon. Friends&#146; concerns. I urge them to
contribute to the review, and I will ensure that they can speak to
those who are carrying it out.</div>
					<a name="080124103000159"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000211"></a>Margaret
Moran:
						</b> I want to reinforce the point. Is the
Minister aware that my constituency is another low-cost area? People
come from London, because it is cheaper to rent in Luton. My hon.
Friend the Member for West Ham has mentioned people living in sheds and
garages, which are not caught by existing legislation because no one
perceived that people would convert such buildings&#151;indeed, some
of those places are not converted, and people are living in
outbuildings. Unscrupulous landlords are exploiting poor migrant
workers and others, which is not caught by the existing legislation.
Will the Minister ensure that that is covered by the
review?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000212"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> On the broader point, that is why I welcome my
hon. Friend&#146;s support for a massive increase in the supply of
housing, particularly social housing. We need to address the imbalance
between housing demand and supply, which is what the Bill tries to
do.</div>
					<a name="080124103000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me mention
several of the issues that the private rented sector review will look
into, because I think that that will address the points raised by my
hon. Friends. One issue that the review will consider is very
interesting, given that my hon. Friends who tabled the new clause
represent two distinct areas, with different characteristics and
different problems&#151;West Ham is not the same as Durham. The
review will look at the composition and regional characteristics of the
private rented sector, who lives in it and who the providers are. I
want to collect the evidence that my hon. Friends have provided to
contribute to the review.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column488" />Column number: 488</div>
					<a name="080124103000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue, which picks up the point raised by my hon. Friends about migrant
workers being exploited, is what impact demographic and social change
might have on future demand and supply pressures in the sector and how
key players should respond. The review will also consider future
regulation and examine what more could or should be done, given the
recent regulatory changes, to ensure that we have a professionally
managed quality sector to meet demand pressures. Finally, there is the
issue of tenant and landlord views and experiences of the sector. What
are their priorities for change, and how can those priorities
contribute to policy development?</div>
					<a name="080124103000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge my hon. Friends to
contribute to the review to ensure that it is as robust as possible,
and I shall invite them to talk to Julie Rugg and David Rhodes from the
centre for housing policy at York university, who will be carrying out
the review. It is important that we have my hon. Friends&#146;
experiences, anecdotes and evidence, and the people leading the review
could go to West Ham and Durham to find out what is going on in the
private rented sector to ensure that they are as informed as they can
be, so that any future legislative changes are made with the greatest
authority.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): The Minister
will be aware that high levels of students cause problems in certain
areas as a result of what is called studentification. I have listened
carefully to him, and I assume that the review of the private rented
sector will pick up some of the problems in areas where high levels of
students have an impact on the housing
market.</div>

I did not make myself clear&#151;or perhaps he came in slightly
later&#151;but I have mentioned the problems of studentification. As
I have said, we are about to consult on the use classes order. The
problem has certainly been raised with me; I have responsibility for
it; and I am keen to look into it.</div>
					<a name="080124103000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have covered in
depth some of the issues that my hon. Friends have rightly raised. With
the greatest respect, however, I must tell them that the new clause
does not achieve anything that cannot be achieved via existing
statutory provisions for regulating the private sector, such as
additional licensing and overcrowding notices. However, there are
certain concerns, which we will need to tackle when we are looking
further afield as part of the private sector review. Given what I have
said and the fact that I am extraordinarily sympathetic to my hon.
Friends and want to help them as much as possible, I hope that I will
be invited back to the beautiful city of Durham and to West
Ham&#151;I want to go on tour. In the light of what I have said and
of my sympathy for my hon. Friends and their great campaigning work, I
hope that they will consider withdrawing the new
clause.</div>

issues. As my hon. Friends the Members for West Ham and for Luton,
South have demonstrated, we need to re-examine the issue, regardless of
the circumstances that lead to areas having a lot of private rented
housing. We also need to consider extending not only mandatory
licensing, but use class orders as they affect HMOs, as the Minister
has said.</div>

know, we do not sit for more than three hours without a break, but
given that there will be breaks for votes, if the Committee wishes to

						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a
Second time.</div>
					<a name="080124103000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">In view
of what you just said, Mr. Gale, I shall continue to
exercise a self-denying ordinance of brevity, and so I shall seek the
Minister&#146;s views on new clause 30, which I tabled with my hon.
Friend the Member for St. Ives. It is once again about enforcing a code
of practice for the private sector. It seems to me, and to
organisations concerned about the matter, that the private rented
sector is still a wild card when it comes to standards. The active
ingredient of the new clause is the establishment of standards of
conduct and practice that must be followed on the management of private
residential property. The debate that we have just had highlights the
dangers of not doing
so.</div>
					<a name="080124103000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will
be all too aware of the fact that many people live in abject poverty in
the private rented sector and, as long as we do not have a more active
way of enforcing standards, that is likely to continue. One of the
problems is overcrowding, which is forced on us by the absence of
sufficient rented accommodation. The <i class="I">County Times</i> in my
constituency, which is without 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div>doubt the finest campaigning newspaper not only in Wales or the United
Kingdom, but western Europe, has frequently highlighted the desperate
shortage of housing in the private rented sector and, indeed, the
public rented sector, in my constituency. As a result of that shortage,
people are willing to compromise their standards and accept
accommodation that in any other circumstances they would regard as
unacceptable. It is therefore incumbent on us to ensure in regulations
that the quality of such private rented accommodation is sufficient to
warrant people&#146;s living in
it.</div>
					<a name="080124103000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Minister to share his perspective on the matter. He does not have to
give us a long response, as long as it is insightful. On that basis, I
shall decide whether to press the new clause to a
vote.</div>
					<a name="080124103000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000218"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I applaud the hon. Gentleman for tabling the new
clause, but I intend to outline and explain the mechanisms that we
already have that negate the need for it. Section 233 of the Housing
Act 2004 gives power to the appropriate national authority, which is
the Secretary of State in England and the Welsh Minister in Wales, to
approve codes of practice, whether prepared by that authority or
another person, laying down standards of conduct and practice to be
followed with regard to the management of houses in multiple occupation
or of excepted accommodation. Excepted accommodation is any
accommodation that is specified in an order that is accommodation
controlled or managed by public sector bodies, or other accommodation
specified in regulations, buildings occupied by students or religious
communities, buildings occupied by their owner or buildings occupied
only by two persons who are not living in one household.</div>
					<a name="080124103000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
has so far been used to approve three codes of practice that
specifically deal with the management of student accommodation. No
other code has been considered necessary as yet, because local
authorities have been active in ensuring that HMOs, which are
frequently the most problematic properties in terms of management, are
managed adequately via the mandatory licensing regime. I am satisfied
with the way in which local authorities are ensuring the management
standards of such
properties.</div>
					<a name="080124103000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
more widely than HMOs&#151;I am conscious that we have already
debated them&#151;hon. Members seem keen to ensure for those who rely
on a third party to manage their home that there are common standards
to ensure that the management is conducted properly. I hope that hon.
Members are not surprised to hear that I could not agree more. Everyone
has the right to expect their home to be managed well and
professionally, which is one reason for the private sector review. That
is also why, for people who rent privately, the Government actively
support accreditation, which has been championed by the Accreditation
Network UK, and the national approved letting scheme, both of which we
have provided with funding in the past.</div>
					<a name="080124103000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both ANUK
and NALS ensure that those who rent in the private sector have the
option to rent a decent property from an accredited landlord or via an
accredited letting agent. Accreditation Network UK promotes and
encourages best practice models of accreditation. Local authorities, in
conjunction with local landlord organisations, work together to ensure
that properties and/or landlords sign up to codes of practice on
standards and management. Its model scheme, which has been adopted by
many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>local authorities in relation to their local private rented stock,
includes a requirement to fair, reasonable and competent management
practices. Many schemes also provide landlord training and professional
development.</div>
					<a name="080124103000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Agents
who are members of NALS&#151;there are 1,400 member offices
throughout the UK&#151;have agreed to abide by service levels such as
responding to requests for maintenance or repairs and otherwise
providing good and competent management. Prospective tenants looking to
rent a home in the private sector should be encouraged to use an agent
who is a member of NALS or to let a property that is part of a local
authority accreditation scheme. Many local authorities are looking to
ensure that accredited properties are part of the mix within
choice-based
lettings.</div>
					<a name="080124103000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
Department is currently instigating a piece of work on accreditation to
establish whether the existing schemes are adequate or whether there
needs to be more active support for their take-up and use, which will
complement the work being carried out as part of the private sector
review. NALS is supported by the professional bodies in the lettings
and management sector, namely the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, the Association of Residential Letting Agents and the
National Association of Estate Agents, as well as by the British
Property Federation and the Housing
Corporation.</div>
					<a name="080124103000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know
that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire tabled the new clause on the
back of concerns, perhaps of his constituents or Shelter, that the
experience of those renting in the private sector sometimes falls short
of the standards of management that all tenants have a right to
receive. I talked about the private sector review in our debate on new
clause 29, and explained that we are trying to do as much as we can
with that. I stress that the outcomes of the review will help to inform
us whether any further Government intervention or regulation of the
private rented sector is needed, but the Bill is not the place to do
that.</div>
					<a name="080124103000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">A possible
unintended consequence of the proposed new clause is that such a
national code would apply to all residential property, whether
long-leasehold, freehold or owner-occupied. I do not wish to dwell on
that point, as I want to be as concise as possible, but I am not sure
whether that is the intention. Existing codes for leasehold management
practices, such as that produced and promoted by RICS, adequately cover
that area. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman and that he

						</b> The most interesting thing
that the Minister said was that his Department is, to use his phrase,
doing a piece of work to investigate the quality of private rented
accommodation. I did not know that. He will discover that there is a
huge range of quality. In the private rented sector, there is still
accommodation that frankly is rubbish. People live in relative squalor
in this country in accommodation that does not befit a second-world
country let alone a first-world country. Again, I am touched by the
Minister&#146;s optimism that existing legislation does the job, but
let us recognise that that rubbish accommodation exists here today,
even under the aegis of the Housing Act 2004. That tells me 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>that however hard he may try to persuade us that existing legislation is
sufficient, there is accommodation that has fallen through the
vice-like analysis of the quality of accommodation in this country
under existing legislation. Therefore, people are living in
accommodation that is bad for their health as well as for the
communities that endure that poor
accommodation.</div>
					<a name="080124103000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible that even the new clause would not be sufficient to change the
situation. We must be realistic and recognise that in 10 years&#146;
time there will still be rubbish accommodation in this country. Part of
the reason for that is that people are loth to complain. I was quite
intimidated by my landlord when I was a student because I felt that he
had all the power and that if I complained too much he would either
throw me out or increase my rent to such an extent that I would have to
move out. We are talking about power relationships in which the tenant
is almost always the junior partner. Therefore, although the Minister
did not say this, I am not completely persuaded that even new clause 30
would be
enough.</div>
					<a name="080124103000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
on the basis of that one very important revelation that the Department
is examining the quality of accommodation in this country, I am willing
to withdraw the motion, but if possible&#151;we do not have to do
this in the next week or two&#151;the Minister might seek feedback
from individuals of all parties about what the style of that
investigation needs to be and what parameters the Department might wish
to set, to establish whether there is something that we can do through
legislation or codes of practice to try to get rid of accommodation
that is harming people in a social sense and sometimes harming their
health as well. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

							<a name="080124103000222"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> According to the 2001 census,
Newham has the highest average household size in the country. The lack
of bigger homes is a principal cause of the overcrowding, with entire
families living in one-bedroom flats. The negative impacts of
overcrowding and/or cramped accommodation on family life, education,
health and community cohesion have been ably demonstrated in reports by
Shelter and the Royal Institute of British
Architects.</div>
					<a name="080124103000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Shelter&#146;s report entitled &#147;Full house? How overcrowded
housing affects families&#148;, we discovered that three quarters of
overcrowded families had children sharing a bedroom with parents; more
than a quarter had children sleeping in living rooms and dining
rooms&#151;that rose to more than a half in respect of severely
overcrowded families&#151;and 86 per cent. said that depression,
anxiety and stress in the home were caused by cramped living
conditions.</div>
					<a name="080124103000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">More than
a quarter of Newham&#146;s homes are overcrowded, according to the
occupancy rating. Indeed, the Department for Communities and Local
Government&#146;s figures from a 2005 study showed that the highest
level of overcrowding at ward level, based on the bedroom standard, is
shared by a ward in my constituency&#151;Green Street West.
Twenty-five per cent. of those households are overcrowded. It shares
the dubious honour of being the most overcrowded ward with its
neighbour, Green Street East, which is also situated in the London
borough of
Newham.</div>
					<a name="080124103000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have numerous constituency cases in which overcrowded accommodation is
clearly having a very negative effect on family life and
children&#146;s development and achievement, and is placing a real
strain on services and communities. For instance, Mrs. R
lives with her entire family in a one-bedroom property in Stratford.
That is an almost adult family of four. Mrs. R, who is
elderly and has health problems, sleeps on the living room
floor.</div>
					<a name="080124103000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mrs.
B, another constituent who sought my help, lives in a two-bedroom flat
with her four children, whose ages range between four and 14. As one
can imagine, the cramped living conditions have an enormous impact on
her eldest children&#146;s education; they find it difficult to
study, given that they have no space to do so. The schools that the
children attend have written to me on the family&#146;s behalf,
asking whether I can help to get them housed in more appropriate
accommodation.</div>
					<a name="080124103000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mrs. O is trying to
balance her busy career as a nurse with the pressures of an overcrowded
home. She, her husband and their eight-year-old daughter share a
one-bedroom flat in my constituency. Mrs. O will soon have a
greater pressure on her family life because she is heavily pregnant and
is expecting the baby soon.</div>
					<a name="080124103000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mrs.
I from Plaistow has been living in a two-bedroom flat for seven years,
and in that time her family has grown. Her four children are getting
older, and her son has to sleep with two of his sisters in the second
bedroom because of the pressure of space. Mrs. I told me of
her concern about the impact that it has on family life, especially on
her children&#146;s development. Again, the educational prospects
were a great concern.</div>
					<a name="080124103000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly, Mr. Gale,
I could continue listing such cases, but I chose those four because
they happen to have come up in the last six weeks. I wish to make it
clear that it is a tiny selection of the cases that have come to my
attention. Often, however, families in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 495</div>overcrowded accommodation are not entitled by law to larger properties
because of the archaic definition of overcrowding currently on the
statute book.</div>
					<a name="080124103000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current standard dates back to 1935. It bears no relation to modern
living standards. It may have been appropriate in the inter-war years,
when we were clearing the slums in the east end&#151;those that were
left standing after the luftwaffe had played their games&#151;but
they are not the standard for
today.</div>
					<a name="080124103000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the existing definition of statutory overcrowding, infants under 12
months old are not counted as members of the household. Those under the
age of 10 count as only half a person. The definition includes living
rooms, and even kitchens, as acceptable places to sleep. Its definition
of acceptable bedroom sharing arrangements is not appropriate to 20th
century Britain.</div>
					<a name="080124103000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
31 would overhaul the current definition of overcrowding. It would
insert new wording into the Housing Act 1985 to ensure that bedrooms
and not merely &#147;rooms&#148; counted&#151;a bedroom standard
rather than a room standard. New clause 32 would bring in a new bedroom
standard, based on the statistical measure of overcrowding used in the
survey of English housing, and it has wide acceptance&#151;for
example among researchers&#151;as an appropriate gauge of
overcrowding.</div>
					<a name="080124103000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 33 would update the existing space standard by including all
children under the age of five as half a unit, and everyone over that
age as one unit. Youngsters take up space, as all lucky parents
realise, and a more generous bedroom standard that recognised their
presence would do much to assist young families juggling work and home
to make ends meet; and it would allow our young people more space at
home in those crucial early years.</div>
					<a name="080124103000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to give hope to
families that find themselves trapped in such circumstances. The high
cost of living and the high cost of housing mean that many families are
completely trapped. I hope that the Minister will be minded to
intervene, when appropriate and possible, to ensure that the size of
new build in areas of the greatest pressure meets the real needs of the
residents. To decode that, I mean that we need to build larger
properties in the developments currently planned in Lea valley and the
Thames Gateway, properties that are appropriate to the needs of the
communities that those areas should serve.</div>
					<a name="080124103000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
real social, economic and health cost to families living in overcrowded
conditions. I ask the Minister to recognise that, and to pledge
Government action to tackle it. Overcrowding is completely
unacceptable. I recognise that some local authorities have concerns
that the introduction of a bedroom standard might add further pressure
on social housing. I stated before, that pressure is already extreme in
Newham. However, overcrowded households&#151;even those that are
statutorily overcrowded&#151;are entitled only to reasonable
preference on the waiting list, not to extra priority ahead of others
who are in more immediate housing need. Nor will statutory overcrowding
be anything more than a relevant consideration in reaching a decision
on whether it is reasonable for an overcrowded household applying as
homeless under section 175 of the Housing Act 1996 to continue to
occupy its current accommodation.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>
					<a name="080124103000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">An updated
statutory definition will not overburden local authorities or create
unrealistic duties beyond those imposed by current legislation. I
therefore hope to hear something significant from the Minister on the
new clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000223"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:
						</b> I want to speak briefly
in support of the new clause. My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham
has given extensive and compelling reasons why further measures are
needed to prevent overcrowding and provide better space standards.
Clearly, the lack of affordable housing in some areas and the
weaknesses of licensing, which we have discussed, mean that households
will fall into overcrowding traps if they do not meet current
definitions or have the means to move to other accommodation.</div>
					<a name="080124103000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also stress to the
Minister that many of the new houses that are being built throughout
the country are very small, and families will grow out of them very
soon, so there is an urgent need to look at space standards. Like my
hon. Friend, therefore, I am very interested to hear what the Minister
will say about tackling those issues.</div>
					<a name="080124103000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080124103000224"></a>
							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): We
have listened with considerable sympathy to the arguments raised by the
hon. Member for West Ham, particularly about the problem of
ever-smaller places being built. I have heard her concerns about the
Thames Gateway echoed by local authorities, which find that one- and
two-bedroom apartments are flying off the shelves, but cannot get
bigger properties built. It is therefore perhaps time for a further
look at the issue, and we, like the hon. Lady, are very interested in
what the Minister has to say. We are certainly sympathetic to her
general
position.</div>
				
					<a name="080124103000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000225"></a>Margaret
Moran:
						</b> I, too, support the new clause. We have been
discussing the issue for many years. I have sat on several Committees
that have considered housing Bills, and I remember hon. Members
repeating the need for a modern definition of overcrowding. The current
definition dates back to the pre-war era, as my hon. Friend the Member
for West Ham has eloquently outlined, and it is not relevant to the
modern day.</div>
					<a name="080124103000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of
those living in my constituency, particularly among the south Asian and
Bangladeshi communities, have very large extended families, and they
face severe overcrowding. At my surgeries, I routinely see a trail of
people who live six to a one-bedroomed property, and that will happen
again tomorrow. It is not acceptable in this day and age to tell such
people that they have no hope of being rehoused, because their lives
are unutterably impossible. Those people&#146;s children live on the
streets, with all the consequences that we know that has in terms of
crime and antisocial behaviour. That is not the fault of those
children, who have nowhere to learn, live or play, and it is
intolerable that they should have to exist in such conditions in this
day and age. We need many more properties in Luton and we have a
desperate need for more three and four-bedroomed homes. Ever more one
and two-bedroomed properties are being built to meet commuters&#146;
needs, but families have no prospect whatever of
moving.</div>
					<a name="080124103000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">On many
occasions, I have raised the issue of why we do not ensure that RSLs
and councils can allow extensions to homes. If we lived in an
overcrowded home and could not afford to move, we would try to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div>get a loan to build a loft extension or to extend our home in some other
way, and I do not understand why we cannot allow people in desperate
circumstances to do the
same.</div>
					<a name="080124103000175"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div>
					<a name="080124103000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we will amend the overcrowding legislation very soon, but in
the interim, we should ensure that more funding is available to
councils and RSLs, so that they can take practical measures to relieve
at least the immediate misery of some of those families. We also need
to consider how to make the housing allocation system more flexible. It
is simply nuts that a family of six, living in one-bedroomed
accommodation but needing four or five bedrooms, cannot be allocated at
least a three-bedroomed home. Such families&#146; lives would be
improved immeasurably as a result of that greater flexibility, but the
bureaucratic systems do not allow it. Admittedly, the accommodation
would still be overcrowded, according to the local authority
definition, but for those whose accommodation is so overcrowded and
whose lives are intolerable, increased flexibility would at least allow
a slightly better quality of
life.</div>
					<a name="080124103000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080124103000226"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Andy Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush) (Lab):
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Luton,
South and other hon. Members. The problem of overcrowding dominates the
surgeries and work of a substantial minority of MPs,
particularly&#151;I suspect&#151;in London, the south-east and
inner-city areas generally. I can support the examples that have been
given today: five children in one-bedroomed flats and six children in
two-bedroomed flats are increasingly common, as my surgery case load
demonstrates. It has become the norm&#151;not just common&#151;for
two or three-children families to live in under-provisioned
accommodation that requires extra
bedrooms.</div>
					<a name="080124103000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">During my
short time in this House, I have taken part in several debates on the
subject, where I have heard from the increasingly significant minority
of hon. Members who have a large number of constituents experiencing
such hardship. It strikes me that were that level of deprivation and
lack of social provision the case in other public services, the problem
would have been addressed sooner.</div>
					<a name="080124103000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the past 10 years,
Government policy has failed to address the crisis in the provision of
low-cost housing of a sufficient size. In part, the Bill will address
that problem by setting out the Government&#146;s intention
substantially to increase housing supply, and affordable housing supply
in particular, in this country. The new clauses represent the other
side of the same coin, which is why I hope that the Minister will
welcome them. However, if the Minister cannot accept them today, will
he at least acknowledge the need to improve the living conditions of
families in overcrowded accommodation? The situation is intolerable,
and it must not be allowed to continue.</div>
					<a name="080124103000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The huge
disparity in the cost of market properties, particularly in London and
the south-east, whether rented or for sale, is one of the factors that
have led to the problem of overcrowding. The average price of a
property in Hammersmith and Fulham is &#163;453,000, and it is not
much less in the Ealing part of my constituency. According to the
National Housing Federation, an income 22 times the average is needed
to purchase such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div>a property, which means that there is no possibility, as there was just
20 years ago, of families on low or average incomes accessing property
in the private sector. We need a greater amount of subsidised housing,
which I believe the Government intend to provide. I strongly welcome
that, if it will help to improve the overcrowding
situation.</div>
					<a name="080124103000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham has said that the new clauses
are not designed to place infeasible and unrealistic burdens on local
authorities, it is absolutely right to send a signal to them that this
is a problem that they have the job of tackling. They have statutory
duties towards homeless people and homeless families, and they are
failing to deliver on those duties in some
cases.</div>
					<a name="080124103000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure is
to the Government&#146;s advantage, because it fulfils Government
policy. It may be to the disadvantage of some local authorities, and I
shall use the example of Hammersmith and Fulham council, which has
openly set out three ambitions in relation to the provision of
subsidised housing. The council&#146;s first ambition is to minimise
the amount of affordable social housing that is constructed, so that
the borough goes from a situation where more than 80 per cent. of the
housing built in the borough was social housing, as was the case under
the previous Labour council, to a position where the council has a
target of 40 per cent. overall, which is below the London planned
target. The council&#146;s second ambition is to reduce by three
quarters, from about 40 per cent. to about 10 per cent., the proportion
of housing that is social housing for rent and to dispose of as much
existing social housing as it can as quickly as possible by market
sale. Thirdly, the council aims to reduce the overall percentage of
social housing in the
authority.</div>
					<a name="080124103000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
ambitions run contrary to everything that the Government are trying to
do. Whether they run contrary to the Opposition&#146;s national
policy on housing, I do not know, because every time an Opposition
spokesman raises the issue, different words come out of their mouths.
We hear warm words about housing supply, but we hear very little on the
ground from many Conservative authorities. It is time to turn up the
pressure on local authorities that are not prepared to co-operate with
the Government&#146;s laudable aim on housing supply, and emphasising
the need for change to the overcrowding standard is part of that
process.</div>

							<b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): I rise briefly to congratulate the
hon. Member for West Ham on tabling the new clauses and to indicate my
support and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Montgomeryshire.</div>
					<a name="080124103000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many Members of Parliament are
aware from their casework&#151;I must say to the hon. Member for
Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush that the problem exists not
only in urban areas, but in rural areas, too&#151;that the existing
standards are often compromised. We often deal with casework in our
constituencies&#151;I certainly do in the west Cornwall and Isles of
Scilly parts of my constituency&#151;in which the existing standards
and regulations have frequently been flouted. The local authorities and
housing providers are well aware of that, and they do their best to
overcome the fact that there are many circumstances in which families
with children of both sexes are managing in properties with two or even
one bedroom.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div>
					<a name="080124103000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
speak with a certain amount of experience of overcrowding myself,
having been brought up in a family of eight children in a property with
only three bedrooms. I know from that personal experience that there
are limits to what one can do with bunk beds and so on, and I know the
other challenges that overcrowding presents to any family. That does
not mean that I have less sympathy for families living in similar
circumstances today. In fact, with the rising standards that we have
today, I have far greater sympathy for those who are experiencing
overcrowding now, because I have experienced it myself in the
past.</div>
					<a name="080124103000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister takes heed of the strong case made by the hon. Member for West
Ham and others. This is an area where it is important to send out a
clear message and, as the Minister will be well aware, that message
will need to be backed up with the appropriate resources, or with
enabling powers for local authorities and housing providers, to ensure
that we address the serious challenges that many people and families
face as they live in circumstances that we ourselves would not want to
live
in.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000228"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The debate has been important. I am under no
illusion as to the depth of feeling expressed not only by my hon.
Friends the Members for West Ham and for City of Durham, who have
pinned me to the ropes yet again in a most eloquent manner, but others
on both sides of the Committee and, indeed, of the House.</div>
					<a name="080124103000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have found
the debate interesting and illuminating, and I agree with much of what
has been said. I agree that the current definition of overcrowding has
remained unchanged for far too long. The current standards are
inappropriate, inaccessible and archaic, and we need to do something
about it. However, the Government have already committed to moving
towards an updated standard. Hon. Members will recall that when giving
evidence in December, and in a written ministerial statement to the
House on 12 December, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing
confirmed her commitment to amend the Housing Act 1985.</div>
					<a name="080124103000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was very taken by what was
said about the impact of overcrowding on children, which is an
important point. The Government are committed to addressing the matter
of children in bad housing. My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham, who
has made that point time and again, spoke most eloquently on the effect
that overcrowding can have on children.</div>
					<a name="080124103000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that one child in 10
lives in an overcrowded house, and I suspect that the figure is
slightly higher, if not substantially higher, in the West Ham
constituency. My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham has made us think
about the fact that overcrowding can have a real impact on health,
education and wider well-being&#151;it can leave small children with
no space for toys, which can affect their development. As someone who
is interested in education and how it can improve chances in life and
quality of life, I accept that overcrowding leaves children with no
place to do their homework, so their educational attainment
suffers.</div>
					<a name="080124103000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
deal with such matters. Children who have nowhere to play with friends
are more likely to underachieve at school, which might lead to their
being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div>forced out on the streets. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee
know that people are concerned, in both a positive and a negative way,
about gangs on the streets, and we need to do something about that.
Later, we will debate a related clause at some length, but there seems
to be a close statistical correlation between overcrowding and family
breakdown and domestic violence. I know that my hon. Friend the Member
for West Ham is doing an awful lot with regard to that important
point.</div>
					<a name="080124103000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;The
Children&#146;s Plan: Building Brighter Futures&#148; was published
last month, and it demonstrates strong cross-Government support for
tackling the issue of children in bad housing. As well as setting out
ongoing investment in decent homes and our ambitions for the supply of
new housing, the plan gives a clear commitment to updating the
statutory overcrowding standard proof. If necessary, the Government are
committed to changing those outdated and archaic
standards.</div>
					<a name="080124103000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members may be aware that the Government already have the power to
amend the definition of overcrowding through secondary legislation. We
have made a commitment to update the standard, which I absolutely
reaffirm. However, we do not need to put powers in the Bill, because it
can be done through secondary legislation.</div>
					<a name="080124103000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the long
term, we need to be able to affect the supply of housing. The Bill is
designed to achieve better standards and more houses. My right hon.
Friend the Minister for Housing has already announced our priority to
increase the overall supply of housing. Housing is sorely needed in
some parts of the country to tackle the overcrowding problem. We have
already announced the target of 240,000 additional homes a year
by 2016, with the delivery of 2 million homes by that date
and 3 million by 2020. In order to achieve that, we are
providing unprecedented amounts of
investment.</div>

							<a name="080124103000229"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> Will the homes be of the size that we need? It has
been reinforced time and again today, through anecdotes from both sides
of the Committee, that one and two-bedroomed properties are flying off
the shelves, because they are the quickest and easiest to build and
give the best profit margin to developers. We need three and
four-bedroomed, proper-sized houses built to Royal Institute of British
Architects standards, so that we can provide the right places for our
children to grow up. Is there any hope of ensuring that the homes are
of an appropriate
size?</div>
					<a name="080124103000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000230"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend has hit the nail
on the head. However, I want to get in my message about the
unprecedented amounts of investment going into housing&#151;I like
saying that&#151;before addressing her important point about needing
larger homes, not dog kennels. We are providing &#163;8.4 billion
across the regions over the next three years to invest in affordable
housing. That will initially be done through the Housing Corporation
and then through the Homes and Communities Agency. The investment is a
50 per cent. increase on previous comprehensive spending review
periods. We are increasing new affordable housing outputs to 70,000 by
2010-11, of which 45,000 will be for new social-rented homes, which is
50 per cent. more than in the current year.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div>
					<a name="080124103000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend the Member for West Ham has said many times, we need larger
properties, and housing developers need to ensure that family houses
are being built, because that is what people sorely need. Local
authorities working with the Housing Corporation and, in future, the
agency, and developers have an important role to play, through both the
planning system and their strategic housing role. My hon. Friend will
be aware of planning policy statement 3, &#147;Housing&#148;, which
was published in November 2006. It sets out the national planning
framework for delivering the Government&#146;s housing objectives. It
states that the</div>
					<a name="080124103000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;key
housing policy goal is to ensure that everyone has the opportunity of
living in a decent home, which they can afford, in a community where
they want to
live.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080124103000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crucially,
PPS3 asks for more support for family homes. It explicitly provides a
requirement that the housing needs of children be considered, and it
places an emphasis on family-friendly developments, including access to
gardens&#151;I know that my hon. Friend is concerned about density in
her area&#151;play areas, green spaces and parks, which should be
well-designed, safe, secure and stimulating.</div>
					<a name="080124103000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, planning policy
guidance 17, &#147;Planning for Open Space, Sport and
Recreation&#148;, states that such
facilities</div>
					<a name="080124103000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have a vital
role to play in promoting healthy living and...in the social
development of children of all ages through play, sporting activities
and interaction with
others.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080124103000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see from
the corner of my eye that my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham,
who is a champion of such matters, is itching to get up and speak, so I
shall give
way.</div>
					<a name="080124103000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000231"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:
						</b> I applaud PPS3, because it provides a way
forward for better space standards and for the balanced and sustainable
communities that we want to create. What checks will the
Minister&#146;s Department make on local authorities to ensure that
they are delivering the objectives of PPS3 when new developments are
planned?</div>
					<a name="080124103000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000232"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend has rightly highlighted our
dilemma. We hear accusations time and again that the new agency will be
a top-down mega-quango that will impose centrally driven targets, but
that is not the case. Local authorities have a responsibility on this
issue. PPS3 clearly states that local authorities should have
flexibility in deciding what sort of housing their areas need. I
imagine that the diversity of housing needs and challenges in the City
of Durham, to which I have been to speak at the symposium on affordable
housing, will be different from those in areas such as Poole. Local
authorities need to flex their elbows on that matter. There will be
local considerations, but I will keep a close eye on the matter to
ensure that family homes with surrounding play areas, which are so
important for children to grow and develop, are provided on new housing
schemes. I shall keep in close contact with my hon. Friend on
that.</div>
					<a name="080124103000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000233"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> I agree with everything that the Minister has
said, but at some point the Government will have to turn their mind to
what they are going to do about recalcitrant local authorities that are
not prepared to play ball. A local authority such as Hammersmith and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div>Fulham, which I have cited, that says, &#147;Where we had 240 homes
designated for affordable rent and shared ownership, 90 per cent. will
now be available only to people earning more than &#163;50,000 a
year,&#148; and which cynically describes those homes as
&#147;affordable&#148;, is not delivering what the Government
intend.</div>
					<a name="080124103000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000234"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I agree. When we debated part 1
of the Bill, we discussed how the Homes and Communities Agency will
suggest how local authorities can step up to the plate. All the
evidence and documentation that I have received about housing in London
seems to suggest that affordable housing and housing suitable for
families are Londoners&#146; No. 1 priority, and I think that that
issue will be key in London in the next five or six months. With the
greatest respect to the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield and his party,
the work that my side are doing resonates more with the public than
some of what local authorities are doing. Ultimately, we shall find out
about that in local
elections.</div>
					<a name="080124103000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000235"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I am pleased to hear the
Minister&#146;s comments about more flexibility for councils on such
matters. To pick up the comments made by some Labour Members on severe
overcrowding problems, would not scrapping the density targets be of
great assistance, so that instead of making one and two-bedroomed
houses the automatic choice, it would be the norm throughout the
country to have
variation?</div>
					<a name="080124103000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000236"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am grateful for that, because
it relates to another point that I touched on in an Adjournment debate
with my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham, which is that&#151;my
hon. Friend and I may disagree on this&#151;density in itself is not
necessarily the problem. We need very good planning, because planning,
design and quality are key factors. The point that I always make is
that the area of greatest housing density in London is apparently
Kensington and Chelsea. I know that my hon. Friend will say that that
cost a lot of money, and I understand that point, but it is important
that there should be well-designed areas for play, so that people do
not feel isolated and excluded, which is
vital.</div>
					<a name="080124103000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000237"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> As for the idea that Newham could somehow be
designed into becoming Kensington and
Chelsea&#151;</div>
					<a name="080124103000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000238"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Why
not?</div>
					<a name="080124103000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000239"></a>Lyn
Brown:
						</b> Because Newham is one of the 10 poorest areas in
the country, and it is poverty coupled with density that causes social
problems. Density is an issue where people cannot buy or provide for
themselves recreational space and quality of life. Including less dense
areas in areas of deprivation improves quality of life and enables
families to reach their full potential. I accept the points that have
been made about density, but having grown up in a council flat and
lived on a council estate&#151;a good one, which had space&#151;I
know that we can build areas that are appropriate for families.
However, there are too many places in my constituency that have too
great a density and that have many social problems not only because of
the overcrowding, but because there is no space and people do not have
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div>money to buy themselves out of that situation. We should not return to
the road of building high-rise blocks and thinking that they will
answer our social needs.</div>
					<a name="080124103000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080124103000240"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend has raised an important point. We
do not want to see the return of tower blocks. That demonstrates,
however, the importance of design and planning, which leads me to
reiterate this concern. In the context of place shaping, a
well-designed area with suitable facilities, open spaces and good
quality housing and other accommodation allows people to raise their
games. Alternatively, we all know that poorly designed and badly
planned estates can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 504</div>depress the spirits and be breeding grounds for crime, antisocial
behaviour and social exclusion. We need to make sure through the Homes
and Communities Agency and bodies such as the Commission for
Architecture and the Built Environment that planning, design and
quality are top of the
agenda.</div>

							<a name="080124103000241"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> Let us also recognise that
much of what we are talking about is attitudinal. I regret intervening
at this point, but we cannot expect legislation to solve all the
problems. In part, it is because of bad management that we end up with
bad
communities.</div>
