<P>
<H5>9.55 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish to draw the Committee's attention to a correction on the selection list. The lead amendment of the third group is now amendment No.  33, not amendment No. 63 as Tuesday's selection list stated.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. I fear that I misled the Committee by implying that the Secretary of State will take into account all the points raised by members of the Committee in the debate on Tuesday when revising the criteria that determine whether a company is a small company under section 247 of the Companies Act 1985. On reflection and having taken further advice, I wish to inform the Committee that that section of the Act is governed by a European Union directive and that our ability to amend section 247 is restricted by that directive. However, the power given to the Secretary of State under paragraph 5 of new schedule A1 would allow us to amend the eligibility criteria for a moratorium and, if we considered it appropriate to break the link with section 247, we could do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon):</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. Will the Minister want to make consequential amendments to the Bill as a result of what he has just announced?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs.  Michie. No, the Minister will not want to make consequential amendments to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page (South-West Hertfordshire):</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. As the Minister has pointed out one or two misdemeanours in our proceedings, I wish to ask whether the notes from the Department to the Chairman should have been delivered to members of the Committee before the start of our sittings, or is it all right for them to appear a day after the Committee began its proceedings? The notes are devised to help the Committee to understand the purport of the Government's amendments, but to receive them on the Wednesday is a little late.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman probably knows that that is not a point of order. The Minister has responsibility for the circulation of documents and I am sure that he heard the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs.  Michie. If the delay has caused the hon. Gentleman inconvenience, I apologise unequivocally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I accept the Minister's generous response.

<P>
``. Where the directors of an eligible company have announced their intention to make a proposal for a voluntary arrangement, no bank which is a creditor of the company may take any legal action against the assets of the company nor make a demand for the repayment of any loan unless and until there is a failure to make an arrangement''.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Page:</B> I welcome you to the Committee, Mrs. Michie. I assure you that the little disagreement that you have just heard take place is unusual for the Committee. Our first day passed, if not in sweetness and light, at least in general agreement about the purpose of the Bill. We all want it to succeed and to work well in practice. However, several shortcomings will be exposed when the Bill is implemented.
<P>
I was approaching the end of my remarks about a clutch of amendments when the time beat us at 1 o'clock on Tuesday. The amendments fall into two sets. The first set was tabled to highlight the possible downside if the moratoriums do not work; I have been through the problems that could occur. I response to the remarks made by hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), I pointed out that my aim in my observations was to suggest what might happen if the moratoriums failed and creditors did not receive the moneys that they would have received if a receiver had been brought in a lot earlier. The Minister said that what I had described was unlikely to happen because shareholders, owners and managers would want the moratoriums to succeed. However, I am not sure that that will always be the case.
<P>
Companies may reach that rocky point in their existence by several routes. Companies that were once profitable may be unable to continue trading for structural reasons&#151;because something has occurred to change the ground rules. For example, a small grocery that has been running profitably for years, enabling its owners to pay the bills and keep their family, may suffer from the impact of a new supermarket being built in the town. The owners may wonder whether the problem is temporary and whether they can trade through it until their customers come back to their shop, in which case they would be strongly tempted to ask for a moratorium to allow things to be reassessed after trading patterns settled down. They would want the moratorium to succeed because their business has a successful history, and they would want that to continue after they have overcome the commercial pressures put on them by the supermarket.
<P>
On the other hand, there are companies that, for years, bounce along their overdraft limit until, eventually, the owners write a cheque too far, whereupon the bank manager says ``Enough's enough'' and takes the appropriate action. The owners may apply for a moratorium on the grounds that their business has been going for years and that the difficulty is only temporary. What would happen, however, if the owners realised during the company's moratorium period that they had no chance of trading out of their problems? Would they not be strongly inclined to acquire some of the assets at preferential rates&#151;possibly a rate of zero? It is difficult to estimate value inside a company because some stock and assets may be written down to well below their value. The problem of walking assets has been a nightmare for receivers and liquidators over the years. To put the matter bluntly, some unscrupulous directors or managers of companies may try to use the moratorium to get what they can out of the company, while they have the time and opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Austin Mitchell </B>(Great Grimsby): The hon. Gentleman's speech is typical of him. When he agrees with me his speeches are eloquent and true and make a lot of sense; now, however, he is wandering all over the course, in the other direction. Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the amendment prejudges the issue? Companies must be given breathing space and should not be prejudged. The controls within the system are adequate to stop the fraud and transfer of assets to which he refers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am sorry to tell the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)&#151;by the way, is there a Little Grimsby?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Yes, 20 miles away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman's position is constant. He thinks that the banks and liquidators are completely wrong and that the small business man is completely right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I do not put it as crudely as that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I happen to think that life is a little more balanced and that there may circumstances in which the banks and creditors are right and the small business man is wrong. In my humble, stumbling fashion, I am trying to tell the Minister&#151;who has been making some of the shortest speeches of his life during our proceedings&#151;that we should not close our eyes to the potential pitfalls and dangers in the operation and implementation of moratoriums simply because we want moratoriums to work. I hope, too, to send a warning out from the Committee to the people involved that there may be restrictions on lending if creditors get less than they would otherwise have done and small businesses that are given moratoriums fail in excessively high numbers. I am merely trying to bring some balance to the argument, rather than charging in on one side and seeing everything in black and white.
<P>
Some of the bodies involved believe that, if the Bill is enacted in its existing form, it will adversely and dramatically affect the rights of debenture holders&#151;principally the clearing banks. Lending decisions based on full and enforceable security will be destroyed retrospectively. Removing the right of a debenture holder to appoint an administrative receiver during the moratorium and to crystallise that floating charge is to rewrite a bargain that has been freely entered into. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby will tell us that the banks often want belt, braces and the borrower's house put on the line before they give a loan, and that the words ``freely entered into'' should be altered to reflect the fact that the borrower has little alternative but to enter into that transaction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Coercion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I would not use a word as strong as that, as the borrower has the alternative of not entering into the loan. Every small business man or woman should be able to judge whether the company started or supported by the loan will fail; if they are unable to make that judgment, they are the wrong sort of people to be running a business. When they start their business, small business men and women tend to take considerable care in calculating how their business plan will work. I recommend that such people ask a local business link or chamber of commerce to examine a loan of the size that we are considering. However, I must not go down that path, or I shall start to talk about the structure of making calculations, drafting business plans, profit forecasting and marketing for small businesses, and interesting though such matters are to me, they do not relate to the amendment.
<P>
It might be argued that the change unnecessarily affords protection to a company even after it has traded out of its difficulties and exited the moratorium successfully, to which we would all say amen. It would be rather bizarre if, many years later, a successful and valuable company were entitled to avoid a security that was&#151;arguably&#151;freely and justifiably given. To allow that might create an unjustifiable and unnecessary statutory intervention in the marketplace.
<P>
What will happen if moratoriums fail to any great extent, resulting in lower returns to debenture holders and those famous walking assets that we discussed on Tuesday? Perhaps your eye, Mrs. Michie, will be caught in a moment for another expansion on that aspect&#151;I leave it to you to decide. If debenture holders know that security can be rendered unenforceable for up to three months, and if moratoriums fail in significant numbers, they will immediately adjust their lending criteria downward. They will not lend the same proportion of the lending value of a company's assets as they would have without that three-month risk. That will seriously affect funding for new businesses.
<P>
One of the tasks of the nominee, the person who decides whether a moratorium should be granted, will be to decide the amount of funding that will be available for the company to trade in that period. All of us should consider that, because there is no point in granting moratoriums if no funding is available to run the business during the moratorium period. As we have all said, the moratorium is the main plank of the rescue culture. If a company is to continue trading during a moratorium, it must have funding, but no bank debenture holder will continue an overdraft facility if the right to appoint an administrative receiver and crystallise that floating charge is removed. The bank will cancel the overdraft immediately, and the moratorium will fail. I want the Committee to be certain how people on the other side of the coin will view the decisions that it makes and the legislation that results.
<P>
I did not speak in great detail to amendment No. 15, because its provisions appeared an amendment tabled in another place by my colleague, Baroness Buscombe, on 4 April, and because Government amendment No. 40 addresses the problem in question. I would not have tabled amendment No. 15 had I known that Government amendment No. 40 would be tabled. Nevertheless, it should be noted that it took the Government seven months to produce their own provision. It is right and sensible that the amendments will prevent a landlord from re-entering premises when a moratorium is in force. The provisions as originally drafted prevented all creditors, even secure ones, from enforcing their rights, except landlords, who had a right peacefully to enter their premises in the event of a failure to pay rent or a breach of a condition of a tenancy. I am delighted that the Government have proposed such an important improvement.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have said several times that the act of the moratorium may fail or perform badly. However, I was disappointed that the Minister did not respond to amendment No. 19, which we believe to be most important. If a moratorium is to succeed, as we would all want, it is essential that the company in difficulties is assisted by the Bill's other provisions. I hope that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby realises that I am trying to make a balanced argument, so that I cannot be accused of trying to destroy the Bill's essential aim. Paragraph 14 of new schedule A1 undermines the prospect of a company being rescued by a moratorium while offering creditors an unnecessary and excessive degree of protection.
<P>
The problem of getting funding while a moratorium is in force will, more than any other factor, kill the chance of more moratoriums being started. Almost inevitably, a company under a moratorium will need to locate a source of finance if it is to survive; that is vital and I see no point in having a moratorium without it. Under the Companies Act 1985, the courts learned to scrutinise the source of a company's credit and whether it had sufficient funding to continue trading under the statutory protection afforded by the administration order. The principle is exactly the same under moratorium arrangements. It has been recognised in the Bill that on-going funding will be essential.
<P>
Against that background, paragraph 14 would deprive the company of the ability to grant good security; that will make life difficult. From my business experience I can tell the Committee that I have seen exactly how that can happen, and I declare all sorts of knowledge and interests. I know of a business that wanted to carry out a profitable development that would put it into loss for the period of the development. It told the bank what was going to happen and the bank said, ``Fine.'' The change was to take about five months and included a lot of rebuilding. Two weeks before the end of the project, the bank manager lost his nerve and said, ``I think we'd better have someone run a rule over the company.'' Coopers & Lybrand did so and, bearing in mind that the company was profitable, concluded that the changes that it had introduced should enable it to break even, but that if Coopers & Lybrand was asked to give advice and management guidance, the company would make a profit of one unit. Fortunately, the company had considerable assets and it was able to go to another lender. Within a year, it was not only breaking even, but making three to four times the profit that Coopers & Lybrand had calculated it would make if had been asked to give its valuable managerial advice. If the company had not had substantial assets, it would have been squeezed and landed in serious trouble.
<P>
Companies must be given every opportunity to obtain funding while a moratorium takes place. One part of the Bill should not act in detriment to another.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Michie. I have had the privilege of serving under your chairmanship before and it is a pleasure to do so again.
<P>
Earlier, I asked whether the Minister, in the light of his point of order, wanted to make consequential amendments to the Bill. I refer him to paragraph 3(2) of proposed new schedule A1 to the Insolvency Act 1986, which mentions section 247(3) of the Companies Act 1985. That section sets out the tests of which two must be passed for eligibility. In our first sitting, we remarked on paragraph 5, which could be classed as a sweeping-up amendment to other legislation. The European Union restricts the power to amend section 247(3) of the 1985 Act, so is the Minister satisfied that the provisions will not be fettered?
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) finished by talking about paragraph 14. It might reflect my limited experience of such matters to say that the paragraph appears to remove a great deal of the Bill's flexibility and the good that it could do. In difficult times, a company often has the possibility of refinancing; a moratorium surely offers one such time. Paragraph 14 is, to say the least, restrictive, and I hope that the Minister will reconsider.
<P>
I should like to say a few words about floating charges and walking assets. At our first sitting, I made the rather too sweeping comment that banks would have significant notice of a moratorium before it happened. That is not entirely correct, but it is true to say that moneylenders are generally bound to be aware that something is seriously wrong with the company, before a moratorium.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I do not want to disagree with the hon. Gentleman, but it amazes me how hands-off banks are in monitoring their loans. I am also amazed by how companies borrow money all round, do not pay bills and leave the banks alone until, suddenly, everything implodes and a bank discovers that not only its loan, but many others, are in trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman, as that is exactly my point. Moneylenders&#151;especially holders of floating charges&#151;will not necessarily know of a moratorium when it happens.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman realises that the point of the legislation is that there must be agreement between creditors and shareholders before a moratorium can be established. It will not happen without such an agreement, so the banks will know about a moratorium.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful for that point. Is the Minister saying that, if the moneylender is aware of a moratorium before it takes place, he can crystallise his floating charge? I shall be happy to give way to him if he intends to answer that question.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have tried to explain on several occasions that when a moratorium is agreed, the rules change, whereas prior to its being agreed, the status quo continues. It is a simple as that. Every option that is currently open to a bank or lender will remain open to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> All right. The point is taken and I hope that the Minister does not try to change it in the light of any notes that come his way. The problem is that holders of floating charges being unable to crystallise their loans will provide a disincentive to lend. I hope that my arguments will persuade the hon. Member for Great Grimsby that it is essential to very small businesses that moneylenders are able to lend on floating charges. Very small businesses often have no assets and someone who incorporates often has no assets to mortgage or charge, so he or she can only form a company and give a floating charge to a bank. If the bank crystallises the debt, that gives it a charge over the debts owing to the company. We do not want to discourage the granting of finance to people who have good ideas but no assets, if a bank is prepared to back them&#151;I know that it happens rarely these days&#151;because it believes that the people and their ideas have a future.
<P>
The Minister said, rightly, that creditors will invariably have notice of a moratorium because they must agree to it. If members of a company want a moratorium and creditors disagree, the members have a right to go to the courts. The point made by the Minister, unless he corrects me, probably answers my reservations to the extent that time will expire between the creditor knowing about a moratorium and the moratorium taking place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I suggest that the hon. Gentleman should not be so keen to back off from that point. Does he believe that there will be a change in culture? Business men and women who owe money will not go to the bank to say that they have financial difficulties; instead, they will try to set up the mechanism of a moratorium because, when things start to go wrong, it will be in the bank's interest to put in a liquidator or receiver as soon as possible&#151;perhaps to pre-empt the establishment of a moratorium. Removal of a company's funding is damaging and makes survival harder, even if a moratorium is established a few days later.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point; in fact, it adds greater cogency to his arguments in respect of paragraph 14.
<P>
I have a final question, prompted by the zeal of caution. Have the Government considered requiring proposed nominees at least to consult holders of floating charges before their appointments are accepted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mrs. Michie. I want to resume the debate at the point at which we left it on Tuesday. I have listened to the speeches from the Opposition spokesmen, and I deplore the tendency to blow hot and cold on the subject of the banks. Banks are the villains of the piece, but both Opposition Members have to some extent argued in their favour, claiming that we might frighten them off making floating charges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman not understand that we are trying to make matters better for business men?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I understand that. It is the reason that we must adopt a consistent attitude towards the banks, which are the villains of the piece in most cases of foreclosure and liquidation. As the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, in many cases, the manager who agreed a loan is moved to another branch or gets cold feet; a new manager takes over, or a new policy is enunciated from the centre, and suddenly all loans are up for review. Such unpredictability and inconsistency is the fault of the banks and businesses cannot cope with it. The Bill should restrict the power of banks, not only because they are the villains, but because they will continue to be the most powerful force, regardless of what arrangements are made. They are the dominant lenders and they have the muscle to employ accountants to recall loans&#151;be they insolvency proceedings or voluntary arrangements, banks will dominate the processes because they are the biggest lenders.
<P>
It is a simple matter of logic that we should redress the balance against the banks and in favour of small businesses, which is why I argued for extending the period of the voluntary arrangement. Given the power of the banks, it is impossible to deal with such matters in 28 days, especially in a small town where one needs to shop around for alternative sources of finance. I could not arrange a mortgage in 28 days, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland could not arrange one in 128 days, so how can we expect a business to save itself in such a short time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Liberal Democrats have considerable sympathy with that suggestion, but every aspect of the Bill must be considered on its merits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Of course, but that is nit-picking and no reason to prevaricate and jump from one side of the argument to the other. The basic principle is clear and we should assert it. I hope that we can discuss again the period of the voluntary arrangement on Report.
<P>
In conclusion, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister's reply will take into account my proposal&#151;new clause 6&#151;which the Opposition should have supported, given the nature of the private Member's Bill that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire introduced. His knowledge of the way in which banks deal with such affairs is considerable, so he should realise that new clause 6 would control the power of the banks from the moment of the announcement. It would prevent the banks from acting against the company at the point at which the announcement is made. It would apply, not while the arrangement was in progress&#151;my hon. Friend the Minister has said that the banks would be precluded from acting during that period&#151;but during the run-up to it, when everything is uncertain. That is when I want to restrain their power.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The Government see no good reason why a floating charge holder&#151;often a bank&#151;should be exempted from the general stay. Our purpose in legislating for the option of a moratorium in the company voluntary arrangement procedure is to provide a short respite to allow the directors of a company to put a rescue plan to the company and its creditors, free from the immediate threat of individual creditor action. If such a plan can be agreed, that will be good news all round&#151;not only for creditors, but for employees, shareholders, directors and the wider economy. To allow an administrative receiver to be appointed, or a floating charge to crystallise, during the moratorium period would be counterproductive. There would be no point in doing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White (Milton Keynes, North-East):</B> There have been cases in the past in which banks and other creditors have agreed with small businesses a way forward, which Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue have resisted because they have preferred charges. Would Customs and Excise, through its VAT section, still be able stop a moratorium happening in the circumstances to which the Minister is referring, even if the banks&#151;for once&#151;agreed to it?

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No. As I understand it&#151;and I ought to understand it, as I am the Minister responsible for it; I wonder whether that is a truism&#151;no one would be able to intervene in the 28-day period of the moratorium. Applications can be made during that period to end the moratorium, but there is no automatic right to end it. The moratorium offers the directors a breathing space in which to put a rescue plan to the creditors and shareholders. At the meetings of the creditors and shareholders, they decide&#151;this point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby&#151;whether to approve the rescue plan as part of the proposed voluntary arrangement.
<P>
I turn to the point raised by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. I am satisfied that if we wanted, we could use the power in paragraph 5 of new schedule A1 to break the link with section 247 of the Companies Act 1985. However, we see no need to do that at present. I hope that that makes the issue clear, because I know that the hon. Gentleman was concerned about that point.
<P>
I turn now to some of the substantive points raised by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. I thank him for giving us the benefit of his experience. His story about the company that saved itself from the fate that might have befallen it had it paid a very hefty fee to a company of auditors and receivers is a salutary one. It ought to give us a great deal of strength and resolve in pushing through this legislation.
<P>
The nominee has to state that, in his opinion, a voluntary arrangement has a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented. We debated that issue at some length on Tuesday. Therefore, if success does not seem likely to the nominee, he will not give the statement and no moratorium will result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I understand that perfectly. However, the part that worries me is the race to the line. This was also mentioned by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, who is currently supporting me: he does not always support me, but on this matter we have an alliance&#151;not a casual affair, but an alliance.
<P>
The process can take the form of a race to the line. We must consider what happens when a bank learns of a company's difficulties and rushes in quickly. Some banks will say, ``Here's a week's notice and oh, by the way, we're going to send in a receiver.'' It happens immediately&#151;I know of companies that have gone to the bank to discuss their problems and have been visited by the receiver on the same afternoon. Can a moratorium be established even though a bank has already appointed a receiver?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> A moratorium would be difficult in those circumstances. The hon. Gentleman is right to speak about a race to the line, which is what such scenarios often resemble. If a rescue does not have a reasonable prospect of succeeding and another solution, such as liquidation, is posited, it cannot be expected that everything will be saved. It is as simple as that&#151;it is a fact of life, albeit a harsh one. Moratoriums can be used where possible, but that will almost certainly not be the case if the funding streams are not available.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire seemed to suggest that assets could be spirited away. I was fascinated by his example of a of a shop proprietor&#151;this must have happened 1,000 times in this country&#151;seeing a supermarket open in his area and thinking, ``What do I do? Do I cut and run now? Do I try to rescue what I can?'' Such matters are obviously serious. However, if directors intended to spirit assets away, why would they first try to obtain a moratorium, which would ensure that their activities were monitored by the nominee? After all, that is the point of the moratoriums. The directors would be subject to a range of offences if they spirited away assets during the moratorium. If that is what they want to do, they should do it outside a moratorium and not inside one, where it will be much more difficult. I should already have said that no moratorium is possible if an administrative receiver is already in office. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, that can happen very quickly.
<P>
Before a company can obtain a moratorium, the nominee must be satisfied that it will have funding. If the bank has been antagonised, the nominee will have to take that into account in trying to decide whether the company is likely to stand any chance of success, even when a charge has not been crystallised. We see no good reason why the floating charge holder, which will often be a bank, should be exempted from the general stay. It is strange to imagine that a voluntary agreement procedure occurs in a vacuum. It does not. In most cases, nominees will need to talk to companies' bankers before and during the moratorium. That will almost certainly affect their attitude to rescue plans. The banks' interests will be taken into account by the nominee, and even if they are not, there is nothing to stop a bank making its views known to the nominee and challenging his actions or decisions. As I said, the process is not artificial or divorced from reality.
<P>
The amendments would defeat the purpose of the Bill and I hope that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire will not press them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I started by saying that there are amendments in this world that are not intended to see the light of day, but that are designed only to probe and to ensure that the Minister fleshes out the Bill's aims. These are such amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but that its Directors remain in control of the company and of its business during the moratorium.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 20, in page 16, line 31, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4) A disposal of the company's property to any person other than a person who is connected with the company shall not be avoided only on the ground that sub-paragraph 18(1) was not satisfied.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 21, in page 16, line 35, leave out sub-paragraph (a).
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Before I speak to amendment No. 32, I have a small piece of good news for the Minister: I do not propose to speak to amendments Nos. 20 or 21, because the introduction of new paragraph 15 has made them redundant; if I had known about that I would not have tabled them. I appreciate the insertion of the paragraph, because it deals with the concerns expressed by my noble Friends in another place.
<P>
Amendment No. 32 tries to crystallise a matter that is implied, but not spelled out, in the Bill. It is possible that the point would be better dealt with in another part of the Bill&#151;if the Minister says that my amendment is in the wrong place, I shall immediately roll over and agree with him, provided that he suggests another place where it might more correctly and effectively be made.
<P>
When a receivership takes place, the receiver goes in and runs the company; he has a number of clearly defined functions and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the company, such as paying the bills, buying the stock&#151;but what does the nominee do? Apparently, he has three main functions. First, he has to judge whether the moratorium has a reasonable chance of being successful. We had a long debate in the previous sitting about the height of the hurdle that the term ``reasonable'' would erect. One Labour Member thought that it would lower the hurdle, while the Minister thought that it would raise it.
<P>
Secondly, having satisfied himself that there is a reasonable chance of success, the nominee has to monitor the company's activity. It is not clear whether he has the say-so in respect of the running of the company; apparently he merely monitors it. Thirdly, he has to ensure that there is enough money to run the company. Although it is implied throughout the Bill, the amendment makes it clear that the directors remain in control of the company and of its business during the moratorium. It would be immensely helpful if the Minister would flesh out the role of the nominee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for not speaking to amendments Nos. 20 and 21. We want to address the matters raised by the Opposition in the other place. I will not have to censure the hon. Gentleman, because the amendment, as corrected, now appears in the right place. It would require every invoice, order for goods or business letter issued during a moratorium by or on behalf of the company and on which the company's name appears to state that the directors remain in control during that period. That seems to be an unnecessary requirement. We should remember that, under the moratorium, the company will remain under the control of the directors. There will be no change in that respect, as the nominee will not assume control of either the company or its business. What will have changed is that there will be a moratorium and a nominee in office. However, paragraph 16 provides for that to be disclosed on the company's paperwork, and no more is required to ensure that those who are dealing with the company are aware of what is going on. That is clear and simple, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Although I am disappointed that the Minister cannot bring himself to accept the amendment&#151;it may be placed elsewhere but it has not been accepted&#151;he has fleshed out the matter. That is useful to the nominees who will use the legislation and to the directors who will use the moratorium to try and trade their company back to profitability. In view of his explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The amendment is similar to one considered in the other place. I am tabling it in the hope that the Government have a change of heart&#151;I know that that is unlikely, but one can always hope.
<P>
As was explained in the Lords, nominees should be able to apply to the court for directions in respect of any matter arising in connection with the performance of their functions. That jurisdiction has always been given to office holders in positions similar to that of nominees. Baroness Buscombe put the case succinctly in the Committee that considered the Bill in the other place and I see no reason to go over the same ground. A nominee should have the protection that is afforded by being able to apply to the courts. I understand why Lord McIntosh rejected the amendment: he said that nominees should not be able to run to the protection of the court, but there will be times when a nominee will require that protection, and I do not see why he should not have the opportunity to apply for it. I accept that it should not be carte blanche protection, so that a nominee can automatically obtain some form of court protection in respect of the granting of a moratorium, as that would make a mockery of the whole issue. However, there should be a system to provide court protection for a nominee who requires it. That is the substance of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The amendments concern the status, independence and accountability of the nominee. The Government are creating a state monopoly and a new role for a new sort of professional&#151;one more concerned with rescue than with liquidation. Insolvency practitioners may have changed their name to R3&#151;the Association of Business Recovery Professionals&#151;to give the impression that they are rescue experts, but the interests of the insolvency profession will always lie in insolvency and liquidation, because that is where their fees come from. All too often, it is in their interest to prolong the process to accumulate ever higher fees. For some years, I have been writing to the Minister's predecessors about the case of Mrs. Josephina Askew of Lincoln. That poor lady was charged a total of &#163;120,000 in fees to settle a debt of &#163;4,500. She lost her business and her house because it was in the interest of the practitioner to prolong the festering accumulation of fees.
<P>
The nominee will have a new role to revive companies, give them a chance of survival and help them to battle through. I would like to stack the odds in favour of survival rather than liquidation, and my amendments are a somewhat inadequate attempt to do that. We are creating a new role, but there is not much in the Bill about the accountability of nominees to the public, or to the companies and business people involved. We want both to facilitate rescues and to curb practitioner greed, which is the curse of the existing system. For example, the Bill requires the nominee to estimate the cost of the moratorium, but the assumptions on which those estimates are based must be communicated to the stakeholders and the process must be as open as possible.
<P>
Amendment No. 63 specifies failings on the part of the nominee that would put an end to his role. If he is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>no longer independent of the company,
<P>
</UL></FONT>he must cease to act as nominee. That problem can arise, so we must safeguard against it. Some years ago, I was engaged in correspondence about Corporate Communications plc. The matter is dealt with at some length in the little pamphlet ``Insolvent Abuse'' which my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) and I compiled for the Association for Accountancy and Business Affairs. I recommend it to the Committee. Hon. Members should rush out to buy a copy, although it might make the Minister's job a lot more difficult, as a lot more amendments might be tabled. It contains dramatic revelations about the abuses of the profession and it reveals the dangers that can arise if the nominee, whose powers my amendments would restrict, is in collusion with the business people concerned.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The directors of Corporate Communications plc decided to place the company in receivership around midnight. By the early hours of the following morning, all the assets of the company had been sold off at knock-down prices. For nearly a month before, the company and the receivers&#151;Coopers and Lybrand, incidentally&#151;had been involved in a series of meetings at which the details of the new arrangements were worked out. The company's major creditors were deprived of the assets, which were shunted into a new business. We must not allow moratoriums to be used as personal enrichment devices for either the insolvency industry or the directors of failed companies. The purpose of amendment No. 63, which states conditions in which the nominee's role should end, is to provide necessary checks.
<P>
Amendment No. 70 is more complicated. None of us has any reason to be happy with the regulation of insolvency practitioners by the recognised supervisory bodies. There are eight recognised supervisors, including the Department of Trade and Industry. The situation is already chaotic, so I am horrified to learn that the proposed reform is to create another supervisory body, bringing the number to nine. It will be an overarching body, but it will not have the powers to deal with the abuses of the profession. People maltreated by insolvency practitioners or by nominees need to be able to contest fees and complain about the malpractice. An ombudsman is needed. Most professional groups have an ombudsman to regulate their activities. Insolvency practitioners decline to have one, but one should be imposed. We cannot impose one directly through the Bill, so amendment No. 70 is designed to give the DTI responsibility for redressing the failures of the insolvency bodies. Giving the DTI that role would provide a court of appeal and some redress for stakeholders who did not like what was happening under the arrangement. Amendment No. 64 is much simpler and straightforward. It would allow an application to be made by any member of a company or any other person affected by the moratorium.
<P>
The whole tenor of the group of amendments is, in brief&#151;I see the Government Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope), nodding enthusiastically&#151;to provide some regulation of that new group of people and to orientate them toward rescue, rather than the fee-charging, asset-looting vulture culture of the rest of the insolvency practitioners. Nominees will start as insolvency practitioners, as that is where the body of expertise is located, but they need to develop as company rescuers, distinct from the fee-accumulating depredations of the main body of the profession.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I want to say a few words about fees and an ancillary matter. Three years ago, the hon. Member for Great Grimsby had an Adjournment debate on the same issue, was shortly followed by another Adjournment debate on a broadly similar matter&#151;the fees of insolvency practitioners&#151;introduced by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and the Weald (Miss Widdecombe). I attended and contributed to both debates.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will deal with the important issues that have been raised. There must be a mechanism to allow the fees of insolvency practitioners&#151;and, for that matter, nominees&#151;to be challenged. They cannot have carte blanche to charge whatever they like, because that would not be in the interests either of business or of an entrepreneurial economy. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby touched on an important point when he dealt with the duty of insolvency practitioners to obtain at least a reasonable price for the assets that they sell. I sincerely hope that the Minister will address both those points and explain what the Government intend to do to overcome those real market difficulties.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> First, I shall address amendment No. 33, tabled by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. It is unnecessary to provide the nominee with the power to apply to the court for directions. The nature of the nominee's role makes such an application inappropriate. Commercial and administrative decisions are for the nominee, not for the court. Directors remain in charge of company assets; the nominee does not have control of them. The court should not be used to provide nominees with a means of avoiding decisions that are rightly for him to take, or to gain the court's endorsement for an intended course of action. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire will be pleased to know that that view was recently expressed by Mr. Justice Neuberger in a case involving T&D Industries plc, and in another case involving a company that was the subject of an administration order. We take comfort from Mr. Justice Neuberger's comments. I hope that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire does, too, and withdraws his amendment.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby makes a gentle plea, pulling his punches, to sort out the problem of practitioner greed, but the amendment is unnecessary within the context of the Bill. It would add three further circumstances in which a nominee must withdraw his consent to act during a moratorium&#151;when
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>he is no longer independent of the company directors and its creditors; he has been disqualified by the courts; or he has been the subject of an adverse finding by a disciplinary hearing of a recognised supervisory body.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Incidentally, I have so far been able to identify only seven supervisory bodies, whereas my hon. Friend said that there were eight.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Including the DTI.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Ah, right. We are so humble that we did not think of ourselves as belonging in the same company as the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, for example.
<P>
When a nominee has been disqualified by the courts under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, nothing more is needed. Among other things, clause 5 provides that a person against whom a disqualification order is made or against whom a disqualification order undertaking is accepted under the Act is banned absolutely from acting as either a nominee or a supervisor. If my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby needs more detail, I shall try to provide it, but I do not think that more is necessary and I urge him to not to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope (Christchurch):</B> The hon. Member for Great Grimsby, perhaps with tongue in cheek, made some appallingly defamatory remarks about this country's insolvency profession, of which we should be proud. Our insolvency profession has an international reputation for expertise and its success is apparent in, for example, the scenario involving Canary Wharf. Will the Minister take the opportunity to reject his hon. Friend's wholly unjustified and unwarranted remarks?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Yes, I certainly reject any generic criticism. We Welsh often suffer from the same thing&#151;we are different creatures, and there are 3 million of us. A great deal of valuable work is done by insolvency practitioners. On the other hand, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that no profession is perfect and that abuses that have to be dealt with have been clearly identified.
<P>
In respect of amendment No. 70, it would be inappropriate to give the Secretary of State responsibility for intervening in the progress of a company's moratorium on the application of a creditor&#151;such matters are clearly not for the Secretary of State. Such an intervention is properly a matter for the courts, and accordingly paragraph 26 of new schedule A1 provides that ``any creditor, director'' or shareholder
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of the company, or any other person affected by a moratorium...may apply to the court
<P>
</UL></FONT>if he is dissatisfied about any act, omission or decision of the nominee during the moratorium. I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby not to press the amendment.
<P>
Both my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon raised important points about fees. The current procedure under the company voluntary arrangements&#151;rule 1 of the Insolvency Rules 1986&#151;requires the voluntary arrangement proposal to state what it is proposed should be paid to the nominee by way of remuneration and expenses. We shall adopt a similar rule for moratorium cases; in addition, before the moratorium can be extended, the meeting will have to approve the additional expected costs of monitoring the company. I hope that that is clear enough and I ask my hon. Friend not to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> May I ask again my question about a duty of care to be imposed on a nominee or an insolvency practitioner&#151;I know that we are not discussing that subject at present&#151;to obtain at least a reasonable price for assets dealt in and sold?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> A mechanism exists for challenging fees. In most forms of insolvency it is for the creditors to fix the remuneration of the office holder, and it is in the creditors' interest to ensure that they receive value for money. I fully expect that to happen in the circumstances that we are considering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I think I might be hearing further from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No. I have sat down.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Perhaps the Minister will address the proposal mentioned by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby: that a duty of care should be imposed on nominees to obtain at least a reasonable price for assets sold. We hope that the Department of Trade and Industry is discussing the broader picture.
<P>
Admittedly, my next point relates not to moratoriums, but to insolvency procedures generally. I know of instances in which the moneylender has gone in and assets have been almost given away&#151;by an odd coincidence, to customers of the moneylender in question. That is a real abuse and it behoves the Department of Trade and Industry to tackle those problems, which I hope that the Minister will do.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman has just made another speech, rather than an intervention. It is important to understand that the nominee does not realise the assets. An office holder will do what he or she can to maximise the realisation of assets. However, it must be appreciated that the assets may not always be readily realisable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I rise to defend myself and to tell the Committee of the value of the little pamphlet, ``Insolvent Abuse: Regulating the Insolvency Industry'', to which I referred earlier. It lists the regulators and shows that chartered accountants in England and Wales regulate 784 practitioners; insolvency practitioner associations 330; the Law Society of England and Wales 196; the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland 156; the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants 155; the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, 68; the Law Society of Scotland 20, and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry 125. It is ludicrous that 1,834 insolvency practitioners are regulated by eight bodies.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister accuses me of trying to re-regulate the profession, but it is the responsibility of Government to regulate the profession by having a genuinely independent regulator, as we promised in our business manifesto. If there is no effective regulation, amendments to the Bill must be tabled to protect the creditors and the businesses involved.
<P>
The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) accuses me of making defamatory attacks on the profession and I plead guilty to the accusation. He may rise to defend it. I do not want to make the sweeping accusation that the whole profession is oriented to the vulture culture. Some of my best friends are insolvency practitioners&#151;because of the way in which I conduct my finances, I frequently need their advice, as well as their friendship&#151;so I withdraw any general accusations. However, abuses in the profession, one of which is the propensity to draw out cases of insolvency to generate massive fees, are not adequately dealt with by the present regulatory structure.
<P>
As the booklet states, the Select Committee on Social Security found that, in the Maxwell insolvency, Robson Rhodes charged between &#163;111 and &#163;174 an hour, Arthur Andersen between &#163;90 and &#163;153 an hour and Price Waterhouse between &#163;120 and &#163;191 an hour. If members of the Committee were getting such fees, our sittings might be longer. The scale of charges is monstrous, especially as junior employees often do the work. Of the Maxwell receivers, Nabarro Nathanson charged &#163;705,000 and Buchler Phillips &#163;744,000. Total fees and disbursements amounted to &#163;1,600,000 and the net assets realised were &#163;1,672,000, which left the stakeholders with only &#163;43,000, which Mr. Justice Ferris rightly described that as ``shameful''.
<P>
Those are examples of abuses that shame the profession. We must safeguard against such abuses, because the professionals are not doing so properly, and that is why I tabled the amendments. My hon. Friend the Minister has asked me not to press my amendments and I shall not do so, because they are imperfect, as is my speech. They were tabled in haste, but perhaps more suitable amendments can be considered in light of this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman intends to cover this issue. Does he agree that there should be a mechanism, at least for insolvency practitioners, to obtain a reasonable price for assets?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Absolutely. There should be an obligation or a duty of care, and I tried to provide for that. I shall not press my amendments, but I hope that we will return to the issue on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The hon. Member for Great Grimsby will have the opportunity to table a splendid clutch of amendments on Report, and I shall be delighted to contribute to the occasion. I hope that, in my limited and crabbed fashion, I have been as generous as possible in acknowledging that Ministers had already dealt with some of my amendments. I tabled the amendment in the hope that the Minister would accept it, but perhaps he will table a similar one on Report&#151;I would not take any political credit for it, other than pointing that out to him.
<P>
The nominee should have a right to apply to the court. That is sensible. He cannot apply to the court for directions and assistance, but creditors, directors and members of the company might challenge his acts, omissions and decisions in court. They can go to court for protection, but the nominee cannot, and that is unfair. However, I shall reserve my position until Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
