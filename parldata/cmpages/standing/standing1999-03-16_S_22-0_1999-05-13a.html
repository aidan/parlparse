<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 422, in page 60, line 4, at beginning insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1) In this Part an ``immigration officer'' means an immigration officer who is authorised by the Secretary of State to exercise the powers conferred by this Part and the Secretary of State shall not so authorise an immigration officer unless he is satisfied that the immigration officer has received such training as the Secretary of State considers to be appropriate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now come to a new part of the Bill and a new subject&#151;the powers of immigration officers. The Bill will extend some of their existing powers&#151;for example, to arrest for certain offences for which they currently do not have a power of arrest and take them into new areas. In many cases they are marginal extensions of existing powers, but in some cases officers will be dealing with sensitive matters. All members of the Committee will be aware that immigration matters often have a sensitive background and require careful handling.
<P>
We fully support the important work of immigration officers in enforcing immigration law, but it is also part of our job to ensure that proper safeguards are in place to enable the powers to be used properly. That brings me to the subject of the amendment, which requires that immigration officers receive proper training to exercise their powers. The amendment gives the Minister an opportunity to tell us about the Government's plans for such training in regard to present and new powers.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): The Government's intention is to ensure effective enforcement of our immigration laws. One way in which that has been done up to now is by the removal of people who have no continuing right to be in the United Kingdom. The police usually accompany immigration officers to wherever the person is who is to be removed and assist the immigration service in removing him. However, increasingly, the police merely stand by because there is no problem while removal is effected, and it is a substantial draw on police resources.
<P>
We want to increase the effectiveness of removal and the number removed. For many years, large numbers of people have been told that they will be removed, but the resources have not been available to effect removal. We want to increase the resources available to the immigration service to effect removals. However, that will mean increased pressure on the police to provide officers to join the immigration officers in carrying out removals.
<P>
Some police chiefs are reluctant to provide substantial numbers of officers, sometimes at short notice, to effect removals, and the officers often have no role to play other than to stand by and see whether anything transpires that might give them a role&#151;if the person resists, obstructs or seeks to do something that he should not do.
<P>
The aim of the clause is threefold. First, it makes clearer the current powers that immigration officers have and are trained to use. Secondly, it makes marginal changes to the powers as a result of changes in the law, and those need not detain the Committee. Thirdly, and most important, in limited circumstances it will enable immigration officers to effect removal without the presence of police officers.
<P>
We currently intend to train only about 20 immigration officers to carry out these tasks and we envisage that that small team will, in circumstances to which I shall come in a moment, carry out the removals without the presence of a police officer. It is a sensitive area that we intend to approach with caution. The immigration officers do not want to go into situations where they may be required to exceed their powers; however, they want to be sure that they can carry out removals effectively.
<P>
We shall provide substantial training to the team of immigration officers that will take on these new responsibilities and exercise the new powers. They will work initially with the police, but will be able to use the new powers in joint operations with the police. In due course they will carry out removals without the attendance of police officers in cases where all the evidence suggests that no problem or difficulty is likely to arise. If a difficulty arose&#151;no one can guarantee that one never will&#151;the immigration officers would have powers to deal with it. However, it is envisaged that, in the long term, if a difficulty is expected to arise, the police will be present. Where immigration officers have reason to believe that there will be difficulty in effecting a removal, they will not be expected to do so without the presence of police officers. The new powers will be used where there is unlikely, in the intelligence estimate, to be a need for force. Most removals are effected with relative ease, although, as I have said, there is no guarantee that that will always be the case.
<P>
The amendment raises important issues. I do not believe that there is much disagreement about the principles involved. The immigration officers are warranted under the Immigration Act 1971 and receive training in all the legislation that they are required to administer. The directors of the immigration service authorise warrants. There is no question that immigration officeres will be authorised by the director to exercise the new powers conferred on them by this part of the Bill without comprehensive and appropriate training.
<P>
Considerable financial provision of &#163;200,000 for each of the next five years has already been made for the estimated cost, and that is reflected in the financial effects of the Bill. A training package is currently being developed in consultation with the police, with the aim that immigration officers will be able to exercise their powers with sensitivity and restraint, relying on interpersonal skills to resolve conflict. There will be no widespread introduction of these powers until training has been fully validated. Only around 20 officers will be trained intially, and they will work alongside the police in a pilot scheme designed to test the powers before they are introduced more widely. However, the immigration service will continue to call on police support where the risk assessment is that they should, for example in particularly sensitive cases in certain localities and in larger operations. It will also keep the police informed when it is carrying out operations, so that, even if the police are not present, they are aware that the operations are being carried out.
<P>
The pilot scheme would allow working practices and training to be evaluated and fine-tuned and for the views of community groups to be considered. Immigration officers are not novices in this field. The immigration service has been working alongside the police for many years, and those working in enforcement already operate under the safeguards of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and are familiar with the procedures. I do not, therefore, consider it necessary to place a commitment to training in the Bill. I hope that we can show the Committee that the training for these new powers will be properly addressed and authorised.
<P>
When I read the amendment from the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) yesterday, it provoked a lively discussion between myself and senior immigration officers. Although none of us felt that this version of the amendment was appropriate, we may want to draw out some of the points that it raises. The measure codifies many of the powers that immigration officers already have and adds to them for some officers. I agree with the principle that only those officers who are properly trained should be allowed to exercise the powers of search, entry and seizure but the amendment encompasses existing powers, in addition to new ones, and therefore needs further thought.
<P>
I want time to look at the amendment because one or two of its suggestions may deserve further consideration and enable us to introduce additional safeguards to ensure that the new powers in the Bill can be used as we intend and are not spread further. It must be clear that the only officers who can exercise the powers are those who are authorised to do so under the rules of the immigration service.
<P>
We shall reconsider the ideas behind the amendment; I do not want to include training in the Bill, but there may be a way to authorise groups of officers to use the powers that go beyond those already exercised by immigration officers. With that undertaking, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response to this important but difficult issue.
<P>
We have twin objectives: we want the law to be properly and vigorously enforced and to support immigration officers, but we also want special care to be taken to exercise the powers sensitively. That is the Government's wish, too.
<P>
The Minister accepted that immigration officers would have some new powers&#151;a marginal extension&#151;but that increasingly they would be exercising those powers unaccompanied by police officers. Several issues arise from the proposal and we must therefore consider later parts of the Bill very carefully indeed, although I do not want to be unduly critical. For example, the Minister said that immigration officers would exercise the powers on their own when they did not foresee any problem, but if they envisaged difficulties they would seek the assistance of the police. I can understand that, but the history of such cases shows that problems can arise unexpectedly. A case that may appear to immigration officers to be relatively easy to deal with may suddenly turn very nasty indeed. It is because of that risk that we must ensure that immigration offices have the proper training, and the wherewithal, to tackle those situations when they arise, as they surely will.
<P>
I welcome what the Minister said about training, but whether enough immigration officers are being trained is another matter. It must be set against the scale of the problem; various estimates have been bandied about on the number of people who are in the country without permission, in breach of immigration control and without any legal avenue left to be pursued. The figures are complicated as they may include people who have not exhausted every legal right.
<P>
People must have the opportunity to pursue their legal rights, but any interpretation of the available figures shows that there are tens of thousands of people in the country whose remaining legal rights have been exhausted. One of the most serious aspects of immigration enforcement is that the whereabouts of those people must be detected before the policy can be enforced. I suspect that in many cases, the people concerned will be prepared to leave voluntarily when they are aware that the authorities know about them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): The hon. Gentleman's point about resources is also relevant. A constituent of mine sponsored someone to come into the country as his fiancee, but the person concerned went off the rails and the relationship broke down. It was a devil of a job to get the immigration service to remove the individual because, due to limited resources, they could deal only with priority cases, even though everyone wanted out of the country a person who had no right to be here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman supports my argument. We shall watch carefully to see how the Government's proposals work in practice although we shall be fair to them as it is a difficult issue.
<P>
I welcome what the Minister said about training, and about reconsidering the amendment. There have been reports in the media that some of the immigration unions are unhappy about the extension of powers proposed in the Bill. Will the Minister comment on the matter and say what discussions he has had with the unions? Does this part of the Bill have their full support or have they expressed reservations about it?
<P>
I understand that immigration officers are expected to observe the codes of practice laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which governs how the police exercise similar functions of arrest, entry and search. Section 67 of that Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Persons other than police officers who are charged with the duty of investigating offences or charging offenders shall in the discharge of that duty have regard to any relevant provision of such a code.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will that be incorporated in the training of immigration officers mentioned in the amendment? Has the Minister thought about training immigration officers in the use of the PACE codes, because certain characteristics of their work that should be considered in that context? The Minister should consider whether they should be subject to a code. Immigration officers will exercise their powers in communities where there may be difficulties. There will certainly be language difficulties, and in many households children will be present, or adults and children suffering from mental illness or disability. Can the Minister assure me that training will take such matters into account?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> First, the trade unions approached the extension of powers with caution; they did not request the extensions. They want to monitor the way in which the powers are used with the care that the Government and the hon. Gentleman also want. That is necessary; it is even more necessary to ensure that it is done properly. The unions are at one with us in wanting to ensure that the powers are exercised with sensitivity, with awareness of the implications for community relations, and with effective and proper training. They want to be assured that when their members do the work they have sufficient backup and support. The unions' approach has been constructive and sensible in that respect.
<P>
The PACE codes of practice will apply to the use of any powers. The powers which we have extended and are setting out here are modelled on those of police officers. Therefore PACE and the codes of practice under PACE will apply in the same way to immigration officers who use these powers as they do to police officers. Other guidance instructions are also given to immigration officers. We are more than content to make them public to show how the immigration service will guide its members and how those powers will be used.
<P>
I want to be sure that we take on board carefully the issue of community relations. For example, we shall consult the Commission for Racial Equality, on how these powers should be used in future. One of the reasons that has prompted a change here is that the CRE, among others, has been concerned about the way in which enforcement takes place. Its concerns have been varied, but one of them has been that uniformed people carry out the removals, in other words the police. Obviously the immigration service is not uniformed and there may well be benefits from that. We have therefore looked at the CRE's concerns about the use of these powers. We shall consult them on that. We are approaching this with sensitivity and caution as we want to get it right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister said that the PACE codes of practice will apply in the same way that they apply to police officers. Could he clarify a point about the admissibility of evidence? I understand that if PACE is broken by police officers, it is often successfully cited as grounds for not admitting evidence. Clearly these powers could involve searching for and collecting material and there may be a subsequent issue about the material that had been collected. Will the same kind of provisions that apply to police officers apply here? If it was shown that PACE or the codes of practice had been broken, would the evidence acquired in that way be inadmissible?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The rules on the collection of evidence will apply to immigration officers in the same way as they do to police officers. There will be symmetry in the way the powers are applied. The PACE codes will need to be extended to immigration officers when the latter are exercising schedule 2 powers. We intend to do that by a later Government amendment. The PACE codes apply at present to the investigation of offences by immigration officers or by the police. There is no substantial difference between them. It is intended that immigration officers will be trained in the application of the codes of practice under PACE to any powers they are expected to exercise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a useful debate. I am sure that we will return to some of the same subjects later. In order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 958, in page 60, line 8, leave out `or 24A'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 960, in page 60, line 13, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) Subsection (1) will not apply to an offence under section 24A until the suspect's application for asylum has been determined and he has been able to exercise any appeal rights arising from the decision reached.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 958 relates to a concern raised by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association. It notes that clause 104 provides for a power of arrest in respect of the new offence created by the Bill under clause 16. We have obviously debated that clause and the Minister made certain remarks on that and so there will be some overlapping here. The new offence is,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by means which include deception'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to obtain or seeking to obtain
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the avoidance, postponement or revocation of enforcement action''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have been told that the offence is specifically directed towards failed asylum seekers.
<P>
ILPA says that the offence created by clause 16 breaches article 31 of the convention on the status of refugees. It points out that asylum seekers have often not been able to obtain travel documents before fleeing persecution and yet they can claim asylum only once they have arrived here. In those situations, asylum seekers need to rely on false documentation. Traumatised asylum seekers may also omit to give the immigration service complete replies to later queries. In either case they will become liable for prosecution for deception even if the application for asylum is genuine and eventually determined in their favour.
<P>
ILPA says that clause 104 provides immigration and police officers with powers to arrest such people without warrant and in its view that ``further compounds the abuse''. The Minister has commented on this already but he needs to address ILPA's concerns about the power of arrest.
<P>
Amendment No. 960 seeks to ensure that if an immigration or police officer is granted the power to arrest a person without a warrant for the offence created by clause 16, such an arrest cannot be effected while the asylum seeker's application and any consequent appeal has yet to be determined. Again this is a difficult area but the Government need to address ILPA's concerns and add a little more to what was said on clause 16.
<P>
I should be particularly grateful if the Minister could tell us how transit passengers will be dealt with under this power of arrest. They are liable to be arrested if their documents are false even though they are going on to another country. What will happen if they turn out to be refugees who were intended to exercise their claim in another country? They may, I suppose, as a result of the exercise of these powers, come to make their claim in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have added my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) to these amendments as we share many of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. I query one aspect of the provision in new section 24A of the 1971 Act which has been introduced by clause 16 and that is the Minister's judgment of the proportionality of assigning a power to arrest without warrant to the offences we are now describing.
<P>
Obviously the power of arrest without warrant is quite serious in that there is no prior judicial control. I can understand why it is necessary in the context of the original section 24 of the 1971 Act which refers to illegal entry, but the offence of deception which we are creating in clause 16 carries in absolute terms a relatively low penalty. On summary conviction, the maximum penalty is six months and on indictment it is two years.
<P>
Powers of entry and search under section 24 of PACE can be given for offences which attract a maximum sentence of more than five years. PACE seeks to achieve a balance to conform to the principles of proportionality in respect of state powers over the alleged offence and the powers of the officers who will carry this out. Is the proportionality right here and is the power to arrest without warrant necessary? Queries have been raised with me about the possible implications of article 8 of the European convention on human rights which requires that powers be exercised in compliance with statutory codes. We have heard that PACE will apply and that there should be a complaints procedure and I am sure we will get on to that.
<P>
In the context of the new section 24A offences of deception, why cannot we have a system which required a warrant? In other words, why cannot there by judicial control before an arrest in those circumstances, given the nature of the offence and the level of penalty which could be attracted on conviction? The offence of deception is quite different from the general section 24 offence where it could quite easily be argued that an arrest without warrant was more appropriate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am afraid that I cannot support the amendments. I am aware that they were suggested in the evidence that we received from the ILPA, but I do not think that they are necessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 958 would remove the power of arrest without warrant when someone is suspected of committing an offence under the new section 24A of the 1971 Act, which will be introduced by clause 16 of this Bill. The new section 24A will be made up of two provisions. First, it will repeat the existing law under which it is an offence to obtain, or seek to obtain, leave to enter or remain by deception. Secondly, it will be an offence to deploy deception in order to frustrate removal action.
<P>
We must take firm action against those who gain entry to, or permission to stay, in the United Kingdom through deception or who use deception to frustrate enforcement action after any application that they have made has run the full course of its consideration. I do not think that anyone in Committee would disagree with that general proposition.
<P>
The position in law is that someone who gains entry to the country by deception is an illegal entrant. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hertsmere is not suggesting that immigration officers and the police should not continue to be able to arrest, without a warrant, someone who has been smuggled in on the back of a lorry. However, when someone has used deception to gain entry, officials and the police will have to obtain a warrant before they are able to arrest him or her.
<P>
Even if someone is present and police and immigration officials have evidence that he used deception to enter the country, is the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) suggesting that they would have to obtain a warrant from a magistrate before they could arrest him? That would constrain the proper and reasonable operation of an immigration officer's powers. That is not only unnecessary, but might open the whole system to ridicule. That would be the effect of amendment No. 958.
<P>
It is not always possible to be in possession of information in advance of detecting people who use deception. To be able to proceed only by way of summons would unnecessarily hamper effective operations against those breaking the law. If it is discovered that a person has practised deception, the immigration service's experience is that, upon return to an address to execute a warrant, the person concerned is frequently no longer to be found.
<P>
I am aware that ILPA suggested that the power was contrary to article 31 of the United Nations convention on the status of refugees. However, in its evidence, it suggested that the power to arrest without warrant someone who is suspected of having gained leave by deception is somehow new. Its evidence speaks of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The introduction of a power to arrest''.&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 265.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not a new power. There is already a power of arrest without warrant where someone is suspected of having obtained leave by deception. That power flows from the present section 24(1)(aa) of the 1971 Act, which was inserted by the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. That Act was supported by the hon. Member for Hertsmere and his colleagues when they were in government.
<P>
Clause 16, which we have already debated, is a modest extension to those powers. They will be directed against those who use deception to obtain leave to enter, to remain or to frustrate removal. I accept that the powers may include some people who have claimed asylum, but they will include a great many others. I accept that the power will need to be used sensibly, but it needs to be there for the cases that I have described.
<P>
Amendment No. 960 is, I assume, intended as an alternative to amendment No. 958 and it suffers some of the same disadvantages. Clause 16 will not mean that everyone who is suspected of having employed deception to obtain leave will be arrested on the spot. However, a power of arrest will be necessary in certain circumstances. Amendment No. 960 would mean that an immigration offender would only have to make a claim for asylum and the immigration officer or policeman would no longer have any power to detain him. That simply cannot be justified.
<P>
We know that people travelling in transit may be of different types. Some may have serious criminal intent, and they may use deception to travel. Others may use deception to seek to breach immigration controls in another country. Some may be refugees, but others may have other reasons to use documents for the purpose of deception. Therefore, we cannot say that, because someone has claimed asylum, no proceedings can be taken. If we did, every single criminal, drug dealer or anyone else who was picked up carrying a forged passport would promptly claim asylum in the belief that nothing would happen to them as a result. That is not good for the asylum system. It is certainly not good for maintaining public support for genuine refugees, which is the whole purpose of the Bill. Therefore, we must pursue a sensible and reasonable policy when we deal with such cases. The amendments would act as a constraint on that aim.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam asked whether we were satisfied that the powers in the Bill are proportionate to the problem. For the reasons that I have given, I believe that they are justified and accord with article 8 of the European convention on human rights. They are aimed at the prevention of crime and disorder and they are a proportionate means of attaining that objective. We and our legal advisers firmly take the view that the powers do not breach article 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Before the Minister gets too carried away, I want to point out that my opening remarks were meant to suggest that I was on his side. The clause deals with matters that need to be addressed. As he did on several occasions on Tuesday, he has taken the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 off the shelf. He may need it later today, but he does not need it now.
<P>
I am with the Minister in taking a robust attitude towards those who practice deception. However, we need to be careful. Deception involves many grey areas, and ILPA and other prominent people have described the problems that exist. I remember the debates on the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 when the then shadow Home Secretary referred to the people who destroy documents for various reasons. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``That is not necessarily evidence of fraud. There may be good reasons why that has happened''.&#151;[Official Report, 2 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. 38.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the view that the then shadow Home Secretary took in 1992, but I do not know whether he took quite such an understanding approach to the Government as I am taking this morning. Even if one supports the clause, one must point out the need to be careful and to consider people's concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let me make it clear that it is not the practice of the immigration service to arrest people who use forged documents and claim asylum on their arrival. Article 31 of the 1951 convention does not appear to apply to those using false papers and travelling through a safe third country, such as the United Kingdom. If someone makes an asylum claim and is a genuine refugee, the place to make the claim should be the first safe country. That is the approach that all Governments have taken for a long time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has made a further contribution. In order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 959, in page 60, line 26, leave out from beginning to end of line 14 on page 61.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 423, in page 60 line 30, after `(1)', insert `(d) or'.
<P>
No. 424, in page 60, leave out lines 33 and 34 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`only if any of (a), (b), (c) or (d) of subsection (7) (``the first condition'') or (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (8) (``the second condition'') are satisfied'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 908.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It may assist the Committee if I say now that I shall not speak to amendments No. 959 and 423. I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 424, because the Government have accepted the substance of it in their amendment No. 908.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the hon. Gentleman moving amendment No. 959 or amendment No. 424.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall just speak to amendment No. 424. I want to save the Committee's time by not going into subjects that do not now need debate.
<P>
Amendment No. 424 is designed to clarify whether Government amendment No. 908 seeks the same objective as we do. If it does, we welcome that, although we do not regard it as a concession of substance. It may not be a mistake, but subsection (6) is obviously misconceived. It is clearly inappropriate and restrictive for the conditions in subsections (7) and (8) to be met before the power of arrest can be exercised. That would constrain immigration officers far too much, making it extremely difficult for them to exercise their powers. It appears as though police powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 have not been accurately transcribed. Will the Minister provide reassurance on that matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I confirm that Government amendment No. 908 deals with much the same points as amendment No. 424, although its wording is different. I have been advised that the words suggested by the hon. Gentleman's amendment are not the best way of dealing with the matter, so our amendment contains simpler, more straightforward wording. Given that both amendments have much the same purpose, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment and support the Government amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am glad that my imperfect amendment highlighted an obvious gap in the Bill. Having achieved that objective, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Our amendments highlight the matter of suspects who have problems understanding what is said to them; such problems may include language difficulties. A number of suspects are likely to have language difficulties, and that will be more a problem for immigration officers than for the police, who, in the exercise of search and arrest powers, will come across language problems less frequently.
<P>
Amendment No. 426 relates to clause 106(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an immigration officer may enter and search any premises for the purpose of arresting''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a suspect.
<P>
Immigration officers already have such power under PACE. Facilitating the entry of an illegal entrant is an arrestable offence, carrying a sentence of more than five years. That is a minor point, but it affects the need for the power in subsection (1). Why is the provision necessary when immigration officers already have such power under PACE?
<P>
We must probe procedures and safeguards for the exercise of such powers. Amendment No. 961 deals with cases in which suspects do not understand the language in which they are asked to give their name, so they need assistance.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 429, 435 and 437 were suggested by ILPA and concern the need for immigration officers to explain what they are doing in a language understood by the arrested person. The power to search someone for evidence under clause 110(3)(b) should not apply when the person concerned cannot fully comprehend the reason for the search, which should then take place at the police station.
<P>
ILPA ask what will happen if the arrested person does not understand enough English to understand the reason and justification for the proposed search. What happens when an immigration officer attempts to search a suspect and a hostile crowd gathers?
<P>
We must be careful about the power to search people and use foresight to consider what may arise when that power is exercised. Will the Minister explain the safeguards and the approach to be taken in such cases?
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall address matters raised by the amendments, especially amendment No. 971, which I tabled with my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). Our amendment seeks to achieve something similar to amendment No. 429, tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, but adds a provision for an appropriate adult to be present when a young person is searched.
<P>
All the amendments in this group are important. The Minister has already spoken about community relations. We seek to ensure that immigration officers have clear guidance so that they know how to act to maintain good community relations.
<P>
I hope that the Minister does not respond by saying that our proposals are a get-out clause allowing people to plead that they have some disability or that they do not understand. We are not trying to offer people a get-out from immigration officers taking appropriate action against them, but wish to ensure that immigration officers have a clear understanding of where their powers start and finish.
<P>
Immigration officers should not feel that they have to carry out an arrest or search when they are not trained to undertake such actions. Amendment No. 971 makes clear that the appropriate action for such officers would be to ensure that arrested people are removed to a police station, where they can be searched.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Bill&#151;or another measure&#151;provided immigration officers with such guidance. The police have far greater resources for the exercise of such powers than the immigration service, even with the boost that the immigration service is likely to have.
<P>
The police have a far better environment in which to carry out difficult searches which may involve problems in understanding, disability and so on. The police regularly deal with such matters. More progressive police forces are working with health services to find appropriate ways of dealing with people with a mental illness, and are developing units in which they can rapidly assess such people. As we heard, people who will be affected by the provision may have developed certain problems as a result of illness or trauma.
<P>
When such problems present themselves, we must not leave immigration officers out in the field, feeling that they have to carry an action through. We must ensure that people are dealt with appropriately, which may involve using police interpreters and specialist services for young people and people with mental illness.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will provide clarification of such matters, even if he rejects our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): I will say a few words on the matter, before tackling more general issues arising in relation to clause 106.
<P>
Clearly, the law matters. However, how does the Minister expect immigration officers and police constables to determine whether someone is physically or mentally incapable of giving a reasonable response? I accept a perceived need to arrest someone who cannot communicate with the arresting officer. However, what system will be used to determine whether that person is incapable of understanding or communicating? How does the Minister intend to approach that problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The amendments have the common theme of communication difficulties. Before I address the amendments individually, I shall make general comments applying to them all.
<P>
I understand and, in many ways, sympathise with the concerns behind the amendments. I will outline steps that can be taken to address those concerns.
<P>
Incorporating into the Bill elements that do not apply to the police is problematic. The hon. Member for Hertsmere must provide good reasons for incorporating his proposals for the immigration service into the Bill, when those proposals do not apply to the police.
<P>
I will return later to the difference between the circumstances of the police and the immigration service. Briefly, in applying these powers in practice, the immigration service is in a more controlled position than the police. The police often apply the powers when they do not know who they are dealing with; whereas immigration officers who are effecting a removal at the end of the procedure will usually know a good deal about the person whom they are seeking to remove.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> There is a broader reason why the police are in a different position from the immigration service, which I will explain in a moment. The Minister has already referred to the most obvious reason&#151;that the police carry out their functions in a uniform, but immigration officers do not, which makes the task more sensitive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> It will make it more sensitive, but not necessarily more difficult, provided that the immigration service carries out its duties in a proper way.
<P>
I want to deal with communications issues. It is essential that immigration officers exercise their powers with common sense and sensitivity. Until now, immigration offences have been investigated jointly by the police and immigration officers but without a specific legislative requirement to seek to resolve communication problems.
<P>
That is not to say that such problems have been ignored. The police and accompanying immigration officers do take steps to resolve those problems: interpreters are present at some operations; friends and relatives are often used to clarify misunderstandings; translations of relevant documents can be provided; and once someone is in police custody, PACE codes of practice come into play.
<P>
More can and is being done. Many organisations now use facilities that provide instant access to interpreters by phone. The Metropolitan police use such assistance, as does the London ambulance service. Many local authorities do the same to cope with problems posed by the particular needs of asylum seekers. The immigration service will also subscribe to such a service to allow immigration officers to gain access to more than 100 languages at any time of the day, seven days a week. That will not replace official interpreters but will remove some of the concerns behind the amendment. Additionally, immigration officers will carry with them guidance leaflets translated into different languages, which can be used to explain their actions and powers and exactly who they are.
<P>
My final general point relates to the practicalities of some of the amendments. Immigration officers can undertake several visits in one day, dealing with several different nationalities who might use a variety of regional dialects. We must guard against replacing the bureaucratic problems of seeking police assistance with the problems of covering every possible language likely to be encountered during a series of operational visits.
<P>
I should like to deal now with the specific amendments in the group. Amendment Nos. 961 and 962 would introduce divergent practices, which could lead to a person obstructing an immigration officer and feigning incomprehension to avoid arrest.
<P>
Amendment No. 426 would impose restrictions on immigration officers exercising their powers under clause 106 by confining them to those that apply in the execution of warrants. Those restrictions do not apply to clause 106 for a good reason. Clause 106 deals only with the investigation of the offence of facilitation, which is categorised as an arrestable offence under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It is based on section 17 of PACE and places the same restrictions on immigration officers as those placed on police officers. To do otherwise, as intended by the amendment, would introduce a different set of procedures for investigating the same offence.
<P>
Facilitation is a serious offence and is distinguished as such in the 1971 Act. That distinction remains. Immigration officers already have the power to arrest a person for facilitation. To provide them with powers that are different from those of the police would open up loopholes which the unscrupulous could&#151;and, I suspect, would&#151;seek to exploit. No one wants to achieve that.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 429 and 971 would not only create inconsistencies with police powers but could lead to considerable practical and legal impediments. The amendments refer to clause 110, which provides for the searching of an arrested person. The amendments would permit searching on safety grounds but would prevent a search for evidence when the arrested person was unable fully to comprehend what was happening. Any search for evidence would have to take place at a police station with an interpreter present.
<P>
However, the right time to search for evidence relating to an arrest is upon arrest. Not to do so at that time risks evidence being further concealed, destroyed or perhaps disposed of. If an immigration officer was conducting a search on safety grounds and uncovered some evidence&#151;perhaps a passport&#151;should such evidence be inadmissible and should the immigration officer be required to hand it back to the arrested person?
<P>
Clearly, the police and the immigration service will seek to avoid searches in public places, whenever possible. If there is an alternative, the person can be taken to another place and the search carried out thoroughly there. If it is possible and proper to take the person to the police station to undertake the search, that will be done, but preventing a search on the spot could create and facilitate the obstruction of justice.
<P>
Amendment No. 986 proposed by the hon. Member for Hallam would provide a copy of retained evidence to a person in police custody. However, someone in police custody who has been arrested for an offence is protected by the PACE code of practice which, in turn, provides for the resolution of communication problems. All items retained by the police are recorded on the custody record, which is signed by the detained person. Should an immigration officer retain an item, it would be recorded by the custody sergeant and the detained person would have access to it under clause 112. I assure the hon. Member for Hallam that the officers who exercise the powers will have full training, clear guidance and will be subject to the PACE codes of practice.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 435 and 437 refer to clause 111, which deals with the searching of persons in police custody. Any difference in procedure would be particularly noticeable when immigration officers were operating alongside police officers in police stations. Those in police custody are protected by the PACE codes of practice, which already make provision for calling on interpreters and appropriate adults. I can therefore give the hon. Member for Hallam the assurance that he seeks. Clause 112 provides additional safeguards in relation to the access and copying of material seized under this part of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 438 refers to clause 114, which covers the execution of warrants. For reasons that I have already outlined, I am concerned that this and other amendments in the group would introduce divergent practices between immigration and police officers&#151;to little, if any, gain. I am satisfied that existing practices and the enhanced steps to which I referred will deal with the concern behind the amendments, so I cannot invite the Committee to support them.
<P>
As to the powers that immigration officers already have under PACE, we believe that it is right to set them out in a clearly codified form in the provisions. I have already explained to the hon. Member for Hertsmere that we are not only codifying some of the powers that immigration officers already have and extending them in minor and technical ways, but creating new powers for the particular role of enforcement.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) asked how immigration officers will determine whether a person is capable. In the case of enforcement of removal, immigration officers already have considerable information about the person from the record. For example, immigration officers are likely to know about the background and circumstances of a failed asylum seeker. I would also expect medical evidence to be readily available. If the person had a mental condition, difficulties with language or a physical disabilty, it would normally be recorded on the files.
<P>
In exercising similar powers, often the police have never met the person, do not know who he is or whether he has a mental or physical incapacity. Immigration officers, on the other hand, will in normal circumstances&#151;I cannot guarantee always&#151;exercise their powers with some prior knowledge of the problems that are likely to arise. They will usually be able to provide not only interpreters but medical support, if needed.
<P>
Occasionally, there are particularly good reasons for removing people with limited psychiatric incapacity. However, the usual practice in serious psychiatric incapacity cases is that we do not effect the enforced removal of people who may be vulnerable. That is often but not always so. I do not want to give too many guarantees about how we shall deal with such cases in future because individual circumstances must be taken into account. However, very often people with serious psychiatric difficulties will not be removed.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is right to say that the clauses are substantially a re-enactment of the existing law and that many of the extensions of powers of arrest are very marginal indeed for what are relatively rare immigration offences, according to statistics. Even so&#151;I hope that the Minister does not misunderstand this&#151;this is an important opportunity to look at safeguards that ought to be in place. Adopting safeguards does not mean that we are trying to hamstring the immigration service; we want to make sure that the law is enforced vigorously, but properly.
<P>
The Minister seemed to have got hold of the wrong end of the stick as regards the amendments, and adopted an unnecessarily confrontational tone. He need not have been quite so defensive. Amendment No. 424 would do a great deal to release immigration officers from a provision that would make it extremely difficult for them to exercise these powers at all. I hope that the Minister accepts that important issues arise, among them people's understanding of the importance of proper communication because there will be special sensitivities and difficulties in such circumstances. I trust that the Government will use reasonable foresight to address these problems. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have some general concerns about the extension of immigration officers' powers some of which were answered in the letter from the Minister&#151;copies of which were made available&#151;which explained that PACE codes will be brought into play. That dealt with one aspect. I hope that it is appropriate to use this clause stand part debate relating to the first extensions of the powers to discuss briefly the other aspect&#151;the complaints that may arise from the exercise of the powers, and what will happen if they do.
<P>
Power to arrest may be an especially sensitive subject. Unfortunately, there have been incidents involving police officers where difficulties have arisen that have sometimes led to fatalities. The most notable was the Joy Gardner case. The power to arrest without warrant may lead to future incidents in which difficulties arise. We hope not, but if they do, what follows will be of major concern to the people involved.
<P>
The Minister has set out some idea of how complaints would be handled.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 982 relates to complaints. I ask the hon. Gentleman to confine his comments to clause 104.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mrs. Roe. I shall save my comments about detail until that time, and register my concern about the extension of these powers.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbot (Hackney, North and Stoke Newington):</B> It is appropriate to say now that, while I understand what Ministers are trying to achieve, concern is certainly reflected in new clauses such as mine about immigration officers having fresh powers to enter people's homes and arrest them. One of the Minister's problems is the unwillingness of police to go in and pick up overstayers and others. However, the police calculate that it is not worth the damage to community relations to undertake such operations. I am glad to know that the PACE regime will be extended to immigration officers. That is an important safeguard.
<P>
In the case of Joy Gardner, whom the police sought to arrest, a number of people were present versus one woman. Her mouth was taped up. She was strapped up in a way that caused her death. Her case is still very vivid in my part of north London. Clearly immigration officers will be given these new powers, but I hope that the training, support and supervision that they receive will prevent an unfortunate case like that occuring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend raises an important consideration. I have already reassured the Committee about it to some extent, but let me reassure her that we intend that the police should be consulted before the immigration service carries out an operation. My hon. Friend will remember a case that she and I dealt with where, because of their concerns, the police considered that an operation should not go ahead. The immigration service would not want to undertake an operation if the police felt that it would cause long-term community difficulties. Therefore, it will need to exercise caution to ensure that there is no damage to community relations.
<P>
I share with my hon. Friend concerns about the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs. Joy Gardner, which gave rise to an investigation. I assure her that the training undertaken by the immigration service will draw heavily on the experience of the police, who currently perform many of these duties, and will take full account of the recommendations made as a result of the review of procedures following Mrs. Gardner's death.
<P>
With those assurances, I hope that the Committee will be able to able to support the clause.
<P>

<H4><center>Clause 106</center></H4>
<H4><center>Search and arrest without warrant</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> The clause relates to the powers of immigration officers. The police probably do not have similar powers, because the clause relates to section 25(1) of the 1971 Act.
<P>
I want to put to the Minister and the Committee a case that is some years old, but it supports the case that immigration oficers should do things more often than the police would have done in the past. In giving this report, I want to emphasise that I understand the difficulties of the police and accept that, in their contact with the public, they are often dealing with people who have behaved badly or who may be out of control through drink, drugs or for other reasons. Therefore, I do not want what I say to be taken as general criticism of the police. However, it is essential that those who are responsible for the police&#151;sergeants and more senior officers, as well as the police authorities, which in London at present means the Home Secretary&#151;should be aware of what is going on beneath them.
<P>
The case concerns a young man who, at about midnight, came out of a party, was approached by the police and was accused of being an illegal immigrant. He was not an illegal immigrant: he had partial refugee status. He was a student, but could not return to his country because of political problems. Later those problems were resolved and he could go home, and he has had a successful career.
<P>
In the conversation with the police the young man was first accused of being an illegal immigrant and then of being involved in drugs. The police took him to his lodgings, searched the place, could not find any suggestion of drugs and found a passport with a curious endorsement in it. It was not clear whether he had been arrested. In many engagements between young people and the police there is not necessarily clarity about whether an arrest has taken place unless a note is made afterwards. In the same way, there is not always clarity, when there is an audit trail, whether the police have checked with the national computers whether a person holds a driving licence or his car is properly registered. However, I shall not pursue that now.
<P>
The young man ends up in a police station, with his passport being seen by the desk sergeant, who says, ``This is a perfectly reasonable endorsement. The man has permission to remain in this country.'' I shall skip through the case quickly, as it goes slightly away from the clause. The man is told that he has been arrested for assault on a police officer. All that arises from having been met several hours before, in the street, on suspicion either of drugs or not having permission to remain in this country. He is told that, if he is willing to plead guilty, the police will bail him out. Otherwise they will keep him in the cells over the weekend, which I think included a bank holiday. In the end the man comes to court and the magistrates do not believe the police officers about the assault in a police station: they suggest that there was some sort of argy-bargy.
<P>
If some of this specialist work can be moved to the immigration service, obviously with police assistance and escort where appropriate, that is to be welcomed. Following my earlier remarks about those with disabilities, the Minister said that the immigration service often knows with whom it is dealing. So long as it knows that it is talking to the right person, that gives greater confidence. I recognise the professional way in which the immigration service carries out its duty, just as I recognise that the police normally carry out their duty in a professional way.
<P>
I hope that those in the immigration service and the police will be encouraged to see whether a pattern emerges of people slipping into what I would call bad behaviour&#151;doing things that do not really work. If issues come to court and police or immigration officers are not believed&#151;not just in marginal cases where they may not have sufficient proof&#151;I hope that those in authority above them, from first-line supervisors upwards, will take it seriously. If there is to be high morale and high professionalism, those who are trying to do their job properly must know that those above them are paying attention. That is the best way to ensure that we get the public service, which it can be difficult to provide, that we deserve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The clause deals with a power to do something without a warrant&#151;in other words, without prior judicial control. Therefore, the concerns that I expressed earlier about proportionality again apply. However, as long as we are talking only about offences under section 25(1) of the 1971 Act, which relate to assisting illegal entering and harbouring, I can understand the requirement for the power. We all agree that traffickers in human beings should be pursued with the full force of the law, and those who have committed offences under section 25(1) may fall into the category of traffickers of human beings.
<P>
My only concern is to ensure that the powers without warrant, as opposed to the powers in clause 105 with warrant, are used specifically for that category of offender. In common sense terms it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish the traffickers from the trafficked. I hope that we can be assured that the powers in the clause will be used purely to seek to arrest the gang-master, the ring-leader, the person who is assisting illegal entry and harbouring, rather than as a short cut to gain entry to premises where, although the illegal entrants may be found, they are not those who committed a section 25(1) offence and can be dealt with using other appropriate powers. The power in the clause should be targeted at those who commit section 25(1) offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The clause covers the power to enter and search for the purpose of arresting a person for the offence of facilitation, not harbouring. Facilitation is, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, trafficking in human beings&#151;organising their entry into the United Kingdom or other countries. Harbouring is protecting and seeking to prevent the proper operation of the law, which is slightly different. The hon. Gentleman defined it correctly. The issue is whether immigration officers should be able to arrest and deal with those who have been organising the trafficking in illegal immigration. The issue is whether immigration officers should be able to arrest people who organise trafficking in illegal immigrants. Those convicted of that offence are liable to imprisonment for up to seven years and we shall seek, by amendment, to increase the maximum penalty to 10 years. The existing penalty places the offence in the category of arrestable offences defined by section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
<P>
To answer the hon. Member for Worthing, West, the powers in the clause are consistent with police powers. The Bill will enable immigration officers to exercise powers usually exercised by the police because they need to be able to deal with those who carry out the serious offence of trafficking in human beings.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I can reassure the hon. Member for Worthing, West that we will crack down hard on the culture of bad behaviour. He and other hon. Members will have received a letter stating how we will deal with complaints against the immigration service. The new powers will be exercised by a group of enforcement immigration officers. The management of those cases and complaints against the officers will be handled under a separate process so that issues arising from the way in which the powers are exercised can be addressed. Complaints against the small number of officers who have those powers will be carefully monitored.
<P>
We aim to ensure that there is no culture of bad behaviour among that group of immigration officers. The issue is extremely difficult and sensitive and it is therefore enormously important that we get things right, especially as we are introducing the powers. They will not be introduced quickly; it will be done over a number of years, as training develops and we work our way through the pilot studies. We must ensure that any complaints are investigated and dealt with properly. It would appear to be easy to prevent a culture of bad behaviour from developing because only a small number of officers, with a specific role, will be involved. That is not the case in policing, because large numbers of officers carry out a variety of roles. It should therefore be much easier to monitor a small group of immigration officers and to ensure that the high standards by which they operate are maintained.
<P>
In the light of those reassurances, I hope that the Committee will support the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 970, in page 66, line 29, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and (c) as long as no physical contact is made with the arrested person's body.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 428, in page 66, line 33, leave out from `headgear' to end of line 34.
<P>
No. 972, in page 67, line 22, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and (c) only if no contact is made with the arrested person's body'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The power in the clause to search persons is a sensitive issue. If we do not get it right, that power, exercised in the circumstances that we have discussed, may contribute to problems in community relations and cause great stress to individuals. Such problems could be avoided if it were made clear how immigration officers will exercise their powers.
<P>
Amendment No. 970 is intended to clarify what sort of search is proposed under the powers and to ensure that it will be confined to outer clothing, avoiding a more personal form of body search. We want to restrict the power so that no physical contact may be made with the arrested person's body during the search.
<P>
That is important in two respects. First, we may be dealing with people who have suffered trauma. We hope that those who have suffered torture or other forms of distress abroad will be recognised as refugees and not removed. Other forms of distress may be prevalent&#151;much more than in the host population&#151;within the community of people who arrive here as immigrants. Many will have been through difficult personal circumstances: some may properly be removed from this country but a degree of sensitivity may be required.
<P>
Secondly, certain social conventions may be common among immigrant communities. Being touched by a stranger could be traumatic, especially to members of certain faith groups for whom contact is generally discouraged and for whom particular forms of contact with strangers might cause additional distress. We must therefore be clear about how far a personal search will go. I hope that the Minister will explain what training will be given and that he will be clear about the limits of this form of search, given that other forms of search could be carried out in different circumstances&#151;in police custody, for example&#151;that would be inappropriate for immigration officers to perform.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> One of the important points about the clause is that it authorises immigration officers to search persons at places
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other than a police station''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in other words, in public. That is a crucial feature of the power and all the more reason to exercise it sensitively. I agree with many of the points raised by the hon. Member for Hallam and I am particularly concerned about cases with religious sensitivities. However, I shall deal with that later when we debate amendments on the searching of people's head gear.
<P>
Amendment No. 428 relates to subsection (5), which specifically authorises an immigration officer to search the mouth of an arrested person at a place other than a police station. The Immigration Law Practitioners Association is particularly concerned about that. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``ILPA also believes that in the context of searching for identity documentation and other material relevant to an immigration offence''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it is immigration offences that we are dealing with here&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there can be no justification for searching a person's mouth.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 269.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister told us earlier that he was keen to align the powers of the police with those of the immigration service in that regard and I accept that the police may often need the power to search a person's mouth in public&#151;for drug offences, to cite an obvious example. However, I am unclear about the circumstances in which an immigration officer would need to search a person's mouth in connection with immigration offences. Will the Minister provide an example?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O`Brien:</B> I will happily provide the hon. Gentleman with a serious example. Some people are reluctant to be removed and may seek to commit suicide rather than leave the country. One way to accomplish that is by secreting a razor blade in the mouth, and immigration officers have been concerned about that in the past. If they think that a person has secreted an item away with a view to taking his own life or to causing himself physical injury in order to delay his removal, they should be able to search for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is right. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An immigration officer may search the arrested person if he has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrested person may present a danger to himself or others.'' Subsection (3) adds:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The officer may search the arrested person for&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) anything which he might use to assist his escape from lawful custody; or
<P>
</UL></FONT>this is what I asked about&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) anything which might be evidence relating to the offence for which he has been arrested.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I suppose that we could describe suicide as a form of escape from lawful custody, but how often will immigration officers need to use the powers in subsection (3)(b)? Of course, suicide is a serious issue, but will the Minister provide an example of a case in which an immigration officer might need to search an arrested person for evidence relating to the offence for which he has been arrested? ILPA raised that question in its submission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Obrien:</B> I am happy to answer that point. The evidence might be telephone numbers of people engaged in trafficking, a piece of paper that might be swallowed and that contains information about how people come into country or other information relating to immigration offences. It is possible to imagine all sort of circumstances. For example, someone might rip out a page from a passpsort and try to swallow it. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's imagination can come up with many other possibilities.
<P>
Such cases do not happen often. We are mainly concerned with trying to prevent people from injuring themselves. However, if the powers are not in place, an arrested person might seek to conceal evidence in some way. If the immigration service is dealing with a straightforward removal, the powers are unlikely to be necessary. However, it might have to remove someone who was engaged in facilitation in the past and who might still be involved in that racket. In such cases, it might be appropriate for the immigration service to be able to secure evidence quickly. The powers will therefore be useful in the proper operation of immigration duties, but we do not expect them to be used routinely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to labour the point. I am very much in favour of giving immigration officers the powers to deal with circumstances that they might reasonably expect to encounter provided that there are no substantial reasons why they should not have them. I have outlined the concerns expressed by ILPA, but I do not intend to explore the matter further.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am glad to hear the Minister's assurance that he does not expect the powers to be used routinely. I can imagine an immigration officer attempting to search a woman in full view on an estate. Although the officers' powers restrict them to searching outer clothing, I can imagine the effect that it would have on a community if an immigration officer forced a woman to the ground and started to take off her outer clothing. That would not be calculated to improve community relations. Therefore, I was glad to hear the Minister's assurances.
<P>
Ministers are impatient with the police's reluctance to move in and arrest overstayers. However, as he acknowledged, the police must come to a judgment about community relations and they have to live in the community. Immigration officers do not live in the community; they come in, do what they have to do and leave. Therefore, I am relieved to hear that the Minister does not expect the powers to semi-strip a person in public will be routinely used.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I can further assure the hon. Lady. It is envisaged that the powers are very unlikely to be used in normal circumstances. However, in some circumstances, immigration officers might have to undertake searches. It is envisaged that only outer body searches will be carried out in public places, and only then if they are essential immediately. If a further more detailed body search is needed, it is expected that that will be done at a police station. It is not thought that some of the more intimate searches that police officers must carry out to obtain evidence will be necessary at all. Those points relate to primarily to people who carry out operations for a purely immigration purpose, so there will be a far more limited need for searches.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam raised the issue of body searches and not touching the body. His amendment would make the whole search procedure operation unworkable, and perhaps threaten safety. With the amendment, any unintentional touching of a hand or other part of the body during a search would make evidence inadmissible. Anyone trying to prevent evidence from being taken would make sure that the arrested person's body was in physical contact with the person making the arrest because that would be a good way of avoiding evidence going to court. The amendment cannot therefore be accepted. I think that what the hon. Gentleman is asking is whether we intend to carry out intimate body searches in a public place. The answer is no&#151;other than in circumstances that, by and large, I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I was trying to clarify the nature of a search. There are various categories of search. At one level, a person can be required to remove his clothing and the officer will search it visually; another is the pat-down-type search; the third is going into the clothing. It is important to clarify the type of search that would be done. My amendment would have allowed a person to take off his clothes and give them to an officer, who would do a visual search. Perhaps the Minister will clarify what he had in mind.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The intention is not to give immigration officers powers to carry out intrusive or inappropriate searches. They will receive training, with the emphasis on sensitivity, co-operation and awareness of the impact on community relations. I expect there to be many circumstances where an immigration officer will have no ground for suspecting that dangerous items, or evidence, are concealed. That is the usual situation that immigrations officers would face. There will be no need to search, except to protect a person's safety.
<P>
However, we cannot always assume that that will be so. Not all immigration offenders are law-abiding citizens. We must get the balance right, providing safeguards for an arrested person while building on procedures that also offer safety to immigration officers and others at the scene of an arrest. Fortunately, existing legislation provides a framework for that.
<P>
Clause 110 already provides safeguards applying to the police, and others who are empowered by PACE. An immigration officer must have reasonable grounds for believing that relevant items are concealed on a person; he cannot decide to search just on the off-chance. He or she can search only to the extent that it is reasonably required for the purposes of discovering such items, and can require only removal of items of outer clothing in a public place. An officer might say, ``Take off your coat and let me look at that'' and do a quick pat-down, but the aim is not to go further than that. I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons that I gave. The aim is to provide a reasonable degree of power to immigration officers to enable them to search for evidence, prevent dangerous items being retained by a person&#151;especially if it is thought that they might be used for his self-injury&#151;and to ensure that evidence can be collected during removal if it might result in others who may have committed criminal offences being detained and properly dealt with by the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> There is still some uncertainty but I will not press the amendment at this stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 427, in page 66, line 33, after `headgear', insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless the headgear has cultural or religious significance'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 447, in schedule 9, page 104, line 29, after `headgear', insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless the headgear has cultural or religious significance'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have some concerns in this area and we will need some specific assurances that perhaps go beyond those we have heard already. It is important to consider what we are authorsing in subsection (5). As we have said, the clause authorises immigration officers to search people in public. Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A power conferred by this section to search a person is not to be read as authorising an officer to require a person to remove any of his clothing in public other than an outer coat, jacket, glove, footwear or headgear''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our only problem is with headgear. We imagine that many people in religious communities and various cultures will also be worried about that. In today's society there are many people for whom headgear has a particular religious and cultural importance, going beyond the importance that others would attach to their headgear. It can be central to a person's religion or way of life and we should respect that.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not have to convince me of that argument. I will bring forward a Government amendment that will bring this into line with PACE by removing any specific reference to headgear and also footwear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Well there we are. I was not going to argue about footwear. I should be interested to hear that argument but doubtless thought has been given to that too. This debate has been useful and I shall certainly look forward to seeing the Government amendment. On the basis of what the Minister has told me I do not propose to delay the Committee any further with the amendment&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must propose the Question and then the admendment can be withdrawn. The Question is that the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On the basis of what the Minister said in his intervention, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have one further question on the power to search people in public and the gender of those searching and being searched. Could the Minister tell us what the rules will be for immigration? Will he be able to ensure that on any expedition to arrest someone where the search powers are likely to be used, the team will include an officer of the appropriate gender?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> On grounds of propriety and sensitivity if a woman is likely to be removed, it is envisaged that at least one of the immigration officers will be female. However, a male officer might go to premises not expecting to find a woman. The appropriate powers could be exercised in respect of a man who was there, but some powers might need to be exercised in respect of the woman and there will be training and guidance for officers on how to do that. We would envisage that no intimate body searches would be carried out by male officers on women who might be subject of the powers. If a personal search is required, it is envisaged that in all cases it will be done at a police station by a person of the same sex. The hon. Gentleman's concerns are rightly put and I share them, as I do his view that these things should be done in an appropriate way. It is not envisaged that people should carry out a search of the opposite sex that he or I would regard as offending propriety and sensitivities.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean (Penrith and The Border):</B> I am grateful to the Minister for setting out the position as he envisages it, but is there not a problem in the scenario that he paints? If a male officer goes to make an arrest and it turns out to be a woman, he cannot, and rightly should not, conduct the body search, which should only be done at the police station. If that woman has not been searched in some way, the officer might be vulnerable to attack or to the production of an offensive weapon. Would the officer have the right to apply handcuffs or other restraining mechanisms to the woman for his own safety, until she can be searched?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The problem applies just as much if police officers are present. Guidance is now given to police officers on how they should approach such situations.
<P>
We envisage the powers being exercised in line with the way in which the police advise and operate in such circumstances. To some extent we must rely on the judgment of those who can exercise the powers. Clearly, if an officer thinks that a woman is secreting a razor blade in her mouth, which she may then seek to use to injure herself or another, he will have to decide whether to require her to hand it over and, if necessary, he will have to use his powers of search. It is a difficult situation.
<P>
The main thing is to give the police full and proper training to ensure that the matter is handled with appropriate propriety and sensitivity throughout.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsha Singh (Bradford, West):</B> What the Minister has said does not entirely satisfy me. In certain cultures, certainly from the Indian sub-continent, contact between a male stranger and an Asian female is seen as an enormous insult. For example, about three years ago disturbances in Manningham were triggered off by a male police officer pushing an Asian woman in her own home. Those disturbances went on for two or three nights. We must tie the matter down more and I ask the Minister to consider the issue seriously.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady cannot intervene on an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to express concern about propriety and sensitivity in such circumstances. I entirely concur that such issues must be approached with great sensitivity. As a result of issues arising from the Stephen Lawrence inquiry and the way in which last April's thematic report on community relations by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary highlighted these issues, the police are increasingly developing sensitivity in dealing with such matters that goes beyond that exhibited in the past. We intend that immigration officers will have the same training in sensitivity.
<P>
In practice, the circumstances are much less likely to give rise to such issues. Circumstances in which the police have to deal with Muslim women are likely to be unexpected, but, because of the way in which immigration officers operate and we expect the powers to be used, it is likely that they will only rarely have to deal unexpectedly with a woman whom they need to remove. If it is intended to remove a woman, a female would normally attend, so the issue would not arise.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is a sensitive and important matter. There is little distance between us about the level of sensitivity with which these issues must be approached. Because of the practicalities of what we are asking immigration officers to do, they are much less likely than the police to be presented with difficulties. The risks of a problem arising from the police must be much greater because of the nature of the job.
<P>
As the Committee would expect, I cannot give an absolute guarantee, nor can I say that nothing will go wrong in any situation. However, everything that can reasonably be done to prevent something going wrong will be done. We will take account of the sensitivities mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh). In practice, such difficulties are unlikely. While the police have been able to deal with these issues in the past and are dealing with them increasingly sensitively, the immigration service will be even more anxious to ensure that it complies with the requirements of propriety.

<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> It is not just Muslims from the Indian sub-continent who may be affected. My Turkish and Kurdish constituents would be horrified if word got round an estate, for instance, that immigration officers were attempting to take off a woman's clothes in her flat, even if it was just outer garments&#151;people would not know that.
<P>
We must put the matter in context. It will not be the immigration officers taking one person out of a house. More often than not, certainly in my community, they will go on to an estate where many people from that ethnic minority community live; there will be other family members in the same flat, there will be children and there will be hysteria, because if immigration officers are coming to lift someone, that person will not want to go. I accept that the possibility of anything going wrong is minimal, but in a community like mine, once a year is once too often. I stress that no only to people from the Indian sub-continent, but to Kurds and even people from west Africa the idea of a stranger starting to touch female members of the family is horrifying.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I disagree with nothing that my hon. Friend has said and I concur with her wish to ensure that the powers are used extremely sensitively. I want to reassure her and other hon. Members that we are well aware of the need to take account of sensitivities, difficulties and propriety and to respect cultural mores and requirements, and we will do so.
<P>
We must remember that the police currently undertake many of these tasks. They would be able to intervene and say that they do not wish a certain enforcement to take place in a certain way at a certain time. They can also say that if immigration officers are going to carry out a certain enforcement, they wish to accompany them. There is no problem with that. However, should we extend immigration officers' powers to allow them to carry out enforcement in situations in which disturbances, difficulties or sensitivities are unlikely?
<P>
We envisage that immigration officers will carry out those tasks under such circumstances. If any such powers are likely to be used, it is envisaged that the police will go along. The aim is to deal with the high number of straightforward enforcement cases in which someone is waiting for an immigration officer to knock on the door and say: ``The plane is ready. Here's your car: jump in and we'll take you to the airport''.
<P>
That happens. However, there are sensitive enforcement cases. I recently dealt with one in which a woman was threatening to kill her child if the enforcement took place. As soon as the immigration officers&#151;who were accompanied by a police officer&#151;became aware of the threat, they withdrew. They then carried out observations and identified the appropriate time to go in. They had medical and police support and everything else that was needed, and effected the removal of the woman and child quickly and without problems. That was done in an extremely professional way.
<P>
The police will become involved in an enforcement if intelligence flags up a need for them to be involved. They will also be involved if they believe that they should be involved or if the immigration service believe that it would be better to involve them. Immigration officers will only turn up without police officers when both believe that a case is straightforward and cultural or special difficulties are unlikely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Minister explained that in the vast generality of cases problems will not arise and everything will be okay. However, on one or two occasions, difficulties may arise when male officers have to arrest a female or female officers have to arrest a young man. In such situations, officers will behave with sensitivity.
<P>
I accept that. The rare difficult case always causes trouble. British police have the world's most successful murder investigation record. Ninety-eight per cent. of murders are cleared up. A single foul-up&#151;like the investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence&#151;causes trouble. We have the best armed response units in the world under the tightest control. However, a foul-up, such as that which occurred in Sussex, causes trouble.
<P>
Regardless of how good training is under the Bill and regardless of the conditions that are imposed, situations will arise in which male officers going to arrest a male may be attacked by a woman trying to prevent that arrest. Therefore, those officers may have to take unexpected action to arrest that woman.
<P>
I suggest that the Minister should be given a demonstration on use of quickcuffs, so that he can discover how quickly and easily they can be applied. It is impossible for a person wearing such cuffs to attack anyone, so they are a safe way of dealing with the problem. The police already use quickcuffs and the immigration service should have the right to that solution.
<P>
Consider a male officer who suddenly has to arrest a woman; it would be quite wrong for him to conduct an intimate body search. With quickcuffs, he can safely restrain her without her injuring herself or anyone else until he gets her to the police station where female officers can carry out an intimate body search. That is probably the solution to the problem that immigration officers face.
<P>
If the immigration service does not have the right to use the simple, effective and sensible handcuffs that the whole of the British police service now use, the Minister should consider giving it that power. If it could use handcuffs, an officer detaining a woman would not have to worry about searching her. There would be no need to carry out an intimate body search until she arrived at the police station. The handcuffs would make it impossible for the woman to produce a weapon or cause injury to herself or anyone else. I put that forward as a suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says. Immigration officers will have the right to use reasonable force. I am reluctant to picture immigration officers slapping handcuffs on women, particularly in sensitive circumstances. I may be more hesitant about accepting that solution than the right hon. Gentleman. However, I note the points that have been made in the debate.

Government amendment No. 803.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Amendment No. 431 relates to subsection (2) which will allow an immigration officer to search an arrested person at a police station to see whether he has anything that he might use to cause injury, damage property, interfere with evidence or assist an escape. Will the Minister confirm that the police have similar powers to search arrested persons at police stations? I imagine that they do, but my recollection of that is rusty. The police must have such powers otherwise they would find it impossible to function. Why do immigration officers need to have the identical power, so that they can perform the task that police officers legitimately and safely perform at police stations?
<P>
Amendments Nos. 433 and 434 relate to cases in which a person is in detention at a place other than a police station. Why is the power to search not restricted until after that person arrives at a police station? The Minister will be aware that nearly all custody suites at police stations are covered by CCTV systems, which are in place primarily to protect officers from bogus claims that they have assaulted or threatened people? Even cells are covered by cameras, and interview rooms have digital recording equipment and more of them are being equipped with CCTV.
<P>
Nearly every custody suite in police stations that have cells and where searches are conducted has CCTV. Of course, small police stations do not have it, but arrested people are usually taken only to specialised arrest and search custody suites where they can be charged. Such suites are equipped with television and video. Therefore, would it not be better to take arrested persons, not to some other location, but to facilities that have all the modern kit and are geared up to cater for them?
<P>
If arrested people are taken to some other location, will the Minister tell us what sort of location he has in mind? Will they be immigration service premises or other types of secure building? Would CCTV be used there and would the search areas be kitted out similarly to modern custody suites in British police stations?
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> My amendments Nos. 983 and 984 deal with exactly the same point. Why is it necessary for immigration officers to have such powers when they relate to matters that one would imagine are the responsibility of the custody officer? The items that immigration officers are searching for should be in the custody record.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Would the Minister also consider what might happen when something goes wrong? Someone could be taken into custody in a police station and held in cells, but something could have been missed in the search and, in those circumstances, there could be a huge confusion of responsibility. Either the police or the immigration service should be responsible but, as the amendment suggests, we could have a recipe for confusion.
<P>
The police will be worried about responsibility: if something wrong happens in a police cell at a later date, the usual response will be that it is the police who failed, even though the immigration officer carried out the search. In that context, the police are likely to want to perform the search in any case, so we could end up with a double search&#151;by the immigration officer and by the police&#151;unless the police absolve themselves of the responsibility and place their entire confidence in immigration officers' searches. They may be prepared to do so, but not when things go wrong&#151;as they often do even now, unfortunately, in police custody cases.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
When something has gone wrong in a particular incident and the police have taken all the blame, they are likely to want to take control and conduct the searches themselves. In those circumstances, the immigration officer's power would be either unnecessary or lead to a duplication of effort.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The purpose of clause 111 is to provide immigration officers with the power to search persons in police custody. The clause has been modelled on section 54 of PACE to ensure consistency. I keep returning to the theme that any inconsistency between the powers of police officers and immigration officers could cause confusion and exploitation.
<P>
The concerns behind the amendments are clear. It is asked why immigration officers need powers to search people in police custody, when the police already have the power to search. The suggestion is that another search would be unnecessary.
<P>
Under current working practices, I agree that the clause would be unnecessary. Those arrested for immigration offences would be searched at police stations by the arresting police officer. An immigration officer may not be called in until some time later. However, the thrust of this part of the Bill is to empower immigration officers to carry out arrests themselves. As arresting officers, they will be presenting those arrested to custody officers at police stations. As I have already said in response to other amendments, it is essential that practices and powers dovetail, particularly where the two meet as they do here.
<P>
In the custody suite, the arresting officer presents the person who has been arrested. It is better for the person who made the arrest to carry out the search in front of the custody officer, perhaps with the protection of CCTV and of a disinterested custody sergeant overseeing the exercise. With the arresting officer carrying out the search, it will be clear that any evidence found will be part of one process.
<P>
It is possible for someone else to carry out the search, but that could produce evidential problems. One person might carry out a search on the scene, a second person might carry out another search and evidence might be found by the first but not by the second officer. That could lead to evidential confusion, when we require an element of consistency in carrying out the operation.
<P>
As I said, a custody sergeant or someone else could carry out a search, if necessary. However, it is better to have an arresting officer say, ``Turn out your pockets and put everything on the table'', and the custody sergeant make a note of it. Any search can then be carried out by the arresting officer and any other evidence will have been found by that officer. That provides a complete, straightforward link between the people carrying out their roles and is preferable to having different people carry out those roles. Therefore, we are creating a situation where the immigration officer may be the arresting officer, so it is better to maintain consistency in the way in which the evidence is presented.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 433, 431 and 434 would limit the search by an immigration officer of a person in custody to a search for evidence and would remove the proposed power allowing an immigration officer to search someone for weapons, or for other safety reasons&#151;for instance, if a razor blade were believed to be carried, as we discussed earlier. The Government's intention is to provide immigration officers with similar powers to the police so that they, instead of the police, can conduct searches when they are the arresting officer and when directed by a custody officer in the custody officer's presence at a police station, perhaps monitored by video. Indeed, multiple searches are more likely to result from the amendments.
<P>
The amendments would allow a search for evidence to be conducted by an immigration officer, but if the custody officer wanted a search to be conducted for safety reasons, as is invariably the case, he would need to call in police resources. Again, when an immigration officer who is allowed to do so is standing in front of the custody officer, he should be able to conduct a search. It is bureaucratic, wasteful and time consuming and undermines the immigration officer's role, if a police officer must be called in simply to carry out a safety search.
<P>
I therefore cannot invite the Committee to support amendments Nos. 433, 431 and 434.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 983, 984, 985 and 987 would remove the power that enables an immigration officer to search a person in custody if he or she has arrested a person for an offence; instead, the immigration officer would have access to items seized by the police. However, for the reasons that I have already set out, in a sense that misses the point of the clause. The intention is not to carry out duplicate searches. Where a search has already been carried out, it is extremely unlikely that a further search, other than for safety reasons, would be required. The only circumstances that I can envisage are where a person has been arrested for a non-immigration offence, but is subsequently found to be an immigration offender. In those circumstances it would be appropriate to search for documents or evidence relating to the immigration offence, if the police have not already retained all the documents in the person's possession when arrested. Cases where such searches will be necessary are likely to be rare, because the search will already have been done, and anything found is likely to have been found by the police officer who made the arrest.
<P>
Therefore, a person who has been arrested for an offence and who is in police custody is subject to the PACE code of practice, which covers detention, treatment and questioning. All items retained by the police will be listed on the custody record. If an immigration officer subsequently retains an item, that will have to be recorded on the custody record. The arrested person will have access to any seized material through the provisions of clause 112. The introduction of specific procedures in the police custody environment, that would apply only to immigration officers, would introduce unnecessary divergent practices that might lead to confusion, because the custody sergeant would have to have a view about how he treated immigration and police officers. If the clause is clear and consistent, it avoids confusion. Police officers and immigration officers should follow the same procedures when investigating the same offences. I therefore cannot invite the Committee to support the amendments.
<P>
Government amendment No. 803 allows documents seized under section 25C of the 1971 Act to be retained even if the person is released from police custody or is on court bail. The clause currently requires seized documents to be returned on a person's release. Release in such circumstances would not necessarily signal that removal action had ceased. Indeed, many persons subject to removal action are released on temporary restrictions while arrangements are finalised. In such circumstances, it would be appropriate to hold on to documents needed to facilitate removal. That is what the amendment would permit, and I ask the Committee to support it.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Minister said and and I am glad that he has shed some light on the intention behind the clause, which looked as if it would allow double searches for quite capricious reasons. I shall reflect on what he says, but I shall not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I listened carefully to what the Minister said. The official Opposition have no intention of trying to increase searches or to add extra bureaucracy. We thought it worthwhile to explore the reason the Government thought it necessary to give immigration officers this power when the police have it and must, as a matter of course&#151;it would be a severe disciplinary offence not to do so&#151;search prisoners in a custody suite and remove the items specified in subsection (2(a). Why should immigration officers also have to do that?
<P>
We must assume that in the vast generality of instances the Minister is right to say that initially the search would be carried out by immigration officers, therefore there would be a certain continuity, and that the person who makes the arrest and, one hopes, knows the background to the case, should be the person who conducts the search at the police station. There is a certain sense in that. It is hoped that the only occasions when there would be a second search would be if someone was arrested on another criminal charge and the police, in the course of investigating or searching the person, concluded that he might be in breach of the 1971 Act, in which case an immigration officer would have to be summoned and might wish to search. I hope to touch on a related issue in the debate on clause stand part. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I want to hear the Minister's view about how he envisages the powers in clause 110 and the clause 111 power to search people in police custody working. What I am about to say was picked up from the Minister's earlier remarks. Over time, there will be pilot exercises with immigration officers training under the police, then working hand in glove with them. Eventually the time will come when they are satisfied that they have all the necessary skills and competences, and are perhaps trusted by the wider community to carry out this operation on their own. Does the Minister therefore envisage a time when immigration officers will arrest people without police being present, and that at such times those arrested would not necessarily be taken to police stations but could be taken to other locations belonging to the immigration service and searched there, or does he still envisage that irrespective of how proficient the immigration service becomes at operating alone and making arrests, inevitably, in all circumstances, people are likely to be taken to a police station after arrest, and the powers in clause 111 used? I am not trying to catch him out; I merely wish to know whether he thinks that at some foreseeable future time the immigration service may operate the whole procedure alone and will not need the powers in the clause because suspects will not be taken to the police station.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Will the Minister clarify one other point which the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) made&#151;what happens when someone is taken into custody but the police do not search for the type of goods mentioned in subsection (2)(a), thereby committing a serious disciplinary offence? Could the Minister also clarify whether there would be other corresponding changes in the police rules and practices to allow the police to accept than an immigration officer's search was adequate, or would the custody officer be entitled, under police regulations, to accept that the search has been done by someone other than a police officer?
<P>
The clause gives an immigration officer power to make the search under instruction from a custody officer. Would the custody officer need authorisation to certify that the search was sufficient? At present, a custody officer has a responsibility that is usually carried out through a police search, and under police regulations a custody officer who did not have a proper search done would face a disciplinary procedure. Would a change be required at the police end to protect the custody officer if something went wrong? He would have authorised the immigration officer&#151;a non-police officer&#151;to conduct this vital search instead of authorising the police officer to do it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> If I may intervene before the Minister rises, I am not sure that a change in regulations is necessary. I suspect that in practice the police will invent another form, in triplicate, that the immigration officer will have to sign to indicate that he has been solely and exclusively in charge of the search, thereby exempting the custody officer from responsibility. I am not being cynical about the police service; when the Conservative Government introduced legislation on the private transfer of prisoners there had to be similar documentation, so that the private escort company knew to the second when they took charge of the prisoner and when the police service took over and vice versa. It will be a small bureaucratic measure, initiated by the police, to show who was responsible for the search and who was not legally liable. That would probably suffice.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has answered the question posed by the hon. Member for Hallam. Ways will be found to protect the custody officer. When a person is in his control, he will have to ensure that that control is properly exercised because he will then be the officer on the spot with responsibility for the prisoner. In that sense, his role does not change.
<P>
The situation is not the same as that described by the right hon. Gentleman who was formerly a Home Office Minister and knows about these things, because the private sector is not involved. It will be possible to ensure that the relationship between the police and the immigration service is properly defined.
<P>
We want to create a working relationship so that the two roles dovetail. When investigating an offence, an immigration officer usually takes the alleged offender to the police station. The search will normally take place at that point.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me whether a search could take place elsewhere; the answer is yes, if a peson was in detention. It could be the case that someone was detained in order to be removed. He could either be removed to a police station to be held temporarily, in which case the rules that we discussed would apply or, as the right hon. Gentleman suggested, he could be taken to a detention centre. The powers already exist for detention custody officers to carry out the usual searches of any person who is detained. Those are the only likely circumstances in which such a search would need to be carried out.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 111, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 112</center></H4>
<H4><center>Access and copying</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 964, in page 71, line 17, leave out `a reasonable time' and insert `one week'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 965, in page 72, line 14, leave out `a reasonable time' and insert `one week'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> These are small amendments. Clause 112 concerns access to material that has been seized in searches and the opportunity for seized material to be photographed or copied. The clause provides that if a person asks for seized material to be copied it must be done within a reasonable time. The amendment specifies that the photocopy or copy should be supplied within one week. The amendment was suggested by ILPA to ensure that evidence cannot be withheld for an unascertainable length of time as that might jeopardise the ability of the person involved to make his case.
<P>
I understand the reluctance of the Government&#151;any Government&#151;to accept rigid time limits, because failure to keep to that limit, even by a few hours, could result in a case being rejected in court. Nevertheless, if the Minister cannot accept a fixed time limit perhaps he can be more specific about what is meant by ``within a reasonable time''. Does he envisage a reasonable time being within seven days, with a bit of luck, or three weeks or perhaps, if things go at the lawyers' normal speed, six months? I hope that the Minister will cast a little light on what is meant by ``a reasonable time''.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> How long would the man on the Clapham omnibus, to use Lord Denning's phrase, regard as reasonable? The amendments would require copies or photographs of the material seized by an immigration officer to be supplied within one week of a request being made instead of within a reasonable period, as the clause allows. In many circumstances, one week may be a reasonable time in which to expect a copy or photograph to be supplied. If it is reasonable, the immigration officer will be obliged to comply with the clause as drafted.
<P>
Let us suppose, however, that one week was not reasonable because access was not readily available or because special arrangements had been made because of the quantity, size or nature of the material to be copied or photographed. In some circumstances, 10 days, two weeks or any other period may be considered reasonable.
<P>
The term ``within a reasonable time'' will not give an immigration officer carte blanche to take as long as he wishes; he will be required to justify any period that appears to be unreasonable. In my experience, courts are now strongly aware that prosecuting authorities should present evidence as quickly as possible to ensure that it is properly disclosed.
<P>
This is not new legal territory; the clause is based on section 21 of PACE, which requires police officers to supply copies or photographs within a reasonable time. It is regarded as satisfactory for the police and there is no reason why it should not be satisfactory for the immigration service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> We are grateful for the Minister's remarks. Some material may later be returned because it is not needed, but there are no provisions on the destruction of material that may have been copied, although they may appear later in the Bill.
<P>
The Minister said that the phrase is also used in PACE, but I am aware of two occasions on which the police have held on to property or papers for far longer than was justified. They took some time to release the papers, or copies of them, even though they were material to the business of someone who was on bail.
<P>
I draw the Minister's attention to the curious case of Sergeant Gurpal Virdi, in which material placed in a police locker was found some time later in a different police station. My understanding of the procedures is that material held in a police station must be signed and examined every eight hours. No explanation has been given of how a man's property can, without his authority, be taken from one police station to another, and held for an unreasonable time. I do not expect the Minister to comment on the matter now, as disciplinary proceedings may have taken place, but I should like an explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> When documents relate to an individual's immigration status, it is important to ensure that the definition of reasonableness means that a person can always get hold of his documents before any outstanding legal action. Although the officers will presumably have had a strong case in order to use the powers of arrest and search, the individual may be going through a complex process of appealing against decisions on his immigration status. I hope the Minister will reassure us that ``within a reasonable time'' will always allow a person to regain the documents necessary for any outstanding legal process, because such a person may be about to be removed from the country. Failure to gain access to his documents may mean that he cannot continue a legal process that would prevent his removal and once an individual is removed it is too late. It is of little use for the documents to be returned at that point.
<P>
I hope that ``reasonable time'' will be a shorter period than the time that it takes the Immigration and Nationality Directorate at Croydon to return the documents it has seized in order to extend a person's leave to remain or for other immigration purposes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response. I am confident that in the vast majority of cases ``within a reasonable time'' will possibly be within seven days. The concern, however, must be the point raised by the hon. Member for Hallam.
<P>
It does not matter if it takes the immigration service three weeks to provide the copy, provided that an appeal is not pending the next day. If an appeal or access to the court is imminent it is vital to have documents returned or a copy produced within a reasonable time, well before that appeal. I do not wish to press the amendment. I accept the Minister's assurance of reasonable time, but reasonable time is not just the time that they have had the documents but the gap between returning them and the court case. That is the crucial time.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Worthing, West. Material will be retained only as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was seized. It must then be returned. The aim is to ensure that material that does not need to be returned and that is going to be destroyed at that point will be dealt with in the normal way by the police. Obviously, fingerprint issues are dealt with elsewhere. I am having a little difficulty in contemplating the possible circumstances in which the hon. Gentleman's problem might present itself. It is envisaged that material retained will be returned quickly if it is no longer necessary. It is not likely that much material will need to be destroyed. We are not dealing with people who are likely to have a lot of drugs or anything like that. If they did it would be dealt with under entirely separate rules by the police.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West asked me about the police taking too long to release material. That is a similar point to that raised by the hon. Member for Hallam and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. There have been delays in the past in returning material. That is always unfortunate. The powers are there for courts to deal with these matters. We need the courts to use those powers robustly not only in the case of immigration officers, if that becomes necessary, but in the case of the police, so that prosecuting authorities comply with the requirements to do things within a reasonable time. That means reasonable time not only to produce it, but so that the defence or the individual in the case of a removal can use it in an appropriate way. The powers to deal with those issues are there and this will put them in place for immigration officers. We must ensure that the courts use those powers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West mentioned the case of Gurpal Virdi. I cannot comment on the individual circumstances of the case and he will understand that. The hon. Member for Hallam mentioned the return of passports. There was a special exercise over Easter and I am assured that in the vast majority of cases now if the hon. Gentleman seeks the return of his passport from Lunar house or from the Whitgift centre in normal circumstances, and with the usual caveats, he should get it within a day. Sometimes it takes some time to carry out all the appropriate investigations to get a new stamp or to assess and make a decision about continuation of stay issues that might have been raised by the applicant. Getting the passport back might be easy but getting the right stamp on it might be another matter.
