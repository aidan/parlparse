Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): Once again,
Mr. Bercow, it is a delight to see you in the Chair. I was
in full flow when time was called on the morning sitting, and I would
now like the Minister to clarifyan issue concerning charges
over assets. It is my understanding that, once a deal has been done,
when payments of an amount have been made over a certain period, and
once the agreed debt has been pegged down, individuals will not incur
additional charges should they suddenly gain further assets. Will the
Minister clarify that?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000386"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):
						</b> The essential precondition for a charging order is
a judgmentdebt. Before going to court, the parties may reach a
compromise. If the hon. Gentleman lends me &#163;10,000 and I say
that I will never be able to pay it back, but then say that I will
repay &#163;5,000 in six months, we can make an agreement on that
basis. I get half my debt remitted and the hon. Gentleman gets
&#163;5,000 when he might have had nothing. If we agree to such a
contract, there will be no debt left. If I subsequently come into
further assets, there will be no debt on which to charge those assets.
I hope that that clarifies the matter.</div>
					<a name="07032279000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should make it clear, if I
did not do so earlier, that there is no intention that a charging order
should be converted to an order for sale while the debtor is still 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>paying their instalment order. The measure offers extra protection, but
it is not intended to be used in thatway. With that, I hope
that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.

Minister saying that, if instalments are being paid on time and the
instalment register is up to date at all times, there cannot be an

regulations?</div>

							<b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): I want to
ask the Minister about one of the provisions in the clause. I was going
to raise the issue when speaking about amendment No. 136, but it has
been withdrawn. The amendment addresses a kind of
mediation&#151;steps that could be taken beforehand so that people
would not get into the difficulties involved with charging orders and
possession orders. It seems to me that that area is absolutely one for
the courts, and that the mediation process and some informality are
valuable.</div>
					<a name="07032279000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will recall our earlier debate on how, even when there has
been no failure in payment, people can return to court and ask for a
charge. With respect to enforcement of charging orders, other
enforcement, and changes in debtors&#146; obligations, what
facilitieswill be in place to ensure that all courts offer an
opportunity for agreement and negotiation before matters are heard by a
judge? Are people offered the chance of some sort of mediation or
arbitration in all county courts and High Courts, along with referral
to appropriate agencies? The more that that can happen instead of
litigation, the
better.</div>

							<a name="07032279000393"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> There is never anything to stop one party to a
court case discussing the case with the other party. That can occur
through mediation that is initiated from within the community, for
which several schemes are available, or through a more formal process.
In many county courts there is now every encouragement for some sort of
proportionate dispute resolution. Pre-action notices and pre-action
protocols are alsobeing piloted in various jurisdictions with
the intentionof building a mediation or proportionate dispute
resolution element into court proceedings. Nowadays, the whole civil
justice system is geared to the assumption that one goes to court only
as a last resort. Even when people apply to court, it still has the
opportunity to persuade them to take a different course rather than
rely on its adjudication powers. There is therefore already every
opportunity for what the hon. Gentleman
desires.</div>
					
					<a name="07032279000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000394"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I shall push the Minister a little further, if I
may. I am thinking of a situation whereby, today or tomorrow, she, I or
you, Mr. Bercow, go to Lambeth county court or Westminster
county court in the context of an enforcement proceeding. I am trying
to establish whether the court official who first dealt with the
case&#151;the listing officer who handled the paperwork&#151;would
say, from the beginning and as a matter of course, to applicants,
debtors or creditors, &#147;Are you aware that there is someone who
may be able to help you with this?&#148; If the problem were with a
debtor, would the official ask whether the debtor was aware of the
existence of money advice centres and ascertain whether the debtor had
spoken to such a centre? Would the official inform that person of the
centre&#146;s opening
times?</div>
					<a name="07032279000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know
that, with a bit of advice, people can often get out of a hole. For
instance, people can be persuaded to transfer their bank or credit
company obligations to a credit union that will not charge an annual
percentage rate of 27.5 per cent. So is there an assumption in all
parts of the court system&#151;county courts and High
Courts&#151;that people should be proactively pointed towards money
advice and resolution before the case is listed? Creditors might want
people to go straight to court, so are court officers obliged to
consider alternatives&#151;I hesitate to use the term &#147;cooling
off
period&#148;?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000395"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> There is nothing to stop debtors from switching
their debt to a credit union if they want to. I cannot see what that
has to do with the courts. People might or might not know that they can
do
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07032279000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000397"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> But the court may not know whether a credit union
exists in the area. They do not exist in every
area.</div>
					<a name="07032279000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Various piloted
pre-action protocols are on the go that involve more or less formal
offers of mediation, as the case may be. There are, of course, civil
procedure rules that create a general duty on all parties coming to
court to settle before the hearing. They are backed up with the ability
to make an adverse costs order so that, if the creditor had not taken
the steps to which the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>Gentleman referred, the situation might be deemed unreasonable and
produce an adverse consequence if there was an obvious way out of the
difficulty. At various stages in the procedures, the court will send
notices about where advice is available. Sometimes, it is available at
the court itself. Realistically, every effort is made to ensure that
the court is, as it is intended to be, only a last resort. I hope that
my explanation has satisfied the hon. Gentleman, because I have nothing
more to say about the
clause.</div>

different objectives. I am keen on the matter. Perhaps those who
administer our courts will read the report of our proceedings. If they
are not in one of the famous pilot areas, they might reflect on whether
their processes give the maximum opportunity for people to be pointed
in the direction of other court processes that can resolve the issue. I
shall reflect on what the hon. and learned Lady said. Obviously, we can

Bellingham:
						</b> I have a quick question about the clause. This
part of the Bill is headed &#147;Information requests and
orders&#148;. Given the title of the clause 90, I am intrigued by the
wording of the provision because it states that a person who is the
creditor in relation to a judgment
debt</div>
					<a name="07032279000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may apply to the
High Court or a county court for information about what kind of action
it would be appropriate to take in
court&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032279000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my experience
of such issues, albeit many years ago, I should not have thought that
there was any need to apply to the court for the information. It should
be readily available anyway. Is the clause simply a back-up measure for
that small number of extremely rare cases when the information is not
readily available so that, if a creditor wants to enforce a debt, he
would have to take the matter to court by way of an application to find
the information? Will the Minister elaborate on the
process?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000400"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> It is the gateway for creditors to get the
information request or the order that they need. Asthe hon.
Gentleman rightly pinpointed, it is not about the creditor being
advised about what is available as a route to recovery. The clause
opens up the possibility of obtaining information that will undoubtedly
steer the way forward for the judgment creditor. If the court can
supply, for example, a new employer, the obvious way forward would be
to attach the earnings. However, if a new address or a new national
insurance number was available under the provisions to follow, that
would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>point in another direction to a different enforcement. The clause is a
gateway provision to enable requests for information to be
made.</div>

						</b> The group of amendments is about finding out
exactly what information can be gleaned from Departments. I am
concerned about clause 91(2), which
states:</div>
					<a name="07032279000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
relevant court may make one or more of the following in relation to the
debtor...(a) a departmental information request; (b) an

states:</div>
					<a name="07032279000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
relevant court may not make a departmental information request to the
Commissioners unless regulations are in
force&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032279000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
effectively states that requests for information can be put to a
Department, although it does not specify which
one.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07032279000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07032279000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that we look more closely at what is entailed. I am concerned, as are
many people, that the tendency of all Governments in this age of
hi-tech and IT is to try to accumulate more information
abouttheir subjects and to centralise information. In that way
they can have more control over us. Looking forward to what will be
possible in future, with further technological advances, I envisage
many Departments holding a lot of information on
citizens.</div>
					<a name="07032279000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 91(2)
enables a creditor to ask a court to secure information from a
Department about the status&#151;possibly even the financial
status&#151;of the debtor. What protection is there for the debtor?
How much information can be released? What constraints will there be on
a Department in terms of releasing such information? What about
confidentiality of information and data? In the other place, Baroness
Ashton of Upholland addressed some of those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>concerns and mentioned that specified pieces of information could be
made available, particularly from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs. However, having read her response to the short debate in the
Houseof Lords, I am concerned about the paucity of the
evidence that she gave, which was able to satisfy the noble Lords that
this would not be an intruder&#146;scharter and not an
opportunity for Departments to supply information on debtors that might
be highly
confidential.</div>
					<a name="07032279000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
greatly concerned about the principle ofbeing able to get such
information from a range of Departments. Our amendment would
removeclause 91(2)(a) and (b) and delete subsection (5) and
the references to Departments, because we believe that the clause is
going too far. I will not push your good will, Mr. Bercow,
by mentioning clause 92, which gives more information about what sort
of information can be released. We are looking at the
principle&#151;</div>

Mr. Bercow, but I will not push your good will to its
literal conclusion. You are right. I did not want to go into too much
detail on clause 92, because no specific amendments to it have been
tabled, but I take your point that we can discuss it in under this
group.</div>
					<a name="07032279000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 92 lists
the type of information that can be requested. The Minister may argue
that it is limited, simple and basic, but what is
&#147;prescribed information&#148;? Will that be made clear in the
regulations? Should we really give creditors this amount of power to go
to Departments? If we trusted the Government to play fair with
consumers, customers and citizens in respect of how information is
released already, I would be a great deal more content and relaxed.
However, I am not content and relaxed, which is why I have tabled the
amendments and moved my
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): I want to comment on the
points raised by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk. I share his
concerns about the requirement to ensure that information available is
well protected in order to safeguard people&#146;s right to privacy.
However, I have a question, to which I would like him to respond, if
possible. The Conservatives have said that they would like to remove
entirely from the Bill departmental information requests, but also to
provide in clause 92 for extra information to be made available to
creditors&#151;in particular, on driving licence numbers and vehicle
registrations. I am confused by the idea that at the same time as
wanting no information made available, there is a request for
additional information. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could
clarify that
point.</div>

							<a name="07032279000407"></a>Mr.

						</b> I am happy to explain the situation to the
hon. Lady. If my amendments are accepted by the Government and the
ability to go to Departments is taken out of the Bill, clause 92 would
have a different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>application. We suggest that the Committee accept my amendments, but if
it does not, and the provisions in clause 91 remain, I shall not
discuss driving licences and vehicle registration&#151;at this stage.
However, such information is basic and could not be regardedas
confidential. I am concerned about Big Brother breathing down the necks
of citizens and obtaining more and more confidential data. I appreciate
the hon. Lady&#146;s point. On the face of it, our stance might seem
illogical and I appreciate her giving me the chance to explain
it.</div>

hon. Member for North-West Norfolk made and to ask the Minister some
questions.</div>
					<a name="07032279000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
we have welcome processes in place for data protection, as well as
legislation on freedom of information. I assume that if the Bill is
passed, the provisions before us will override the current
data-protection arrangements. I should be grateful to know whether they
go down the route that the hon. Gentleman suggested and will make
further inroads into what personal data is protected. Is this a change
in the law or is this retaining the current position? If it is a change
in the law on access to further data, what steps have the Government
taken to talk to the data protection authorities to ensure that the
Information Commissioner is comfortable with the new procedures? Will
the Minister reassure us that objective people outside Government have
looked at the matter and said that there is nothing to worry
about?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000410"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> A lot of objective people inside Government have
taken account of data protection. I know that the hon. Gentleman has
never been in Government, and I am only a lance corporal myself, but
such matters are discussed across Government. Legislative clearance
must be given by all Departments to all legislation. We do not go
sneaking things on to the statute book without telling our colleagues
in other Departments and then say, &#147;Aha, we have got you
now!&#148; Obviously, the provisions before us are a change in the
law. But are they quite as terrifying as people are suggesting? Look at
the information that can be requested&#151;name, address, date of
birth and national insurance number of the debtor. That is not
terrifying stuff. One must be a judgment creditor before being entitled
to apply for such information. Palpably,the gateway provision
that I have just discussed with the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk
deals with the difficulties of enforcement. Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs might possess information necessary just to click
things into place and permit the enforcement of a debt that the court
has said ought to be
enforced.</div>
					<a name="07032279000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such a
situation, the information would be disclosed not to the creditor, but
to the court. That is why the gateway provision is important. The
creditor could then ask the court, &#147;How should I proceed from
here?&#148;, and the court could say, &#147;Well, why don&#146;t
you go down the attachment-of-earnings route or some other
route?&#148; It will have information to direct the
creditor.</div>

							<a name="07032279000412"></a>Vera

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>It is not a general catch-all. It
mustbe carefully dealt with. What we are looking at is
nomenclature changes in Government or some Government services. In
other words, changing the means by which information is requested. We
have no intention of asking for sensitive tax information, which may be
held by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. There is a control
over the use of any power, which is that it must be compatible with the
purpose set out. There will be no conceivable purpose in disclosing
sensitive tax information to a court whose sole function is to
implement a judgment debt. Therefore, the court could not ask for it
and would not get
it.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>I did not think for a moment that the hon.
Lady was being stroppy. However, I think that I have answered her
question. There are tough criminal sanctions for anybody who misuses
that kind of information, and I am sure that that is reassuring. Since
the information will go not to the creditor but to the court, I think
that all concerns about Big Brother can be set firmly aside. I have
made it clear that &#147;prescribed information&#148; will be for
the purposes that I have said&#151;technical changes in how to
approach a Department or to access the way it stores its information. I
have also made it clear that there is a control over the use of any
power, according to its purpose. Given that the court is interested
only in accessing that information to enable the proper and due
obtaining of a debt, it cannot seek any sensitive information, and such
information would not and could not be disclosed. A judgment creditor
will make a request to the Department for information. The court will
process that request and then advise how to enforce the debt. The
information will go no further than the court; it will not go back to
the
creditor.</div>

							<a name="07032279000415"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am grateful to the Minister,
butI have two ancillary questions. First, once the application
has been made and the court has answered the question, how long does
the court then hold on to the information and, physically, what happens
to it? Is it destroyed? It is a question about the guarantee that the
debtor has that there is not a lot of information about them around the
place.</div>
					<a name="07032279000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, does
the debtor have the right at every stage to ask for any information
held by the courts to be made available to them? I presume that they
do. How do they do that? Are they alerted to the factthat the
court has the information? Just as we are all entitled to pay our money
and get a credit reference print-out&#151;I think that we can all do
that if we want to&#151;does the same apply here? If someone wants
access to the information held by a court, or which they believe to be
held by a court, can they make an inquiry? Will the court give them an
accurate answer? Will it tell them whether it holds such information,
since when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>and until when? Will the court tell them what the information is, if it
is asked? Does a debtor have to pay for such information. What is the
process if the debtor wants to know what is going
on?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000416"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman has slipped back into pub
quiz mode again. The information that we are talking about is the
man&#146;s name, address, date of birth and his national insurance
number, and that is it. We do not want to know the name of his latest
mistress or how much he owes the Inland Revenue or anything else at
all. There is nothing in this that changes the general law about the
information rights of an individual. The court will give them notice
that an order has been sought and the court will give them the
information that they ask for, but I cannot imagine anyone wasting
their time asking whether it has their name or not. The debtor will
already know that there has been a request. If they want to, they can
block such a request, but it will be very hard to block if someone
already has a judgment debt before them. What else can I tell the hon.
Gentleman so that he feels that he has had answers to his questions? If
the information is not to be used, it will be destroyed. If it is to be
used, it will not be destroyed; it will be used. Is that satisfactory?
Can I do
more?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000417"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I will ask one last question. Obviously, people
know what their name and address is. I was more concerned about the
more general information in the prescribed information category. Fine,
I understand that if the information is not to be used, it will be
destroyed, but I presume that the court keeps it for a period. Again, I
am not trying to elicit information that is difficult to find, but
there is a normal procedure whereby information is held by authorities
for a certain time. If the police have information, they are entitled
by law to hold it for a certain time&#151;some information
indefinitely and some for a certain period. Does the Minister know
whether there is a one-year limit? Can she tell us or point me in the
right direction? Her compendious knowledge, with the help of her civil
servants, as to where all these bits of information are to be found is
greater than the compendious knowledge even of all of us on the
Opposition side of the

knowledge or that of my civil servants? There is no change to data
protection; there is no change for the Information Commissioner; there
is no change to all the things that we have grown used to in the
legislation. So that he has perhaps a better grasp of what
&#147;prescribed information&#148; means, let me set out what the
provision might also enable the court to request.</div>
					<a name="07032279000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">After careful consideration by
the Government, and with the agreement of Revenue and Customs, it might
be possible to use prescribed information as a category to request the
details of the owners of a limited company if something were standing
between, as it were, the creditor and the name and address of that
person. It would not simply follow that it was the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>debtor&#146;s name and address, because the name and address of the
debtor could be that of Smith and Brown Ltd, and perhaps under
prescribed information, in certain circumstances, people would want to
go beyond that to get the actual people whose money they wanted to get
at. That is, I think, the broadest category to which those who assist
me have considered that the application of prescribed information might
extend. We will set that out in regulations, of course, if it ever
comes to pass, and there is a retention schedule, apparently, which is
applicable to all information held by Her Majesty&#146;s Courts
Service.</div>

							<a name="07032279000430"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a
Second time.</div>
					<a name="07032279000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is simple and straightforward, but significant because we want
to define household income in relation to attachment of earnings orders
to make it absolutely clear that the key relevant figure to be
considered by the court is net household income.It is
important to consider liabilities and define household
income.</div>
					<a name="07032279000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">When an
attachment of earnings order is made, there should be a clear
definition of the earnings that are to be attached so that, if there
are extra overheads or other liabilities, they can be taken into
account. I imagine that a court would normally do that, and of course
it will use common sense and judgment to consider the income, overheads
and commitments of a family. They may have young children, an elderly,
ill relative or other commitments, or mortgages might suddenly go up or
the household runs into major problems over managing its income and
making it go as far as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07032279000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all come
across such examples in our constituencies, not least as a consequence
of actions&#151;even rightful actions&#151;by the Child Support
Agency. People come to our constituency surgeries and talk about the
problems that they face as a result of attachment of earnings orders,
and they often argue convincingly that some of the liabilities and
outgoings in their household are not catered for or taken care of. Most
of the time, the courts will get that right. They will consider the
overall picture and make a decision that is fair and
balanced.</div>
					<a name="07032279000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
courts have guidance on deciding on the attachment of earnings order,
but what other guidance is there? Will there be any guidance in the
regulations? Would it not make sense for a new clause specifically to
lay down what can be considered? Is there not merit in having a clause
to assess household income and make the rights of a debtor absolutely
clear? Above all, it should be made clear that the debtor must make the
information available, but at the same time the court must listen to
what the debtor is saying so that we end up with a completely balanced,
fair picture of the situation.</div>
					<a name="07032279000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the spirit of what I have
said, I hope that the Minister will consider the new clause carefully,
constructively and favourably.</div>

							<a name="07032279000433"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> It certainly does not seem to attach to one
particular part of the Bill, although the hon. Gentleman has mostly
talked about attachment of earnings orders, so that is perhaps what he
is primarily concerned about.</div>
					<a name="07032279000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar amendments were tabled
in Grand Committee in the Lords by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s noble
Friend Lord Kingsland. We understood then that the amendments had come
from a lobby group that was worried about the rise in creditors and
thought that indebtedness should be assessed at household level 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>rather than that of the debtor. If that is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
purpose, we are deeply opposed to it. It should be the debtor and the
debtor&#146;s income only that are taken into account.</div>
					<a name="07032279000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make a slightly more
technical point. The way in which deductions are calculated for all
varieties of attachment of earnings order are in the Attachment of
Earnings Act 1971. The new clause, standing free in the Bill, would not
interface with that Act. Attachment of earnings orders are used by lots
of Departments and many branches of the judicial system, and not only
by those with which we are dealing. We run the risk of a fundamental
change to the law having an effect on those areas outside this
Department&#146;s remit.</div>
					<a name="07032279000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal would replace the
existing attachment of earnings order system with fixed tables. The
court would not determine the debtor&#146;s means exactly, as such,
and it would be the debtor&#146;s earnings from which the deductions
were made by the employer. There are obvious practical reasons why that
would be difficult to change, but there are legal principles, too. When
an attachment of earnings order or any form of execution are concerned,
we should consider the debtor&#146;s income, because it is their
debt. That seems central to us; it should not relate to other income in
the household. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman appreciated
that that would follow, because what is being spoken of is household
income.</div>
					<a name="07032279000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is that if I, as a mother, had a debt and my grown-up sons lived with
me, they would have to submit to an assessment under the provision to
see whether it would be appropriate for their income to be lent to me
to get rid of my debt. What should be considered is what I am earning
and at what rate I can pay off the debts. That is the mischief of the
new clause, and I hope that I have made that clear. A new means form
will be developed for the attachment of earnings procedures, which will
cover lots of information. I imagine that it will cover all the
information that anybody would wish it to. The court will carry out a
thorough investigation before it makes any orders at
all.</div>

					<a name="07032279000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have satisfied the hon. Gentleman that the proposal is mischievous
rather than helpful, and that there are satisfactory provisions in
place that will be superseded by a thorough means form. It will ensure
that appropriate generosity is given to poor debtors and that
appropriate, fair enforcement is provided for
creditors.</div>

						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07032279000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister will be sympathetic to the new clause. It was tabled
specifically followingan approach by Vivien Gambling, the
chair of the Housing Law Practitioners Association, a well-regarded
organisation of which the Minister will know. I shall describe the new
clause as the association does, as the proposition comes via us from
the association.</div>
					<a name="07032279000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is concerned with the manner in which orders for possession
of land are enforced. The current law allows a lender or landlord to
enforce an order for eviction in the county court by completing an
administrative form in the court office. That might result in the
enforcement of the order without notice to the occupier, and without
lender or landlord having to give evidence of any breach. The risk of
injustice to the occupier is obvious. In the High Court the party
seeking a possession order has to apply for permission on notice for a
warrant to issue.</div>
					<a name="07032279000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would align the procedures across all civil courts, so the
risk of injustice would not arise. A short supplementary note was
prepared by Nowsheen Bhatti, the association&#146;s parliamentary
officer, which it will be helpful to put on the record as it completes
the
argument:</div>
					<a name="07032279000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
vast majority of possession orders are made against tenants of social
landlords (councils and housing associations) and home-owners (mortgage
borrowers). The bulk of those are orders &#145;suspended&#146; or
&#145;postponed&#146; on terms which provide that the order shall
not be enforceable so long as the occupier complies with certain
conditions (e.g. to pay the mortgage instalments or the rent or to
comply with other tenancy conditions). A lender or landlord wishing to
enforce an unconditional order or a &#145;suspended&#146; or
&#145;postponed&#146; order (e.g. in the belief that the terms have
not been complied with) may obtain a bailiffs warrant for eviction in
the County Court by the simple completion of an administrative
form...In the High Court, the practice ...is currently
reflected in the Rules of the Supreme Court RSC Ord 45 r3)...The
need for such amendment was well demonstrated by the case of a council
tenant who was evicted while going in and out of hospitals for
treatment {Leicester CC v Aldwinkle [1992] 24HLR 49). In that case, the
Court of Appeal said that the injustice would not have arisen had the
practice of the County Court been the same as that of the High Court.
This amendment is long
overdue.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032279000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
my constituency experience, I can say that that is a common state of
affairs. It might be slightly different in other constituencies; I
think that I still represent a larger proportion of council tenants
than any of my colleagues in England. Such situations arise often with
council property and, as the notes said, they arise with similar
frequency with social housing, housing association and housing trust
property. They also arise in the context of people who are paying off a

<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>mortgage. People regularly get into trouble. Cases regularly end up
going to court and the court, in the first place, normally makes a
suspended possession order and lays down the conditions. If we
believe&#151;as we do, and the law has obviously established the
principle&#151;that nobody can be deprived of their occupancy without
a court making that decision, it seems absolutely vital in the
interests of justice that, if someone is on notice that they might lose
their possession and matters then develop, there should at least be an
opportunity for a hearing before a judge who can weigh the balance of
the argument.</div>
					<a name="07032279000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
case cited&#151;the Leicester city council case&#151;was a case
where somebody was in hospital. There may be many circumstances where
entirely unforeseen and unpredictable events arise: somebody may have a
heart attack or a stroke, suffer bereavement, have a terrible accident,
become mentally ill, be coping with the severe illness or death of a
relative, and so on. Therefore, it is not sufficient that a piece of
paperwork turns the threat over someone&#146;s head into the reality
of people coming to throw them out. I hope that this measure is
something that the Minister can be sympathetic to and I commend the new
clause to the Minister and hon. Members in all parts of the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07032279000436"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> The new clause is not related to any provision in
the Bill; it is an attempt to compel the Civil Procedure Rules
Committee to amend the rules about enforcement of possession orders. I
heard what the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said
about justice, but this procedure has been found to be entirely
compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998 by the Court of Appeal.
Consequently, there is no clash with justice implicit in the
procedure.</div>
					<a name="07032279000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally, we have a Civil
Procedure Rules Committee to which the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituent can rightly direct submissions for changes to the civil
procedure rules through the hon. Gentleman, by writing in any way and
at any time that she wishes. Perhaps she has already done so. The
Committee will take her comments into account. There is absolutely no
doubt that it considers carefully all the procedural rules that are
required and amends them as and where necessary.</div>
					<a name="07032279000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament has given the
responsibility for changing the civil procedure rules to that
Committee; thereis no justification, in this instance, for
removing that responsibility. There is a parliamentary procedure for
objecting to rule changes by the Committee, and the Government are
content with that position.</div>

						</b> That is a less sympathetic response than I would
have hoped for. The Minister is right and, of course, there is a Civil
Rules Procedure Committee and a Courts Rules Committee. However, we are
just about to deal with the rules of the county court. The Bill is
amending the way in which our courts act. We have just dealt with a
part headed &#147;Enforcement of judgments and orders&#148;. The
new clause is entirely in line with those issues: it concerns
enforcement of judgments. Elsewhere, the Bill deals with both the
legislation and regulation of courts. The Minister and her colleagues
have spatchcocked into the Bill a measure that we will come to later,
related to works of art, which appears to be entirely unrelated to
anything 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>else in the Bill. It is certainly far less connected with these matters
than the new clause.</div>
					<a name="07032279000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government are used to
accommodating something that is appropriately linked to a Bill. I ask
the Minister to think again about the new clause. If I may say so, her
reaction was an instinctive procedural reaction as to why another route
is better. Here is a legislative opportunity to do something that we
could do easily. I am not aware that there has been any great objection
anywhere in the profession or, indeed, in the judiciary, to the
measure. It seems to be an opportunity for a Labour Government to
implement a bit of social justice. The Minister keeps telling us how
committed she is to social justice. I hope that this is an opportunity
for her to confirm her commitment to that ideal and to say that this
measure is a way of ensuring that we have fewer people out on the
streets as a result of some failure of the system than we would
otherwise have. I hope that she might
reconsider.</div>

am afraid. This has absolutely nothing to do with social justice, but
with us in Government not wanting to order the High Court judge who
runs the civil procedure rules committee to get his act together and do
a summersault just to please the hon. Gentleman. He can write to the
High Court judge, using all his measureless rhetorical power, to try
and persuade the judge to change the rule. That is the right procedure

pressing.</div>
					<a name="07032279000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In seeking
to move our amendments Nos. 163 to 167, we are looking at the repayment
requirement that can be imposed on debtors who are placed under an
administrative order by a county court. To be clear to the Minister,
this is a probing amendment. We are trying to establish who is in
control of determining the repayment requirement imposed on debtors. My
concern with the clause is that there seems to be two sources of
authority when it comes to determining the requirement. First is the
implied discretion of the court making the order&#151;I emphasise
implied. Second is the regulations to be made in due course by the Lord
Chancellor.</div>
					<a name="07032279000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 163 to 166 seek to make the discretion of the court explicit, not
implicit. Amendment No. 163 specifically gives the court discretion
over whether the debtor must pay scheduled debts in full or to some
other extent. AmendmentNo. 164 would ensure that the court has
discretion over arrangements made in respect of several different
creditors. That is vital because only the court is in the proper
position to be aware of special circumstances that may affect the
treatment of different creditors; meaningful guidance would be
difficult to offer simply by regulation. Amendment No. 165 makes it
clear that the court has discretion over ordinary payments other than
by instalment, when there are appropriate circumstances. Amendment No.
166 tackles the rather ominous stipulation that
the</div>
					<a name="07032279000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;repayment
requirement may include provision in addition to any that is required
or permitted by this
section.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032279000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
stipulates that any such inclusion is also at the court&#146;s
discretion and cannot spring, like a jack-in-the-box, from regulations
that are yet to
appear.</div>
					<a name="07032279000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the very
least, the clause must distinguish more clearly between what the court
may make a condition of an administrative order, at its discretion, and
what it must do, as required by the regulations. Administration orders
will be used by vulnerable people in difficult circumstances. I believe
that the clause, as drafted, will sow the seeds for conflict between
proper judicial discretion and administrative prescription. I should
like the Minister&#146;s assurance that no such conflict is
anticipated. The amendment is thus just a probing
amendment.</div>

167 is an attempt to clarify what the Government intend by the

lump sums, in addition to instalments. That is not necessarily a

has a meagre income stream but access to a lump sum, the lump sum
should be available for use in settling the debt. However, it is

					<a name="07032279000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The repayment
requirement is based on payment by instalments, but instalments are, to
my mind, merely sums of money provided at agreed times in part
settlement of a debt. It is perfectly conceivable for one large initial
instalment to be followed by several smaller, regular instalments.
Indeed, that is common practice in credit agreements that I have seen,
whenthe first sum represents a deposit or when there is an
agreed scope to vary instalments depending on an individual&#146;s
circumstances. Credit card debt is predicated entirely on the principle
that payments are regular but that the amounts vary depending on the
debtor&#146;s available resources. They are still instalments in
settlement of a debt. It would therefore be in the spirit of an
instalment plan for the court to require one or more lump sums followed
by smaller regular payments based on surplus income.</div>
					<a name="07032279000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me rather
complicated and potentially confusing to tell a debtor, &#147;Here is
your initial instalment plan, but the court may still ask you for
additional lump sums on top of that.&#148; I should welcome the
Minister&#146;s comments on whether an instalment plan, within the
normal meaning of the phrase, is capable of achieving what the
Government intend, without the inclusion of new subsection
(10).</div>

						</b> I compliment the hon. Gentleman on his analysis.
Our view is that there is no need to insert the
phrase</div>
					<a name="07032279000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to the
discretion of the
court&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032279000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">because the power
is entirely permissive. The word &#147;may&#148; is sufficient to
allow the court to exercise all its discretion in making the decision.
I assure him, if that is his concern, that administration orders will
be made on a case by case basis, and on no other, wholly with regard to
individual circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07032279000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 167 would indeed
exclude the new section 112E(10), which would allow the court to
decide, taking account of individual circumstances, whether it would be
appropriate for the debtor to make a lump sum or other kind of payment
in addition to normal instalments. Apart from the perhaps semantic
point&#151;I do not mean that as a criticism&#151;about what is an
instalment and what is a lump sum, I have not, I am afraid, fully
understood what in the subsection is worrying the hon. Gentleman, so if
I do not deal with the root of his worries I know that you,
Mr. Bercow, will allow him to return to the
matter.</div>
					<a name="07032279000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
is there because in addition to a normal instalment order, a debtor
might somehow get some more money&#151;from a bonus or a windfall,
for example, or by disposing of assets&#151;and it may become
appropriate for the court to make an additional order. Instalment is
intended to mean a constant series of similar instalments, although
they can be variable. That is all that the clause is about; there is
nothing sinisterin it.</div>
					<a name="07032279000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have reassured
the hon. Gentleman, but he can come back to me if he still has concerns
that I have not dealt with.</div>

Government&#146;s proposals will deal with that matter.</div>
					<a name="07032279000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the Minister has
clarified for me the flexibility of what is being proposed: that there
is an ability to vary instalments. I was concerned because the amount
of an instalment and the pattern in which it is paid are usually of a
fixed nature. Normal ways of repaying debts can vary. Lump sums can be
paid upfront or at the back end, and the amounts themselves can vary at
every stage during the instalment plan. If the Minister is giving me an
assurance on the proposal I will not press the amendment to a Division,
but I ask her to reaffirm that I have understood what she
said.</div>

							<a name="07032279000445"></a>Vera

						</b> One would expect that instalments would be ordered
to be regular, although I can understand what the hon. Gentleman is
saying. If, after paying instalments of &#163;10 a week for six
months, the person concerned was in work again and the creditor wanted
the instalment to be increased from that point, it would none the less
still be an instalment. However, what is proposed is merely the
ability, if some money falls into the hands of the debtor, for the
court not to be tied to the instalment provision but to facilitate its
being flexible, and notwithstanding the instalments, to be able to
order a lump sum to be paid, or a lump sum instead of the rest of the
instalments. The proposalis about flexibility, which, as the
hon. Gentleman perceived, is
important.</div>

&#145;interest&#146;, insert</div>
					<a name="07032279000521"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;above the Bank of England base
rate&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07032279000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
a probing amendment on a very sensitive issue, which aims to establish
whether it is equitable for creditors to charge interest on debts
scheduled under an administration order if the rate of interest is kept
at the Bank of England&#146;s rate. The principle in play in the
clause, and throughout this part of the Bill, is the need to strike an
adequate balance between the obligations of the debtors and the rights
of creditors.</div>
					<a name="07032279000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although much of our recent
discussion has been about protecting the obligations, and even the
needs, of debtors, we must respect the fact that creditors have rights,
and recognise the legitimate expectations of creditors who have acted
responsibly, by allowing all creditors to charge some interest on debts
that are scheduled to administration orders.</div>
					<a name="07032279000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right that the debtor
should be given shelter by the court from punitive rates of interest
and charges when they get into difficulties. Hon. Members have heard
some of the heart-stopping statistics on personal debt, especially in
the aftermath of Farepak&#146;s collapse, when home credit providers
aggressively targeted those who had lost out.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>
					<a name="07032279000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is easy to see the potential
of the debt trap when reputable store cards can charge consumers
interest rates of around 30 per cent. On a rate of just 25 per cent.,
it would take 12 years to pay off a &#163;1,000 debt by making
minimum payments and would eventually cost over twice the original sum
borrowed. At the more aggressive end of the home credit market, which
we looked at in the Treasury Committee, it is now impossible for a
debtor to clear their debt once they get into difficulty. But allowing
interest rates that do not exceed the bank&#146;s base rate would be
a compromise that also protected creditors&#146; rights. I hope that
doing so would also be in line with a general principle that judgment
debts do carry
interest.</div>
					<a name="07032279000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are at
least two perspectives on this issue. The first would be to say that
creditors are lucky to receive any repayments at all and leave it at
that, but the alternative is to admit that creditors should have the
right to levy reasonable interest until the debt has been redeemed,
even if the rate is substantially lower than the one previously agreed
with the debtor. I should therefore be grateful if the Minister could
tell us whether this issue was considered in her consultation and
whether she might be prepared to revisit it
now.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000448"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> The amendment would allow creditorsto
receive some payment by way of interest, while governing the amount of
interest so that it could not be punitive. The point is to stop
interest being charged once an order comes into force. A debtor at that
stage needs an end point and to start to be rehabilitated. That is our
thinking and why we have made the provision in the new section 112H(2)
under this clause, indicating that no more fees, charges or interest
may be charged while the order is in place.</div>
					<a name="07032279000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea is to get the maximum
repayment available from the debtor so that the total debt or the
largest possible proportion of it will be paid back within the maximum
period of five years. The orders have an end point. There is no
mechanism to extend the endpoint. It is intended to be a
finite solution. If interest were added&#151;this would present
certain technical problems&#151;there is a danger that the total debt
could go beyond the maximum limits set in the regulations, which may be
about &#163;15,000. In that circumstance the court would have to
revoke the order. That element of uncertainty is undesirable
too.</div>
					<a name="07032279000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other point
is that we consulted about adding interest at this stage and
ascertained that the general view was that we were taking the right
approach and that it was good to offer an end point and then work to
rehabilitation and to leave interest out of the equation from then on.
I hope that the hon. Gentleman can be persuaded to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07032279000449"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> I am encouraged by some of the points that the
Minister made. However, I have another scenario to put to her which
might help to clarify my argument. The first scenario involves an
individual who owed &#163;5,000, of which he could afford to repay
only &#163;3,000. A deal would be struck that was effectively below
par value of that debt&#151;par being &#163;5,000 and the
discounted amount being &#163;3,000. Clearly he would not have the
wherewithal to pay any interest. The point that the Minister makes is
absolutely right.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>
					<a name="07032279000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a different scenario in
which, let us say, the amount is again &#163;5,000, but the
individual&#146;s earning capability is such that a negotiation is
struck enabling him to pay back the full amount at par value but over a
period, common sense tells me that there is an ability to pay some
interest. Assuming that interest rates remain as they
are&#151;reasonably low&#151;the amount that would accumulate at
base bank rate on the par value of the debt would not reach the sort of
amount that it would, for example, on a credit card.</div>
					<a name="07032279000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying to differentiate
between a negotiation on a figure that is below par value&#151;the
&#163;3,000 example in which the person does not have the wherewithal
to repay the full amount&#151;and the &#163;5,000 par value
example, in which the person clearly has the ability to pay everything
back, but in which the Minister seems to be suggesting that he is
unable to pay any interest at all to somebody who has lent him that
money in good
faith.</div>

remedies other than bankruptcy. It strikes me is that we are
considering not just people who have got into debt through gross
irresponsibility or who have built up a huge amount of debt on credit
cards, but a small minority of sophisticated business people who have
got themselves into debt and who do not want to go bankrupt. They are
looking for remedies other than bankruptcy to sort out their debts,
andthey might have received credit from other private
individuals. Should there not be a way of
distinguishing between banks and finance companies that
offercredit, and individuals who provide it for other
individuals? In the latter case, there might be an argument for them to
receive some interest on the credit that they have made
available.</div>

						</b> I can see the scenario to which the hon. Gentleman
refers. However, here we are trying to deal with people whose debts
have overwhelmed them, whatever category he wants to put them in. They
are taking a fairly significant step for the present and the future in
entering, through the courts, into an order of the kind that we are
considering. All the way up to that point interest will have run on the
loan, on the judgment debt and so on. Only when that is clear will that
person be able to engage the court to save him from his predicament,
and then the interest will stop running. By then, it will be a finite
problem; the point will be to get rid of the debt. It seems to us that,
given that he will be a long way down the road at that point, it will
be appropriate to stop the interest running on&#151;the creditor will
have received it all the way until then&#151;and to concentrate on
rehabilitating the debtor and getting the debt paid off as quickly as
possible. I invite the hon. Gentleman to agree that that is a very
reasonable way in which to see the matter.</div>

concerns the calculation of a debtor&#146;s qualifying debts for the

concerned that this seems a rather abstruse business. Regulations will
be prescribed as to the maximum sum that a debtor can earn and still be
subject to administration order. I accept the need for a figure to be

							<a name="07032279000460"></a>Mr.

						</b> I endorse what my hon. Friend has just said.
One of the things that told me a little in looking at proposed new
section 112 AD, headed &#147;Calculating the debtor&#146;s
qualifying debts&#148;, is, as he pointed out, subsections (3) and
(4), where the text talks about the regulations making further
regulation and about how the total amount of qualifying debts has been
calculated. Under subsection (4), regulations &#147;may&#148; make
provision. I should like the Minister to explain why they
&#147;must&#148; in subsection (3), but not in subsection (4). Why
is there a difference? Why is one subsection more powerful and stronger
than the other? As my hon. Friend mentioned with regard to the
regulations, the Government&#151;with respect&#151;have had a long
time to get the Bill right. It has been a long time coming and we have
had a series of publications, with a Green Paper and a White Paper, and
a huge amount of consultation with all the different
sectors.</div>
					<a name="07032279000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as I
am aware, the only part of the Bill that came as a bit of a
surprise&#151;the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
alluded to this&#151;is part 6, which relates to works of art. The
Government have had a huge amount of time to get the structure and
detail absolutely spot on in relation to debt management and relief,
and things such as administration orders. I will press the Minister
further: we hear of future regulations, but surely we ought to know now
exactly what the position is
now.</div>

							<a name="07032279000461"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> The amendment would remove the means of calculating
a debt as qualifying debt, which is a vital component of the new
scheme: we need to know what the debtor owes. It would also stop the
court taking account of debts arising before the order was made but not
yet due for repayment&#151;for example, debts under a deferred credit
scheme. We oppose the amendment because it would not allow provision to
be made for the court to add up his indebtedness, so the court would
not be able to make a decision on whether an administration order is
the best method of assistance available to
him.</div>
					<a name="07032279000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allowing that
assessment to be made of the debtor&#146;s true indebtedness could
result in his being directed to a better way forward than the
administration scheme, so it is imperative to allow the court to advise
and direct the debtor in any way that is most advantageous to
him.</div>
					<a name="07032279000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Must&#148;
and &#147;may&#148; in subsections (3) and (4) are there for the
following reasons: subsection (3) is about the total amount of the
debtor&#146;s qualifying debt, so it is imperative that the system of
administration orders functions, and that it is clear and certain what
a qualifying debt is. It must be clear what his total is. It is
imperative that there are regulations set out that point to a fixed sum
when his personal circumstances are considered.</div>
					<a name="07032279000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">My guess is that it is less
important to work outhow the amount of a particular qualifying
debt is calculated. Flexibility about that can adequately be reflected
in rules that we are likely&#151;though not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>obliged&#151;to make. If we do not make it compulsory to have
regulations on how the total qualifying debt is calculated, people will
not be able to ascertain with certainty what it is. It is important
that that regulatory power is there and that we can direct it to
happen. We will consult on all this, as we have on everything
else.</div>
					<a name="07032279000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">In paragraphs
275 and 276 of the policy statement, with which Opposition Members are
quite familiar, we have set out the Government&#146;s current
thinking on this. We do not have regulations ready yet, because we want
to consult, and I cannot say exactly when they willbe ready,
but hon. Gentlemen can see that the document&#151;I do not know
whether they have
it&#151;says:</div>
					<a name="07032279000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
ensure that the reformed scheme meets its objectives, the court will
take into account all the debtor&#146;s existing qualifying debts for
the purposes of meeting the prescribed maximum, regardless of whether
or not a debt is due at the time of the calculation. This enables the
court to consider the impact of deferred debts that will become due
during the lifetime of the order and avoid the need to revoke an order
where such a debt will cause the total debt to exceed the prescribed
maximum&#148;.</div>

						</b> There will be a whole raft of overlapping
consultation processes, but there would not be any significant point in
linking this one with the oneabout tribunals. We obviously
want the regulations to come into force as early as possible, because
the administration order provision is not of much use unless we know
exactly how the qualifying debt will be calculated. The political will
to get the regulations ready is definitely there, but we want to ensure
that we have all the appropriate consultations. As the hon. Gentleman
correctly recalled, it is intended that the consultation on tribunals
will take place in the autumn, and this one will start in the summer,
as we want to get it under way
quickly.</div>

that qualify or disqualify people for something&#151;in the present

parallel scales, tables or precedents beused? Amounts are
easier to comprehend if they are expressed in round figures and

change is well publicised and regular. This part of the Bill is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>good, and I want it to work in the most user-friendly way and with least

					<a name="07032279000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the timetable, I hope that I

						</b> I am sorry to press the Minister, but there
remains concern among all Conservative Members. There has been
significant consultation in the lead-up to the Bill. However, we
identify with the spirit of opinion that has been expressed on how the
various aspects of the Bill&#151;on tribunals, courts and
enforcement&#151;should be implemented when it becomes an Act. If
there is a consultation period after enactment, it could significantly
change the direction of the new legislation from that for which support
has been expressed in our debate. There has been enough consultation;
more of it would put the cart before the horse. When the Bill leaves
Parliament, there should be enough direction that yet further
consultation is not
required.</div>

enormously long legal history whereby regulations can fit only within
the framework of an Act and must not be ultra vires, so the regulations
could not take us in a different direction. With respect to the hon.
Gentleman, we need to keep our feet on the ground. We are talking about
how to calculate people&#146;s debt. The legislation contains a
scheme whereby debtors can be helped out of their debt position, and it
is important to scrutinise that scheme properly now. The consultation
on how debts will calculated will come within the ambit of that scheme
and not outside. There will soon be consultation and discussion in the
House.</div>

challenge the need to provide an approach that is not exactly

engagement with the various organisations that will use the
legislation. The Minister has twice said that there will be summer and

Cabinet Office provision for consultations will apply. There will be
three months&#146; consultation, and it will be made public that a
consultation will take place. I do not doubt that individual
organisations known by the Governmentto have an interest in
the matter will be directly approached for input, but the general
publicity surrounding the consultation will be directed to all relevant
areas in the hope that interested parties will come forward as well.
The consultation will be as comprehensive as possible, because it is
important to get things right. The way to do that is to consult the
maximum number of people with the maximum amount of experience, to
reflect on their responses and to produce an answer to the

goes further in attempting to resolve the possible conflict between the
court&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>
						discretion and the regulations by omitting the need
for regulations altogether. That is desirable for a single reason: I do
not want any district judge to have to tell a debtor that, although he
would like to schedule the debts in a way that is fair, just and
reasonable, the regulations prevent him from doing so.</div>
					<a name="07032279000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the court has discretion
over the amount of debt to be repaid and which creditors take priority
under the order, it seems unnecessary to fetter its discretion over the
amounts of the repayments. However, if it is the Government&#146;s
view that the court needs guidance on the calculation of surplus income
and the nature of the instalments, would it not be reasonable also to
offer it guidance on the total sum to be repaid? It seems that the
court is being trusted with some decisions, but not others. I therefore
seek the Minister&#146;s clarification on why that should be so and
what reasoning has been evoked to justify the differing
treatments?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000481"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> This amendment would remove the power to make
regulations that will allow the Government to prescribe a consistent
approach, across all courts, to the calculation of the amount of
instalments in relation to a debtor&#146;s surplus income.
Consistency is a key feature of the scheme, which received support from
all sides. It is better to have a framework within which the courts can
apply their discretion to an individual set of circumstances, to avoid
an incompatibility between what happensto someone in court
jurisdiction A and what happens to someone in a similar position in
court jurisdiction B.</div>
					<a name="07032279000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am told that creditors are
keen to see an end to the current system in which different courts make
vastly different orders on individual circumstances that are largely
the same. The advice sector also favours a national system that will
ensure a consistent approach to these issues, and one imagines that it
will feel competent and more empowered to advise with a good deal of
certainty.</div>
					<a name="07032279000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
regulations made under proposed new section 112E(9) of the County
Courts Act 1984 will ensure a consistent approach based on the ability
to pay, probably using a version of the common financial statement,
which is widely accepted across both the credit and the advice sectors
as the most comprehensive and best tool for doing that kind of
assessment. That type of scheme is not appropriate for those with
insufficient surplus income to meet the commitment. The revised scheme
is targeted at those debtors who can afford to make reasonable
repayments up to the five-year term of the
order.</div>
					
					<a name="07032279000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000482"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> Unfortunately, I am a bit of pedant on language.
The Minister used the word &#147;probably&#148; in relation to the
use of the common financial statement. Is there any ambiguity that I
should be concerned about? Is there something else that she is thinking
about or will the system be based on a common financial
statement?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000483"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> No, the system is part of the regulation-making
process that I have already described to the hon. Member for
Bournemouth, East. The common financial statement commends itself to us
as the appropriate tool, and it is widely used by advice agencies.
However, if somebody has come up with a better tool by June&#151;if
that is when summer starts&#151;we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>would be open to the suggestion of using it instead. That is the
direction of our thinking at the moment. It is our preferred tool, but
there will not be much deviation from a tool that is similar to the
common financial statement. Nevertheless, we will leave the options
open until the consultation has been
held.</div>
					
					<a name="07032279000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we accepted the amendment, it would prevent the introduction of a
common procedure for determining instalments. Each court would carry on
making its own assessments based on locally devised criteria, which
would add complexity, cost and&#151;overwhelmingly what we do not
want&#151;uncertainty. We therefore urge that the amendment be
withdrawn.</div>

for that open, I probably would not object to it&#151;although I

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000485"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I should like to ask a general question about the
clause and this welcome part of the Bill. This is the first clause
stand part debate under this part, which tries to find systems whereby
people with small or medium debts can have them managed in a way that
resolves the problems. There was a helpful introduction in the
explanatory notes, supplied bythe Government to all Committee
members and available through the Vote Office, explaining the
background and the alternatives: administration orders, enforcement
registration orders, debt relief orders and debt management
schemes.</div>
					<a name="07032279000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
generic questions about both orders in the clause and their context.
First, on a practical matter, if somebody gets into personal debt, what
is the sequence or process that will determine the alternative route
out of it? Options are available. In the explanatory notes, the
administration orders are described as
a</div>
					<a name="07032279000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;scheme for those with
multiple debts totalling no more than &#163;5,000, one of which must
be a judgment
debt.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032279000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is, as we
will see in a little while, a set of arrangements under what are now
called debt management schemes. The idea is to prevent people from
going into bankruptcy and to try to reach an arrangement that, in many
cases, comes to an end in a year, so that, in that time, matters can be
resolved by agreement and the creditors will accept that they will not
necessarily get all the money to which they are entitled. However, in
return, they will get some of the money and the debtor will honour the
agreement and pay that off.</div>
					<a name="07032279000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The arrangement also seeks to
resolve a real life problem, which is that some people get themselves
into a financial muddle and do not have the financial wherewithal to
sustain the obligations. As we probably 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>all know from our personal circumstances, it is much easier to manage
one repayment arrangement than many. The people who get into the
biggest difficulty in life are often those who try to juggle repayments
here and there.</div>
					<a name="07032279000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
people are being chased, quite properly, by creditors for money that
they are obliged to pay, from whom and where can they seek advice in
the court structure? The matter relates to the context of the court
structure, which will set out the sequence, or the best choice, for
people to follow. Again, that reflects our debate a moment ago; it is
about ensuring that we clog up the courts as little as possible, get as
much agreement as possible and that creditors who are owed money get
it, whenever possible. Above all, however, it is about debtors getting
into as little further difficulty as possible, with all the knock-on
effects and
consequences.</div>
					<a name="07032279000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I bridge
that point, on my way to my second question, by reminding Committee
colleagues about figures that we all know. There is now record personal
indebtedness in this country. I have heard in the past few days that
that may just have levelled off. The figure in my head is some
&#163;13 trillion, which is an incredible, almost unimaginable
figure. However, people are willing to consider debt, because of the
amount of mortgage that they can take out&#151;five times their
income&#151;and because of the number of consumer goods that they are
buying. This country is saddled with debt, which is fundamentally
problematical for Britain and not a sign of healthy long-term economic
stability.</div>
					<a name="07032279000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
in case we agree to this part of the Bill, particularly the part on
debt management schemes, has the Department conducted an assessment of
what that will mean in debt reduction? How many people will be
affected? In the Library research notes and the notes on clauses, I
have been able to find only the following figures. Paragraph 384, under
&#147;Debt Management Schemes&#148; in the departmental explanatory
notes,
says:</div>
					<a name="07032279000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
estimated that over 25,000 such debt repayment plans were arranged in
2004 and there are currently around 70,000 active
plans.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032279000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not found
an assessment of the likely impact on indebtedness and the number of
people in debt. How many people are expected to be taken out of
indebtedness and out of the courts? It is an important generic issue as
well as a social policy issue.</div>
					<a name="07032279000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measures seem to be a good
idea. They are a welcome part of the Bill, and everybody has been
positive about them, but does research suggest that they will make a
significant or only a small impact? I should be happy to receive any
information that the Minister can give me or point me toward. It would
put the measures in the wider context of helping people get out of the
pressured position of being in debt, which causes people in our
constituencies illness, grief, family breakdown and worse. I hope that
the measures will take some small steps to alleviate
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07032279000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000486"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> I do not accept the description of a nation saddled
with debt. Debt is important. It is difficult to live life without
substantial debt. I would have to live in a tent if I did not have a
debt called a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>mortgage. The Government are worried about, and have taken the new steps
to address, debt that is out of control. Debt is a useful tool when
properly controlled.
</div>
					<a name="07032279000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have altered,
extended and changed an existing system of coming to terms with debt.
It is a system of mutual undertakings whereby the debtor agrees that he
or she will pay off a certain amount and, as the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey said, is relieved of the management of many
repayments. Creditors acquiesce in having their ability to take further
action restricted so long as the payments are
made.</div>
					<a name="07032279000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is of
course a court-controlled procedure. It will need to go to the courts,
so the options that we have been discussing&#151;mediation,
alternative dispute resolution and so on&#151;will have passed by the
time we get to such a position. There is no doubt that advice is
available. I chronicled its availability a few days ago. Agencies such
as citizens advice bureaux, law centres, solicitors, the Department of
Trade and Industry, financial advisers and advisers financed by the
financial inclusion fund are available, as is outreach to contact
people whose debts are causing them significant stress and difficulty.
One would expect that kind of advice to encourage an individual to come
to court to ask for such assistance. It is not inconceivable that, on
some occasions, the creditor might suggest it, and the individual might
take advice and see the wisdom of
it.</div>
					<a name="07032279000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">In so far as I can
help the hon. Gentleman, those are likely to be the mechanics of how
the helpful provisions will come into play in a troubled
individual&#146;s life. I cannot give him any significant figures on
how many such schemes we expect to emerge. There is only anecdotal
material at present, and study is ongoing, but he is right that there
are about 25,000 administration orders a year. That must give some
guideline about what is likely to follow from the various versions of
debt management. I cannot say more than there are 25,000 orders a year
now, and that that number may exist in future. I am reflecting on
whether I have answered all that he asked&#151;I think that I
have.</div>

marketed as approved. They will receive the seal of approval from the
Government and presumably use their new status to drum up business.
There will be no surprise if existing individual voluntary arrangement
providers offered their own debt management schemes for that very
reason.</div>
					<a name="07032279000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Encouraging
providers to seek approval for their schemes may well be a pragmatic
alternative to regulating the entire IVA sector, although there are
legitimate concerns that the Government have missed an opportunity by
not choosing to regulate. Whatever the intentions behind the clause,
the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that debt management schemes
cannot be operated by individuals who are entirely unvetted by the
supervisory authority. That would create a risk of unscrupulous
providers operating one approved scheme, which they can market as such,
among many others and thus leave the public to draw the inference that
all their services have been given a Government kitemark. It is
ultimately a matter of
perception.</div>
					<a name="07032279000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
course of its investigation, prior to the approval of a scheme, the
supervisory authority might look closely at the body offering it. In
that case, nothing would be lost by the Bill stating explicitly that
the provider, as well as the scheme itself, is approved. I therefore
seek the Minister&#146;s assurance on that
point.</div>

						</b> We support the amendment. I can understand that,
in a free market economy, it could be left to anyone to run such a
scheme, but there is benefit in having official trade-marked, branded
kitemark schemes. Given our long debates about regulation bailiffs and
the Security Industry Authority in respect of bouncers and security
outside pubs and clubs, it would be sensible to think of such matters
now and not wake up only after the Bill is enacted. I hope that the
Minister will be sympathetic to my
argument.</div>

relevant supervisory authority&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07032279000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill contains what is in a sense a
double-decker scheme. A scheme that wants to benefit from the powers
set out in clauses 109 to 116 will have to be approved by the
supervisory authority dealt with in clause 106. However, seeking such
approval is optional; scheme operators will have to decide whether they
want to offer an enhanced scheme. When schemes do not have the approval
of the supervisory authority, they will still be able to offer debt
management schemes, but they will not have the powers available to
those who do have such approval. The schemes that do not have the new
powers will operate as they do now and will be totally dependent on the
voluntary participation of the
creditor.</div>
					<a name="07032279000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Gentleman accepts that there is a scheme for approval and that
those who choose not to seek approval will have only a limited range of

<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>powers available to them, although they will be able to offer a service
based on the voluntary acceptanceof debtors. No doubt such
acceptances will be forthcoming. I hope that that flexibility is
sufficient for the hon. Member for Braintree, because it commends
itself to the Government.</div>

							<a name="07032279000490"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> Again, the Minister has not really persuaded me.
My concern is that if there is some sense or perception on the part a
scheme that it has, even in law, the approval or Government backing for
what it is doing, it may be out there marketing itself as a
professional operation that has the stamp approval of a regulated body.
That might open the system to some level of abuse. I appreciate that
such abuses might happen only at the margin, but the whole point of
having a regulatory body and of regulatory approval is to protect the
innocent and the vulnerable from those that might prey on them. Will
the Minister once again clarify, perhaps more formally than she has,
what the schemes are and under what restrictions they will
operate?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000491"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> The operators of approved schemes have to be
companies or partnerships, not individuals. It is likely that the CAB
might itself go into such territory. The hon. Gentleman will know about
the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, which deals with debt
management concerning credit cards and personal loans, and
Payplan.</div>
					<a name="07032279000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulations
will control and limit advertising,which might provide further
reassurance to the hon. Gentleman, who suggested that people might
misrepresent the supervision under which they operate when offering a
scheme. For a company to misrepresent itself by saying that it has the
authority of a court to offer a scheme when it does not, or by saying
that it has powers that it does not have, would certainly be an abuse
of the scheme and would likely be a criminal offence, probably under
the terms of the theft Acts. I hope that that reassures him on the
issue of false advertising. There is scope in the Bill to limit or
control advertising.</div>
					<a name="07032279000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have reassured
the hon. Gentleman, albeit not exactly how he envisaged&#151;a depth
of worry about the matter is unnecessary. Some schemes will probably be
run by wholly virtuous bodies such as the CAB, which do not have
powers. The input of the supervisory authority will be necessary before
such bodies can have more powers.</div>

relevant. I understand that the arrangement is a permissive one, so
anyone could come up with a proposition, which would then be approved
under the system, but will the Minister suggest possible sub-groups of
non-business debtors? Might it be the category of women&#146;s debt
or debts of certain ethnic or other communities? I am trying to get

themselves up particularly for black or minority ethnic debtors or
women debtors, but I suppose that that is not impossible. Perhaps
membership organisations might want to offer that kind of service to
some of their members rather than to others. I think that the
opportunity that is offered by the provision&#151;although
opportunity is rather too positive a word for what we are talking
about, which is debt management&#151;means that there will be
organisations that are happy tostep into the breach and take
on non-business debtors of various kinds. There is maximum flexibility
in chapter 4, and particularly in clause 104, to allow for all that. I
suppose that the kind of organisations that the hon. Gentleman has
mentioned might become involved; there might be some who wanted to
focus on women, disabled people or mentally ill people, and so on. I do

Newmark:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 174 to 177, which on the face of
it would replace the word &#147;may&#148; with
&#147;shall&#148;, are probing amendments to establish how rigorous
the approval of the supervisory authority will be, in effect. I am
concerned that the word &#147;may&#148; appears many times in this
chapter of part 5. The amendments in this group do not include all of
them and an awful lot is to be left to regulations.</div>
					<a name="07032279000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Approved debt management
schemes and the registration of plans are positive in principle, but
the detail of the approval mechanism and the rigour to be exercised by
the scrutinising authority are a bit vague. That is compounded by the
fact that the proposed supervising authority is the Lord Chancellor or
his delegates rather than the Office of Fair Trading or the Financial
Services Authority. The authority may approve schemes, but it does not
have to do so. Regulations, on the other hand,</div>
					<a name="07032279000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may make provision
about...conditions that must be
met&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032279000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">before approval.
There is a conflict there: may they or must
they?</div>
					<a name="07032279000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">That theme
applies also to the registration of plans under clause 115, which
states that regulations &#147;may make provision&#148; about either
or both of the situations listed. If the need for regulation is
anticipated, it should be declared openly. That is the purpose
underlying the amendment&#151;to replace some of the
&#147;mays&#148; with &#147;shalls&#148;. I apologise to the
Committee that I have not managed to identify them all, but I hope that
I have managed to make my intentions clear to the Minister. Will she
clarify what will and will not be done by the supervising authority,
and what will or will not be prescribed in the forthcoming
regulations?</div>

He wants a lot of &#147;shalls.&#148; I wonder what the collective
noun for &#147;shalls&#148; is&#151;a shower of shalls? However
by substituting &#147;may&#148; with &#147;shall&#148; in
clause 106(1), for instance, which is what amendment No. 174
woulddo, we would end up with the requirement that the
supervising authority shall approve one or more debt management
schemes, irrespective of whether they are utterly hopeless and
inappropriate. That would require the authority to approve one or more
schemes but, in truth, it would probably require it to approve all debt
management schemes put before it. I am sure that that is not what the
hon. Member for Braintree
wants.</div>

proposals, seeking approval to operate a scheme with the proposed
enhanced powers would be optional. The hon. Gentleman knows that. There
is no intention to force operators to offer enhanced schemes; they will
have to decide whether they want to do so. There is no certainty about
the number of applications for approval that will be received or how
many will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>judged suitable and how many not. The intention is that the supervising
authority will have the power to set conditions that must be met by all
scheme operators, so a bedrock of conditions will be laid down. Those
conditions will have to be satisfied before a scheme is
approved.</div>

we intend to consult on the terms of the proposals, including the role

will be proper, helpful, well thought through and well worked out, and
that they will work for the people who are taken on by
them.</div>

							<a name="07032279000506"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The clause concerns an issue that we come across
fairly often: people who have their gas or electricity supply turned
off. The water service is a linked utility. Those used to be public
utilities, but they are now private. The clause is about the process
that would in certain circumstances control when supplies could be
turned off, and it applies to non-business debtors during periods of
protection.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>
					<a name="07032279000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question is simple. It is
partly a DCA-type question and partly a DTI-type one. Just as we now
say that people cannot be evicted from their homes without the sanction
of a court, we could equally reasonably argue that the electricity, gas
or water supply to a domestic property should not be turned off without
such sanction. Can the Minister assist me by saying whether she and her
colleagues have thought about that argument in the context of this
measure? Would they consider introducing such an approach by tabling an
amendment on Report, and would such a move beled by another
Department or in consultation with other Departments? It seems to me
that we have an opportunity to try to do something that would prevent a
lot of desperate, and sometimes unsatisfactory, scrambling
around.</div>
					<a name="07032279000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make
two last points. First, I am aware that codes of practice apply in such
circumstances, but sometimes they do not work, and I am also aware that
there is good practice, which does work. In addition, of course we know
that people abuse the system. Secondly, I have often found that such
issues can be dealt with by agreeing with the provider a register of
people in a community who are vulnerable. For example, when people
become of pensionable age,they could register so that special
procedures were undertaken. After many years, however, I have not so
far found a foolproof system of protecting the vulnerable from having
their water, electricity or gas cut off in certain circumstances. The
situation is even harder now with the multiplicity of providers in this
privatised world of utilities.</div>
					<a name="07032279000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be grateful to hear
from the Minister whether that broader issue has been considered and
whether favourable consideration would be given on Report to an
amendment that sought to give the same entitlement to utilities as
applies in a tenancy or
occupancy.</div>

							<a name="07032279000507"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> There is a huge amount of difficulty in defining
people who are vulnerable in order to set up any type of register at
all. In this context, we are countenancing a person who is in a period
of protection or is in the currency of a debt repayment plan, which
restricts the ability of a qualifying creditor&#151;a creditor with a
qualifying debt&#151;to take any action at all to recover their debt.
A series of restrictions bite on those qualifying creditors, and they
are, as I have said already to the hon. Member for Braintree, two sides
of the coin. The debtor will pay and the creditors will forbear. Quite
separate from that structure, there are rules that stop domestic
utility suppliers disconnecting services. They must not do that here
when they are a qualifying creditor, as is laid down clearly in the
provision. More generally, people cannot cut water off without the
courts&#146; consent and I am reasonably sure that the same applies
to any utilities, but I am not certain. However, that is a broader
point. In this case, utilities that are qualifying suppliers must not
take that action to deal a
debtor.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): I was going to make a
speech, but I shall make my point in an intervention. I am intrigued
about why we are talking about gas and electricity, not water. My hon.
and learned Friend may have an easy explanation, but it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>
						my understanding that it is now virtually impossible
to disconnect someone for not paying their water bill. Therefore, I
would be interested to know what the differences are. It is still
possible to disconnect someone for not paying for gas and electricity,
so there is a disparity. It would be interesting to know why no
reference is made to water in the clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032279000509"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> That is undoubtedly a very good point to reflect
on. It is nearly impossible to disconnect someone&#146;s water. My
noble Friend Baroness Ashton talked in the other place&#151;it was in
a different connection, but linked to the Bill&#151;about the need to
negotiate and to engage water suppliers, because they do not have much
recourse to recover their debts, as they never can disconnect. In some
circumstances&#151;I am not sure when or whether it is with or
without a court order&#151;the other utilities can do that. In
general, that is an interesting question, and one that we should
consider. Within the confines of the Bill, however, we can prevent the
gas or electricity supplier from cutting off supplies while the person
is protected because they are paying under the arrangement they have
come to with their creditors. From the point of view of the Bill, the
situation is rock solid, but more widely, my hon. Friend the Member for

						<b class="B"> </b>That was helpful. Perhaps the Minister
could deal with these points in writing after today&#146;s sitting.
First, is there a need to put water in that context? Secondly, on a
wider question, is a court order and a court appearance necessary for
each of the utilities? If so, can we have reassurance about that? If
not, perhaps we can come back to it on
Report.</div>

						</b> I do not want to be dragged into offering more than
I realistically can offer within the confines of the Bill, just because
I am a good-natured, soft liberal person. I have given very strong
reassurance about clause 133, which manifestly protects people in such
a situation. I rather doubt whether, within the confines of the Bill,
we have any possibility of thoroughly getting to grips with all the
reasoning behind the disparity that my hon. Friend the Member for
Stroud set out for us. However, I will look at the matter and have a
conversation with the hon. Gentleman in due
course.</div>

						</b> I have one question. The clause sets out who the
supervising authority is&#151;an issue to which the hon. Member for
Braintree referred earlier. Subsection (1) says that it is the Lord
Chancellor or anyone authorised by the Lord Chancellor. Whom does the
Department have in mind? We went through this last year with regard to
some legislation brought forward by the Department. There was an
interim arrangement involving Ministers or civil servants, before a
transfer to the Legal Services Commission. It would be interesting to
know whom Ministers have in mind as an agency&#151;it might be
individual or whatever&#151;both on an interim basis and in the long
term.</div>

						</b> We do not have anyone in mind,other than
the Lord Chancellor, at present. We are introducing clause 124 with an
eye to the possibility of the role being delegated in the future. If
that ever occurred, it would be likeliest to go to a judicial
officeholder, but not inconceivable that it would go to some existing
national advice board, such as the citizens advice bureaux. At present,
we do not have anyone to whom we intend to delegate the
role.</div>
