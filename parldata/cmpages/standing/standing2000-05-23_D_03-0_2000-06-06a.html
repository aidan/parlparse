<P>
Amendment proposed [25 May]: No. 1, in page 1, line 13, leave out the words 'but not' and insert the word 'or'. --[Sir Nicholas Lyell.]
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): In the debate before the recess, we heard several thorough speeches. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) in particular has ably covered the ground, so my remarks will be slightly briefer than they might have been.
<P>
I should start by declaring my interest: I practised at the Bar for several years and served on the general management committee of the Bar Council. Perhaps more significantly to debate on the Bill, I was part of the council's law reform committee. I was also a chairman of the corporate barrister's organisation.
<P>
It is perhaps also significant to mention that as a law student at Oxford more than 20 years ago, I spent quite a lot of time studying criminology and penology. Much of the research that has been mentioned and will be debated later was done by academics, such as Professors Roger Hood and Michael McConville, whose work I studied all that time ago. I find it interesting and unusual that many of the Government's arguments for the Bill--particularly the fact that they have set their face against all the campaigning by organisations such as Liberty, Justice and the Commission for Racial Equality--go against much of that criminological and penological research. It strikes me as extraordinary that so many Government Members should oppose those organisations.
<P>
Like many hon. Members, I have enormous respect for the lay magistracy. I do not want any of my responses to be taken in any sense as an attack on lay magistrates. We are all proud that we have such an effective system of lay justice.
<P>
We are discussing the principles underlying trial by jury. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire said, we must consider the history of trial by jury, even on what appears to be a small amendment, although it is enormously significant. In responding to my right hon. and learned Friend, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), I will go into a little bit of the history and consider what is significant about the circumstances of each defendant.
<P>
The Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill was defeated in another place. Many Labour peers who rebelled against their Government's Bill and scuppered it have since been quoted as saying that the No. 2 Bill is worse than the first Bill because of the change that the Government have made, to which my right hon. and learned Friend's amendment is directed. Those comments make the Government's decision even more extraordinary. I suspect that the Government's task will be even more difficult in another place, if the Bill gets that far.
<P>
In the speeches made so far on the amendment, Sir Patrick Devlin--later Lord Devlin--and his Hamlyn lectures have been mentioned frequently. That is the most important study of the jury system to have been produced in the second half of the 20th century. In dealing with the history relating to my hon. and learned Friend's amendment, I will discuss what Sir Patrick Devlin said, because it goes to the heart of our objection to the Government's arguments for the Bill and particularly the crucial importance of considering the circumstances of the individual offender. My right hon. and learned Friend's amendment is directed towards that point. Sir Patrick said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For of all the institutions that have been created by English law, there is none other that has a better claim to be called "the privilege of the Common people of the United Kingdom."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) pointed out, it is extraordinary that a system that has been developed over seven centuries of British history can be tossed away so casually by the Government and their Back-Bench supporters, if they have their way, in only a few sittings. The Bill was introduced in the name of modernisation, but in fact shows the Government's complete rejection of all the history and traditions of the law of England and Wales.
<P>
Sir Patrick went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The English jury is not what it is because some lawgiver so decreed, but because that is the way it has grown up. Indeed, its invention by a lawgiver is inconceivable. We are used to it--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
by "we", he means the people of England and Wales--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and know that it works.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That goes to the heart of our objection to the Bill and particularly the Government's rejection of what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire said. They understand so little of the importance of a system that works and has grown up by tradition. Nothing sticks in my craw more strongly than the Government's complete contempt for history and tradition.
<P>
Sir Patrick also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The jury system developed that way simply because that was the way in which it was found to work.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He talked about British traditions and the British people:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The virtue that makes them a law-abiding people makes them also good guardians of the law and gives them a sense of fairness that makes them happy judges. They put up with the inconvenience of<P>
it--the waiting and the hanging about and the interference with the daily round--not only because they assume it as a proper responsibility but because, once they get into the jury box they enjoy being there. . . they perform. . . an important service to British justice. They sit there as witnesses of the legal process. They see the way the accused is treated--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is crucial to the point made by my right hon. and learned Friend--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>listen to the evidence of character, hear the sentences that are passed, and silently approve or disapprove. . . It reminds them that they are not engaged upon a piece of professional ritual but in helping to give the ordinary man the sort of justice he can understand. Upon what jurymen think and say when they get home, the prestige of the law, in great measure, depends.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have had the rather unusual benefit of the experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire, who spoke about what happened when he sat on a jury. In one case, he was also the foreman of a jury. It is unusual for us to have the benefit of that experience, because the secrets of the jury room are normally kept. However, my hon. Friend was right to give us the benefit of the experience of a nonlawyer or lay juror. He was impressed by the way in which the system operated.
<P>
It seems that--I am sure that those who read the record of our debate would agree--when talking about civil liberties, the experience of the ordinary lay juror is central. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire gave a graphic example of someone whose whole career depended on the result of a case and on the common sense of a British jury. All the points made by Sir Patrick Devlin in his Hamlyn lectures back in the 1950s were reinforced in spades by my hon. Friend's experience. That is unusual, because I do not think that any Committee considering such issues has ever had the opportunity to benefit from a speech by a former lay juror. From the research that I have undertaken, I think that that is unique. Many of us on both sides of the Committee have plenty of experience as practising lawyers in the courts, but hearing what goes on in the mind of a juror and in the jury room has been enormously beneficial and has completely undermined the Government's case, particularly against the amendment.
<P>
Sir Patrick went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The judge's task--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and one might add the lay magistrate's task,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is not merely to expound the law to the jury, but also to offer them an approach to the facts that is based on the ideas that lie behind the law ... It is not with him, as it may well be with the jury, the only trial in which he will ever take part; he is perhaps less interested than they are in the fates of the individuals concerned.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In this amendment, we are talking about the fates of individuals and the crucial constitutional protection that they should have.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The jury is the best instrument for deciding upon the credibility or reliability of a witness and so for determining the primary facts. Whether a person is telling the truth, when it has to be judged, as so often it has, simply from the demeanour of the witness and his manner of telling it, is a matter about which it is easier for a single mind (or even three justices' minds) to be fallible.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is surely the point. The collective impression made on 12 minds has in this country always been regarded as more reliable.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The jury hear the witness as people who are as ignorant as they are of lawyers' ways of thought. That is the great advantage to any citizen of judgment by his peers--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the whole foundation of jury trial.
<P>
In 1922, Sir William Holdsworth stressed the role of the jury as the touchstone of contemporary common sense. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The effects of the jury system upon the law are no less remarkable and no less beneficial. It tends to make the law intelligible by keeping it in touch with the common facts of life. The reasons why and the manner in which it thus affects the law, are somewhat as follows: If a clever man is left to decide by himself disputed questions of fact he is usually not content simply to decide each case as it arises. He constructs theories for the decision of analogous cases. These theories are discussed, doubted, or developed by other clever men when such cases come before them. The interest is apt to centre, not in the dry task of deciding the case before the court but rather in the construction of new theories, the reconciliation of conflicting cases, the demolition of criticism of older views ... The jury system has for some hundreds of years been constantly bringing the rules of law to the touchstone of contemporary common sense.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is precisely because of the way in which that common sense view of jurors can affect the characters of individuals that the amendment proposed by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire is so important. The jury provides a safeguard.
<P>
I want to remind those who cynically dismiss the importance of these issues of what was said as long ago as 1784 by Mr. Justice Willes when he spoke about looking forward into futurity. He talked about the danger that might arise if a Government casually tossed away this constitutional safeguard:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For more than seven out of the 8 centuries during which the judges of the common law have administered justice in this country, trial by jury ensured that Englishmen got the sort of justice they liked and not the sort of justice that the Government or the lawyers or any body of experts thought was good for them.<P>

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> Given the hon. Gentleman's passionate defence of the jury system, if the Bill is passed, can he give the Committee a cast-iron assurance that it would be reversed by a future Conservative Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary knows perfectly well that policy for future elections is not decided on the hoof in a Standing Committee. I can tell the hon. Gentleman what I also said on Second Reading that when the issue was debated when the Conservatives were in government, I expressed my opposition to any reduction in the right to trial by jury. My view has always been consistent. The Parliamentary Secretary should be able to judge what my advice is likely to be when it comes to the formulation of future policy, but I am not going to be drawn further than that.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> Just to clarify, is the hon. Gentleman saying that he would advise his party leader that a future Conservative Government should introduce legislation to reverse the effect of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am confident that the Bill will not become law. If it is not defeated in this House I am certain that it will suffer the same fate as the No. 1 Bill in another place. The Minister's question is therefore completely academic. As it will not become law, there will be no need to reverse it. I certainly shall not answer hypothetical questions.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey). I hope that this will be a supportive intervention. The hon. Gentleman and I both hope that the Bill will not become law. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that neither his party nor my party would go to the electorate on one policy on such an important matter and then suddenly, without any authority, change it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are beginning to have a Second Reading debate. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I will indeed, Mr. Maxton. First may I thank the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for his supportive intervention? I entirely agree with him. The problem for the Minister is that so many Labour Members are drawing attention to that point. They are involved in the campaign to retain trial by jury and produce a rather splendid magazine drawing attention to these debates. They make the point made in my right hon. and learned Friend's amendments: the decision about the mode of trial involves the circumstances of the offender and not the offence.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the Government campaigned on the other side of the argument at the election. They told the electorate that they were against any change in the right to trial by jury. They have now turned that on its head and they have no mandate for this. They are being attacked constantly from their own side both by lawyers and non-lawyers. I refer Labour Members, to the comments made by one of the non-lawyers on Second Reading, the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Mr. Best). All of us involved in that debate regarded his speech as one of the most powerful made by the Govemment's opponents on their Back Benches. It is noticeable that the opposition to the Bill comes not just from lawyers, but from both sides in both Houses.
<P>
I return now to the amendment and the circumstances of the offender, which is what particularly concerns my right hon. and learned Friend, We must look at what the constitutional significance would be if the Bill became law. I make no apology for returning to some of the points that my night hon. and learned Friend and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made. Again, Sir Patrick Devlin has some helpful comments about the circumstances of the offender. He talks about this being a matter of conscience. He describes the jury as a safeguard against repugnant laws. It must be regarded as repugnant if organisations like Justice, Liberty and the Commission for Racial Equality argue that it would be quite wrong for the circumstances of the individual offender not to be taken into account.
<P>
Sir Patrick Devlin said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The second and by far the greater purpose that is served by trial by jury is that it gives protection against laws which the ordinary man may regard as harsh and oppressive. It is a protection against tyranny. It is also an insurance that the criminal law will conform to the ordinary man's idea of what is fair and just. If it does not the jury will not be a party to its enforcement. They have in the past used their power of acquittal to defeat the full operation of laws which they thought to be too hard. Their minds are not trained to the making of an orderly separation and opposition, they are more likely to allow one set of considerations to act upon the other in such a way as to confuse the issues. One way or another they are prone to give effect to their repugnance to a law by refusing to convict under it. The small body of men, who under modern conditions, constitute the effective body of legislators have to bear this in mind. It affects the character of the laws they make, for it is no use making laws which will not be enforced.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what the Government have to bear in mind. If they are seeking to introduce a law that states that there must be no consideration of the individual circumstances of an offender, they are flying in the face of all the research done by organisations such as the Commission for Racial Equality and the Society of Black Lawyers.
<P>
There is no point detaining the Committee at great length this morning with that research. The Ministers know that it shows that ethnic minority defendants do not feel that they receive as fair a trial from the lay magistracy as from a jury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The hon. Gentleman is rightly focusing on whether the character of the defendant should be taken into account. Will he give us the benefit of his views on whether the character of the defendant should have been taken into account in extending criminal damage trials, which, as he well knows, were limited when the right to jury trial was cut down by the previous Government, on the basis of the value of the damage caused, not the defendant's character? Was that right or wrong? Or would he prefer not to answer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We are talking about the Government's current proposals that relate to a body of offences in which the circumstances of the offender may be relevant. As my right hon. and learned Friend said, that includes issues of dishonesty. The whole purpose of trial by jury has been to protect individuals who felt that they would have a fairer trial by a body of their peers. The Parliamentary Secretary confuses the issue by referring to the past: it is not relevant to the amendment being debated.
<P>
Not only are the Government mistaken in their proposals, but also in rejecting the important points made by my right hon. and learned Friend. The proposals upset further those who are rebelling against the No. 1 Bill. The Government are going against seven centuries of history and setting their face against a crucial constitutional safeguard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I hesitate to follow such a fine contribution. I hope that the Committee will take to heart the words of Sir Patrick Devlin.
<P>
The debate on whether to keep the right to trial by jury is interesting, but the amendment is about whether to consider the circumstances of the accused. There has been much talk of the jury system having existed for seven centuries. One of the most important features of that system is that it involves the whole of society in the legal process. As has been said, it gives society the right to order men and women to question laws that they think are hard and vexatious.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) was speaking, it struck me that that is the first and ultimate stakeholder principle. It was not invented two or three years ago in a hothouse in Millbank tower, but seven centuries ago, to give ordinary men and women the right to be involved in the legal process and to judge their fellow men and women who are accused of crimes by the state.
<P>
However interesting the arguments are, Mr. Maxton, you rightly want us to focus on whether to consider the circumstances of the accused. I made the effort last night to talk to a number of people. One of the conversations I had was with a practising circuit judge. I shall not name him, but he was open in his views. To be fair, he started the conversation by saying that he wanted to restrict the right to trial by jury. I can see both sides of the argument. I have also practised in the criminal courts, but, unlike my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire, I am a very undistinguished lawyer and have, therefore, spent a great deal of time in the magistrates courts, while he has been practising in the higher courts. However, over the years, that has given me some insight.
<P>
The judge to whom I was talking last night began by saying that he believed that the right to trial by jury should be limited. He is a practising judge who is concerned with the administration of justice and presumably wants to ensure efficiency and lessen delays. That is understandable. Presumably he has come across abuses by those who are not of good character, and we know that that happens. Such people, often with a string of convictions, should not be our concern on this amendment, because they waste the time of an ancient, expensive, careful and slow system. However, some of the abuses have been exaggerated. Many people change their plea, but not all of them necessarily do so because they are being cynical and want to waste our time by electing trial in the Crown court as a way of spinning things out. It may be that some sort of plea bargain is done; that is not strictly allowed these days, but such things happen.
<P>
The judge said, as members of the Committee have, that we should limit the right to trial by jury, that magistrates try people well and carefully and that there is no reason why they should not consider these cases. He accepted all that, but, interestingly, when I asked him where he would like to be tried if he inadvertently walked out of a shop carrying something and was subsequently accused of shoplifting, he said that he would like to be tried in front of a jury. That is a question that members of the Committee should ask themselves. If, despite having devoted their lives to doing their best, they were accused of dishonesty, which could destroy them, their sense of worth, career and everything, deep down, who would they want to be tried by? Would they want to be tried by the magistrates or by a jury? If Committee members are honest with themselves, I believe that they would prefer to be tried by a jury.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend is aware that what the judge said to him last night is similar to what the current Home Secretary said as recently as three years ago, when he was shadow Home Secretary. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If a police officer, a Member of Parliament or even a Secretary of State were charged with an offence of dishonesty, would they not insist on being tried by a jury? If that is the case, why should others be denied that right of election?--[Official Report, 27 February 1997; Vol. 291, c. 434.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is it not remarkable that he has changed his views so radically in only three years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes, and I do not understand why. I am prepared to try to see where the Government are coming from. I accept that they are charged with the administration of justice and want to make it efficient, that there have been abuses in the system, that it is expensive and that there are long delays, but I cannot for the life of me understand why the Bill is so absolutely explicit. It lays down that when magistrates consider whether a matter should go to trial by jury, they cannot prevent it. They would be hauled before the Court of Appeal if they considered the circumstances of the accused. That is my difficulty.
<P>
I am prepared, reluctantly, to go along with the rest of the Bill. I accept that the modern world is as it is and the criminal justice system is under pressure. However, I refer to what my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath said in an intervention and to the former wise words of the Home Secretary.
<P>
Why are the Government seeking to prevent magistrates from making any consideration of the circumstances of the accused? I may be unfair and the Minister can reply shortly, but the amendment is probably viewed as a middle-class amendment. Only a typical professional person hauled before the courts at the age of 45 for a first shoplifting offence would benefit from it, the argument would go. However, that is unfair: it should not be viewed as a middle-class amendment.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many people have strings of convictions, but everyone at some stage of their life is a man or woman of good character. It does not matter where people come from or whether they have any professional qualifications or no qualifications at all. At some stage of life, there comes a terrible moment when an adult of good character is accused of a crime and is likely, if found guilty, to lose the reputation of being of good character. People can come from any walk of life, be black, white, middle class, working class, from the north or the south of England--it does not matter. At that critical moment, people have a right to trial by jury.
<P>
The judge made another point. He said that one way to deal with the problem is to shorten the period for which people found guilty of minor offences effectively lose their good character, which affects career prospects. The judge also said that nothing really happens to shoplifters, who usually get a conditional discharge and never go to prison. Of course that is true. No one suggests that a middle-aged housewife found guilty of walking away with a few goods from Asda should go to prison. Of course a conditional discharge, probation or a fine will ensue--but that is not the point. To the person concerned, it is a devastating experience. I have seen middle-aged women break down. No doubt they get over it, but they feel destroyed because they have been found guilty of dishonesty in a public forum. The dishonesty is what gets the gut of people, who fear that the local paper will publicise the fact that they were found guilty in a local magistrates court of stealing. That is why we should draw back before we dismiss such a sensible amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice </B>(Lewisham, East): I am still puzzled. The hon. Gentleman makes the same argument about a shoplifter as the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire. Why are Opposition Members so convinced that magistrates, who come from local communities and neighbourhoods, are incapable of reaching a verdict of not guilty for such a middle-aged woman in that situation? Does the jury have extra wisdom, which enables it to reach a better verdict?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is an extremely good intervention and I am glad that the hon. Lady made it. She posed a question that we must answer. It is a difficulty that confronts us as we argue our point. The more we argue in favour of the right to trial by jury, the more difficult it becomes to state that we have great faith in lay magistrates. I recognise the difficulty and there is no point in denying it. We cannot say publicly that we have no faith in lay magistrates. We do have faith in them. [Interruption.] I am trying to be honest. I have seen how many magistrates and stipendiaries operate, and the unpaid work that they undertake conscientiously is fantastic.
<P>
However, it was said in a previous debate that lay magistrates do not spend a lot of time doing full-scale trials. I have not done many full-scale trials on the evidence on a dishonesty charge in front of magistrates. The reason is obvious: many people want to go to a jury. Magistrates spend much of their time dealing with guilty pleas and they hear a lot of nonsense. A huge mass of ridiculous so-called pleas of mitigation are made by local solicitors representing the worst part of local society. Magistrates come, rightly, from the best parts of local society and all walks of life. I accept that. Such people have made an effort in life and are law-abiding. They hear a lot of garbage, nonsense and drivel. I have been in that position, and the same applies to judges. There is no doubt that, eventually, one's belief in human nature is affected--this is not a criticism of magistrates--because one sees an appalling trail of humanity trudging past one every day of the week, guilty of breaking up our estates, committing burglaries, thieving and lying. The police cannot keep pace with it.
<P>
I hugely admire the work that magistrates do and the care with which they consider cases. However, at the back of my mind is the knowledge that, if I were accused of a crime that I did not commit, I would have more faith in a jury, because it is made up of 12 ordinary men and women, who are not in any way case hardened. As my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath has said, they will consider my case and the offence with which I am charged on their merits, and put out of their minds all that has gone before.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor </B>(North-West Leicestershire): Can the hon. Gentleman clarify the context in which magistrates are subjected to the unremitting flood of garbage that he describes? I declare an interest as a life member of the Magistrates Association. Is the context the pleas of mitigation or the relatively rare trials--as he rightly describes them--heard by magistrates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I suppose that there is a trap in the hon. Gentleman's question, but I do not know. If the trap is that many of the people who plead not guilty are in fact guilty, I accept that. We all know that many people tell lies in court and abuse the criminal justice system, but that does not defeat my point that judges, stipendiary and lay magistrates--through no fault of their own and because of their heavy work load--often have a certain view about the nature of a defendant, however much they try to put it out of their minds.
<P>
A solicitor put an important point to me last night, when I was trawling for opinions on the subject. When he argues a legal point in front of magistrates, he may have to discuss the defendant's circumstances and the background to the case. Then the magistrates must, in theory, put such matters out of their minds. They try to do so, but they cannot. However, a jury is sent out of the room and all the extraneous matter is discussed in its absence. A jury concentrates only on the evidence.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): The hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Ms Prentice) asked a pertinent question, and I have made it clear that I strongly and genuinely support magistrates. Is it not also a fact that magistrates live day in, day out with the police appearing in front of them? They will not say that they do not believe a police officer, but if they reach a conclusion that leads the police officer to think that they have not believed him, albeit that there was another reason for that finding, that factor will trouble them, but not the jury, which does not have to make such decisions day in, day out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is an important point. Of course, magistrates courts used to be called police courts. I might get into trouble with this answer, and I know that magistrates do not want to favour the police, but the police protect us all and do a difficult job. As my right hon. and learned Friend said, many magistrates see the same police all the time. If one person says one thing and a policeman says another, it is difficult for a magistrate who has often heard that policeman telling the truth to put that fact out of his mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that a finding of not guilty in the magistrates court is tantamount to disbelieving the evidence of the police? In my experience, those findings have suggested no such verdict. They have occurred in unclear, grey cases, which have been a matter of perception and balance, and on which the magistrates have reached an alternative conclusion to that of the Crown Prosecution Service, which the police advise. It is not a matter of "disbelieving the police", which is a stark and emotive phrase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The hon. Gentleman is night. In many cases, the situation is as he described it. However, anyone who has practised in the criminal courts or who has experience of them will know that the accused and the police are often in direct conflict, particularly on confessions. A practitioner must launch into powerful attacks on the police and, in effect, accuse them of lying. That is not easy, but to do one's job on behalf of one's client, it must be done. I agree that the situation is often as the hon. Gentleman described it, but in other cases it can be a matter of disbelieving the police, and that can be difficult for local magistrates.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I commend the hon. Gentleman for his honesty in accepting that difficulties are inherent in the position for which he argues. It would help if he told the Committee what trials he considers it appropriate for magistrates to conduct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am broadly happy with the present system. Magistrates can conduct all trials, as the current system allows them to. The accused should be allowed to have a magistrate to conduct his trial even if he is accused of a matter relating to dishonesty. There may be many reasons why he prefers a magistrate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): To get the trial over and done with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes, he may want that. He may be worried about going up to the Crown court, where the penalties are more severe. That is a judgment that the accused makes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Is not that the fundamental point? The Government are inviting us to make the decisions for our constituents, whose reputations are at stake. Should not our constituents be free to make those decisions for themselves?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes, that is the traditional system. We are putting too much of a burden on magistrates, who might resent that. The Committee rightly contains several Labour Members who are or have been magistrates, but unfortunately the argument appears to set the magistrates against the rest of us. I am not sure whether that is the position. If I were a magistrate, I might feel that the Bill unduly restricted my independence and competence. Why am I allowed to consider all the circumstances of the nature of the offence, and the outcome, but not the circumstances of the accused? Apparently, the Government think that a magistrate is a grown-up person, so I find that restriction difficult to accept.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend hits the nail on the head. Conservative Members are not saying that magistrates are unsuitable to try either-way offences. They have been held to be perfectly suitable to try them--and I think that they are--if the accused accepts it. The point at issue is whether the accused can choose whether to submit himself or herself to the magistrates. Does not this magistrate, anti-magistrate debate that is picking up show only too clearly the kind of thoughts that go through the minds of highly intelligent, experienced magistrates on the Labour Benches? It might be police, anti-police.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr Leigh:</B> Yes, that is a good point.
<P>
My hon. Friend made the powerful point in his opening speech this morning that juries act in a strange and often idiosyncratic way. Often they are not clever people; one can see that as they walk in. They may not be as clever as hon. Members or lawyers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I was all right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend was. Another interesting fact that I learned last night was how funny juries can be. If the evidence against the accused is strong, the judge will often say, "This is an open and shut case. Of course this chap is guilty." Last night, the judge said to me, "I try to put that out of my mind, because it is for the jury to decide", but even if the evidence against the accused is very strong, the jury may go back to the retiring room, say, "There must be something in this. Why is this trial going on?" and find him not guilty. That may sound idiosyncratic, but that is the way of the British jury.
<P>
Equally, when the evidence is weak, the judge may take a legalistic view. The judge may say, "This is a grey area. Does the evidence really stack up? Can we prove this beyond reasonable doubt?" The jury may say, "We are going through all this palaver in this great Crown court. There must be more in it. There's no smoke without fire. We'll find this chap guilty."
<P>
Juries often act in a strange way, not in a logical way. I have enormous respect for the common-sense Judgment of all the juries I have seen. Their judgment may seem strange to those of us who try to be clever lawyers, but to them it is good, plain common sense, and, in a strange way, it works.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> In the context of the discussion about reputation, to which the amendment relates, the other answer to the question posed by the hon. Member for Lewisham, East, is that for an innocent person who is charged with shoplifting, the statistical chance of acquittal is greater in front of a jury. People who believe that they are innocent will risk the greater publicity, because all the evidence is that they stand a better chance of getting off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is an interesting intervention, but does it bolster our case? Some might argue that it does not, because the accused people are being cynical. It has nothing to do with their innocence or guilt or with the ancient rights of Englishmen, but simply whether they can get off. They have a right to make that judgment, but why do more people get off in front of a jury than in front of magistrates? The evidence is the same. Is it because in the higher court a defendant may be better represented, by a barrister, rather than a solicitor? Am I irritating anyone by saying that? The trial moves far more slowly, and there is a careful summing up by the judge. I have been in many tiny Crown court trials where the matter appears to be trivial but enjoys the full panoply of the law. The chap in wig and gown sums up carefully to the jury and goes through all the facts in the case, but also says to them firmly, "You must be satisfied so that you are sure". However trivial the matter, it proceeds in a slow and expensive way. At the end of the day it is a very careful and sure process. We want to have trial by jury, not for the cynical reason that juries are stupid and have the wool pulled over their eyes by criminals, but because it is a fairer, better and more careful process. That is why if any of us were accused of a crime, we would prefer a trial by jury.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): I thank the hon. Gentleman; he has been generous in giving way. He is trying to address the weaknesses of the Opposition's position. The thrust of his argument appears to be that anyone who feels that his character is at risk should have the right to a jury trial. The position before us is different. It shifts the line. There will still be a large number of offences for which people will go before magistrates. How does he distinguish between the position where one should have that right and where one should not? Could he justify that distinction, because I cannot see it? This seems to be a more practical argument than we have heard from the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I do not think that I can give the hon. Gentleman an absolute answer about the right way of going about these things. We are dealing with something that is important and has been around for a long time. We should consider these matters carefully. Many distinguished people in the other place could probably answer him better about the exact borderline of what should be triable either way, what should be dealt with by the magistrates and who should have the right to go to a Crown court. I believe that if one is dealing with an offence of dishonesty, the magistrates should have the right to take the accused's previous good character into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Is not the answer to the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) that it is for the Government and their supporters to justify changing the position? They are putting this forward. We are content with the current division. Is it not significant that when the hon. Gentleman talks about what is more convenient and what might be administratively simpler, he echoes the very fears that Sir William Blackstone expressed a couple of centuries ago? He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>however convenient these powers may appear at first ... let it again be remembered, that delays and little inconveniences in the forms of justice, are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more substantial matters;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that not the constitutional issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes. This is now developing a bit like a jury trial. Just as in a jury trial, or any trial, it is up to the prosecution to prove its case, beyond all reasonable doubt. Surely the Government must prove their case, beyond all reasonable doubt? A jury can begin by thinking, "Oh, this chap is obviously guilty". After hearing the prosecuting lawyer present the case they may decide that it is an open and shut case, but as the trial progresses a little doubt may come into their minds. Is there not that little doubt in the Government's mind? Do they really believe that they have proved beyond peradventure that we should not consider the circumstances of the accused?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Is not a further point that we have not so far heard a single argument to make the case for all these either-way offences becoming offences where there is no choice? There could be a proper argument about where the dividing line would be. People might agree that affray or burglary ought to have the right to a jury trial, but the possession of cannabis ought not. But the Government have not begun to have that debate. They have not allowed that debate. It is an all-or-nothing proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No doubt the Minister will give us the benefit of his views to explain his position.
<P>
<B>Ms Hazel Blears </B>(Salford): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his attempt to look at the balance of these issues. The Government take a different view from some Opposition Members on the principles at the heart of the Bill, and it is proper that we should debate the issues. What would the hon. Gentleman say about the 6,000 or so cases where defendants currently elect for trial by jury, while intending to plead guilty from the outset? Research has shown that in 27 per cent. of such cases defendants intend to plead guilty. Will the hon. Gentleman answer that question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I dealt with that at the beginning of my remarks and acknowledged that there were some abuses. Equally, circumstances surrounding the nature of the prosecution or affecting the accused may change. It might not always be an entirely cynical process, despite what the hon. Lady says. There might be good reasons, when it comes to the Crown court, for people to change their plea. And when it comes to guilty pleas, the Crown court deals with them efficiently, expeditiously and fairly. In any event, I am not sure that this is the huge burden on the criminal Justice system that it is made out to be.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I was just thinking that there are other remedies available to cope with that--for instance, harsher penalties for those who change their plea. There are many devices that could be used rather than the draconian one proposed by the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I would like to make one other point. I know that the Opposition do not like us to say this; perhaps they think that we are being disingenuous, but I assure them that I certainly am not. Despite everything that I have said, those who suffer most will not be the middle class, middle-aged chap or lady up for shoplifting for the first time because magistrates will probably have some sympathy for someone like that.
<P>
Those most affected will be young black people. The Government do not like us saying this and I hesitate to support Justice and their case. Opposition Members often giggle when we agree with Justice, because they think that we are using any old argument and do not agree with it--but that is where all the facts point. As is well known to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, in London particularly, young black defendants form a large part of the clientele in question. However much we as judges and magistrates try to put these prejudices out of our mind--and we all do so--in many cases they are still lurking there. We have to accept that and the case that the Government have to answer is that young black people probably get a fairer trial when those making a judgment about their innocence or guilt are drawn from a wider cross-section of society. I am sorry to have taken so long in my attempt to argue some of those points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> We have had a long and important debate on the amendment. No apology is needed from the hon. Member for Gainsborough. He was very open in discussing these questions, and necessarily so. I shall try to respond to the points that have been made.
<P>
First, to lay one canard, this debate is not about the merits of the jury system. The Government accept many of the arguments made by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and other members of the Committee about that. The jury system has great value; it is integral to the British criminal justice system as a whole; there are no proposals in the Bill to fundamentally change that. The amendment deals directly with the Bill's central provision and that is the circumstances in which the jury system as opposed to the magistrates court should be used as a means of deciding whether somebody is guilty or innocent. That is the first and critical point. The hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Gainsborough were commendably honest and direct in addressing the issue and I pay tribute to them for doing so.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In our second sitting, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That leads to the question whether we trust magistrates more than judges. I shall not beat around the bush: I trust a judge and jury more than I trust the bench. That is my view, which is based on experience: I know that people get a better trial from a jury of 12 people who consider the facts and a judge who must direct them who knows that the case will be open to review if he gets it wrong.--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 25 May 2000; c. 35-36.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to make the case.
<P>
On Second Reading in another place, that judgment was implied in many noble Lords' speeches, although that was not drawn out as honestly and clearly as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey had done. The hon. Member for Gainsborough made much the same point in a different way. From his experience, he believed that there was no parity--in respect of the fairness of trials--between magistrates and a jury. He said that that was the profound reason lying behind the concerns of Opposition Members about the Bill. Opposition Members genuinely expressed their personal esteem to magistrates in various ways, but they could not escape from the implication that magistrates' justice was less fair and less just in a profound sense than trial by jury.
<P>
We do not accept that case. Some of my hon. Friends have been magistrates and spoke powerfully about their experience. I can also provide testimony of my own. After the No. 1 Bill was defeated in the other place, I went on "The World at One" the following morning. I had spoken that morning in my constituency to a senior magistrate of 25 years' standing. She was an active Conservative who had given many years of public service. She said that we were absolutely right and should hold to our proposals come what may. She believed that the magistrates courts provided fair trials and that opponents of the Bill had not understood how the magistracy had changed over the past 25 or 30 years. Comments made in another place and in Committee here have not paid sufficient tribute to changes in the magistracy. The idea of magistrates as police courts was expressed in another place, but it is simply wrong.
<P>
I pay tribute to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and his right hon. and hon. Friends in government who had a positive programme to improve the quality of magistrates courts, a programme similar to what my right hon. and hon. Friends are taking forward with energy and expedition. As with judge and jury courts, there is always a need to improve the quality of justice in magistrates courts. It has changed and improved. Many of the stories that we have heard relate to the circumstances of magistrates courts 25 or 30 years ago.
<P>
Only three arguments can be made: the magistrates provide unfair trials; juries are unduly lenient; and magistrates are unduly harsh. Those are the only possible conclusions stemming from the argument that there is no parity between the two types of system regarding the fairness of trials.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister says that there are only three arguments. However, the key argument relates to the confidence of the population of England and Wales, which has grown up with the jury system, believes in it and has a right to choose. As the Minister rightly points out, 97 per cent. of all cases are tried by the magistrates. A huge number of either-way trials are conducted that way with the defendant's voluntary approval. The defendant's right to choose, not the quality of the magistrates court, is at issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The fact remains that there is no right to choose in 1.4 million cases every year. People are tried in a magistrates court, whether they like it or not, whatever the circumstances and however they feel about it. The point was put powerfully by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey: people do not have that choice now. Let me put this point to members of the Committee: should 1.4 million people be given the absolute right to jury trial in all cases? Responding to an intervention, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, my colleagues and I all pressed that point. The right to jury trial, identified by the right hon. and learned Gentleman as a key point, is not an absolute right for anybody who commits any crime of any description at any time. It is a highly qualified right and we are debating in Committee what those qualifications should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Before the former Attorney-General intervened, my hon. Friend suggested that three conclusions were possible. However, there may be other considerations. Magistrates could be viewed as more acceptable and appropriate for dealing with cases in which people pleaded guilty; for sentencing rather than adjudicating the facts and the law; and for dealing with offences that are generally agreed by the community to be less serious. We have not, however, debated that yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is precisely the point to which I was coming. The hon. Gentleman's jibe that nobody in government had defended it was unfair because all the speeches, as opposed to interventions, in the debate so far have been made by Opposition Members.
<P>
The profound and important conclusion that I draw is that, if we have a duty to provide a fair trial, which we do, we must ensure that the magistrates courts and judge and jury courts provide equally fair trials. That conclusion is not shared by some members of the Committee. They are entitled to argue their point, but we do not agree with it. We believe that fair trials are offered by both systems, not just as a tribute to the worthiness of magistrates, but because of practical experience of how the legal system works. We accept that the fairness of trials can be improved. I pay tribute to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and to my hon. Friends who are working to enhance fairness in all forms of trial. We shall continue to do that, but that does not mean that one form of trial is less fair than the other.
<P>
I shall directly answer the point raised by the hon. Member for Gainsborough. I was first asked where I would choose to be tried myself by Jeremy Paxman, live on "Newsnight". I said that, if I were caught walking out of a bookshop with a book that had not been paid for under my arm, I would be happy to go before a magistrates court. It would not occur to me to do otherwise for that sort of offence. I have absolute faith in the ability of magistrates courts to provide fair trials. If I, as a Member of Parliament and a Minister, were to say that I did not have faith in that system, it would be a profoundly dangerous view to propose, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey acknowledged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> How then does the Minister interpret the fact that his right hon. Friend the Home Secretary--his ministerial superior--said directly the opposite, as recently as February 1997, in a passage that I quoted earlier in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> My right hon. Friend speaks for himself. The point made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough is that individuals must decide for themselves where they fall on this issue. Different people will fall in different ways. The key issue is the extent to which rights should be circumscribed, as set out in the Bill. I have my position; my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has his position; my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has his position. I was asked for my view and I am providing it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Is not the logic of the Minister's argument that all cases should be tried by the magistrates? What is the point of having a jury trial'? The Minister opened his speech by stating that the Government strongly believed in Jury trials and were making no underlying attack on them, yet the logic of the argument is, as I said, that all cases should be tried by magistrates. Why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I will come back to specific offences. I intend to run through them to deal with an important point. My hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Ms Blears) put the case eloquently in an intervention--a balance has to be drawn. There is a balance now. Some cases automatically go for jury trial; some cases automatically go to the magistrates' court; some cases can be either way, which is what we are talking about today. That is how our system has evolved. There is no intention on the part of the Government to threaten that key right to jury trial that is a core element for the more serious offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have just two last points before we move on. The hon. Gentleman's has a view about where he has confidence, but others have different views. If the public are to have confidence in the system, the more you can give them that choice within an acceptable range, the more confidence there will be generally. It is not a matter of whether there is confidence in magistrates and/or jury trials: all the evidence shows that what is important is where there is the most confidence. No one is saying that they do not think magistrates produce a decent system. They are merely saying that they believe that the Crown court and the jury trial produces a better system and that they might want to choose that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is precisely the point: people make their judgements. It is not black and white with one being right and the other wrong. I was not trying to suggest that the hon. Gentleman suggested that in his speech. The question is whether one would have an equally fair trial before both the magistrates or a jury. I conclude that one would.
<P>
I now come to the serious range of points that have been raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about the types of offences. The key point here is reputation. I want to describe the current situation. Appendix 5 of the criminal statistics, England and Wales 1998 sets out very clearly those offences which are summary offences showing classification numbers for court proceedings and caution. You will be glad, Mr Maxton, that I am not going to read out all the offences that are summary trial and magistrate only. However, I want to read a number of them that relate to reputation and dishonesty--precisely the points most directly focused on in this Committee. I will just go through them. They include assault on a constable. That is a serious matter when one's reputation is to be affected by the decision of a magistrates' court. There is brothel keeping. It depends on one's attitude to keeping brothels, whether one thinks that that is an important matter for reputation. I would certainly regard it as a serious matter if I were charged with keeping a brothel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That does not sound very likely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Member for Gainsborough has been so direct and straightforward. I am grateful for the courtesy for which he is famous. Some people might think that cruelty to animals is not a very serious matter but there are many walks of life in which cruelty to animals would be seen as serious and which would affect one's reputation. Cruelty to or neglect of children is very serious. Being found guilty in a magistrates court of being cruel to or neglecting a child would be very damaging to one's reputation and professional prospects. Then there is night poaching and day poaching. I do not know Gainsborough very well and I do not know whether poaching takes place there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> They are all Lincolnshire poachers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I though that there was a reference there, but in Norfolk, of course, there is no knowledge of it at all and certainly not in my constituency of Norwich. That is, however, an offence of dishonesty. If one is found guilty of poaching, one is found guilty of doing something dishonest.
<P>
Stealing, unauthorised taking of a conveyance and aggravated vehicle taking are dishonesty offences that affect one's reputation. Indecent exposure is not about dishonesty, but it is certainly about reputation and it would be very serious if any of us in this Committee were found guilty of indecent exposure. It would be very damaging to our professional careers.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> If the right hon. and learned Gentleman will forgive me, I will just finish my list and then I will give way to him.
<P>
Drunkenness is a very serious offence in many walks of life and being found guilty would exclude one from certain occupations. The labour laws, including the Shops Act 1950 and the Employment of Children Act 1973, are very serious matters. If one is found guilty of employing an under-age child, that is a serious matter affecting one's reputation. There is also kerb crawling. Poor Sir Allan Green, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, was found guilty of kerb crawling and it so damaged his reputation that he had to leave his job immediately.
<P>
In some areas, offences in relation to Sunday trading might be thought to be very damaging to one's reputation, as would drug offences. Other serious offences include impersonating a police officer, which would seem to be a dishonesty offence, and driving after consuming alcohol or taking drugs. There was a footballer of the much-reviled Ipswich Town--now, unfortunately, in the Premier league who was found guilty of driving after consuming alcohol. He had to pay for the offence: at the end of last year he played on the football pitch with a tag on him. That was damaging to his reputation. "Work record-falsification" is dishonesty.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Fraud, forgery, etc. associated with vehicle or driver records<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is dishonesty. People can be silly about speed limit offences, but I am sure that, after being found guilty of speeding, David Beckham would think that his reputation had been seriously damaged.
<P>
I am sorry to have detained the Committee, Mr. Maxton, but I wanted to list the kind of offences under the present and previous Governments, including dishonesty, that affect reputation and are tried summarily in a magistrates court with no right to trial by jury. It is a significant list.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Does the Minister accept that one reason why the Bill is following this process is that, in past considerations of whether an offence should be triable only in a magistrates court, or either-way or by jury, no separate consideration was given to the reputation point? That was not suggested to be the rule before. In addition, in every case during my lifetime that I was able to check, serious consideration was given, offence by offence, before a decision was made to propose the removal across. That was the up-to-date consideration at the time the Government of the day introduced proposals to make the changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Where the hon. Gentleman has a fair point--I accept it--is in saying that the issue could be approached in a different way by total reclassification, using as criteria commonly accepted concepts of seriousness and understood concepts of dishonesty, reputation or whatever. It is possible to argue that we could have gone about this in an entirely different way by having a massive reclassification debate. However, that would have been a substantial and time-consuming process, because it would have been difficult to get a consensus in the House, let alone in the country and the criminal justice system as a whole, on what should or should not be tried in a specific way.
<P>
<B> Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I was puzzled as the Minister was reading out his list of summary-only offences. Item 814 on page 273 of the same document refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Fraud, forgery, etc. associated with vehicle or driving records.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister made the point that that is a summary-only offence. Page 270 deals with what is entitled, first, "Indictable motoring offences" and then "Trial-either way offences". Two pages before that, I find item 814:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Fraud, forgery, etc. associated with vehicle or driver records:
<P>
1. Forgery, etc. licence. (TEW).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am finding the same categorisation coming under summary and trial either-way. I find it difficult to read and understand the lists. Will the Minister clarify how seemingly the same offences come under summary and trial either-way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The difference is between indictable motoring offences and summary motoring offences. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is a lawyer with a great deal more experience in the courts than I have and he knows more than I do about the breakdown between offences. I think that I am right in saying that a side benefit of this approach has been the relatively recent publication of the appendices for the first time in order to help the debate. If there is any lack of clarification, I am happy to write to the right hon. and learned Gentleman to set out the matter more clearly.
<P>
<B> Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful. I do not want to waste time on false points. The Minister was right to say that the publication for which we asked has been helpful, but it is difficult to read and understand. It would help if he would ask his officials to write to me as soon as possible, explaining why
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Fraud, forgery, etc. associated with vehicle or driver records<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
appears under both categories--that is, "either-way/indictable" or "and summary" and what the difference is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I will certainly write to the right hon and learned Gentleman in the way that he suggests.
<P>
My final point on this matter is that, whatever way in which we went about the process--total reclassification, the Bill in its current form, and so on--there is fundamental problem for members of the Opposition, which is that, if there is an absolute right to jury trial in the case of offences that affect reputation or should affect dishonesty, the only conclusion that can possibly be drawn from their position is that an absolute right ought to be established in the case of many of the offences that I have listed which also affect reputation and honesty.
<P>
I know that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen are not arguing about parking tickets--which, as motoring offences of a relatively trivial sort, are in the category "summary only" cases--but serious cases are involved which are rightly tried by magistrates and affect reputation and dishonesty. In my opinion, if an argument is to be made against the Bill, the only consistent position for the Opposition to take is to say that these should not be tried by magistrates but should be tried each way and should be shifted after the process of public consultation. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and the Conservative Members on the Committee have an obligation to be straight about that point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Will the Minister accept that I never put the argument that it is the reputation test that should be the dividing line? That was an argument that came first from the Government in the No. 1 Bill. It seems to me that the issue is always the seriousness of the offence. That is the debate that we should have. I am grateful to the Minister for the opportunity at least to identify the question and what the test should be. I should be interested to know why the Government did not think of going down that road between the general election and their proposal to introduce either the No. 1 Bill or this one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The reason, as I said earlier, is that the process of reclassification, whatever criterion is used--whether the one suggested by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire or another type--is difficult and complicated and it would necessarily throw more heat than light on the overall process.
<P>
The amendment would enable the court to take account of the circumstances of the accused when deciding mode of trial and would enable the magistrates to do what they are precluded from doing by the Bill--consider the circumstances of the accused when deciding the venue for trial.
<P>
Our initial view, as stated by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire when he moved the amendment, was that the court should take account of the implications of conviction for the accused's reputation and livelihood and the original Bill so provided, as a number of colleagues on the Committee have said. That approach was widely criticised in another place as creating "two-tier justice". There was a perception that the provisions might discriminate against the poor and the unemployed and in favour of prosperous or employed defendants and that it was--I do not attribute this to the hon. Member for Gainsborough--a middle class approach.
<P>
We took careful note of the concerns that were expressed in the Lords and more widely and the current wording is an attempt to respond to them by strengthening the safeguards in the Bill and amending the criteria to make them as objective as possible.
<P>
Under new section 19, the courts will be required to make an objective allocation of cases based on the circumstances of the offence and the nature of the case. Where the circumstances of an offence are such that the magistrates consider that, if proved, it would be beyond their sentencing powers--here the sentencing point arises again--the case would be directed to the Crown court for trial. A case would also be directed to the Crown court where features of the case, such as its complexity, made it more suitable for trial there.
<P>
Much of the concern about the Bill ignores the fact that magistrates already deal with the vast majority of criminal cases--more than 97 per cent. of the people already referred to. Magistrates also exercise exclusive jurisdiction to try many offences that have potentially serious implications for the accused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sorry to be rather slow here. I want to go back to the important point about the No. 1 Bill. If the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment, could they at least consider accepting an amendment whereby magistrates could consider the circumstances of the accused if he was of good character? That would overcome the argument that they are looking at the matter only because the person is middle class, has an important job or whatever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am prepared to look at the point. We clearly do not have a great ideological division on this point. We proposed one solution in the No. 1 Bill and another in the No. 2 Bill. We did that to try to take account of the debate. We think that what we have here is right, but I will look at the wording that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned to see whether we can do anything.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire cited the example of the defendant from Orkney charged with drink driving and failure to give a specimen. I think that that case took place some time ago. If the same case arose today, the defendant would have no right to demand trial by jury because Parliament has determined that these offences should be tried exclusively by magistrates. The right hon. and learned Gentleman can correct me if I am wrong, but that reclassification was made under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which was introduced when he was Solicitor-General. This process has been constantly evolving, under Conservative Governments for 18 years, as well as now.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The point of my example was nothing to do with the drink driving clause. There was no breathalyser and the only question was whether the offender should have given a sample. It was simply one ingredient in the then law. He was staggering about, slurring his speech and appeared to be drunk. The point of my intervention, as I made clear, was that a much respected Crown court judge took one view and the jury took another, for reasons which, when one stands back and looks at them, show how the common sense of the jury provides genuine protection to the citizen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I understood the point made by the right hon. and learned Gentleman. I did not want to misrepresent him. I am sorry if he felt that I did. I was seeking to make the point that that case is a classic example of how the reclassification has taken place over time under Governments of all colours. The suggestion that an absolute right, going to back to Magna Carta, is being removed does not stand up.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I must not intervene too much. I shall try to summarise these points. The Minister is simply wrong to say that it does not go back to Magna Carta. Has he studied this? He surely recognises that trial by jury for the vast bulk of criminal offences has been standard since at least the early 14th century.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I have studied it. As I said right at the beginning, nothing that we are proposing in the Bill challenges the key importance of the principle of jury trial identified by the right hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon. Member for Surrey Heath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> It chips away at it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is a legitimate point for the hon. Gentleman to make in saying that the reclassification should not take place, because he does not want to chip away at the various points. The fact is that the fundamental rights are not being challenged.
<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice:</B> I had thought of intervening earlier with a little lesson on medieval history, but I restrained myself. I remind my hon. Friend and Opposition Members that, even in relatively recent times, it was not true to say that one was tried by a jury of one's peers. The property qualification for jurors was not removed until the late 1950s.  For many of the rest of us, it would not be accurate, even as recently as that, to say that this was a trial by our peers as such.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is a powerful and important point, well made. It illustrates the power of the Government's argument overall, which is that our criminal justice system is evolving--as it should. The evolution just described is important and progressive. I believe that the proposals in the Bill are an important evolution.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Proposed new section 19(2)(c) makes it clear that magistrates have to take account of whether they have the power to impose the right punishment for an offence, but only with reference to paragraph (b) to which we are considering an amendment. Would not the punishment depend upon the previous record of the accused? Has it been considered whether the track record of the accused can be taken into account, even though that is clearly a circumstance of the accused?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is a perfectly fair point. The Government do not accept that a jury should try a defendant for a minor offence, unless there are aspects of the offence that make it more serious and therefore more appropriate for trial on indictment. Some of the serious aspects of the offence may relate to the accused. For example, an alleged breach of trust by a person in whom a high degree of trust is placed is one of the features that would make a case more serious and thus suitable for trial on indictment. The personal circumstances of the accused, including his or her reputation and the possibility that a conviction might affect his or her livelihood, would not be relevant in deciding the appropriate court to try the case.
<P>
We have also considered whether the courts should take account of the defendant's previous criminal record in deciding venue for trial and have concluded that that should not be a relevant consideration. The defendant has traditionally been entitled to have that information concealed until sentencing. Revealing information about previous convictions at the mode of trial hearing would be a serious step since it might have the effect of denying summary trial to many defendants who would have preferred it.
<P>
The Government have accepted the argument that the courts should deal with these cases on the basis of the seriousness of the offence and not the circumstances of the offender. If previous convictions were revealed, a jury would try defendants with a long record, whereas the magistrates would try those without previous convictions in similar cases.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister because he has at last turned to the substance of the amendment and I would just follow up the point rightly put to him by his hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk with relation to 19(2)(c). Is there not a fundamental flaw in 19(2)(c) which the Minister should address directly in his speech? 19(2)(c) says that the court shall consider
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>whether, having regard to the matters to be considered under paragraph (b), the punishment which a magistrates' court would have power to impose for the offence would be adequate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yet, since it cannot consider his previous convictions, how can the court--the magistrates--decide whether the punishment is adequate? We should consider the classic example put by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. Somebody with a first-time shoplifting offence is deeply unlikely--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If this is an intervention, it is rather long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I believe that the position is very clear. I tried to say it clearly but perhaps I was not being clear enough. We feel that the principle, which I think is well established in law, that people should be judged on the merits of a particular incident as to whether they are guilty or innocent of a particular charge is the right way to operate. Their history should not be taken into account at that point. I take slightly amiss the suggestion that I have been rather dilatory in responding to the particular points of the amendments. With all courtesy to you, Mr. Maxton, and to Mr Sayeed, I think that I can fairly state that in moving his amendment, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and many other hon. Members have ranged very widely. It would have been inappropriate if I had not responded to those points.
<P>
I hope that, upon consideration, the right hon. and learned Gentleman will withdraw his amendment. If not, I urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> This has been a useful debate. I am a little sorry that the Minister did not take the opportunity to pick up the point that I sought to make, albeit  at too great length for your patience patience, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
The amendment effectively states that the courts should do what the Lord Chief justice, Lord Bingham, advised, and should be able to take everything into account. Lord Bingham was right: he said that he was not enamoured of the equivalent provision in the earlier Bill, because it drew specific attention to reputation.
<P>
The Minister and the Home Office have "lost the plot" on the matter. Those are not my words, but those of the heading in the New Law Journal of the recent article by Professor Michael Zander, who is one of the people on whose support the Minister especially relies.
<P>
I think that I have the Minister's ear at present. Has he not read the article by Professor Zander? I will cite it, to put it briefly on the record, and then pass it across to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am paying great attention to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks. I have not relied in my speech on this or other occasions on Professor Zander or anyone else, so he cannot say that I rest my case on Professor Zander. I want to make that clear.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister is uncharacteristically misinformed, because both the Home Secretary and the Home Office--and the Minister, I take it, as I imagine that he and the Home Secretary speak with one voice--have placed enormous reliance on the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, headed by Lord Runciman, of which Professor Zander was a distinguished member, as I am sure the Minister knows. The report was unanimous.
<P>
As the report makes clear, and Professor Zander states in his article in the New Law Journal for 10 March 2000 at page 366, a copy of which I obtained from the Library this morning and shall lend to the Minister after the debate:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> But not allowing the court to take such matters--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the defendant's reputation and previous convictions--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>into account is even worse. The main reason for having the possibility of jury trial in "either way" cases is that the case is sufficiently serious, whether intrinsically or for this particular defendant, to make it right to allow him to put his case to the judgment of his peers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall read one more sentence:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Obviously, the report of the Runciman Royal Commission can no longer be cited in support of the Mark 2 Bill, since the Commission placed great emphasis on the view that access to jury trial was important for cases involving potential loss of reputation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This where the fundamental flaw in the Bill comes. How are magistrates to decide? I shall be grateful if the Minister intervenes to tell us, as I did not have an opportunity to ask him during his speech. How will they decide whether they have sufficient powers of punishment, if they are not allowed to make a distinction between someone with a completely clean record and someone with a string of previous offences--let us say, of housebreaking, burglary, theft or handling, as in the kind of cases that the Minister relies on--for whom six months' imprisonment is deeply unlikely to be adequate?
<P>
Here the Bill is fundamentally flawed and the Minister has failed to argue the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> How does the example that the right hon. and learned Gentleman gave of magistrates courts finding that they did not have the powers to pass the sentence that they would like to pass, in view of the severity of the offence, differ from what happens at present? It is not uncommon in certain circumstances for magistrates courts to pass cases to the Crown court for a harsher sentence. The evidence may emerge later and may not be clear from the statement of case available when a decision is made on mode of trial.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly--he will correct me if I am wrong--the difference is that magistrates are not obliged to decide every case at the moment. If the prosecutor asks for a case to be tried in the magistrates court, the magistrates will consider whether their powers of sentence are adequate. For that purpose, they expect to be informed of the defendant's criminal record. Obviously, the same magistrates will not decide whether the case goes to the Crown court and then try the defendant if the case is retained in the magistrates court. At present, and sensibly, the magistrates can take the record into account. Our justice system would be absurd if they did not do that. Yet the Bill tells magistrates that they cannot take the record into account, notwithstanding the fact that they must consider whether they have adequate powers of sentence. That absurdity leaps from the page, and the Minister has failed to explain it.
<P>
It is not the Opposition's duty to correct a Bill with which we fundamentally disagree. I will not push the amendment to a vote, because it goes to the heart of the change made after the Lords rejected the No. 1 Bill. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), with whom I profoundly disagree on this matter, would support the Bill if it were in the form recommended by the royal commission. However, he cannot support it because of that change. I tabled this small amendment to highlight that issue, but the Minister has not responded. It is for Ministers to answer for themselves. I will not push the matter to a vote and I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath will do so either. However, the gap remains stark and unanswered.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do I assume that the right hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Yes, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 19, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> '; and
<P>
(d) whether in all the circumstances of the case a denial of jury trial would impinge upon the rights not only of the accused but also of the community at large to have the matter considered and adjudicated by a jury.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I will take this amendment and amendment No. 3 quickly, because you have been tolerant in allowing wide-ranging debate, Mr. Maxton. The Minister has already dealt with many points and provided his answers to the questions that amendment No. 2 raises, although with respect, I regard his answers as inadequate.
<P>
The amendment would mean that when magistrates considered whether a matter should go to trial by jury, they would take into account whether denying jury trial would impinge on the rights not only of the accused, but of the community at large, to have a jury consider and adjudicate the case.
<P>
We have, correctly, discussed the rights of the accused in detail so far. lt is important that the accused can choose between trial by jury and trial by magistrate. Of course, people accused of dishonesty sometimes ask to be tried by magistrates. I have said time and again that I have confidence in magistrates, and a high regard for them. I do not want to have to repeat that. I explained that I came from a legal family. My stepmother was a magistrate for 25 years, and her experience was almost identical to that of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire. I respect that. However, the amendment raises the wider issue that a jury trial gives the community at large an opportunity to set the appropriate standards of justice in the vast body of our criminal justice system and particularly in marginal cases.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The classic example is the Ponting case. Although I cannot conceive that magistrates would have refused trial by jury in that instance, since it was an either-way case, it would, if the Bill ever became law, have to come before magistrates to decide whether a jury should try it. It is very unlikely in the next 20 years that magistrates would decide to keep such a case for themselves, but it is an example of the importance to society of magistrates having the ability to set the standards.
<P>
I shall give one other short example from my own experience. I tried a football hooligan case a few months ago in which a young man who had a criminal record for football hooliganism and was not allowed to go to the Millwall match in question, was then accused of inciting a riotous crowd afterwards. The police officer who gave evidence, and who impressed me as an accurate witness, said that he had seen the young man wearing a pink shirt, inciting the crowd to hurl missiles at the police, who had riot gear--and they needed it--as they backed away up a narrow defile towards the tube station.
<P>
The defendant acquitted himself very well in the witness box and called a couple of young women who worked in the Millwall ticket office and happened to have been in the group of 50 people or so, some of whom  were hurling missiles. They said that they had not seen him committing an offence. An issue of fact was involved.
<P>
Two questions arise. I have the feeling that if the magistrates had heard exactly the same evidence as I heard, they would have acquitted this young man. But I also have the feeling that nobody in his position would have felt comfortable going before the magistrates. In acquitting that young defendant, the jury left an unhappy young policeman who had been the principal prosecution witness. There was no doubt that he sincerely and profoundly believed that he had seen the defendant inciting the crowd. This points up vividly what I put in an earlier intervention, which is that it is much more difficult for magistrates to stand back from a case than it is for a jury. It gives confidence to the public at large to know that they would have the right to go for trial by jury if they were in the same situation. This was a small but difficult case and would undoubtedly have led to the young man going to prison if he had been convicted. Equally, I feel sure that Mr. Ponting would have had to go to prison if he had been convicted. They are both examples of how the jury can set the standards for society.
<P>
I tabled the amendment--intending to withdraw it in due course--to highlight this important aspect of the jury system.

<P>

<B>Ms Blears:</B> The amendment refers to the rights of the community to have confidence in the justice system. The Bill is about shifting the principle whereby at the moment only the defendant has the right to make the decision. In future the wider community will have the right to determine mode of trial. The wider community includes the magistrates, who have heard the prosecution and have taken into account the details of the offence. We are moving away from decisions being taken by an individual who can impose his or her view, to a system in which the wider community takes the decision. Does that not strengthen the justice system?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for asking me a pertinent question, which will enable me better to explain why she is mistaken. She is mistaken because the prosecution, the lawyers, magistrates, Crown court judges, police and so forth are the establishment. They constitute the system. The wider community is everybody at large who has to decide only a few cases over limited periods of their lives--a fortnight, usually--and who can stand back from the system.
<P>
The flaw in the hon. Lady's question is the suggestion that the magistrates represent the community. The jury represents the community. The magistrates are highly respected, carefully chosen people, but they are part of the system, just as I am part of the system. I sit as a recorder. If I had not made a career in Parliament, I might well have sat as a judge and have been part of the system. The jury is the community. I ask the Committee to remember that it is part of our freedom. I tabled the amendment to point that out. If this bad Bill were passed, it would be slightly better if the amendment were accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity further to debate magistrates' intentions when they take decisions about where a case should be tried. I repeat, to make it absolutely clear, that my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) and I believe that tampering with the Bill by making small amendments is an unsatisfactory answer. We intend to probe the issues rather than suggest that an amendment provides a solution.
<P>
The Government have not properly considered what Bill to place before Parliament. There is no mandate for the Bill because there was no discussion before the election. The public have not gained confidence in politicians as a result of the Bill, and I must tell Labour colleagues that that is a serious criticism. It undermines confidence in the political system when a measure is promised by a political party at an election, but quite the opposite measure is delivered when that party comes into government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): It is different in opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) intervenes from a sedentary position. Since the election, we have changed our policy in one respect. If we are in government after the next election--and I hope that we will--we shall implement the policy on which we go to the country. The Labour party, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, went to the country on a policy directly contrary to the one that is before us in the Bill, which undermines confidence. It is particularly undesirable in the context of criminal justice.
<P>
We have had a strange and hasty consideration of whether reputations should be included or excluded. The proposition in the first Bill has fallen, as the flaw in the reputation test was discovered. We now have a set of considerations in the Bill that excludes many elements that should have been included. Our debates are about establishing what the considerations of the courts should be in determining where a case should be tried.
<P>
I endorse and support the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire who said--contrary to the hon. Member for Salford--that the magistrates, in common with Crown court and other judges, do not speak for the wider community. From the moment that they are appointed, they are judges and are perceived as such. They are drawn from the community, but so are other judges. In that respect, magistrates are no different from other judges, except that they do not sit full-time and are not paid, unless they are stipendiaries, who do sit full-time and are paid. Therefore, some magistrates are exactly the same as other judges, and stipendiaries are hearing more and more cases.
<P>
The public interest must be considered. However, the Bill now excludes the court from considering the public interest in having a jury trial. As I understand it, when a case is brought, two questions are still asked: "Is there more than a 50 per cent. chance of securing a conviction?" and "Is it in the public interest to proceed?" Therefore, it seems proper for magistrates to consider whether it is in the public interest for a case to go to a  jury, because it is of particular local or national significance. That might relate to the defendant, the witnesses, the nature or time of the case and so on.
<P>
Incidentally, it was unfortunate that the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire gave an example of a football hooligan who just happened to support Millwall. As a Millwall supporter--[Hon. Members: "Shame."] I am not at all ashamed. Supporting Millwall is a great pleasure and delight. The club was nearly promoted this year, and I hope that it will be promoted next year. The right hon. and learned Gentleman's story was a happy one, but I hope that people will cite Millwall less frequently as an example of a place where violent events take place.
<P>
I am also protesting to the BBC. In a report last night about Euro 2000, it referred to Millwall, inappropriately and unjustifiably, in the context of football hooliganism. I hope that the BBC will apologise to the club and more widely.
<P>
Judges sometimes pass sentences to set a standard and send a message to the wider community. Similarly, the amendment would provide magistrates with an opportunity to say, "This is the sort of case where we would want a jury to make the decision." A judge would then pass the sentence, so that it could set a standard. Therefore, it seems that the amendment would, rightly, address the public interest question and the setting of standards by allowing the magistrates to consider the interests of the community at large in having a jury trial.
<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice:</B> I want to intervene for two reasons. First, I endorse everything that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has said about Millwall and I hope that he is successful in his debate with the BBC.
<P>
Secondly, I have some difficulty with the amendment. Given the hon. Gentleman's argument, surely proposed new section 19(2)(a) gives magistrates the opportunity to make the decision about whether a case should go to jury trial, or are we looking at the eventual development of a grand jury system, along American lines, whereby a greater number of people than the three magistrates decide where a case is tried in the public interest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall take those points in reverse order. I do not think that a significant number of people have ever argued that we should move to a grand jury system. I do not pretend to be an expert, but I have seen examples and read about such a system, as the hon. Lady probably has. It seems to represent a way of adding greater confidence to the prosecution system and the criminal justice process, which we do not need, so I do not think that we should draw that conclusion.
<P>
I understand the hon. Lady's point that proposed new section 19(2)(a) allows for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the nature of the case<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in general to be looked at. I assumed that that was included so that when magistrates consider the different factors--if we accept the proposal in the previous amendment that they should also consider the defendant and the offence--they have before them the list of matters that should be considered, which should include all of them, or none. Some hon. Members think that if the circumstances of the offence are to be considered, it is logical to consider the circumstances of the accused and the wider circumstances. I appreciate that a legalistic interpretation might be that that is covered by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the nature of the case<P>

However, on balance, I am of the view that

does not necessarily drive magistrates to conclude that they have to consider the full community implications. It is a narrow point but we want to get the drafting right.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Although the Bill is small, paradoxically, if the Government had done their job properly and considered the whole process, it is precisely the type of Bill that they would have produced in draft form. As I have argued twice in this Parliament, it is the type of Bill that that might have gone to a Special Standing Committee first rather than to a Standing Committee, so that evidence could be taken.
<P>
For example, the hon. Member for Gainsborough cited anecdotally the conversation that he had last night with a circuit judge. My understanding is that, although the Home Secretary prays in aid on a regular basis the Lord Chief Justice and the judges consulted by him, their view is not widely held by the judges who try that kind of case every day of the week. My inquiries of people who sit as judges and who were colleagues of mine when I was at the Bar or at university, and unsolicited inquiries--those who have come to me--have suggested that the that the predominant view of those who try cases is that jury trial ought not to be restricted. If the Government tested the opinion of the full-time, salaried judiciary, not the stipes--the magistrates keep them separately, and clearly they have come out in favour--they would have an entirely different representation of view.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us expressly whether the Government have sought the view of the judiciary in general and, if so, with what conclusion. If not, are they willing to do so? If they have only sought the view of members of the judiciary who deal with such cases day in, day out, will they publish the result of that inquiry, giving the number of judges consulted, how many expressed an opinion and what that opinion was? My view is that one of the great flaws of the argument that all the lawyers who judge cases are on our side is that the largest pool in the context of jury trial has not been consulted.
<P>
I appreciate that, ultimately, there is no argument whether the prevailing view should be that which the lawyers hold. I share the Minister's general scepticism. The argument should not be determined by the lawyers' view. That is why an amendment of this nature has merit. We need to ensure that we always consider the view of the community and the defendant.
<P>
I want to add a postscript that relates to the intervention of the hon. Member for Salford. It troubled me, because I heard her make similar comments earlier. She is often in danger of arriving at views that seriously put at risk the duty of hon. Members to ensure that they defend individuals and their rights. If it is thought that we need to shift the balance of opinion in this country from the defendant to the community, we are in danger of living under the tyranny of the majority over the minority. One of the great benefits of Britain should be that we are pluralist and respectful of minorities. We must be especially careful to look after the interests of those who are accused of offences, just as we must in relation to minority groups. Giving the community more power over the individuals whom it is judging is a dangerous route.

<P>

<B>Ms Blears:</B> This is a fundamental part of the Bill and of the reasoning behind it. We must ask by whom the decisions should be made. Are they a matter for the defendant alone and not for the community, victims, witnesses, the police, magistrates or any other wider viewpoints',' Should individuals impose their views on their system for their advantage, whatever that might be, or should a balance be struck in our criminal justice system to draw in the wider stakeholder from the community? I accept the hon. Gentleman's view that we are here to protect the rights of the individual. However, we are also here to advance the rights of the communities that we represent. That balance is pivotal to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand the hon. Lady's argument, but its first flaw is that it was not put to the country. The hon. Member for Lewisham, East made the good point that Parliament has, until recently, continued to increase stakeholding in the criminal justice system. We have lowered the age in which people can participate in cases not only as jurors but as magistrates, we have got rid of the property requirement and ensured equality between women and men, just as we did with the franchise. The jury system has become more representative, but we are now considering legislation that clearly and unarguably represents a significant reduction in the jury system. People will no longer have the right to trial by jury in relation to  hundreds of offences. That approach has never been tested or publicly debated; the public have not been involved.
<P>
Although it is perfectly reasonable for the hon. Lady to argue her case, there are two reasons why she should not feel confident in doing so. First, it has no public mandate. Secondly, it goes in the other direction to that which we have sought to follow for all these hundreds of years. The Government are starting to take away people's right to choose, without careful debate. In the previous sitting, the Minister for the first time got into a discussion of how the proper location for the consideration of cases might be decided.
<P>
I have made it clear that I am happy that we have a criminal justice system in which all offences and the appropriate places for them to be tried are considered every 10 years or so. That is done methodically, carefully, with due consideration, on expert advice and with hearings, and proposals then come before Parliament. To make such changes without that process and to take the whole grand central block of cases and transfer them, lock, stock and barrel, from a procedure in which the defendant has a choice to one in which he has no choice at all, is a usurpation of liberty too far. It seriously troubles me that the hon. Lady thinks that that is a defensible position. It also troubles me that her view appears to be widely held by her colleagues, who seemed to hold a different view so recently.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making an extremely important point. The Committee has seen the 10 pages that list the either-way offences. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that they cover the whole spectrum of our criminal justice system? They relate to violence, sex, drugs, theft, dishonesty and the entire gamut of that system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have seen the list. Ministers will know that we asked questions, sought to establish the truth and eventually got nearly to the list. I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman. It is sloppy and dangerous law making to assume that it is possible to generallse about where people should be tried and that there are no difficult issues. There is no logic in the assumption that it is reasonable to put an offence of carrying a blade into the same category as possession of cannabis. Each case needs to be debated separately. I understand the Minister's point that the matter needs careful consideration. However, I think that I am right in saying that, on all the recent occasions when we have discussed similar measures, we have either dealt with one type of offence--for example the value element of a criminal damage offence, when we decided that, given inflation and the cost of living, the offence should be updated, as has been done with fines--or we have changed the law only after careful consideration of whether offences should be moved from one category to another. Therefore, I hope that if the Government succeed in getting the Bill through the House of Commons, they will at least be halted in their tracks by the argument put forward in the other place that we should not proceed until we have properly considered which offences should be tried where.
<P>
It is a paradox that a review of the criminal justice system is currently taking place, for which Lord Justice Auld and his colleagues have been seeking evidence. It is not as if there is no forum in which we could have the debate. I am troubled that we are having the debate now when some of the changes that this and the previous Government supported have been introduced without being evaluated, although they have reduced delay and increased the efficiency of the criminal Justice system. If people think that there are further matters to consider, we already have a forum in which they can be discussed, but the Government do not intend to use it for the most central proposition of all. The process of making law, let alone the process of taking away long established rights and liberties, will always be difficult for the Government to justify, and I argue that these measures are impossible for the Government to justify on any fair or logical basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I echo a great deal of what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has said and believe that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire has done the Committee a service by tabling this probing amendment, which raises the issue of the wider community. While I support a great deal of what has already been said, I want briefly to mention a couple of other points about the community at large.
<P>
In addition to the fact that the Government have undergone a complete volte face from the position they took when in opposition, right up to just before the previous election, in relation to this particular amendment, they are going against much of what they have said more recently in response to the Stephen Lawrence case and the Macpherson inquiry. It is especially noteworthy that much of the research that has been published and the comments made by organisations such as Justice, Liberty and the Commission for Racial Equality, have suggested that the Bill is completely contrary to the interests of civil liberties. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made clear, when we are considering the interests of the wider community, it is troubling to see in the Government such an authoritarian tendency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> In a moment, but I want to finish my point.
<P>
The new Bill gives the court the power to consider trial venue, taking three factors into account: the nature of the case; circumstances relevant to the alleged offence; and whether the punishment that the court could impose would be adequate. The provision for the court to consider reputation and livelihood has been removed, but Justice says that it should be noted that the new criteria are likely to lead to new and diametrically opposite discrimination. Sentences are likely to be higher for people with previous criminal convictions, who may therefore be outside the court's sentencing powers and fail the third of the Government's relevant criteria. As a consequence, under the Bill, those with a history of criminal activity could be more likely to be granted trial by jury, while those of previous good character would be more likely to be tried summarily. That is directly contrary to the interests of the community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I was interested in the use of the word "authoritarian" in the context of the Lawrence murder and the Macpherson inquiry. Will the hon. Gentleman remind the Committee which Government set up the Macpherson inquiry? What decision did the previous Government take on the matter?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The point that I am making is that the Government have made fine speeches about their proposed responses to their own inquiry and it was their own--but the Bill goes directly contrary to that. I have a vision of Labour Members reporting to their constituency parties at the end of the week or any week in which the Bill is considered. When asked what they have been doing at the House of Commons they would have to reply, "We have been arguing against all the briefings provided by Justice, Liberty and the Commission for Racial Equality." If Labour Members are comfortable with that, I am amazed.
<P>
Evidence is crucial and work has been done by authoritative researchers. I mentioned in a previous debate that several of those professors were already in authoritative positions in criminology and penology about 25 years ago when I was at Oxford. They have retained their authority. They include Professor Mike McConville, who was involved in a study from 1995 to 1998 at the legal research institute of the university of Warwick, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The study has resulted in a comprehensive report published by the Commission for Racial Equality. I direct Labour Members who slavishly follow Ministers in this matter to read that research.
<P>
I practised at the Bar in the criminal courts in the west midlands and represented many defendants from ethnic minorities from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary, who subsequently joined the same chambers, will have had the same experience. Much of what I read in the research report rang true with me, with respect to the interests of the community and fair representation--particularly of ethnic minority defendants. The researchers drew some important conclusions, but I want to focus on what some ethnic minority defendants are quoted as saying.
<P>
In one case, a charge of actual bodily harm against an Asian defendant was reduced to common assault following his election for jury trial at Crown court. We have already discussed in some detail the way in which Government figures suggest that the proposed change is necessary because of the time wasted by people pleading not guilty in the magistrates court, electing jury trial and pleading guilty later. However, that view leaves out what the researchers have wisely uncovered--that often the charge is reduced when the case reaches Crown court or when firmer advice is given to defendants by those representing them. It is not necessarily a question of defendants playing the system. Often the charges are reduced as a result of more thorough investigation of the prosecution case. Also, clearer and fuller advice may be given.
<P>
The Asian defendant who was interviewed by the researchers was asked why he pleaded guilty to common assault and said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it's less of a charge and I will plead guilty to it--so everyone is happy, at the end of the day ... I am helping the court--I'm not saying I didn't do it, what I'm saying is it didn't happen like that.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He meant that the offence did not happen in the way that the original charge was framed at the magistrates court. It was also clear to him that there was a greater chance that the prosecution would reduce the charge, in line with his view of the offence, at the Crown court, and that, if the matter had gone to trial there, the likelihood of an acquittal before a jury would have been greater. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If there is not enough to convince a jury, then it is in your favour. They got to be 100 per cent. sure you did whatever--you don't have to prove you didn't.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If ever there was a clearer example than that quotation of why ethnic minority defendants have a greater faith in the jury system, I do not know what it is. We must consider carefully the views of ethnic minority communities regarding their faith in the justice system and the interests of the wider community, especially in the light of the Macpherson inquiry.
<P>
I wanted to end on the conclusions of the report published by the Commission for Racial Equality. It says that its findings were based on a small sample drawn primarily for qualitative purposes. In fact, as the researchers noted, the sample consisted of 299 cases and so was not that small. It said that the findings cast significant doubt not so much on the statistics being cited by the Government to support limiting the right to elect but on the interpretation of the statistics being put forward. It said that, as far as comparisons were possible, the statistics from its research sample relating to outcomes in either-way cases, almost precisely mirrored those drawn from Home Office research, particularly in relation to the number of defendants who elected Crown court and subsequently entered a guilty plea. It went on to say that in seeking to use the statistics to argue that there is widespread abuse of the right to elect, the Government overlook the limited basis of Home Office statistics, for example, including defendants who are acquitted or otherwise cleared, and ignore the circumstances that lead the majority of those who change their pleas to guilty in the Crown court to do so. The latter include various ways in which the original charges against defendants may be mitigated through late decisions by the prosecution to substitute alternative charges, accept not guilty pleas to some charges or reduce the seriousness of factual allegations against defendants. There is a wider community interest in studying the statistics properly. The Government are foolish to ignore the serious conclusions of the research.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I want to make a brief contribution and to reply to the intervention of the hon. Member for Salford, who asked why the accused alone should have the right to determine the mode of trial and whether there was a wider view of society to be considered. The intervention was fair. The amendments would not bring a return to the status quo with the accused alone having such a right. All that we are suggesting is that magistrates should have the right to consider the matters and to take them in the round. We discussed the circumstances of the accused in an earlier debate and are now discussing the wider circumstances of society. We are proposing a compromise and are being moderate in what we are suggesting. We accept that the Government will not agree with our view that matters should be kept as they are. We are simply saying that it is ridiculous that the magistrate should not have the right to take a wider view.
<P>
<B>Ms Blears:</B> I accept that, were the amendments to be proposed seriously, that would be the effect. However, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire has made it clear that the amendments are not to be pressed to a vote and that the Opposition oppose the Bill in principle. The principle of the Bill is to shift the balance from the individual to a wider group. The Opposition have made it clear that the amendments are not intended as a means of improving the Bill but, if anything, the opposite.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That comment is rather unfair. The hon. Lady knows well the procedural reasons why one might not want to press issues to a vote in Committee. If one does that, it can be difficult to persuade the Clerk to allow the issues to be debated on Report. It might be considered important for Parliament as a whole, rather than just Committee members, to hold such a debate. The Committee has been good and the debate serious. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire has presented the amendments seriously. We believe in what we are saying.
<P>
I shall return to the point that I was making but I will not labour it. If the Government are not prepared to accept the status quo, why can magistrates not have such an opportunity to consider the issue in the round? As my colleagues said, the jury is a little Parliament. It is the only type of Parliament on which most members of the community will serve. We do not live in an Athenian democracy in which all citizens have the right to be law makers, but in a democracy in which the vast majority of the people have the right only to elect law makers. However, they also have the right to sit on a jury. Juries are, therefore, important.
<P>
Magistrates might invoke the provisions of the amendment only rarely, but Labour Members should realise that the boot could be on the other foot. There may come a time when they are not in government and they believe that Parliament is imposing burdensome, reactionary and bad legislation on the British people. Are they happy for magistrates to have no right to consider the wider implications for society of an accused person's case, offence or trial? Is it right that magistrates are not able to refer such cases to a jury, a little Parliament of citizens? The amendment is worthy of debate and its principles should be put to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> In light of the time, I shall not speak at length on issues that do not pertain to the amendment. However, on the point raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about the judiciary, the Council of Circuit Judges was invited to comment on the proposals, but it did not consider that to be appropriate. However, the former Lord Chief Justice made it clear that his views represented those of the senior--I emphasise the word "senior" in response to the hon. Gentleman's comments--judiciary. As for the Auld report, we do not think that everything should be chucked into it for consideration. On reclassification, the hon. Gentleman alleged that the Bill is inflexible because it affords blanket treatment to either-way offences. That is not the case. Reclassification is a more blunt instrument. Magistrates will decide the mode of trial in each case and how to tackle particular points.
<P>
Amendment No. 2 relates to the possible right of the defendant or the community for a case to be tried by jury. It would place a duty on magistrates courts to consider whether a decision by magistrates to try the case themselves would impinge on that right. The right, which is referred to but not defined, is, presumably, in additionto what is in the Bill and would allow the magistrates court to exercise an overriding discretion. I do not understand how that would be helpful or how the courts could be expected to interpret such a provision fairly.
<P>
The court should be required at the mode of trial hearing to consider only the nature of the case and its circumstances. The circumstances of an offence that would make it more suitable for jury trial are set out in the mode of trial guidelines that were issued by the Lord Chief Justice in 1995 when the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire was, I think, Attorney-General. They include offences with a racial motivation; offences in which the victim is especially vulnerable; offences that have professional hallmarks; and offences that involve a breach of trust. The "nature of the case" argument is taken from section 19 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. It, too, is intended to cover cases that, according to the mode of trial guidelines,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>involves complex issues of fact or questions of law, including difficult issues of disclosure of sensitive material.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, we also intend the "nature of the case" to cover exceptional circumstances on which it is necessary to make a value judgment, such as obscenity cases in which the views of a jury might be more useful than those of a Bench of three.
<P>
I understand the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point. The "nature of the case" is important. We are prepared to consider the mode of trial guidelines to see whether we can clarify the matter further. I hope that that responds to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> In so far as it is a response, I am grateful for it, but the Minister has missed the point and it is now impossible for me to conclude by 1 o'clock, as I had hoped. However, I shall be brief this afternoon.
<P>
I want to make two points in summary. The amendment's objective is to obtain the Government's recognition that jury trial, which provides an important protection for every citizen, gives people at large--the demos--control of the criminal justice system. Comparisons are often made between England and Wales and Scotland. I come from a Scots family. My father came south only when he was 19. I have a high regard for Scotland.
<P>
