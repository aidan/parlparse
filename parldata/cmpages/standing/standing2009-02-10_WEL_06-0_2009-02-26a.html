Sanctionable benefits shall be returned to the claimant with

is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess.
Amendment 63 attempts to ensure that if a mistake is made, it is
rectified not only with the restoration of the benefit, but with the
payment of compensation to the people who have suffered the loss. We
have concerns about this clause because it is a change from the current
two-strikes rule to cover the loss of benefit after one sort of
incident. We are worried that such an incident may include an
administrative error as well as fraud. The clause strengthens any
action that may be taken against a benefit claimant, so if it is proved
that a sanction was taken as a result of an administrative error, the
claimant should receive not only what they lost, but a form of
compensation. I hope that the Government will appreciate that the
amendment is fair and reasonable. Such a practice applies to many other
cases in which someone has suffered a mistake. For example, it applies
with tax credits, so it should also apply in this particular
case.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div><a name="09022642000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022642000240"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): It is a great pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess. I listened
carefully to the detailed description of the amendment given by the
hon. Member for Rochdale. Notwithstanding what he said, I have one or
two concerns that the Committee should
consider.</div><a name="09022642000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman might not have fully reflected on the effects that his
amendment might have. He referred to the extension of the benefit
sanction to include the case of one offence. In his opening remarks, he
referred to that as one sort of an incident, but it is not; it is a
benefit offence that would include all cases where somebody had been
convicted of one or more benefit offences in any proceedings, had
accepted an administrative penalty as an alternative to prosecution, or
had agreed to be given a
caution.</div><a name="09022642000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment includes the word &#147;offence&#148;. Under the
amendment, somebody who had committed an offence, including somebody
convicted of an offence before a court, not only would be allowed to
keep the money that he had wrongfully received, but would be given
compensation as well when that was &#147;attributable to a
mistake&#148;. However, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment
mentions a &#147;benefit offence&#148;, so to talk about &#147;a
mistake&#148; misses the point about there being an offence. It would
follow that, if there were some element of mistake in the background to
someone being convicted of a benefit offence&#151;this particularly
concerns me&#151;such a person would then be entitled, under the
terms of the amendment, not only to be allowed to keep the benefit that
they had received, but to receive compensation as well. I look to the
Minister&#146;s response, but because the amendment uses the word
&#147;offence&#148;, the courts could interpret it as covering
cases in which somebody had been convicted of a criminal
offence.</div><a name="09022642000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000241"></a>Paul
Rowen</b>
<i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div><a name="09022642000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000242"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> If the hon. Gentleman wants to say that the
word &#147;offence&#148; means something other than an offence, I
shall look forward to his
explanation.</div><a name="09022642000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000243"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I would only ask the hon. Gentleman to look at the
clause. The terms that I have used are exactly the same as the ones in
the
clause.</div><a name="09022642000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the hon. Gentleman suggesting that if a mistake is made&#151;not an
offence&#151;the clause should allow a claimant to be sanctioned
either through the courts or though administrative means? We are saying
clearly what should happen if an administrative sanction proves to be a
mistake. I know of scores of cases in which that has happened. Does he
not accept that an innocent party should be entitled to compensation,
because that is what happens under tax
credits?</div><a name="09022642000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000244"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> The hon. Gentleman is even more confused than I
thought he was in the first place. He talks about an innocent mistake,
but his amendment does not refer to an innocent mistake. May I read his
amendment to him, because he might not have reflected carefully on it
during its drafting? It
says:</div><a name="09022642000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sanctionable
benefits shall be returned to the claimant with compensation where the
benefit offence is attributable to a mistake made by the Secretary of
State or anyone acting under his authority as provided in paragraphs
(1) to (11) above&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div><a name="09022642000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman refers to the Bill. When I made my first remarks on his
amendment, I carefully set out the circumstances that were covered by
the Bill: when somebody is dealt with by an administrative penalty or a
caution or they are convicted before a court. The  hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would cover all those circumstances,
including the third one&#151;a conviction&#151;but the first two
deal with where an offence has been admitted and are alternatives to a
matter being brought before a court and the person being subject to a
conviction, if found guilty, because an administrative penalty and a
caution both involve an admission of
guilt.</div><a name="09022642000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman now says to the Committee that his amendment would deal
with somebody who is innocent and where there has been a mistake. If
there has been a mistake, there has not been an offence, because such a
person would be able to plead not guilty to the charge and would be
found not guilty if the courts accepted their version of events. If
there were a wrongful conviction, they could appeal against it.
However, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment mentions an
offence.</div><a name="09022642000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
somebody is subject to an administrative penalty or is given a
caution&#151;in both cases they will have admitted their
guilt&#151;or is brought before a court and convicted and sentenced,
if there has been an element of mistake in the background, as there
often is on the part of the authorities in benefit fraud cases, that
does not negate the dishonesty of the person who has committed the
benefit offence. Things might begin with a mistake, but there has been
an offence if someone has dishonestly received benefits to which they
are not entitled.</div>
<a name="09022642000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
clearly set out the effect of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment.
Under it, someone who, in common parlance, would be called a benefit
cheat would be entitled to receive the amount that they had wrongly
been given and compensation on top. People who are convicted of these
offences are sometimes given discharges, community sentences or
suspended sentences. If the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment was
passed and such people were able to establish that there had been some
mistake somewhere in the background on the part of the administrative
authorities or the Department for Work and Pensions, they could say,
&#147;Oh yes, but I&#146;m entitled to keep what I received and I
want compensation as
well.&#148;</div><a name="09022642000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is sending out a strange message. Many people are honest
claimants of benefits, such as those who are in need and have
circumstances that entitle them to benefits, or those who happen to
have been made unemployed&#151;particularly at this time. Such people
honestly claim their benefits and go to great lengths to make sure that
all their circumstances are known. What on earth are they supposed to
think if somebody who has dishonestly received benefits is allowed to
keep the fruits of their dishonesty and get compensation on top? I am
not sure that that is something with which many of my constituents
would agree. I might be wrong about this, but I am not persuaded by
what the hon. Gentleman has said because he has used the word
&#147;offence&#148; in his amendment. I believe that I have
described the consequence of his
amendment.</div><a name="09022642000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000245"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09022642000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000246"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Certainly, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last
intervention did not help him.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div><a name="09022642000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000247"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I refer to proposed new section 6B(13) of the
Social Security Fraud Act 2001, as inserted by clause 19. It
states:</div><a name="09022642000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
this section and section 6C...&#145;benefit offence&#146;
means&#148;</div><a name="09022642000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
sets out clearly what a benefit offence is. The provisions to which the
amendment would add also set out the circumstances in which any sort of
benefit that had been withheld would have to be repaid. All we are
seeking to do is to add to the provisions, not replace
them.</div><a name="09022642000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000248"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I am not going to read the provisions out now,
but I think that the circumstances to which they refer are, in effect,
the same as those that I set out. What those circumstances cover are
actually in the note supplied by the House of Commons Library. The hon.
Gentleman may, with the best of intentions, have drafted a defective
amendment, so I invite him to reconsider and withdraw it. If he wants
to press the amendment to a Division, I will have no hesitation in
advising my hon. Friends to vote against it, because the legal effect
of what is proposed is dubious. Let him be in no doubt that his
amendment refers to an offence. It would give compensation and benefits
that had been wrongly received to somebody who had committed an
offence, and we should not go down that
road.</div><a name="09022642000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000249"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann
McKechin):</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr.
Amess.</div><a name="09022642000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that it would be helpful if I were first of all to summarise the
provision to which the amendment of the hon. Member for Rochdale
relates. A one-strike sanction will apply to cases of benefit fraud
that result in a conviction, or when a caution or administrative
penalty is offered as an alternative to prosecution. There is a need
for legal certainty and we need to make a clear distinction between a
conviction, caution or administrative penalty on the one hand, and
official error on the other. The sanctions are in respect of fraud, not
official error.</div>
<a name="09022642000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 19
allows for all benefit withheld as a penalty for benefit fraud to be
repaid to the customer if a conviction is quashed. That also applies
when an administrative penalty is no longer appropriate if, following a
review or appeal under the internal procedures that already exist, it
is decided that there was no overpayment, or that the sum is not
recoverable. Those are obviously matters of fact. The Department
already has a widespread scheme to provide redress for
maladministration, which allows for compensation to be paid to
customers in appropriate cases. If customers remain dissatisfied, a
complaint can be made to the parliamentary
ombudsman.</div><a name="09022642000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hertsmere raised an interesting point about the
phraseology of the amendment and the fact that it may cover items and
cases that the hon. Member for Rochdale did not intend to cover, such
as if a mistake is actually a fraud perpetrated on the Department. In
the light of that, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022642000213"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

McKechin:</b> The amendments are intended to ensure that we
can apply the new provision to all those who are found guilty of
benefit fraud, including cases which result in an absolute discharge.
The underlying principle of the new sanction is that all those who
commit benefit fraud should be subject to the sanction. Absolute
discharge means that the court is satisfied that the offender is
guilty, but decides not to impose any type of sentence. We see no
reason why such guilty offenders should escape the
sanction.</div><a name="09022642000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
relatively few cases receive an absolute discharge, we believe that it
would be wrong to exclude them from the sanction, especially as those
who receive a caution or administrative penalty for low-level benefit
fraud as an alternative to prosecution will be
sanctioned.</div><a name="09022642000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also want absolute discharges to count for our existing two-strikes
sanction in section 7 of the Social Security Fraud Act 2001. It would
be inconsistent to apply the sanction to someone who receives an
absolute discharge for a first offence, but not to apply it to those
who are absolutely discharged for a second
offence.</div><a name="09022642000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
98 corrects an error in paragraph 6(3)(b) of schedule 4 to the Bill.
That paragraph amends section 11 of the 2001 Act in
consequence of the new provisions introduced by clause 19, which
provides for loss of benefit if a person commits a benefit
offence.</div><a name="09022642000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
11 of the 2001 Act sets out when the affirmative procedure applies to
regulations under the Act. The amendment ensures that the affirmative
procedure applies to regulations made under proposed new section 6B(6)
inserted by clause 19. The proposed new section
allows,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>where the sanctionable benefit is income support, for regulations to
prescribe the manner in which the offender&#146;s entitlement to
income support may be reduced. The Government consider it appropriate
for the affirmative procedure to apply to regulations made under the
power. This will bring the position in line with regulations under
subsections (7) to (10) of proposed new section 6B, which
deals with reduction in other types of
benefits.</div><a name="09022642000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000269"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I seek reassurance from the Minister on one
point. I do not think that this will take terribly long. My concern is
that the provisions should operate independently from the criminal
justice system. I anticipate that that will be the case, because it is
already the case when someone is convicted of two offences and is made
subject to this particular form of sanction. That provision operates
independently of the criminal justice system, and I understand that the
same will apply in these circumstances.</div>
<a name="09022642000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
explain further, so that the Minister fully understands my concern. All
benefit fraud offences are serious, but the degree of seriousness
varies, and the public accept that. It is important that the courts
consider the circumstances and seriousness of individual cases, and
that they judge and pass sentence accordingly. The public are
especially concerned by cases in which people have received large sums
of money over a long period to subsidise a high lifestyle, and who
might already have been receiving other income so that the benefits
that they have wrongly received have been a top-up. In some such
cases&#151;we know that they exist&#151;the people concerned have
lived a high, if not luxurious, lifestyle. I expect that those are the
cases that the public want to be judged most seriously, and for which
they would want people to receive combined punishments. That is our
concern, but we recognise that the seriousness of cases varies and that
they have to be judged accordingly.</div>
<a name="09022642000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
particularly concerned about the people at the higher end of the scale.
I am amazed that, notwithstanding the warnings that the Liberal
Democrats have been given about the effect of their amendment, they
would entitle such a person, in theory, to have their lawyers go back
over the circumstances of the case, notwithstanding that they have been
convicted of an offence or made subject to an administrative penalty or
caution, to see if there had been any administrative mistake, and then
to come back before the courts to get back the money that they had
wrongly received&#151;however many thousands of pounds it
was&#151;with compensation on top. I do not want to put this too
strongly, but some would call that a cheat&#146;s charter coming from
the Liberal Democrats. The hon. Member for Rochdale has been fully
warned about this problem, and I am sure that his constituents will
take a view on this issue. Many of them will feel, as we do, that
people in particularly serious cases, who have got away with large sums
of money, should receive combined punishments. I look to the Minister
for confirmation that the provisions are quite independent of the
criminal justice
system.</div><a name="09022642000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000270"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> If anyone is living in &#147;Alice in
Wonderland&#148;, it is the hon. Member for Hertsmere. I have not
said that anyone who is convicted of a benefit offence should not
receive sanctions. I have made clear our view that compensation should
be payable if the provisions have been administered incorrectly. The
hon. Gentleman should concentrate on what the amendment says, and what
is proposed, rather than imagining cases that do not exist.</div>

McKechin:</b> I am pleased to confirm to the hon. Member for
Hertsmere that the system is completely separate from the criminal
justice system. He is absolutely right that we must all take benefit
fraud seriously. The level of fraud across all benefits is down by more
than two thirds from that in 2001. At 0.6 per cent. of expenditure, it
is at the lowest level ever recorded, but we certainly are not being
complacent. There is absolutely no excuse for fraud, and I do not
consider that the hon. Member for Rochdale has grasped that fraud is
not excusable in any circumstances. The taxpayer certainly should not,
in any circumstances, end up paying back compensation to someone who
has attempted to defraud the Department for Work and Pensions. I
therefore ask hon. Members to support the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000274"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The clause deals with state pension credit, and we
welcome its provisions, which introduce the possibility of pilot
schemes of up to two years to increase the uptake of pension credit.
The clause allows regulations to be made, permitting the payment of a
state pension credit without a claim being made, and with modified
rules concerning how the entitlement is to be determined. The success
of such pilots will be judged on whether there is an increase in
individuals claiming and receiving state pension credit. The pilots
will last for up to 36 months.</div>
<a name="09022642000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The benefit,
which was introduced to raise people above the poverty line, is failing
due to a lack of uptake. It has increased, but after many years
confusion about the pension system remains, and that is exacerbated by
the complex bureaucratic forms that pensioners must fill out, and the
means-testing to which pensioners are subject, in order to receive
their benefits. The system does not deal with the needs of pensioners,
as half of people over 65 years old do not like or seek financial
advice. Indeed, Citizens Advice figures for 2006-07 showed that only 10
per cent. of its clients were over 65&#151;half the percentage of
pensioners over that age as a proportion of the total population.
Without essential advice, those who need pension
credit&#151;vulnerable individuals&#151;do not get it, because they
are unaware of their rights.</div>
<a name="09022642000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should
not be any means-testing for pension benefits, because the system puts
off older people from applying for certain benefits, and they end up
losing in other areas. Uptake of pension credit is also further
diminished by the fact that one in eight pensioners have still not
heard of pension credit. These problems have, we estimate, led to
&#163;2.37 billion of pension credit going unclaimed. As such, each
person loses on average &#163;26.40 in unclaimed pension credit, an
amount that could make a huge difference to people&#146;s lives. Up
to &#163;5 billion of other essential benefits for older people are
never claimed either, and against that background the clause is welcome
because it seeks to extend state pension credit and to ensure that
those who, for one reason or another, are not prepared to navigate the
complex web of forms receive state pension credit.</div>
<a name="09022642000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would extend the pilots to include carer&#146;s allowance
in the pension credit scheme to ensure that carers who are entitled to
pension credit are automatically assessed for entitlement to
carer&#146;s addition, which provides &#163;27.75 in addition to
the pension credit. If the automatic assessment is based only on
income, some older carers may be left out when they would be entitled
to pension credit if their caring responsibilities were
known.</div>
<a name="09022642000214"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="09022642000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, carers must apply for carer&#146;s allowance to receive the
carer&#146;s addition, which cannot be paid alongside the state
pension, and then reapply for carer&#146;s addition. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>That process would be much simpler if the carer&#146;s allowance was
integrated with the pension credit pilots. We welcome the pilots, but
we hope that the Government will accept that it is sensible to include
carers in the
amendment.</div><a name="09022642000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000275"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> May I say&#151;I forgot to do so
earlier&#151; what a glorious pleasure it is to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Amess? In my juvenile approach to
these matters, I hurried along on the first amendment in the hope,
which subsequently proved to be reasonable, that the hon. Member for
Rochdale would not be here to move his amendment 63. I actually think
he rather wishes that he had arrived a bit
later.</div><a name="09022642000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s welcome, but let us be clear. There
is already a question on the pension credit form about whether the
applicant is in receipt of carer&#146;s allowance. There is no such
thing in law as carer&#146;s addition. The amendment&#146;s effect
would be that we could not in any circumstances automatically carry out
the pension credit pilots that the hon. Gentleman welcomes. There is no
such thing in the parent Act or other legislation as carer&#146;s
addition. I am sorry to be pedantic, but I can only work with the words
that the hon. Gentleman used in his amendment. It is clear that he
would not welcome exactly what the amendment would
do.</div><a name="09022642000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
broadly accept what the hon. Gentleman says. Of course there are issues
with take-up, but I do not agree entirely with his rather strangulated
description of pension tax credit and take-up in the first instance. He
seems to want to give the Royal Bank of Scotland chairman pension
credit, regardless of the proper use of public funds. He seems to want
every millionaire and everyone else who manages to reach the
appropriate age to receive pension credit. That is not the best use of
public resources. We are targeting the poorest pensioners, and that is
entirely the right way to
go.</div><a name="09022642000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no separate carer's addition. Pension credit provides an additional
amount for older people who are also carers, but it is not separate
from the pension credit entitlement; it is part of it. The amendment
would not do what the hon. Gentleman wants it to, but would achieve the
opposite, and we would not be able to get on with the automaticity
pilots that he seeks and welcomes. I ask him in the nicest possible way
to withdraw his amendment because it would not achieve what he
wants.</div><a name="09022642000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000276"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I listened carefully to the Minister, but Carers UK
states in its
briefing:</div><a name="09022642000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Approximately
240,000 pension credit claimants received the Carer Additional in May
2008. Out of a total of 2.7 million pension credit claimants, this is
nearly 10 per
cent.&#148;</div><a name="09022642000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the Minister saying that Carers UK is
wrong?</div><a name="09022642000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000277"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> No, I am not. I thought that I had made that
clear. The carer&#146;s addition, which is an additional payment to
pensioners who are also carers, is part and parcel of the pension
credit. There is no separate legal entity under law in the State
Pension Credit Act 2002 or any previous Act, so the amendment drafted
by the hon. Gentleman&#151;not the carers&#146;
association&#151;is completely perverse in terms of the ends that he
seeks to achieve. I would rather he quit while he is ahead, withdraw
the amendment and let us get on.</div>

of the expiry of the specified period referred to in subsection (1),

share the objective of seeking to ensure that pensioners receive what
they are entitled to, and we are aware of the issues with take-up of
pension credit which have been well ventilated on several occasions in
the past, certainly by Members on this side of the House. The purpose
of the amendment is to seek more information about how automaticity
will work in the case of pension credit, because there seems to be a
lack of specificity in some of the details in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022642000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulation-making power that the Government are taking is wide-ranging

automaticity will be piloted

or more specified
areas&#148;.</div><a name="09022642000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the areas will be relatively small in terms of
population&#151;around 2,000 people in each case&#151;but the
Minister will no doubt correct us if we are wrong about that. We would
like to know whether all pensioners eligible for pension credit will be
subject to automatic payment of pension credit in the areas where it is
being piloted. If they are not, we would like to hear from the Minister
what the criteria are by which pensioners will be selected for
automatic delivery of pension credit. We wait to hear more details on
that, and if pensioners will be selected we would like to know whether
matters such as age will play a part in the
selection.</div><a name="09022642000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would like to hear more details about how the piloting will work in the
pilot areas, how pensioners will be selected or whether there will be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000280"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> Those are all perfectly reasonable questions. The
hon. Gentleman is right that the pilot schemes are likely to be fairly
small in scale and of limited duration. He will know that the clause
allows for regulations that will be forthcoming&#151;we hope as soon
as possible&#151;after Royal Assent which will discuss in detail
exactly how the pilots will work and how they will be designed and
evaluated.</div><a name="09022642000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill refers to</div>
<a name="09022642000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;one or more
specified classes of
person&#148;</div><a name="09022642000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
will allow us, following further analysis and design, to target
absolutely everyone in a small area as defined simply by age, or to
target cohorts within the group. There will subsequently be many more
details provided through regulations, and a chance through our usual
processes to discuss them
thoroughly.</div><a name="09022642000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
notion of automaticity is appropriate. With the best of intentions,
many people, including lobby groups, decided that it was somehow not in
their interest or in the interest of pensioners to encourage take-up
because of&#151;quite naturally&#151;the view that somehow pension 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>credit is charity, and something with which pensioners should not get
involved. The opposite is the truth, and it is an entitlement that all
pensioners should at least be able to afford themselves of.</div>
<a name="09022642000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the specifics of the amendment are likely to be small in focus and
duration and that there may well be&#151;we have yet to
determine&#151;a series of pilots in which one pilot learns from the
other in a cumulative sort of way, the notion of putting in place a
backstop at six months is probably not the best way forward. There will
be evaluations of the pilots, which I can guarantee will be published.
Therefore, via Pepper <i class="I">v. </i>Hart, the assurance that the hon.
Member for Hertsmere wants is covered in that regard. The Bill is about
securing the principle and enabling the legislation to allow us to do
that. Details of scope and duration are still to be determined, but we
can discuss them more fully in
regulation.</div><a name="09022642000111"></a>

assurances. As I said in my opening remarks, we saw this as a
wide-ranging power, and the Minister&#146;s remarks have confirmed
that. We were seeking to elicit information about it to scrutinise what
the Government are proposing. We shall continue to do so when we look
at the regulations as and when they are made. Moreover, we want to

contracts are made, it is very important that the staff who are
employed by the various organisations have the right levels of
qualifications. The amendment seeks to ensure that a level of training
is provided so that the staff can meet the needs of the different
claimants. Those claimants 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>can include people with mental or physical disabilities, with caring
responsibilities, with issues of drug and alcohol dependency, and lone
parents with dependent children and lone parents who may have been
subject to domestic violence. Those are some of the sorts of clients
that JCP staff currently deal with. If, as is envisaged in this clause,
a large number of functions will be transferred to other organisations,
we believe that it is very important that a level of training is
provided for
staff.</div><a name="09022642000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me refer Members to the briefing that has been prepared by Rethink, an
organisation that deals with mental health issues. The organisation
quotes the research of the Department for Work and Pensions that
suggests that even with pathways regimes, existing personal advisers
admit that they lack knowledge and understanding of mental health
issues. It
states:</div><a name="09022642000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Mental
health issues (including depression, suicide and self harm)...were
particular areas (Incapacity benefit personal advisers (IBPAs))
reported having difficulties with. IBPAs did not feel their initial
training had prepared them for working with these kinds of
customers.&#148;</div><a name="09022642000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also states
that</div><a name="09022642000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;12
per cent. of people with mental illness report
being...discriminated against by Jobcentre Plus
staff&#148;.</div><a name="09022642000215"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09022642000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is already an issue about the level of training of existing JCP staff.
If more of the functions of JCP staff are to be given to a new
organisation&#151;that is an integral part of the Bill&#151;it is
imperative that a level of training is specified when the contracts are
let. I appreciate that under the clause those organisations will not be
able to impose sanctions; that still remains the responsibility of JCP
staff. Nevertheless, if someone presents themselves to those staff with
a particular illness it is important that the personal advisers dealing
with them have the right level of
training.</div><a name="09022642000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rethink
has provided an example of a personal adviser referring someone with a
diagnosis of personality disorder and a history of mental health
problems to a condition management programme for people experiencing
chronic back pain. That is an example of something that has happened
with existing staff. Many people with mental health problems feel
insecure and discriminated against. If we are to extend the provision
and increase widely the number of staff involved in such programmes,
they should receive the appropriate training. However, that is not
specified in the Bill. Obviously, that would be worked out when the
contract is let and an agreement is made. It is important that the
Department for Work and Pensions appreciates that there are issues to
address in this area. We hope that the Minister feels able to reassure
us that this sort of issue will be taken on board as the schemes are
rolled
out.</div><a name="09022642000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000283"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises some fair points, with
which I have some sympathy, but his amendment highlights the dangers of
trying to write commercial contracts into a Bill. Not least because he
has used &#147;shall&#148; rather than &#147;may,&#148; he is
saying that under the clause any contract, regardless of its content,
should
include</div><a name="09022642000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
level of training required to meet the needs of
claimants&#148;</div><a name="09022642000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">with
mental health or drug dependency problems and all the other things he
mentions. He is saying that every 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>single contract made under powers allowed in the clause must specify the
level of training for all those various areas, regardless of whether it
is
appropriate.</div><a name="09022642000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the need for providers to
have appropriately trained staff, where it is deemed necessary to
deliver the contract effectively. That will be adequately covered in
the contracts, which will stipulate that the providers should not
discriminate against any customer on the grounds of disability,
whatever it is. We will ask bidders to describe any relevant skills
that they have to enable them to address the specific needs of and
barriers faced by their customers. We will ask about the specific
information on the roles relating to, and the qualifications and
experience required for, each post that are needed to deliver
the provision, given the nature of the contract and the focus on the
client
group.</div><a name="09022642000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
procurement process will have requirements within terms and conditions
of contracts for contractors to satisfy themselves that their employees
are suitable in all respects to deliver the programme. I can assure the
hon. Gentleman that the vulnerable groups mentioned will all be given
adequate protection. The contractors&#146; employees will possess the
relevant skills, training and experience to enable them to deliver the
provision effectively and address the specific needs of their customers
and the barriers to work that they
face.</div><a name="09022642000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we use the powers in clause 23 to contract out functions, we will take
steps to ensure that contractual employees are properly trained and
equipped to deliver the programme.</div>
<a name="09022642000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite
right and proper that the perfectly reasonable concerns that we have
discussed are matters for a specific contract, that it is for a
specific provider to deliver a specific service and that such things
should not be set out in the Bill. In that context, and having taken on
board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, I ask him to withdraw the
amendment for the reasons that I have
outlined.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000284"></a>Paul

of
Part</div><a name="09022642000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022642000285"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): I beg to move
amendment 23, in
clause 28, page 36, line 37, leave
out &#145;aged 18 or
over&#146;.</div><a name="09022642000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again,
Mr. Amess. Part 2 of the Bill, which starts at clause 28, is
about the right to control the provision of services to disabled
people. Amendment 23 is a probing amendment, in which we seek to test
why the Bill&#146;s provisions are restricted to adults. The clause
sets out the purpose of part 2 and does not in itself set out the right
to control, which is dealt with in later clauses. However, I want to
test the Minister on why we are limiting the provisions to adults. The
Department for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>Children, Schools and Families is piloting individual budgets, but as
the Minister will know from our evidence-taking sessions, having
different Departments carrying out pilots on individual budgets with
different rules and different processes is a step backwards, not
forwards. It would be better for disabled people and their families if
we had one seamless framework and set of rules. Apart from anything
else, that would make it clear that where a disabled child and their
family had the right to control the services that they received, there
would be a seamless transition in the provision of those services as
the child grew up and became an adult. As a result, they would not have
to move from a framework that was run by the DCSF to one that was run
by the DWP or the Department of Health.</div>
<a name="09022642000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will know, and it is commonly said, that there is already an issue in
local government social care services with disabled children&#146;s
transition from receiving services provided by local government
children&#146;s services organisations to receiving adult services.
That transition is not always as smooth as one would hope, despite the
fact that the legal definitions of a child and an adult relate to being
aged 18 and should therefore be pretty predictable to local
authorities, which should be able to put in place plans to make the
transition seamless.</div>
<a name="09022642000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek to
test the Minister on whether removing the limit that restricts the
provisions to those aged 18 or over and extending them to all disabled
people would not only be a step forward and give disabled children and
their families greater rights and control in general, but help with the
transitional process involved in moving into adulthood.</div>
<a name="09022642000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue is the cost, particularly where local government services are
concerned. Have the Government assessed the possibility of having one
set of processes to supply more personalised care and support packages
for adults and one set that is designed for children, with different
rules and different procedures? Have they assessed whether one,
seamless framework would be more cost-effective, ensuring that more
resources were used to deliver front-line services or give families an
individual budget and a more direct payment, rather than being used on
bureaucracy and unnecessary cost?</div>
<a name="09022642000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will hold
my comments about amendment 71 until we reach it; I will not stray out
of order. That is all I want to say to the Minister for now. We will
get to the wider issues when we move on to later
clauses.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000286"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Jonathan
Shaw):</b> In common with Committee colleagues, it is also my
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr.
Amess&#151;I have never heard a Member say anything else. That will
stand me in good stead.</div>
<a name="09022642000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
hon. Member for Forest of Dean for the amendment. He is right to probe
and I welcome the spirit in which he chose his words. I shall provide
details of why we are not including children at this stage, but first I
shall answer a question immediately. The hon. Gentleman referred to the
pilots that DCSF is undertaking, and working closely with it during
those pilots, DWP will test the alignment. I shall talk about that
shortly.</div>
<a name="09022642000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
committed to extending choice and control to disabled people, which
includes the empowerment of disabled children, young people and their
families. The DCSF pilots will begin soon, and their evaluation will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>seek to establish whether individual budgets enable families with
disabled children to exercise more control and choice over the delivery
of their support packages. It will also examine whether individual
budgets improve outcomes for some or all disabled children and their
families. The pilots will tell us which services and funding streams
are suitable for inclusion in individual budgets for
children.</div>
<a name="09022642000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Disabled
children cannot exercise the same direct user control as many disabled
adults. They have different needs from adults and access different
services, which are provided under a different statutory framework.
That is why a specific children&#146;s pilot is required&#151;to
determine how best to ensure that the appropriate services are
developed to meet children&#146;s needs. There are also issues about
how children&#146;s rights to individual budgets interplay with the
rights of parents, and how those rights interact with provisions in
children&#146;s legislation, so it is neither timely nor appropriate
to introduce legislation before those issues have been explored
further.</div>
<a name="09022642000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000287"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful for that outline. I am not sure
about the language, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Department has
decided to call its pilots trailblazers. In one sense I welcome that,
because it implies that the Department is committed to rolling out
individual budgets, as it explicitly stated in the White Paper. The
pilots&#151;the trailblazers&#151;are designed to work out how best
to do so, and the commitment to do so is clear. I am not sure from what
he said about DCSF, however, whether that Department has taken the
decision in principle to roll out individual budgets because the
evidence is clear that pilots deliver significant benefits and the
pilots will test how best to do so, or whether the pilots will test
whether or not the Department is going to roll out individual budgets.
His Department&#146;s commitment is clear, but is DCSF&#146;s
commitment equally clear in principle? If so, is it simply testing how
best to deliver those individual budgets?</div>
<a name="09022642000216"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<a name="09022642000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000288"></a>Jonathan
Shaw:</b> The Government have made a commitment to devolving
choice to the individual regarding services, but to answer those
questions fully one needs to make an assessment&#151;hence the
piloting. There are different sets of legislation on the different
issues of parents&#146; responsibilities and children&#146;s
rights. If we were to set our face and say, &#147;This is how
it&#146;s going to be,&#148; before the outcome of those pilots or
trailblazers&#151;whatever fantastic word we want to attach to
them&#151;the hon. Gentleman might accuse us of having an
ideology  without having worked out how to do things. We need
to understand those complexities, and we are fully committed to doing
so.</div>
<a name="09022642000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">My colleagues
and I have set out our ambition many times, and I know that the hon.
Gentleman shares that ambition. It is also welcome to people who depend
on services and who want to be empowered by being in control of care
and support services as well as services that support them in work or
other aspects of their lives. He is right to talk about that transition
period between childhood and adulthood, and I know that my colleague,
the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member
for Corby (Phil Hope), is working on that aspect at the moment. It
seems to be one of our biggest challenges to get that policy right. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>is sometimes frustrating, as a Minister, tying up different Departments,
and it is frustrating as a constituency MP to see that two different
departments in a local authority area do not always talk to one another
as they might to serve our constituents&#146; needs.</div>
<a name="09022642000192"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">We are
committed to piloting this matter. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of
and will support, I am sure, Aiming High for Disabled People, into
which we are putting additional resources. Indeed, the Aiming High for
Disabled Children programme has allocated &#163;1 million in 2009-10,
and &#163;1 million in 2010-11, to cover the costs of individual
budget pilots for disabled children. So we are putting resources in, as
well as having ambition, but we need to establish what
works.</div><a name="09022642000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000289"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for setting out
clearly the Government&#146;s ambition. This is a probing amendment,
as I said, and I am pleased that he has outlined the commitment of his
Department and the DCSF to work together closely on the way in which
these benefits are delivered to families, and on ensuring that, where
required, the services provided to disabled children can move
seamlessly into those provided to adults. Given those assurances, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022642000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09022642000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000290"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I beg to move amendment 71, in
clause 28, page 36, line 41, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) When P is
exercising his rights under this Part the relevant authority shall be
subject to a duty to cooperate with
P.&#146;.</div><a name="09022642000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, welcome the measures in this part. As we heard in the evidence
sittings, where this approach has been applied to the caring services
in the local authorities that have taken it on board, it has liberated
many people and has considerably improved their lives. We strongly
welcome the measures that will extend that approach to disabled
people.</div>
<a name="09022642000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
the Minister to clarify a few things before I discuss the specifics
behind this probing amendment. We welcome this approach and the pilot.
The work that has been done with the caring services shows that it is
key that the system is as simple and as straightforward as possible,
that it is person-focused and not target-driven, that it is responsive
enough to the varying needs of those with fluctuating health
conditions, and that people will be given accurate and accessible
information. I look forward to the pilot demonstrating those particular
aspects.</div><a name="09022642000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
have I tabled amendment 71? If hon. Members consider clause 30, they
will see that it details the relevant authorities. In the amendment, we
are saying that where a person is exercising their rights under this
part of the Bill, those named authorities or people whose services have
been contracted to them have a duty to co-operate. We all know and can
quote examples from our constituency case load in which a particular
authority or even an official has a view on something and is not
prepared to give constituents what they are entitled to.</div>
<a name="09022642000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I say,
this is a probing amendment that has been tabled because we believe
that it needs to be made abundantly clear to the authorities that they
have a duty to co-operate and that doing so is not an option. In a
sense, that will not be a problem in relation to the pilot 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>because the authorities will have been selected and will have agreed to
it. However, as the measure is rolled out some authorities may be
reluctant to participate. We believe that the cardinal principle that
they have a duty to do so must be
accepted.</div><a name="09022642000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
hon. Members read the briefing produced by the Royal Association for
Disability and Rehabilitation, although some of the issues that it
raises will be dealt with under the equality Bill, they will see that
one if its concerns is that particularly where there is public
procurement, some of the rights that have been hard fought for and are
beginning to bear fruit in relation to contracting out will become lost
in the overall noise. Through the amendment, we are seeking to make it
clear that the rights of a disabled person are enhanced not diminished
by the Bill, and that it is not an option for an authority to
participate or grant that person what they are entitled to. The
amendment is about liberating disabled people, not leaving them
hidebound by official rules and
regulations.</div><a name="09022642000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000291"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I support the concept of the amendment but believe
that the hon. Gentleman has tabled his amendment to the wrong clause.
The clause effectively sets out the purpose of the part, and a much
better worded amendment is our amendment 45 to clause 31, which we
shall have the opportunity to discuss later. Our amendment achieves the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s objective rather more elegantly. The theme of
the quality of Liberal Democrat amendments that is emerging this
morning is firming up nicely, so I will close my
remarks.</div><a name="09022642000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000292"></a>Jonathan
Shaw:</b> Following that very modest comment, I am delighted
to respond to the hon. Member for Rochdale, and I thank him for his
amendment, which explicitly states that authorities must co-operate
with an individual who exercises his or her right to
control.</div><a name="09022642000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
it helps the Committee, the right to control creates a framework to
improve flexibility in the services that disabled people use. It will
do that through regulations that can place certain duties on public
authorities. The right to control will shift the balance of power from
the state to the individual and enable the individual to have a real
say in how best to meet their support needs.</div>
<a name="09022642000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulations
made under clause 31 can impose a duty on authorities to consult a
disabled person when preparing a plan to meet their assessed needs.
They can also empower an individual to require their authority to
consult them when revising their care plan and taking account of their
wishes. We have chosen to structure the clause in a way that empowers
the disabled person, giving their views and wishes full
consideration.</div><a name="09022642000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention is that the delivery of the right to control should be as
seamless as possible for the individual, so that authorities and
agencies will need to be aware of their obligations under the right to
control. It is therefore implicit in the duty to consult that the
result of the consultations should take account of the views of the
individual. The authority in question will have to co-operate with them
in order to reflect the person&#146;s needs and wishes properly. We
expect authorities to be supportive in delivering their obligations, so
we will ensure that the requirements and expectations of the new right
are clearly communicated.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div><a name="09022642000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
words of assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment. He was right to move the amendment, to seek assurances from
the Government, but it is about achieving a balance, about ensuring
that there is some autonomy and decision making locally&#151;I am
sure he supports that for local authorities, and perhaps a little more
than I do generally, hence what I am saying about the
amendment&#151;but also some for the individual. That is what we are
concerned about today, and what we are doing with the regulations will
get the balance about
right.</div><a name="09022642000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000293"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. As I
said at the start, the amendment was probing in nature, so I beg to ask

is a very broad set of definitions, which would pretty much encompass
most services provided by
government.</div><a name="09022642000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
subsection went well, but unfortunately, further down the clause, which
is where the amendments come in, there are the main exclusions in
England and Wales. Some of them are around services provided to
children, which the Minister and I have already discussed in clause 28,
but the provision also excludes community care services and therefore
omits all of social care. Social care will be one of the significant
areas, important in enabling the disabled person to achieve almost any
of those matters. If we do not have adequate, flexible and responsive
social care, someone will clearly have barriers  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>to their education and issues about securing training, getting to work
and living independently. Excluding social care services leaves a big
hole.</div><a name="09022642000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
discussed the matter in the evidence sessions, Mr. Amess,
when your colleague was in the Chair. I probed the Minister then and
challenged him about the provision. He said that he did not want to be
too prescriptive and set out that there was already provision in other
legislation about individual budgets and direct payments for adult
social care. That is perfectly true, but there are problems in how such
things will work and whether the procedures and processes are aligned.
The Bill seems to look at things from the Department&#146;s point of
view, rather than that of a disabled person. We should have one common
framework for accessing all the services, and potentially we should put
together all the funding streams and resources, so that they can be
directed in a way that suits
requirements.</div><a name="09022642000217"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="09022642000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
positive news that we heard during the evidence-taking session, from
one of the Minister&#146;s officials, was that the Department did
plan to work very closely with a steering group, and with the
Department of Health and the Department for Communities and Local
Government, in order to join up the pilots and subsequently when the
pilots are rolled out. My concern is that, if we exclude community care
services from this provision, we might regret it later. Were we to
remove subsections (5) and (6) and include social care services, we
could still specify in regulations the scope of pilots and how they are
rolled out. We should give Ministers the ability to include those
services, rather than restrict the scope of the regulations by
excluding social care services.</div>
<a name="09022642000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 24,
which the hon. Member for Rochdale has signed as well, would explicitly
include the provision of care services and community care for disabled
people, and amendment 24 would leave out subsections (5) and
(6)&#151;the exclusion provisions relating to England and Wales, and
Scotland respectively. That would widen Ministers&#146; powers and
perhaps make it more likely that the Departments running the steering
groups will join up with the Department of Health, social care services
and local government. If we provide for that power, and if
organisations know that the pilots can be drawn more widely, it might
help to concentrate minds and engage local authorities in the running
of the pilots. That is the help that I seek to
provide.</div><a name="09022642000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
organisations support widening the measures. For example, Leonard
Cheshire Disability, which is a very well known campaigning
organisation, is very supportive of the proposals in general, as we
are, but it would like assurances over the funding streams and how the
system will work in practice. It wants to know how the programmes may
differ and whether it would be possible to include social care payments
in the right to control. If we exclude from the Bill the ability to
include social care, we will tie Ministers&#146; hands later, rather
than leave those options open. It would be helpful if the Minister
could explain why the Government have chosen this route, in a little
more detail than he was able to during the evidence session. Does he
think that so splitting up the funding streams is helpful? Was there
any evidence from the pilots that the Government ran to lead one to the
conclusion that excluding social care funding from this right to
control process, and doing it separately, is an improvement?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div><a name="09022642000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">During our
evidence session we heard from Liz Sayce, the chief executive of RADAR,
which is another well known, pan-disability campaigning organisation.
It, too, is very supportive of the direction of travel in the Bill, but
it is also very keen to know whether, after we have run the pilots and
rolled them out, disabled people can look forward to a system where
they can access all the support that they need via one gateway, where
everything is joined up and where they can look at their needs and
access one budget to cover the whole area of responsibility.</div>
<a name="09022642000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to put on the record one or two quotes from organisations that support
that approach. In its Second Reading briefing, Mind, which campaigns on
mental health services, stated that it
was</div><a name="09022642000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;disappointed
that community care services are to be
excluded&#148;.</div><a name="09022642000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Equality and Human Rights Commission, in its briefing on the Bill,
pointed out that</div>
<a name="09022642000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provisions
in the Bill are limited in the scope...explicitly excluding
services relating to health and social care. This is in stark contrast
to the aspirations set out in the...Green Paper...The
Commission proposes that explicit exemptions such as that relating to
health and social care are removed from the face of the Bill and
instead that the Bill relies on...regulation-making powers to
extend (or remove) the right to control to different areas over
time.&#148;</div><a name="09022642000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have not spoken specifically to the Equality and Human Rights
Commission about my amendments. However, reading what it said in its
brief it appears to be endorsing amendment 25, which would leave out
subsections (5) and (6). It says explicitly that it wants those
subsections removed from the Bill, to give Ministers wider powers in
the regulation-making sphere, so that they can extend those powers at a
later date.</div>
<a name="09022642000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
RADAR has looked at whether it would be sensible to take out those
exclusions in the Bill. Some of the work that it has done seemed to
show that legally that would be perfectly permissible. It would be
helpful if the Minister could set out the Government&#146;s latest
thinking, subsequent to our evidence-taking sessions. If he wants to
leave these exclusions in the Bill, it would also be helpful if he
could give the Committee a little more detail about how exactly he
proposes to work them through in the pilot. Moreover, what happens in
the pilot if Ministers subsequently want to tie the right to control in
this Bill with social care services? Will this exclusion tie
Ministers&#146; hands in regulation-making powers, so that they
subsequently have to come back to the House to amend primary
legislation? If the Minister can reassure us about that issue, we may
not have to trouble the Committee with a Division on this
amendment.</div><a name="09022642000184"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022642000297"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Like the hon. Gentleman, I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s explaining in more detail some of the reasoning
behind this measure. We support amendments 24 and 25, but we have also
tabled two other slightly different amendments, including amendment
70.</div>
<a name="09022642000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
explain what we are proposing to do in amendment 70. It is to ensure
that services would not be excluded should they prevent some of the
other aims set out early on in the subsection. Part 2 lists a range of
matters such
as:</div><a name="09022642000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
provision of further education for
P;</div><a name="09022642000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
facilitating the undertaking by P of further education or higher
education;</div><a name="09022642000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
the provision of training by P&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div><a name="09022642000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so on. What is
different about amendment 70 is that we are not saying that there
should be an automatic exclusion of those services, but only where the
ability to control those services would prevent an individual from
doing what is set out in part 2.</div>
<a name="09022642000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had an
example two years ago in my constituency of a young man who was going
to university. The local authority had agreed that there could be
direct payment and the university had agreed to passport over some of
the support that it was going to provide. However, on the final weekend
before the young man was due to go to university, we were still
discussing with the primary care trust whether or not its element of
care was going to be passported, because it clearly made much more
sense for that young man to have a package of services rather than
having different streams providing that support. In fact, having a
package of services is a much more efficient use of public resources.
At virtually the twelfth hour and the last minute, the PCT relented and
agreed to direct payment from its element of the care. The young man
was then able to purchase a total package 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>that has enabled him, for the last two years, to go to Leeds university.
That would not have happened without that provision of direct
services.</div>
<a name="09022642000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our view,
that is an example of how excluding some of these services could act as
a barrier. It goes back to my earlier point and my earlier amendment to
clause 28, about the authority co-operating. In the case I have just
referred to, the PCT was initially unwilling to co-operate and it was
only after a considerable amount of pressure had been applied, let us
say, that it relented. That is an example of how the exclusion of some
of these services can have a detrimental effect for some of the very
laudable aims that are outlined earlier in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022642000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
49, which is the other amendment in my name, goes slightly further by
not dealing with health services, but it seeks to include care services
in direct
payments.</div><a name="09022642000218"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
