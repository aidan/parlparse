<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000207"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Good morning, Mr. Key. On behalf of the
Committee, I welcome you back to the Chair on the penultimate day of
our proceedings.</div>
<a name="09102937000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8 is
the meat of the Bill. In many ways, it is the most significant clause,
and the fact that a large number of amendments have been tabled to it
shows that there is a lot of interest in it among Committee members. I
shall go through the different issues raised by the first group of
amendments, and I hope that the Committee will bear with me because
that will take a little
time.</div><a name="09102937000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1, tabled by my hon. Friends and me, would
add</div><a name="09102937000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
the promotion of economic
enterprise&#148;</div><a name="09102937000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
the end of subsection (5)(a). When discussing eradicating poverty, it
is important philosophically to mention, albeit briefly, the creation
of wealth. I recognise that the state has an important role in
alleviating poverty, but it cannot perform it alone. It is the wealth
creators&#151;the entrepreneurs and the business men and women
throughout the country&#151;who create jobs and set up businesses,
and they will be at the heart of eradicating child poverty, which is
the solution we all want from the
Bill.</div><a name="09102937000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102937000208"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab):
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the best ways of contributing
to tackling child poverty is to encourage enterprise to pay
above-poverty
wages?</div><a name="09102937000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000209"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> That is an interesting debate. I remember Robin
Cook criticising the predecessors of the tax credits introduced by the
Conservative Government to subsidise poverty pay. I think that those
were the words he used at the time. Of course, the policy of the
previous Conservative Government has been continued and taken further
by this Government, but the hon. Lady makes an absolutely fair point: a
balance must be struck between the contribution of the state and
businesses.</div><a name="09102937000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
significant feature of the evidence sessions at the start of our
proceedings was that when local authority leaders were pressed on what
it would take to eradicate child poverty they first mentioned getting
more jobs and businesses going. On 20 October, Paul Carter talked about
the need to bring more &#147;wealth and prosperity&#148; into his
area of Kent. Richard Kemp, speaking on behalf of Liverpool on 20
October
said,</div><a name="09102937000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
thing that will still take more people out of poverty in my city is
more and better-quality
employment&#148;.</div><a name="09102937000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
talked about the 4,500 jobs that were created in Liverpool last year,
but made the fair point that not all of them had gone to the group that
we are
discussing.</div><a name="09102937000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly,
but certainly not least, Colin Green, speaking from his experience of
Coventry said first, in response to a question from my hon. Friend the
Member for South-West Hertfordshire,
that</div><a name="09102937000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
most important things in this area are those that Richard pointed to,
about creating a dynamic local economy.&#148;
<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Child Poverty Public Bill
Committee, </i>20 October 2009; c. 62-63,
Q136-139.]</div><a name="09102937000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the perspective of the council leaders who will have an important
job on the ground in working with the Government to eradicate child
poverty in their
areas.</div><a name="09102937000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are further interesting perspectives. Just as Tip O&#146;Neill said
that all politics is local, I would say that poverty is very much a
peculiarly and distinctively local phenomenon in many parts of the
country. The Department 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>has produced some shocking figures on&#151;to
introduce a bit of jargon early in the morning&#151;the lower-layer
super-output areas. Those figures look at sub-ward levels of economic
inactivity. In the Falinge and Central area of Rochdale, 76 per cent.
of the working-age population claims out-of-work benefits, and in a
further 60 areas across the country, many of them close to the
constituencies of some members of the Committee, more than half of the
working-age population is not in work. I sometimes refer to those areas
as job deserts. We will have to address that distinctive problem to
make real progress towards reaching the targets by
2020.</div><a name="09102937000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000210"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an extremely interesting
point. However, before we go too far down a path with those figures,
which might be slightly misleading, does he agree that one reason for
those intense concentrations of workless parents is the nature of
social housing distribution and allocations? The fact that there is
much less social housing now than there was 30 years ago means that by
definition one concentrates people with disadvantage in small
geographical areas, rather than the geographical areas in some way
explaining why people are in poverty? We need to look at people rather
than at areas, which appears to what the hon. Gentleman
implied.</div><a name="09102937000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000211"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I think that the two issues are linked. The hon.
Lady makes a fair and sensible point. Housing does play a role, and
that is one reason why I have some sympathy with the Liberal Democrat
amendment 30 on transport. If there are large concentrations of people
with high worklessness in one area, and jobs are created on the other
side of town but there are no decent bus routes or it is incredibly
complicated to get there, that is where transport comes
in.</div><a name="09102937000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me point to a possible solution to the issue that the hon. Lady rightly
highlighted. In the Marsh Farm estate in Luton, close to my
constituency, there was just such a set of circumstances. The estate
has high levels of worklessness and child poverty, and it was
discovered that the people living there spent just under &#163;2
million a year on a range of takeaway foods, all from businesses
outside the estate. There was no garage on the estate either, and
people had to go some way&#151;to St. Albans, for example&#151;to
get their cars serviced. Partly through, I think, some money from the
new deal for communities programme, a fast food business and a garage
were set up on the estate. I understand that those businesses are now
thriving and sustainable, and not in receipt of ongoing taxpayer
support. That is a good example of the promotion of economic enterprise
within a job desert. Transport could, or would have to, be the solution
in some cases, but not everyone can travel long distances to work, so
it is important to have a supply of jobs in areas with high
concentrations of
worklessness.</div><a name="09102937000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102937000212"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): I completely
agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need for small-scale
statistics, and about the importance of initiatives such as the new
deal for communities and estate-based work. I would like some
assurances that not only the hon. Gentleman but the rest of his party
are signed up to the focus on local poverty indicators. Those of us who
were tackling unemployment and poverty in inner London in the 1990s
found that the then Conservative Government would look only at the
macro-statistics and not at the small-scale area
statistics. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>That was one of the reasons we could never really
crack some of the problems. Will the hon. Gentleman assure us that
everyone on his Front Bench has changed their mind and is now aligned
with what he
said?</div><a name="09102937000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000213"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> As I read the political tea leaves, localism has
had a long overdue renaissance in all the political parties, not least
in the Conservative party&#151;perhaps even principally in the
Conservative party. That is absolutely right. Local authorities, with
the total place concept that is being developed in local government,
are getting much more switched on to such an approach. I am happy to be
on the record as saying that all poverty is local. The hon. Lady makes
a fair point: we shall need a balance of national and local solutions
to deal with the important
issues.</div><a name="09102937000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102937000214"></a><b class="B">Julie
Morgan</b> (Cardiff, North) (Lab): I strongly support the idea
of localism and looking at things in small local areas, but it is
important to link that with wider economic strategies. I think in
particular of south Wales, where areas are blighted by worklessness, in
a large degree due to the end of the mining industry&#151;a
catastrophe that we are still trying to get
over.</div><a name="09102937000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000215"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The hon. Lady is right. There are many such areas
of the country. My own area, for instance, used to make trucks and had
a big motor component industry, but all that is gone now. My area, like
hers, is having to think how to earn its living in a new and changing
world. That is always part and parcel of economic life. However, the
hon. Lady makes a fair point and I am sure that such issues are rightly
occupying the minds of her local authority leaders and of the Welsh
Assembly.</div><a name="09102937000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
50 mentions child care&#151;to which the hon. Member for Regent's
Park and Kensington, North will no doubt refer shortly. She is right to
try to put the issue in the Bill. The whole area of flexible working
needs to go in alongside that&#151;the National Children&#146;s
Bureau was keen to see it in the Bill. The NCB has drawn attention to
the fact that we are clearly not going to get many
families&#151;single parent families in particular&#151;into the
labour market without making absolutely sure that we have adequate
child
care.</div><a name="09102937000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102937000216"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): We are
debating an issue on which there has been a change of focus in
Conservative policy. Flexible working is another such
issue&#151;perhaps in the past it was seen as imposing too much of a
requirement on companies, and that to allow flexibility in working
would be against business interests. On the contrary, it has opened up
the work force and allowed more people to access work and has been a
positive measure that the Government have taken forward and that the
next Conservative Government will be able to build
on.</div><a name="09102937000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000217"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I am grateful, as always, to my hon. Friend for
putting that on the record. I have always thought it slightly bizarre
that, as an employee, one is given such an all or nothing option: to
sell either all of one&#146;s time to an employer or none of it. We
need to get away from that general concept, because that is not how
many people&#146;s lives operate. We are all agreed, across the
Committee, that work is the best way of getting people&#151;including
children&#151;out of poverty. We have to do further thinking on that
area.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div><a name="09102937000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000218"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> May I pay tribute to the Government for some other
progress they have made? The use of tax credits has made
work&#151;typically for around 16 hours a week&#151;easier, for
lone parents in particular. However, there are disincentives to work
more hours than that and for those for whom 10 hours might be more
appropriate than 16. We have a rather fixed system that dictates how
millions of people live. Does my hon. Friend think that progress can be
made to create a smoother and more graduated system to ensure that
people are able to work the hours that are most appropriate to them and
best suit their circumstances, including child
care?</div><a name="09102937000181"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000219"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. If memory serves me
correctly, that point was made by Kevan Collins in our evidence
session, when he called for more flexibility within the benefits system
and for the system to be prepared to take risks sometimes over
individuals, with benefit holidays and the ability to get back on
benefits.</div>
<a name="09102937000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000220"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Helen
Goodman):</b> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has costed
the options that he is talking
about.</div><a name="09102937000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000221"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I am not sure that we have talked about general
options; we are talking about a general philosophical approach of
providing more flexibility within the welfare system. I do not
necessarily agree with the Minister that a flexible system is
necessarily more expensive than a rigid system. There are costs
inherent in a rigid system, if it keeps people out of the labour
market, because the Minister&#146;s Department has to go on paying
benefits. It is a complicated area. I recognise what she is saying and
she is right to make that point, but this is not by any means the end
of the debate. It will be the subject of further study by her party and
mine for many years to come. I shall move on because there are many
amendments to speak
to.</div><a name="09102937000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
58 deals with the well-being of children, which we have touched on
throughout the Bill. This is specifically a child poverty Bill; it
looks at the income levels available to families in which children
live. It is not a Bill about children&#146;s well-being specifically,
but we would all agree that poverty and well-being are intimately
linked. If nothing else, fostering children&#146;s well-being is
likely to be beneficial to the outcomes of those children when they in
turn become parents. The National Children&#146;s Bureau, among
others, has said that adding a reference to well-being would ensure
that the Government consider the breadth of services that can impact on
the quality of a child&#146;s
life.</div><a name="09102937000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
2 covers three different areas, all of which I will speak to. The
reference to families with disabilities covers a distinct group in
which there is a particular concentration of child poverty, as every
study on child poverty shows again and again. The Equality and Human
Rights Commission, among others, has called for and will welcome
amending the Bill to refer to disability. We referred to it in our
earlier discussions on the disability living allowance. I commend the
amendment to Ministers for their consideration. The Secretary of State
will have to consider the issue specifically when she formulates her
strategy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div><a name="09102937000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make the
same point about ethnic minorities. I am conscious that we need to be
careful of the language we use, but, for example, there are
phenomenally high rates of child poverty in the Bangladeshi community
in London, perhaps for long-standing cultural reasons or due to
language or attitudes towards all family members going out to work. We
must recognise that a general UK-wide strategy may leave certain
communities untouched. Again, the Equality and Human Rights Commission
has welcomed that
focus.</div><a name="09102937000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to talk about proposed new subsection (5)(e) in amendment 2, which
refers to &#147;reducing family breakdown&#148;. I hope we can
debate this in as consensual a way as possible, and I long for the day
when this area of family policy is more or less agreed across the
House. I am always troubled that it is an area of contention, as it is
one on which I seek consensus. I was genuinely pleased when I picked up
&#147;Ending child poverty: making it happen&#148;, which was
brought out earlier this year by the Department for Work and Pensions
from the child poverty unit, which has done tremendous work on bringing
the Bill forward. All three references to strengthening families
pleased
me.</div><a name="09102937000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Page
12 of the document
says:</div><a name="09102937000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Family
breakdown and crisis can make searching for work very difficult and
also increase the risk of dropping out of the labour
market.&#148;</div><a name="09102937000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is absolutely right; I was pleased to see that. Page 15,
which addresses supporting parents, talks about strengthening the
capabilities of parents. That is just the right the language and
something I would back completely. Page 16 sets out the famous building
blocks to try to eradicate child poverty, with the diagram that has
been produced at all sorts of conferences. I was again pleased to see
family rightly mentioned as one of those eight building blocks. I have
referred before to the impact assessment, paragraph 2.6 of which
says:</div><a name="09102937000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Family
breakdown may have caused the family to fall into
poverty.&#148;</div><a name="09102937000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
statement are all from Government documents, so I was surprised when I
looked at clause 8(5), and noticed that all the building blocks were
there and named expect one: family. Curiously, family seems to have
slipped through the net, and I do not know why. I was disappointed
because I had thought that what the Government had been saying and
their direction of travel had been encouraging.</div>
<a name="09102937000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
slightly discouraged during the evidence sessions when the
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said:</div>
<a name="09102937000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government are not wholly convinced that family breakdown is a cause of
poverty&#148;.</div><a name="09102937000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000222"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I found that the most peculiar piece of evidence
that we heard in all the Committee sittings was a Government Minister
saying that family breakdown was not a major contributor to poverty. It
might make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>one think that the couple&#146;s penalty within
the benefits system is almost deliberate, if the Government put such
little regard on supporting and keeping families together, and do not
regard them breaking apart as something
major.</div><a name="09102937000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000223"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I hear what my hon. Friend says, although I take a
slightly more charitable view. I do not think that it is deliberate; it
is probably an oversight or an unintentional policy error. I completely
and utterly accept that poverty drives families apart. There is a
saying that when money goes out of the window, love goes out of the
door&#151;or vice versa. I wholly accept that, but I think that the
relationship works the other way as
well.</div><a name="09102937000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us look at some detailed figures. The hon. Member for Northavon is a
great believer in dipping carefully into the households below average
incomes series&#151;no doubt he has the pack with him. I also have a
copy from the
Library.</div><a name="09102937000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
got the House of Commons Library to carry out some analysis of the
figures. It sent me a note in July&#151;that is the one to which I
referred in Committee. The note splits children in low-income
households&#151;those below the 60 per cent. median
income&#151;into those whose parents are married, in a civil
partnership, cohabiting, single, widowed, and separated or divorced.
The figure for all children in poverty across the UK is 23 per cent.
The likelihood of a child being in poverty if their parents are
married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is 18 per
cent.&#151;1.8 million out of 9.8 million children. In households
headed by a parent who is single, widowed, separated or divorced, or
whose civil partnership has been dissolved, the figure is 1.1 million
out of 3 million children, or 36.6 per cent&#151;slightly more than
double the figure for other households. When I said that the figure was
double, I was being cautious and had understated the figures.</div>
<a name="09102937000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the
Government&#146;s own figures for households below average
income&#151;they are just the facts of the case. We can forget any
political baggage on the left or the right of the issue&#151;these
are just the facts. It is staggering that we cannot get some political
consensus on the issue on doing something to strengthen and support
families and give them the best chance of keeping their children out of
poverty.</div><a name="09102937000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102937000224"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): With respect to the hon. Gentleman,
I do not think that there is such a thing as &#147;just a
fact&#148;&#151;his facts were laden with inference, and that is
where there is some difference between us. The point was made in the
evidence session that many countries have comparable rates of lone
parenthood to the UK, but that that does not manifest itself in child
poverty. From the point of view of the Bill, is not the most important
question why being a lone parent in Britain associates very strongly
with poverty, when it does not have to in many other comparable
countries?</div><a name="09102937000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000225"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, and I would
want to look further into the particular details that he mentions.
However, as I look at the statistics across Europe, I see that this
country is off the curve. We are right at the top of the table for
countries in which there is a significant degree of separation, and we
also have a very high level of child poverty. I believe that there is a
correlation between the two. Of course, if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>we give more and more financial support to single parents, there will be
less child poverty in certain areas. None the less, 1.8 million
children in two-parent families are in poverty, while 1.1 million
children in single-parent families&#151;those where the parent is
widowed, separated or divorced, or where the civil partnership has been
dissolved&#151;are in poverty.</div>
<a name="09102937000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is clearly correct in the sense that if we give lots of state
benefit to single parents, we can do something about the issue, and I
do not think that anyone would dispute that. However, I am making the
more general point that as part of their strategy&#151;not the whole
and perhaps not even the most significant part&#151;the Government
must be conscious of the need to do something to strengthen and support
family life, the fragility of which leads far too many of our children
into poverty.</div>
<a name="09102937000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000226"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that
any difference between the parties relates to a question of means,
rather than a question of principle. However, given that the
Conservative party is keen to introduce a premium in the tax system to
support marriage, what calculations have been done on the amount that
would act as an incentive to couples to marry and stay
together?</div><a name="09102937000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000227"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I have not actually mentioned marriage so far,
although I am happy that the hon. Lady has done so. I do not know what
my party will do on that issue, and we have not announced that yet.
However, we have announced plans to end the couple penalty as far as
the working tax credit is concerned, and that would apply to married
and cohabiting couples. There is a separate debate to be had on
marriage, and I am more than happy to enter into one with the hon. Lady
or anyone else on another occasion, but that was not the central thrust
of my argument&#151;I was just talking about strengthening families
in any shape or form.</div>
<a name="09102937000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000228"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Does my hon. Friend, like me, wonder whether any
Labour Member will stand up and defend the couple penalty and say that
this is a desirable state of affairs? Alternatively, will they welcome
the fact that we would seek to get rid of it? The Minister is always
quick to point out that there are costs to all these things, but surely
we can all agree that we should seek to end the couple&#146;s
penalty.</div><a name="09102937000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000229"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Interesting though that might be, it
might be more productive if we tackled the
Bill.</div><a name="09102937000182"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="09102937000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000230"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> As always, Mr. Key, I shall follow your
guidance in these matters. My hon. Friend&#146;s comments are on the
record for Labour Members to respond to as they wish later in the
debate.</div><a name="09102937000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendments 67 and 68 were tabled by the hon. Member for Northampton,
North. She wants to include the provision of services for looked-after
children and for those in the asylum and immigration system, which was
the subject of earlier deliberations. There are distinct issues there,
so I think that it is fair for her to raise that
point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div><a name="09102937000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000231"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Good morning, Mr. Key. I have been musing
this morning as to what sin you might have committed in a previous life
to have to endure another of our sittings. It is nevertheless good to
see you in the Chair.</div>
<a name="09102937000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8 has
a slight feeling of a Christmas tree about it; we have all come along
with our baubles. A bit of me almost wants to strip the tree down and
perhaps even take out subsection (5), on which we are hanging those
baubles. Either we have a strategy that is about child poverty and we
let the Secretary of State get on with it, or we have a complete
shopping list of everything that matters to do with the welfare of
children&#151;and in the spirit of the debate we have added a couple
of our own. However, what we have is neither fish nor fowl&#151;we
have some things that matter to children but not others.</div>
<a name="09102937000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
tabled amendment 30, which is about transport, and amendment 47 on
child care. We note that the hon. Member for Regent's Park and
Kensington, North wanted to add a provision on child care in a
different place in the Bill. We can have a high-tempered debate about
where it should go, but we would be happy if amendment 50 were
accepted. I shall explain why, if we are going to have a Christmas
tree, we would like to hang the baubles of transport and child care on
it, but I wonder whether the Ministers will reflect on whether picking
some things and not others might create the wrong outcome.</div>
<a name="09102937000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is like
our discussion about targets when we started our consideration. Once we
start saying that something matters because it is in legislation, is
there not a risk that, when drawing up the strategy, we look at the
things that are listed, but ignore disability, ethnicity,
asylum-seeking children and all the other things that we would like to
add? I hope that the Financial Secretary will give us a flavour of why
some things and not others are included and reflect on whether
specifying particular things makes sense. If we are going to do that,
transport is clearly an important issue and it links to the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness on rurality,
because transport and rurality are closely
linked.</div><a name="09102937000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102937000232"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument and I am having similar difficulty about
what should and should not be included. Would he not agree, however,
that there is a difference between what is included and some of the
other items that are being suggested, which are subject areas and
services, and a separate category that would not fit into the existing
structure relating to individuals&#146; characteristics and groups,
such as ethnicity? A clear distinction can be drawn between
those two sectors. I think that it is right to concentrate on the
services and subject areas rather than the groups, which would be a
separate
argument.</div><a name="09102937000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000233"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> That is a fair point. We are talking about different
categories of things today. I am not absolutely convinced that all
those on the list are of a kind. One might argue that some of them are
slightly different sorts of things, but I take the general point. If
that is the criterion for being on the list, transport services would
be an obvious example. There are three obvious links between transport
and child poverty: access to services, access to jobs and access to
leisure.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div><a name="09102937000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The material
deprivation standard is things like having a hobby and going
swimming&#151;that kind of stuff. If there is no bus and the
child&#146;s parents do not have a car, going swimming is going to be
a bit tricky. Clearly, if we are to deliver on the targets, I cannot
see why transport would not be on the list. Health matters, education
matters, social services matters and transport matters, so why not
include transport, which has a particular impact on poverty in rural
areas?</div><a name="09102937000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the problems with the Government&#146;s anti-poverty
strategy&#151;it is an inevitable problem&#151;is that it is much
easier to do things in towns and cities, as everyone is in the same
place. There might be public transport, and things could be done
cost-effectively, but that is hard if there is one deprived child
living down a country lane with no bus. Transport is
central.</div><a name="09102937000078"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000234"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point. By way
of example, I would cite the Humber bridge toll, which is one of the
highest and most expensive tolls in the country to use a piece of
infrastructure completed nearly 30 years ago. Anyone with a part-time
job or who is working for minimum wage is unable to use the bridge, and
thus employment in an area of lower than average income is constrained.
Transport absolutely needs to be understood within the poverty
context.</div><a name="09102937000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000235"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The cost of transport is important, even for those
who have a car&#151;there are issues such as the cost of
petrol&#151;but I am thinking particularly of those who do not have
access to private transport. Many of us know that public transport is
little short of a joke in many parts of the country. It either does not
exist at all or, if it does, it is expensive. If someone uses public
transport to get to work, they can have a season ticket and get
relatively cheap fares&#151;that is one thing&#151;but if someone
needs an occasional bus to a Sure Start centre, a leisure activity or
whatever, they pay the full fare&#151;they do not get a discounted
fare. There is a risk of being ever so slightly London-centric about
this. Those of us who represent constituencies outside London are
sometimes astonished by the comparison between cheap bulk public
transport in central London and the kind of fares that our constituents
experience.</div><a name="09102937000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a particular issue about housing allocations&#151;I believe that
the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North has mentioned
this&#151;that links to transport. For example, the DWP local housing
allowance scheme can result in particular areas of a local authority
being inaccessible to people on housing benefit because there is, in
essence, a cap on the rent that will be covered, so people tend to
cluster in the low-rent parts of a housing market area where transport
might not be good. That is partly why the rent is so low&#151;it is
cheap to rent there because no one wants to live there because there is
no transport. There is a danger that the policies will interact.
Putting a provision on transport in the Bill would encourage the
Secretary of State to think broadly about one of the barriers to
improving child welfare and dealing with child
poverty.</div><a name="09102937000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue is child care, which is covered in our amendment 47 and also in
amendment 50&#151;I hope that the hon. Lady will make some further
observations on child care. This partly comes back to the point made by
the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire about the link between lone
parenthood and poverty. One of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>the reasons why there is a much stronger correlation
between lone parenthood and child poverty in Britain than in many other
countries is that, despite the progress that has been made, there is
still a lack of affordable, accessible, flexible, quality child
care.</div><a name="09102937000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that in-work poverty is significant&#151;a job is not enough on
its own to get someone out of poverty&#151;and, interestingly, the
poverty measures that are used in the Bill do not net off child care
costs. Again, we are probably understating child poverty in working
households because many parents, particularly lone parents who work but
do not receive working tax credit or child care tax credit and all the
rest of it, pay a significant part of their after-tax income in child
care costs, so their real living standards are much
lower.</div><a name="09102937000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must think about the accessibility of affordable, quality child
care&#151;and flexible child care. Those who have regular,
predictable working patterns and pre-school age children might face one
set of issues relating to child care, but if the kids are off at
primary school, and perhaps there is an in-service day in the middle of
the week, or cover is needed for half term, or one of them is
ill&#151;all those kinds of things&#151;people&#146;s ability to
hold down a regular job may be undermined. Fill-in child care can be
very expensive and can affect living standards. We need to have child
care on the list as well, if we are to have a list at
all.</div><a name="09102937000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not go through the rest of the amendments, but I would like to
make an observation about family breakdown, because it is obviously
important. It is clearly the case that the children of lone parents are
at a higher risk of child poverty than the children of two-parent
families. Interestingly, the policy response of the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire, as I understand it, is within a fixed pot of
money to put extra money into two-parent families. Is not that what
getting rid of the couple premium would actually
mean?</div><a name="09102937000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000236"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> It would provide a level playing field, as
elsewhere in the benefit system there is not the discrimination against
two-parent families that currently exists with working tax credit. It
would be a levelling up, not a levelling down. It would not take money
away from any single parents at all. There is also the whole area of
trying to strengthen and support families to give them a chance of
staying together in the first place, rather than dealing with the
consequences when they split
up.</div><a name="09102937000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000237"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> But as with all spending commitments, there is no
such thing as a free lunch. The hon. Gentleman has told us with some
passion, which I believe is sincere, that he is concerned about the
high rates of child poverty in lone-parent families but wants some
additional support to be available to two-parent families in priority
over lone-parent families. That would presumably give him less bang for
his buck on child
poverty.</div><a name="09102937000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000238"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Yes, but we are not talking about fixed states.
There is the whole phenomenon of LATs&#151;those who are living apart
together. The hon. Gentleman must be aware that many people who are an
item, to use the popular vernacular, are forced to live apart because
of the way in which the benefit system acts against them. People are
taking decisions in their personal lives because the benefit system
would be stacked against them if they moved in with each
other.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000240"></a>Ms

way?</div><a name="09102937000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000241"></a>Steve

views on that
point.</div><a name="09102937000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000242"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> I am interested in the point that the hon. Member
for South-West Bedfordshire just made because it seemed to be based on
the assumption that the benefit system effectively does not
disincentivise a couple from separating because the two people will not
have additional costs as a result. In my experience, the housing costs
of two people separating would heavily outweigh any possible advantage
within the tax credit and benefit system of them separating, so I
wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has thought that point
through.</div><a name="09102937000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000243"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Were the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire to
respond to that point, I am sure that he would cite some recently
published research about those relative costs, but I am with the hon.
Lady on that. One of the things that people do not value adequately
enough in such calculations is the value, in the case of couples, of
what might be called free child care. Couples can live together and
save certain costs by doing so, leaving aside the psychic or emotional
benefits&#151;whatever they are called&#151;of being together,
which are rather difficult to include in a cost-benefit calculation. If
one parent works, however, the other can provide free child care,
whereas a lone parent does not have that
option.</div><a name="09102937000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000244"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that levels of
financial support should be determined by need and based on the number
of children and the amount of finance available to that unit, rather
than on whether the family arrangement is that of two parents or of a
lone parent? As I understand it, the current arrangements seek to put
financial need as the criterion.</div>
<a name="09102937000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000245"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Yes, the focus clearly must be on need. I do not
want the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire to think that any of
us in the Committee do not think that fostering an environment that
enables people who want to stay together as a couple to do so is a good
thing. We all believe that, so the point of difference is between the
causality of what he talks about inevitably leading to poverty, and the
ability of the state to do as much as it can about it. He is involved
in voluntary sector projects in his constituency that are very
effective in that area and that could be better resourced. This is not
a council of despair, and I am not saying that we cannot do anything.
This is a question of whether a national child poverty strategy with
local implementation should make the causal link that he
assumes.</div>
<a name="09102937000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
point relates to marriage, which the hon. Gentleman did not mention,
and I appreciate that that was because he did not want to be
pigeonholed. The evidence that financial incentives keep people
together specifically in marriage is staggeringly weak. He will know
that his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe
(Mr. Clarke), when Chancellor, like other Conservative
Chancellors, cut the married couple&#146;s tax allowance
repeatedly&#151;the current lot finished it off, but they started it,
as it were. There is no correlation between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>the point at which the married couple&#146;s tax
allowance was degraded, and marriage and divorce. We must be careful
about the assumption that relatively small financial incentives will
affect big life choices in a simplistic, causal
way.</div><a name="09102937000183"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000246"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It is extraordinary that both left-wing parties on
the Committee are so determined to deny that disincentives for couples
to stay together exist or have any import. The further up the income
levels someone is, the freer they are to make decisions. It is the poor
and vulnerable whose decisions are particularly driven by financial
incentive, because of the immediacy of finances in their daily lives.
Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that, despite the evidence provided by
work such as &#147;Dynamic benefits&#148;, there is no financial
disincentive for people on low incomes and benefits to be a
couple?</div>
<a name="09102937000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000247"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I certainly take one of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points: lower down the income scale, these incentives matter more. The
&#147;Dynamic Benefits&#148; report is packed full of assertions,
but there is relatively little substance behind a lot of it. Some of
those assertions may be true, but in my view they are not
substantiated. They underestimate the benefits of being a couple and
what it is that prompts many people to remain as a couple,
notwithstanding, as the hon. Gentleman says, some financial issues in
doing so. We risk relying too much on anecdote in this area. There is
not a lot of hard evidence of people
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> It is asserted that this goes on a
lot. The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire says, &#147;We all
know people
who&#151;&#148;</div><a name="09102937000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000248"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I
don&#146;t.</div><a name="09102937000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000249"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I am not sure that I do either. This is a marginal
rather than a central feature of the system, and that is perhaps where
we disagree.</div>
<a name="09102937000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I
should wrap up my point. If we are going to have a Christmas tree, our
baubles are nice, so we would like to see child care and transport on
the list. However, I ask the Minister to consider whether a Christmas
tree is the best
idea.</div><a name="09102937000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000250"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I want to add another bauble to the Christmas
tree. I have tabled an amendment on asylum-seeking, Traveller and
looked-after children, but we have discussed those issues previously. I
do not want to say much more, except to point out that looked-after
children need services particularly when they come out of care, to help
them enter economic activity.</div>
<a name="09102937000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
speak to amendment 20, which is about the criminal justice system. I
agree with the hon. Member for Northavon that things can be added on
for ever, and that all kinds of issues would be suitable. However, I am
not sure that the criminal justice system is referred to anywhere in
the Bill. I am not thinking about children who are in the criminal
justice system because, as I have said, children in institutions might
be vulnerable and have multiple difficulties, but I am not sure that
poverty is the biggest issue for them. I do not think that we can
measure poverty if such children are in an institution that is properly
resourced.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div><a name="09102937000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am thinking
about the involvement of parents in the criminal justice system, and
the impact that that has on family income and on levels of child
poverty in particular. That applies to both men and women. However, in
the Corston report on women offenders and the sentencing of women,
there are particular issues regarding women who are put into prison,
their experiences in prison and difficulties with resettlement. Often,
women are more likely to face custodial sentences for non-violent
crimes, despite their family responsibilities. There are major issues
around that, and maintaining relationships with the children. May I
just give a practical example, as it always helps to focus attention a
bit?</div>
<a name="09102937000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The mother of
one of the families I have spoken about previously was sent to prison
for stabbing her partner. When she came out, her benefits had been
disrupted because she had been in prison and it took about three or
four months to get them sorted out, because the benefits system is not
the fastest thing that has ever happened. Worse than that, while she
was in prison, her housing benefit lapsed and she built up rent
arrears. So when she came out, she had no income and she had to go back
to sharing a cramped flat with the partner she had stabbed. She was
pregnant and was being pursued by the council for rent arrears. By any
standards, a local authority that is looking at how to tackle child
poverty must consider what happens with this group of parents, which
will not be
huge.</div><a name="09102937000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000251"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Does the hon. Lady know how long the prison
sentence was, because it is my understanding that housing benefit is
supposed to stay in place and is not supposed to be disrupted if the
sentence is less than 13
weeks?</div><a name="09102937000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000252"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> She received a longer sentence than that. It also
seemed that the courts had not made a proper assessment of how many
children she had. She did not have proper legal representation and I
think the courts thought&#151;it was not absolutely clear&#151;that
she had only one child, but she had three and she was
pregnant. She got quite a long custodial sentence&#151;longer
than 13 weeks&#151;and it was only by starting to get proper
legal representation and unpicking things that it was possible to
resolve her situation a
bit.</div><a name="09102937000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect&#151;I do not have all the data&#151;that although this
group of parents might not be huge, 100 per cent. of their children
would be found to be living in poverty and suffering compound material
deprivation. I understand that the Minister does not want to have a
wish list that goes on and on, but will he consider giving some
assurances about how the assessments locally and the strategy
nationally can take into account the criminal justice system? That is
particularly necessary because of the pressures on families in which
the parents are involved with the criminal justice system, with a
devastating impact on the family&#146;s income. Will he make sure
that he looks at not just the issues surrounding fathers but those
relating to mothers?</div>
<a name="09102937000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
an example of the particular impact on lone parents. One of my more
instructive mornings was spent in a youth court, where all the young
men were being done for nicking and driving cars, and they were getting
community sentences. There were only a couple of women who were up in
the youth court, one of whom was a very poor young mother. She was a
teenager 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>and had a couple of children. She was done for
committing credit card fraud to get money to support her children.
There are real issues about focusing on this difficult group and making
sure that they are properly included. If my right hon. Friend the
Minister cannot include them in the Bill, will he say exactly where the
criminal justice system will come into play in looking at strategies to
deal with child
poverty?</div><a name="09102937000109"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000253"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for
Northampton, North, whose personal experience of case work benefits the
Committee as it seeks to understand the many triggers of child poverty.
The hon. Member for Northavon rightly pointed out that clause 8 is a
Christmas tree. Perhaps if I had had the insight to speak to the hon.
Gentleman before I drafted my amendments, I might have sought to alter
the clause altogether, so that subsection (5) might read, &#147;Must
consider what if any measures ought to be taken to improve the
well-being of children.&#148; Given the variety of policies and
services that affect the welfare of the children, any effort to list
them all is fundamentally absurd.</div>
<a name="09102937000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers
have heard what has been said, and I am about to move on and promote my
own baubles, but I invite them to think again whether the approach is
the right one. It has been a pleasure to listen to the three
outstanding contributions that have been made today, and I am struck
with the thought of other relevant services&#151;to refer to the
comments of the hon. Member for Northampton, North, who sought a
rationale for the Christmas tree in relation to
services.</div><a name="09102937000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
hon. Members will have daily familiarity with the misery caused to the
families of lone mothers or fathers, or new families, by the
administration of the Child Support Agency. It is an impossible mess in
which lots of good people appear to be trying to do their best, but all
too often things end in misery for families, with stress in the home
and child poverty.</div>
<a name="09102937000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
nothing on the list about the administration of benefits. What goes
more to the heart of services on which children in poverty depend than
the administration of benefits? If the hon. Member for Northampton,
North is right, and someone coming out of prison can wait four months
to get her benefits sorted out, that goes to show how important the
administration of benefits should be in the clause, if we are to go for
a Christmas tree
effect.</div><a name="09102937000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000254"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that there is
some rationale for not including absolutely everything? The provision
of financial support for children and parents so clearly has the Child
Support Agency and the administration of the benefit system at its core
that I cannot see that anything would be added by listing those items.
I think that the baubles can be limited, even if a few extra might
conceivably be added with a little more logic than the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s two examples, important though they are in our daily
lives and case
work.</div><a name="09102937000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000255"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The hon. Lady is probably right, but the point
allowed me to bring up both those subjects.</div>
<a name="09102937000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall try
not to detain the Committee too long by talking about other amendments
that I have not tabled, but I hope that the Government will take on
board the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>need to emphasise enterprise and the creation of
wealth, as well as its distribution, which is the reason for amendment
1.</div>
<a name="09102937000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
commented already on well-being. It would be peculiar if we did not try
to bring the concept of well-being into the matter. The Bill is
primarily about incomes, and I shall come to the issue of rurality in a
moment. However, it is possible to imagine that even while children
are, technically, in poverty, there can be excellent access to
transport, libraries, swimming pools and a choice of decent schools, so
that a material difference can be made to the lives of children who are
still, technically, in relative poverty. Therefore, a wider sense of
well-being needs to be captured in the strategies.</div>
<a name="09102937000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
rehearse the point about family breakdown too much more, but to the
bizarre combination of Labour and Liberal Democrats who seem not to
care about, or&#151;I must stop overstating my case&#151;who fail
to give sufficient weight to the importance of family breakdown, I
would recommend the report &#147;Dynamic Benefits&#148;, which was
recently published by the Centre for Social
Justice:</div><a name="09102937000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Economies
of scale mean that two single claimants will always need (and hence
deserve) more than a couple. However, the Government reduces benefit
payments to couples by far more than is saved through cohabiting: so,
among families facing the greatest disadvantage, where strong, stable
family units are needed most, they are most
penalised.&#148;</div><a name="09102937000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon may say that that is an assertion not backed
by evidence, but it is followed immediately by a case study, which is
about the best that can be done in such a context, I think. It deals
with a couple, who
are</div><a name="09102937000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;both
workless and living separately from each other. They are each entitled
to a single person&#146;s JSA of &#163;64.30 per week and a HB/CTB
award that would depend on where they
lived.&#148;</div><a name="09102937000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
says:</div><a name="09102937000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
they choose to live together, then the Government recognises their
joint income required to keep the same standard of living would be 75
per cent. of their combined separate incomes as singles. However, as a
couple they would be entitled to just the same HB as a single person,
and between them would receive a joint JSA award of only &#163;100.95
per week. This would typically leave them with approximately 66 per
cent. of their previous income, less than the 75 per cent. required to
make it equivalent for
couples.&#148;</div><a name="09102937000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09102937000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the case study in the report is incorrect, I would be interested to
hear that from the Minister, but on the face of it, it shows that a
couple on benefits living together would be penalised more than is
necessary to reflect the fact that they were living together. That,
simply, is the point being made by my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Bedfordshire and the Conservative party. I do not think that
it is an extreme one, and it certainly does not seek to penalise lone
parents. It is an attempt to lay out what a fair and reasonable benefit
system and a level playing field look like.</div>
<a name="09102937000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000256"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The hon. Gentleman has helpfully raised a specific
case, which aids the debate. Clearly, there is a set of bills that two
people running separate households must pay twice. An example is water
rates. There is no benefit for paying water rates, so people running
two households have two lots of water rates, household insurance, fuel
bills and so on. There must be some adjustment. The question is whether
it is the right adjustment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div><a name="09102937000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman read out the line:</div>
<a name="09102937000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government
recognises their joint income required...would be 75 per cent. of
their combined separate incomes as
singles.&#148;</div><a name="09102937000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
he know where that figure comes from? Where do the Government recognise
that it is 75 per
cent.?</div><a name="09102937000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000257"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I have to confess that I have not the faintest
idea. Perhaps the Minister will be able to help us later; I merely
throw it out. Apart from casework, my greatest and deepest involvement
in understanding the benefit system comes from reading that report and
others. I do not have the hon. Gentleman&#146;s statistical
background.</div><a name="09102937000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000258"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I am honestly not trying to be a smart Alec. What I
was getting at is that I assume&#151;I am guessing, because it is not
made clear&#151;that the issue is about the equivalence scales. I am
guessing that the report is saying that the Government adjust for
household size on one basis, but pay benefits on another. It is
perfectly sensible to discuss whether the equivalence scales match the
benefit relativities, and if not, whether they should be adjusted. It
does not seem to be a great theological point; it is a somewhat
technical one. I wonder whether people make judgments on such a huge
issue as whether to live together based on 6 or 7 per cent. here or
there. If 9 per cent. is the margin, is that enough to make the hon.
Gentleman decide whether to live with
somebody?</div><a name="09102937000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000259"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I must say that yet again, the hon. Gentleman has
shown his credentials for the post of first chairman of the child
poverty commission. I hope that he will give serious consideration to
such a move in due course.</div>
<a name="09102937000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments
67 and 68, as I said, if we accept the Christmas tree idea,
looked-after children are always missed. The Children, Schools and
Families Committee wrote a report recently pointing out just how much
we, as corporate parents to looked-after children, fail them. Asylum
seekers&#146; children are all too easily missed as well, so I
support the
amendments.</div><a name="09102937000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
did want to make a main contribution&#151;I will try not to make it
too long, Mr. Key&#151;on my amendment, which concerns the
need for policies to deal with rural child poverty. Some 22 per cent.
of rural children and their families live in financial poverty,
according to the Commission for Rural Communities &#147;State of the
Countryside 2008&#148; report. It is a serious issue. According to
the same report, child poverty is growing more quickly in rural than in
urban areas. During the period 2004 to 2007, it rose by 3 per cent. in
rural areas, compared to 2 per cent. in the rest of the nation. That is
a reminder that during some periods in the past 10 years,
child poverty has moved in the wrong direction.</div>
<a name="09102937000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Poverty in
rural Britain is hidden, as the media and an urban-based and perhaps
occasionally urban-focused Government&#151;I do not mean that overly
pejoratively&#151;typically focus more on urban blight. As can
sometimes be seen in contributions from Opposition Members, there is a
tendency to believe that rural living is essentially a comfortable and
middle-class preoccupation.</div>
<a name="09102937000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000260"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div><a name="09102937000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000261"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I will in a moment, having done my normal trick of
provoking her. According to the Institute for Public Policy Research
North&#146;s 2006 paper, &#147;A New Rural Agenda&#148;, that
view obscures issues such as small settlement structures, limited
provision of welfare services and the arrival of ex-urban
groups.</div><a name="09102937000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000262"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that
many of us represent rural and semi-rural constituencies, but I thought
it necessary to put it on the record. My constituency&#151;an
ex-mining community&#151;is largely rural, with market towns. The
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the
Member for Bishop Auckland, has just told me that her constituency is
800 sq km, which can hardly be described as a compact urban area.
Indeed, I drove past it when I was going on holiday in Northumberland
recently, and can vouch for it being
rural.</div><a name="09102937000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000263"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. The
rare signs of commitment to, and understanding of, rurality by Labour
Members are always welcome. Although the causes of rural poverty are
similar to the causes of the urban experience of poverty, there are
often&#151;</div><a name="09102937000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000264"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09102937000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000265"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I will make a little more progress, with
Mr. Key&#146;s permission. I shall seek to be less
provocative of Labour Members. I will happily give way to the hon. Lady
once I have made my
point.</div><a name="09102937000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are often deeper challenges because of rural constraints, such as low
rates of pay and the predominance of seasonal work in coastal towns and
villages. Those issues are pertinent in my constituency of Beverley and
Holderness. Seasonal work is linked not only to tourism, but to
agriculture. Access to education and services is difficult for those
without private transport, as was mentioned by the hon. Member for
Northavon. There are also higher living costs, particularly in tourist
areas and places that are remote and isolated from centres of main
activity. Pockets of deprivation in rural areas are harder to discern
than in urban areas, where they are more
concentrated.</div><a name="09102937000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000266"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> This is a major policy point in the Bill. One of
the reasons why the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party criticised the Bill
was the responsibility it put on local authorities. One reason why I
and other Labour Members support that approach is that local
authorities can deal with issues of poverty, including rural poverty,
in their areas as it is. That is why it is so important that we follow
the approach in the Bill. It will enable the targeting of poverty in
precisely the way he
wants.</div><a name="09102937000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000267"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Asserting something does not necessarily make it
so. I hope that the hon. Lady is right. However, my hon. Friend the
Member for Henley, who is far more expert in the workings of local
government than I, suggests that the Bill is over-prescriptive. In his
opinion, it does not allow the flexibility of approach that the hon.
Lady wishes for. Perhaps we will focus on that later in our
deliberations. I agree that if the Bill provided that flexibility, it
would be right to support it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div><a name="09102937000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Access poverty
features largely in the lives of rural children and young people. It is
particularly important in the lives of teenagers. Over time, there has
been a centralisation of services such as health, housing, education
and leisure services. The financial and physical barriers to services,
such as distance or a lack of transport, affect families and children
on low incomes disproportionately, particularly those in remote areas.
That is why amendment 60 was
tabled.</div><a name="09102937000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
benefits, which are the responsibility of the Financial Secretary,
there is a lack of rural jobcentres. Before the sudden spike in
unemployment, the Government were busily shutting jobcentres as fast as
they could. According to the CRC report, &#147;State of the
Countryside 2008&#148;, there are only 31 jobcentres in sparse and
rural areas. In rural areas, 40 per cent. of 15 to 16-year-olds said
that the availability of transport played a part in their decision
whether to enter post-16 education. I know people in Withernsea and the
surrounding areas who have tried to access education in Hull, but have
given up on their courses because of the difficulty and expense
involved in accessing public transport. That affects the drop-out
rate.</div><a name="09102937000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
put it to the Minister that there are extra costs to living in rural
areas. Households in rural settlements typically spend &#163;74.50 on
transport each week; that compares with a figure of &#163;57 in urban
areas. Therefore amendment 60 is necessary to ensure that the UK
strategies cover the specific rural challenges and that progress on
child poverty is made fairly and proportionately across different
areas, so that no areas are left behind in the drive for
improvement.</div><a name="09102937000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000268"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> I shall aim to be brief and will concentrate on my
amendments, but we have had interesting exchanges about the couples
penalty, family breakdown and other important contextual drivers of
child poverty, and it occurred to me that there is potentially a
couples penalty for pensioners as well. If that is the case, I wonder
why we do not see a spate of pensioner break-ups when people reach
retirement age. As the hon. Member for Northavon rightly said, the
factors that drive relationships are much more complex than that, and
relationships are much less amenable change as a result of relatively
minor impacts of the tax and benefits
system.</div><a name="09102937000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Admittedly,
Conservative Members are making some very good points; the last speech
that we heard contained some important points about rural poverty.
However, in making representations, it is critical that the
Conservative party tries to understand that given public spending
pressures, and the demands that constantly come from Opposition Front
Benchers for faster and deeper cuts to public expenditure, adding ever
more demands for investment in benefits and other services is
unrealistic. Those demands would need to be met by taking resources
from other elements of the tax and benefits system. That understanding
has been sadly
missing.</div><a name="09102937000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make a couple of comments on amendments 64 and 66,
which are probing amendments. I do not intend to use the word
&#147;bauble&#148;, because it would be inappropriate in the
context of a very important group of people, but I am clearly not
seeking to add the provisions to the Bill, for the reasons that other
hon. Members have outlined. We should not look to the Bill to include a
list of different categories of people at risk of poverty, or a list of
their characteristics. That is an important point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div><a name="09102937000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I and other hon. Members were asked to table an amendment about
children who live with families that do not include their parents, but
who are not in the care system, there was a quite dramatic unintended
consequence for me, which is that I learned something. I learned that
there is a huge policy implication arising from a situation that is
brought up in my advice surgery every two weeks. Families in my
constituency are constantly coming to me with a number of complex
problems&#151;often financial but sometimes not&#151;and they
include one or more children who are not the children of the people in
front of me. They are nephews and nieces&#151;a sister&#146;s
child&#151;or grandchildren, and almost invariably the
circumstances&#151;</div><a name="09102937000146"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000270"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> I apologise, Mr. Key. I thought that we
were covering all the amendments to the clause. I have obviously made a
mistake and I shall return to my amendments later. To address the issue
of child care specifically, and to continue the Christmas analogy, if
we added child care to the building blocks, it would be the
non-gender-specific fairy at the top of the Christmas tree, rather than
a bauble. Given that the Bill has specified a number of services, and a
number of different approaches to, and preconditions for, a strategy
for tackling poverty, not to include child care would be quite a
significant
error.</div><a name="09102937000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8(5)(a) talks

expect the Minister, in responding to the amendment, to point out that
child care will be covered under those categories. Of course, an
element of that argument is right. However, it is possible for a
Government strategy to promote and facilitate employment, health,
education and social services without necessarily looking at the
delivery of child care services. It is possible to leave out an
analysis of the impact of child care and its delivery, quality and
affordability, and that inclines us to make a case for its
inclusion.</div><a name="09102937000185"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="09102937000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am clear that the Government have transformed the landscape of child
care in the past decade. The national child care strategy and the
Childcare Act 2006 provide for the extension of child care, with the
addition of places for three and four-year-olds. In the near future, we
will be rolling out free places for two-year-olds; that will be funded
by the nursery education grant. There is also the provision through
Sure Start, children&#146;s centres, and additional support through
the child care affordability programme and the child care tax credit.
That is all true. However, in practice a number of inherent flaws in
the system show the downside of localism. If we do not specify child
care in the Bill, it is possible that those flaws might expand in
future.</div><a name="09102937000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
review of the early years funding formula is taking place. That
formula, which is in principle entirely sound, aims to put nurseries
maintained by a local authority on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>the same footing as those in the private and voluntary sectors, to
create a level playing field. However, the Royal borough of Kensington
and Chelsea is using that formula to create the opportunity to close
four maintained nursery schools; it is one of a number of authorities
across the country acting in such a way. That was not an intended
consequence of the funding formula. In practice, that local authority
is not looking at the delivery of child care against the benchmark of
child poverty, and is not considering how its child care services would
best deliver a service to the people who need it
most.</div><a name="09102937000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to provide a separate example relating to the funding that
is pouring into local government through the nursery education grant
and the Sure Start programme, which is funding the expansion of early
years provision. Some local authorities have decided that they will
seek to recoup large amounts of Government money through back-door
means, for example by charging rent to those nurseries, which
immediately pass on the cost to parents. One nursery is being charged
&#163;64,000 a year in rent by Westminster city council, which is my
local authority. That money, which was delivered into the hands of the
nurseries, is immediately recycled out, back into the general
fund.</div><a name="09102937000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned that if we do not strengthen the Bill and ensure that
local authorities and other partner providers look at the implications
for child poverty when considering aspects of child care delivery, the
issue will slip off the
radar.</div><a name="09102937000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000271"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Just to underline my hon. Friend&#146;s point,
to refer back to the family whom I mentioned, that young girl who came
out of prison was only given a half-day session in the local Sure
Start, and was charged for sessions
there.</div><a name="09102937000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000272"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> What my hon. Friend says is absolutely right. We
know that there has been a significant expansion in core funding for
free places, which we should be proud of. However, the complexity of
delivery, particularly given that we rely on a market model for a lot
of child care&#151;we use the private and voluntary sector for so
much of it&#151;invariably means that charging becomes a factor and
that we cannot rely, without further strengthening the requirement on
local authorities, on the people who are most in need being able to
access the services that they
require.</div><a name="09102937000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary is well aware of my concern
about how the child care tax credit works. The Government are right to
say that that tax credit is a more generous means of funding families
on low incomes, so that they can afford child care in the marketplace.
Sadly, the number of people who claim child care tax credit is small.
For example, in my local authority area, only about 100 or so families
actually receive it. It is, and has been, possible for local
authorities to say that they will introduce extra charges for child
care, on the assumption that the child care tax credit will take up the
slack. It will not do so, because it is structurally difficult to
claim. It effectively militates against certain areas of the country
where costs are high and working tax credit take-up is relatively low.
We end up losing the provision. That has been the case in the past, and
I fear that it will be so in the future if we cannot guarantee
delivery.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div><a name="09102937000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">So far, I have
concentrated mostly on under-fives, because that is where the greatest
expense lies for parents, but an even bigger concern, not covered fully
in the Childcare Act 2006, is child care for older children. We know
that the extended school service exists, and that a huge amount of
money has gone into it; that is something of which I am very proud. It
is also true that the level of prescription relating to extended
schools is such that it is perfectly possible for a school to say that
it is providing a full extended school service, but not actually
provide a single service on its site. That is how the classification of
extended schools operates. Looking at service delivery throughout the
country, I am not at all sure that there are not very real variations
in the quality and provision of
service.</div><a name="09102937000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
seek to migrate lone parents on to the employment and support
allowance, jobseeker&#146;s allowance and income support, on the
basis that the extended school services exist and on the basis that
there is the ability to pay for them, but we lack the robust
information that would let us know whether that actually
happens.</div><a name="09102937000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000273"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I point out to my hon. Friend that we published a
written ministerial statement on Monday, which made it absolutely clear
that, as lone parents migrate from income support to JSA, their
obligations to work will be tied to school hours, rather than the
extended schools hours to which she refers, and about which she is
particularly
concerned.</div><a name="09102937000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102937000274"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> I am grateful for that welcome clarification. I
expect that, in practice, most Jobcentre Plus staff would be sensitive
to such issues, but it is important that the point be specified. The
broader point remains: extended school provision and early years
services are critical, not just to enable parents to work, although
that is significant, but because they are enriching and valuable
experiences for children. Investment in early years services provides
more value for money than investment in education at any other stage in
a child&#146;s life. If we can close the attainment gap by the age of
five, it will be far more valuable to us than money that is dedicated
to secondary, further and higher education; a lot of that investment is
spent chasing up on what we were not able to do in the early
years.</div>
<a name="09102937000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
50 is in no way critical of the progress made over the past decade, but
I worry that underneath the general average of improvement, there are
significant levels of variation, even within local authorities. I am
not convinced that the target of tackling child poverty and improving
social mobility will be attained simply by looking at local authority
averages, as the Childcare Act does. If the Government are to keep a
clause that specifies a number of different services and elements that
are needed for a comprehensive strategy, but not all of them, I would
strongly argue that they should include child care provision as a vital
building
block.</div><a name="09102937000163"></a>
