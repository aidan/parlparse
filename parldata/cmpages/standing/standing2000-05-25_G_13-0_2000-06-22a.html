<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the earliest practical registration of all social care workers'.<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Dr. Brand.]<P>

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> One of the nice things about speaking immediately after a break is that no one, with the exception of you, Mr. Gale, has the faintest idea of where I have reached in my speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister had just responded to an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I thought that you might have been the only person paying attention, Mr. Gale, and that has confirmed my suspicion.
<P>
I was trying to deal with the concerns of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) about the speed with which registration would be complete for all social care workers. I was trying to describe to him the early priorities that we envisage setting for the General Social Care Council, which would be to include social workers, residential child care workers and managers of care homes. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) asked what we meant by that.
<P>
The regulatory powers in clause 21(2)(f) allow us to make regulations in relation to the management of care homes. We envisage that someone will need to be identified as the manager of the care home. In some cases--in small care homes, for example--that will be the person who is also carrying on the business. In larger care homes run by organisations that might provide several establishments, the person registered as carrying on the business will not be the person identified as the manager. The person carrying on the business might be a company, for example.
<P>
If you remember, Mr. Gale--you were chairing our proceedings at the time--I tabled an amendment that I described as surreal. It made it clear that the manager had to be an individual. I0 hope that that answers the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I can say that because he has only just arrived and has not heard my answer. As there is a rule about repetitious arguments, I obviously cannot repeat for his benefit what I have just said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I apologise to you, Mr. Gale, to the Committee and to the Minister for arriving late. I assure the Minister that I will read most attentively what he has just said in the Official Report as soon as it is available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not doubt that for a second; I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will do that. .For his sake, I will say that I was trying to deal with a point that he raised about the difference between a person carrying on a business and the person managing that business. We will ensure under the regulatory powers that someone is identified as the manager. That is appropriate. We will use our powers under clause 21(2)(f) to ensure that that is done.
<P>
The person managing a care home might not be registered as the person carrying on the business. I gave the example of a company being registered in that capacity. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that such a company cannot also be registered as the manager for obvious, common-sense reasons. We envisage at the earliest opportunity wanting to register with the General Social Care Council the individual who is the manager. I have tried to explain to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight the time scale that we are pursuing.
<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): To save time, will the Minister indicate whether he will publish a timetable once we are further down this road?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is a possibility, although I do not want to commit myself to doing that. We have established a general social care advisory group that will help us with the implementation of this part, should it become law. We will need to take advice from the General Social Care Council on the matter. I have already noted what the hon. Gentleman might describe as a timetable for the registration process for residential child care workers. There will be a slightly longer time scale for managers. We want to get on with registration because that will add significantly, I hope, to public protection of service users in particular.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I accept everything that my hon. Friend says. As a qualified social worker, I accept the priority that he extends to particular groups for registration under the General Social Care Council. Is there not a case for two-tier registration, whereby everyone working in the care field could have a lower form of registration and those who had achieved particular qualifications or skill levels could progress to a higher level? That would serve the interests mentioned of achieving the highest possible standards in a largely unqualified work force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We do not have two-tier registration in mind. It will be possible for people to progress from one register to another should their qualifications change. For example, a national vocational qualification level 3 residential child care worker might want to become a professionally qualified social worker and would progress to a different register.
<P>
We have made a well-documented decision, outlined clearly in the White Paper, that we wanted the register maintained by the General Social Care Council to be qualifications-based. There will be opportunities for people to register on one of the registers maintained by the GSCC. We would not want to hold out the prospect of one less valuable or second-class register. Registration will be significant and add appreciably to public protection, serving as a seal of approval of individuals and more widely of the qualifications that they hold.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson), and I will want to agree on one matter: it will be important to make progress on registration as fast as we can. That is what the Government intend to do.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am pleased to hear the Minister's reassurance. I would have thought that there was great merit in having a register for everyone working in the field, so that legal checks and background checks could be made as an interim measure before a fully fledged, qualifications-based register were established. That might help to speed up the process considerably. If the Minister would like to respond to that point, I would be happy to hear what he had to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I would not want the hon. Gentleman to conclude that there would be no opportunities for employers and the wider public to be satisfied about the criminal record of a worker not on a register maintained by the GSCC. Other procedures are in place, including the Protection of Children Act 1999 and the Police Act 1997, that hold out the prospect of security, irrespective of whether a person is registered with the GSCC.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I will ask leave to withdraw the amendment at the end of my remarks, Mr. Gale, in the light of what the Minister has told us. We will have an opportunity to return to the matter once regulations are laid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I apologise to the Minister if my absence at the beginning of the sitting renders redundant the question that I am about to ask. Will he explain the way in which what he has said about there being a manager in all cases works with clause 21(2)(j), which gives powers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make provision requiring the person carrying on an establishment or agency to appoint a manager in prescribed circumstances?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that there is an explanation, but the paragraph seems to sit uncomfortably with the Minister's comments.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That intervention is extremely interesting and I wonder whether the Minister would like to intervene on me to respond?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I should have referred to clause 21(2)(j) rather than to clause 21(2)(f). The appointment of a manager is already required under the Registered Homes Act 1984. We will simply ensure that our power to make regulations will provide continuity between the new arrangements under the Bill and those that pertained under that Act.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The short discussion has been most helpful and, under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 341, in page 23, line 31, leave out from beginning to end of line 34.
<P>
The amendment would delete subsection (4). It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Each Council shall ... act ... in accordance with directions given to it by the appropriate Minister; and ... under the general guidance of the appropriate Minister.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am concerned about the independence of the General Social Care Council and its position as a professional registration body in relation to other such bodies. The Minister might have counter examples, but the essential characteristic of the professional registration bodies with which we are familiar is that they are self-regulating. Although the General Social Care Council has a title that invites it to be on a par with other registration bodies in the health and social care professions, the requirement that it can be directed by a Minister substantially reduces its self-governing independent state.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that self-regulation by the medical and nursing professions has served the public well?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know my view that self-regulation is an essential characteristic of a profession. It defines and marks out a profession and is an important part of the structure of our liberal democracy. That is not to say that it always works perfectly. There are interesting and pertinent debates on refining self-regulatory mechanisms. I hope that the General Medical Council will produce proposals to satisfy the legitimate concerns that have been, and are being, expressed about the self-regulatory mechanisms in the medical profession. It would be unfortunate if professional self-regulatory bodies were unable to deal with legitimate concerns and, because of that, were regulated by the state. I would be uncomfortable with a move from professional self-regulation to a system in which the professions were regulated by the state. I do not want to over-egg the pudding, but one's mind is drawn to the old Soviet Union and how that regime undermined professional independence.
<P>
However, I do not intend to have that debate. Instead, I want to give the Minister the opportunity to explain where the GSCC will sit within the broader body of regulatory and registration organisations for health and social care. I hope that he envisages it having equal status to existing registration bodies and taking its place at the table with them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has raised specific issues about the construction of the GSCC and the wider issue of professional self-regulation. The GSCC will not be a self-regulatory body in the way that described. We made it clear when we published our intentions to establish such a body that a majority of lay representatives will serve on it. It is important that the nature of the GSCC is fully understood. It will be a non-departmental public body. The hon. Gentleman will see from its duties and responsibilities that some of its functions will ultimately be funded by the Government, particularly the training of the social care work force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): Will my hon. Friend assure me about the make-up of the General Social Care Council? He said that the majority of its members will be lay people. For the profession to have confidence in the council, it should also have professional representatives--people who work day in, day out at the grassroots.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I give my hon. Friend that assurance: yes, the General Social Care Council will include members with experience of the services that we have described. I do not want to be too specific about precisely how the make-up of the council will be established, but it must command the professional respect of social care workers. That is important if it is to succeed in the important mission that we have in mind for it.
<P>
The General Social Care Council will be constituted as a non-departmental public body, and it is entirely consistent with how such bodies are traditionally set up that the Secretary of State should be able to issue it with directions, should it prove necessary. That is particularly important in the light of its specific responsibilities, which will include the training of the social care work force, for which the Government might have some responsibility and liability for providing resources.
<P>
I want to reassure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge on some of the arguments that he is developing. He might inadvertently have the impression that we would routinely issue directions to the GSCC, as if it were directly run by the Secretary of State; indeed, he alluded to state regulation. That is definitely not our intention. We do not envisage using the powers of direction on trivial issues or the minutiae of the Council's everyday management.
<P>
It is important, however, to have the flexibility to issue directions in appropriate circumstances. For example, although it is an unlikely eventuality, it would be wrong totally to exclude the possibility of the councils not being properly managed or failing to meet their statutory duties, and Ministers might be required to take remedial action. That would be an exceptional state of affairs, and we do not envisage such a situation, but it is important to be able to issue directions should the circumstances--unfortunately--arise. The amendment would make it impossible for the Secretary of State to have such responsibility.
<P>
We are setting up the body in a way that is consistent with previous non-departmental public bodies. We have no sinister intention; there is no sinister motive in the Secretary of State having the power to issue directions to the council. It will not be based on the traditional self-regulatory model; it will be different. At its core will be the pursuit of the public interest and public safeguards. The council will have a lay majority, which will be drawn from the social care work force. In the wider scheme of things, however, it is important to have the general power of direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying exactly what he has in mind. He has reassured me, not least by confirming that the Government have no intention of becoming involved in the minutiae of day-to-day management and control of the council. The Minister said at the outset that the council will be different from some of the other self-regulatory bodies because it will not have a professional majority. That is an argument against it needing to be under the direction of Ministers. I can see the public interest arguments that could be advanced for a professional majority body. It should be possible, however, to structure the terms of reference and the framework in which the council will operate so as to ensure that conflicts of professional and public interest would not be likely to arise, bearing in mind that it has a lay rather than a professional majority. I am still a little uncomfortable about the way in which the council sits with the other registration and regulatory bodies among the health and social care professions. It will have a different structure, although, on the face of it and in terms of its name and general purpose, it appears to be another such an organisation.
<P>
I note the Minister's remarks and I believe that the amendment has served its purpose by allowing him to flesh out exactly where the council sits in the overall scheme of things. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 50 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 51</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 245, in page 24, line 6, leave out 'or care home' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'care home or residential family centre'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following: Government amendments Nos. 246 and 247, and amendment No. 342, in page 24, line 11, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'except where that person is engaged in the activity referred to on a voluntary basis',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Amendments Nos. 245, 246 and 247 are purely technical. They extend and clarify the definition of a social care worker and therefore enable councils to register family centre, fostering agency and adoption agency workers, as well as managers of establishments or agencies that provide social care services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept the Minister's remarks and that the Government amendments make a sensible and technical improvement to the wording of the Bill. We have no problem with them.
<P>
Amendment No. 342 seeks merely to probe the Government's intentions on volunteers. I should make a distinction in respect of voluntary organisations. We all see that such organisations have a considerable role to play in the scheme that is mapped out by the Bill, but they will often be under contract to statutory bodies and will employ people on a basis that is other than voluntary. The day-to-day work of some voluntary organisations does not have much to do with volunteers. I am thinking specifically about people who volunteer individually to work in establishments that would be caught within the Bill's definitions. I assume that the Government do not intend people who volunteer to help out in a residential care home, perhaps by going in for a few hours a week to talk to the residents and to play cards, a game of backgammon or whatever else, to be caught later by a requirement to be registered on a statutory register. There may be a way in which people with such a role can be vetted. I could construct an argument to state that they need to be vetted, whether they are employed or are volunteers. I do not want to suggest that no such need exists, but I do not think that registration on a statutory register would be the appropriate route.
<P>
I should like to give the Minister a couple of examples. A large multinational company in my constituency regularly seconds its employees for a short stint in some form of voluntary organisation, on a voluntary basis. The organisation might provide residential care. Girls from one of the girls' schools in my constituency routinely do what I think is still loosely termed as work experience, although it is unpaid, in residential care homes. Indeed, I have met one or two people in the House who, although they have never been involved professionally in social work, have done some work of that kind on a voluntary basis, either at school or during some other period of education. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Minister told the Committee how the Government envisage volunteers fitting into the overall scheme of things, bearing in mind the value that we know the Government place on volunteering and the spirit of voluntarism generally, as the right hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) recently reiterated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has raised a completely different scenario from the one covered by his amendment. His amendment relates to volunteers supplied by a domiciliary care agency and does not cover the examples that he gave of people volunteering to work in care homes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I think that I understand how the Minister reached that conclusion. The amendment proposes that a certain wording should be inserted at the end of line 11, but it was intended to be inserted in such a way that it would apply to subsections (2)(a), (b) and (c).
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It is an intriguing amendment because it does not refer to those subsections. It might be that I have misunderstood the amendment, in which case I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. However, he has made clear his intention in tabling the amendment and I shall deal with the point that he raised.
<P>
The essential issue is what the volunteer is doing. If the volunteer is providing services that could constitute personal care, in the way that we understand that term, it is right that, in principle, such a worker should fall under the remit of the General Social Care Council. I am not saying that we would want to require a volunteer to register with the General Social Care Council, because that is not the point. The point is that we would want volunteers to be covered by the codes of practice that the General Social Care Council will develop because that will ultimately provide the necessary public safeguards and standards. "As I said, the issue is what volunteers are doing, and the same argument applies to employed staff. If they are providing personal care, it is appropriate in the interests of public protection for the General Social Care Council to have a responsibility to oversee the work.
<P>
As I said earlier, we had a slight problem with our definition of personal care in clause 100, which a Liberal Democrat amendment drew to the Committee's attention. We are still working on that definition to ensure that we get the point across in the Bill. We need a proper definition and we shall table an amendment that will allow us to ensure that the definition of personal care in the Registered Homes Act 1984 is consistent with the definition in this legislation.
<P>
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question lies in what the volunteer is doing. If the volunteer is not providing personal care, no public purpose would be served by bringing that volunteer within the scope of the General Social Care Council. If the volunteer is providing personal care, the issue is irrelevant. We do not want to create unnecessary bureaucracy. I am not saying that volunteers will necessarily be brought within the scope of any register held by the General Social Care Council, but it is important that the codes of practice should extend to the work that they do. As the hon. Gentleman will know, policing the codes of practice will be a joint responsibility and will certainly involve the inspections undertaken by the National Care Standards Commission.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry that the scope of the amendment was unclear. The amendment's application seems to depend on how far one indents the line that the amendment seeks to insert. The Minister correctly assumed that the issue of registration was at the heart of my concern--and, of course, with registration comes the cost of registration, fees payable and all the other areas with which the Minister will be familiar from other debates where volunteers become embroiled in statutory procedures, whether they relate to record checking or registration. He will know that the voluntary sector is concerned about the costs of making the necessary police record checks. Additional registration costs would be a serious disincentive to volunteering. The Minister will want to ensure that he does not provide such a disincentive when he drafts the regulations.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 248, in page 24, line 15, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'or in the provision of services similar to services which may or must be provided by local authorities in the exercise of those functions'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 249, 250 and 251.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendments concern the technical definitions of social care workers. They allow us to extend the definition by regulation to people who provide services similar to those that are provided by local authorities. That would include people who supply personal care staff, care workers, inspection staff of the commission or the National Assembly for Wales and student social workers. The council's codes of conduct and practice will apply to workers who are covered by these important amendments. It will be able to lay down standards for training and tests for competence in character for such workers. By extending the scope of the workers who can be registered, we are extending the safeguards of the council for the general public and service users.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 249, in page 24, line 17, leave out from 'person' to end of line l8 and insert--

<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I beg to move amendment No. 343, in page 24, line 22, after 'employed', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'to provide nursing or personal care'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 252 and 253.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> It is helpful to know that the Government will revisit the definition of social care in clause 100. That will speed up the debate.
<P>
The amendment's purpose is to avoid defining all people who are employed by day care centres, such as cleaners or technicians, as social care workers. I am sure that they would not want that. The amendment would make the definition more precise so that it covered someone who provides nursing or personal care. Although personal care will be redefined, it is important that the interpretation of clause 51 does not catch the wrong type of worker.
<P>
We would have made the same observation about subsection (3)(b), which uses the wide-sweeping term,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a person engaged in the provision of personal care.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The definition of personal care includes the provision of advice and encouragement, which could be from a mother to a child. I am sure that that is not the Government's intention. As they are to reconsider the definition, we have held off discussing the definition of personal care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) made a fair point. We do not intend to make cleaners register with the General Social Care Council and be subject to the codes of practice. The issue is the contact that people have with residents in day centres. However, we might want to go beyond those people who provide personal care to include other day centre staff, such as managers, support staff and those providing training or education in the range and remit of the General Social Care Council. The amendment, as I interpret it, would make that impossible.
<P>
The distinction would not be a sensible one to draw. A line must be drawn between people needing to be in the scope of the regulations and those who do not. The amendment would put the line in the wrong place and would unhelpfully exclude people who should generally be under the terms of the GSCC. Again, I want to make it clear that we are not necessarily considering regulation but are, at the very least, talking about an obligation to comply with the appropriate codes of practice.
<P>
I should also draw the hon. Lady's attention to the fact that we will have regulations making powers to exclude classes of workers such as cleaners from the scope of the GSCC registration requirement. We have the necessary tools to do the job properly to draw the line in the right place, not to exclude people who should be brought within the scope of the GSCC and to keep outside those for whom inclusion would serve no purpose.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> This is interesting. I am confused by the first sentence of subsection (3)--"regulations may provide" but people
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall be treated as social care workers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3)(a), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a person engaged in work for the purposes of a local authority's social services functions<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
takes in a group of people including accountants, paper clip counters and everyone else involved with those purposes. Was the Minister suggesting that he could break down the categories listed in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) when he "may" make the powers that "shall" make people registrable?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee before the Minister replies that interventions must be interventions and not speeches; they are getting long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has again made a fair point but I ask him to look at subsection (2), which makes it clear that we can except by regulations certain persons from the definition of "social care worker". We must consider carefully his illustrations. It would not serve the purposes of the Bill to include the categories of workers that he has just described in the remit of the General Social Care Council. We can deal with that point later; the hon. Gentleman need not alarm himself unnecessarily.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): As my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre has mentioned, must we not ensure that people wanting to abuse those in vulnerable situations do not move into new occupational areas, when we close down opportunities in certain fields, in which abuse can be continued? That is why we must have the scope to ensure that anyone with regular contact with vulnerable adults is covered to some extent by the provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, I strongly agree with my hon. Friend. I possibly did not make my point accurately enough. The issue is the person's contact with vulnerable people. That is the spirit and intention with which we intend to develop the scope of the General Social Care Council. We must ask ourselves repeatedly the basic question of what purpose would be served by bringing a group of workers within the council's remit. The purpose must be the protection of the public. We must answer that question to decide where the line to which the hon. Member for Meriden alluded must be drawn as we develop the Bill and in future consultation with the GSCC. I hope that the hon. Lady is satisfied with what I have said. She made a sensible point. The Bill as it stands allows us to deal with the issues that she identified.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> As long as a good degree of common sense is exercised when the line is drawn, as the Minister put it, as to which professions can be excluded from the term "social care worker", I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 255.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendments are intended to provide for registration in more than one part of the register. For example, a person registered as a social worker might want to become the manager of a care home and would need to apply for inclusion in the appropriate part of the register. That might involve additional training, according to the rules made under clause 54 with respect to the part of the register dealing with managers.
<P>
That form of dual registration is appropriate, as the skills and competences necessary to different types of care worker will vary. If the councils are to fulfil their duties of promoting high standards of conduct and practice, they must ensure that all social care workers have the right skills and training for their field.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> We have previously touched on an aspect of the amendment because I raised the example of the children's home manager who had not been subject to proper checks. What I said this morning was slightly inaccurate. The delay, after one local authority had notified the other that its police checks had revealed that the man in question was unsuitable for his occupation, was not six months. In fact, two years elapsed before something significant was done, which is even more serious than I had thought.
<P>
The amendment would reinforce the clause's function of ensuring that the relevant council could satisfy itself that those working with vulnerable adults and children were suitably experienced, of good character and without any record of offences suggesting that they might pose a risk to such vulnerable people. The amendment would provide for proper checks, by ensuring appropriate certification under the Police Act 1997. The hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) spoke of the on-going risks, and we need to make sure that checks are done to minimise future risk.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 347 and 348 have a different purpose and are intended to help the Government. The clause contains one set of conditions too many, which could lead to confusion. The amendments would make it clear that the first and second conditions mentioned are the same as "the following conditions" in subsection (1)(c). The rogue set of conditions is in line 8 and is confusing. Perhaps everyone else thinks that the drafting is clear, but we thought that it needed to be clarified.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We agree that councils should obtain details of applicants' criminal backgrounds. They will be able to do that under the Police Act 1997, the Protection of Children Act 1999 and part VI of the Bill. They will be able to register under the Police Act as a body that can make checks. They will then countersign an application to the Criminal Records Bureau from the person who is the subject of the check. The bureau will issue a certificate with the criminal record as well as Protection of Children Act and protection of vulnerable adults listings. Because such checks will already be possible, the amendment is not necessary.
<P>
Amendments No. 347 and 348 have been kindly tabled by the hon. Lady to correct a perceived lack of clarity about what conditions are meant. We have examined the clause carefully and we understand the desire to remove doubt about interpretation, but I am satisfied that there is none. Amendment No. 348 is, I think, slightly deficient and grammatically horrid anyway, because it would, I am told, insert an extra "is" into the sentence. We cannot have two "is's" in one sentence, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I am gently reproved for my grammar--not for the first time, I fear. The problem in the clause is the way the words "conditions" and "unconditionally" are repeated and thrown in together. However, I accept that the meaning is reasonably clear, and I certainly accept the rebuff about my grammatical error, for which I apologise. As I am sure Committee members are aware, the Opposition live rather hand to mouth in preparing amendments. Our mistake came from working at speed.
<P>
On the substantive amendment, I accept that clause 6 would enable the council to run the checks. I simply wanted to hear--and have heard--that the Minister will be diligent in ensuring that the new council will run checks entirely thoroughly. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 256, in page 25, line 12, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'for persons wishing to become social workers'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment Nos. 257 to 259, 264 to 266 and 268 to 270.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Once again, the amendments are intended to improve clarity and drafting.
<P>
The councils will have specific responsibility for regulating the training of professional social workers, using powers under clause 59. Amendment No. 264 would extend clause 59 to enable the councils to regulate post-qualification training. The amended provision, together with the power under clause 61(1) for the councils to make rules requiring registered persons to undertake further training, will create the power properly to regulate the continuing professional development of social workers. That is an important objective.
<P>
The technical amendments Nos. 256 and 257, 265 and 268 to 270 would become necessary because of the amendment of clause 59 to allow for approval of post-qualification courses. Amendments Nos. 256 and 257 specify the training required by social workers for the purposes of deciding on applications for registration. Amendment No. 265 clarifies that, for a course to be approved under clause 59, it must enable students to meet the required standard of practice to qualify as social workers. Amendments Nos. 268 to 270 clarify that the Minister's duty to promote training and power to arrange it if adequate provision is not being made apply to the training of both existing and prospective social care workers. Amendment No. 266 is needed as a consequence of rearranging clause 52.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 345, in page 25, line 14, after 'training', insert 'or experience'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 346, in page 25, line 17, after 'training', insert 'or experience'.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I believe that the term to describe what we propose is a grandfather clause, although I wondered why it could not be called a grandmother clause, especially as so many women work in social care. In any case, we are hoping to improve the lot of the grandparental generation.
<P>
The Bill places much emphasis on the designation of courses and the creation of new courses to allow social workers and social care workers to become properly qualified. One reason is that 80 per cent. of those now engaged in social work do not have clearly defined qualifications. None the less, a considerable number of people have a lot of expertise and can bring many years of experience to the most difficult cases. We would not wish those who have that level of experience to be deterred by having to obtain a new raft of qualifications. Their experience should count for a lot, hence our desire to see the word "experience" in the Bill. All too often, we see a ripple of fear pass through professions allied to medicine when new designated qualifications are set. Many of those who have practised for a long time feel unequal to the task of sitting a fresh set of examinations at that stage of their professional life.
<P>
Ways have been found of successfully regulating those professions--for instance, when the practitioners of a particular skill are observed by inexperienced and newly qualified people, they are found to be entirely proficient in carrying out their tasks. Why cannot a similar arrangement be found for those who can bring substantial and good experience to the social work profession? If that treatment were available to them, they would not be deterred from allowing the use of their expertise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendment should not be accepted, but not because I disagree with the hon. Lady. For example, although many care home managers have no formal qualifications, they have bucket loads of practical experience, which is crucial. The Bill will allow that sort of experience to be taken into account. Subsection (3) provides the general power for the council to specify any other requirements as to an applicant's "conduct and competence". That would certainly include experience.
<P>
Those already in the work force will have many years of experience but no formal qualifications. I can understand that they might be anxious about being required to undergo onerous training before registration and worried that we will develop a one-size-fits-all approach to training requirements. I assure the hon. Lady that that will not happen. We intend that the required level of training will take account of the person's knowledge and experience, so the hon. Lady's concerns are groundless.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The Minister will know that we are not in favour of the one-size-fits-all approach in most areas of health care, because it is difficult to achieve.
<P>
I accept the Minister's assurance, but when referring to subsection (3) he spoke about the applicant satisfying any other requirements. He seemed to emphasise the word "other", yet it does not appear in the Bill. I am perfectly prepared to accept that that is the meaning of the subsection, but it is not what it says. If it had included the word "other", I would have understood the intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady is right that the word "other" does not appear in subsection (3). However, if she takes that provision in conjunction with subsection (2), she will see that it clearly deals with further, or additional, or "other" requirements not listed in subsection (2).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I did not read the provision like that, so I am still not sure that those affected would do so. However, I am prepared to accept the spirit of the Minister's response. The Government may want to find the opportunity on Report to make the matter specifically clear and to achieve perfect clarity. There will then be no confusion. On the basis that that is what subsection (3) is intended to achieve, and in the hope that the word "other" might appear on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
We are making reasonably speedy progress this afternoon, with the help of the endeavours of all hon. Members. Opposition Members are certainly doing what we can to debate the Bill without superfluous questions. The amendment seeks to probe the Minister on the question of removal from the register. A person who is removed after having gained all the necessary qualification, done the necessary courses, obtained the correct experience and been successfully registered will face a serious situation. Although I accept that the Bill provides a lot of latitude for temporary suspension while a case is being investigated and also a capacity for that person to return to the register, it does not, as far as I can see, provide for appeal against removal from the register. The Minister may be able to satisfy me on that point--it looks as if he wants to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall try to satisfy the hon. Lady; she need only look at clause 64.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I think that I have the answer to my question, although I should like some time to consider the provision. In some respects, I wish that we could cross-refer provisions before debating them, as we are sometimes tripped up by not making the obvious cross-referral. I am pleased to hear that an appeal will be possible. As I said, the clause provides latitude for temporary suspension, which is perhaps tantamount to an inquiry into the way in which the removal was decided. With the assurance that clause covers that point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

The amendment gives the councils a general power to make rules about registration, which will allow more flexibility to respond to changing circumstances.

As is the case with all rule-making powers in part IV, any rules made through this power will be subject to ministerial approval before taking effect.

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The Government have been consistent in many of their amendments about branching-off references to fees, but the one before us is a sweep-up amendment. Our amendment points out that such fees should be limited to the actual cost or to some other level, in order to protect--

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'for the purpose only of recovering the full cost of maintaining the registers provided for in this part'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 263, 271 and 272.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendments group certain powers to charge fees and give the councils general powers to charge fees in connection with their functions. The ability to charge fees for providing services will give councils a useful facility to generate income and prevent the whole cost of running the councils from falling on the public purse.
<P>
As well as bringing together existing powers, the provision extends powers to ensure that councils will be able to charge for other services. For example, approving a course might involve the council giving a considerable amount of advice and assistance to the training provider while the course is developed. Councils should be able to charge for such a service. To give another example, if a major employer places a bulk order for copies of the code of practice so that it can give a copy to every member of its staff, the council should be able to levy a suitable charge. However, the council's fees must be reasonable and may be levied only under council rules that have been subject to ministerial approval. In giving that approval, Ministers will bear in mind the requirement that any fees must be reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I now have a change to make my point all over again.
<P>
One practical problem is that this issue pertains to clause 56, but the Government amendments refer to clauses further on in the Bill relating to fees. As there are quite a few amendments, it takes a while before one reaches the final group that relates to clause 67. Hopefully, we might reach that clause by the end of the day.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 350 is to achieve the reasonableness to which the Minister has just referred, so that fees are limited to what is reasonable. I want to probe the Minister on Government amendment No. 272 because I notice that the last sentence says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> requiring persons registered under this Part to pay a periodic fee to the Council of such amount, and at such time, as the rules may specify.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That struck me as a little on the wide side. Will the Minister say what "a periodic fee" means? Will it mean that there is a fee to pay when one is registered with the council and a fee to pay if there is a change to that registration? I would understand that because man hours will be involved in entering the registration and communicating with the person who is registered, and if there is a change to registration, more man hours will be involved, but what will the periodic fee amount to? Will it amount to an annual subscription to the council from the social worker?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton As I understand it, amendment No. 350 would require the council to set fees at a level that will ensure recovery of the full cost. Is that the intention?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> No, the purpose is to achieve reasonableness in relation to fees, which is exactly the same as the Minister's intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am happy to give the hon. Lady an assurance that fees will be set on a reasonable basis. However, given the wide span of the social care work force and the low incomes of many people in that work force, it is certainly not our intention to set fees on the basis that every individual would be charged at a rate that would cover the full costs of their registration. That would not necessarily be appropriate. The funding of the GSCC will be partly covered by the funding transfer that will arise on the closure of the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work. Additional funding will be met by resources from the Department of Health. We shall certainly want to avoid the need to set registration fees at a level that might deter applicants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister makes an important point. He previously said that it was the Government's policy to charge fees that would cover the cost of the exercise in hand--registration, inspection and so on--and that full-cost recovery, but nothing beyond that, was the principle behind that policy. The Minister has now said that that might be inappropriate in the case that he described. Will he confirm in which cases he believes that it is appropriate and in which he believes it inappropriate to recover the full costs from the fees charged?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I thought that I had done that. I have made it clear that most part II services are commercial undertakings, so it is reasonable to expect to recover the full cost. It would be inappropriate for the taxpayer to subsidise commercial undertakings. However, the registration requirements of the GSCC are a different matter, which we have approached differently. Just before the hon. Gentleman intervened, I explained that we do not want to set fees at a level that will deter people from registering with the GSCC.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden referred to periodic fees. To some extent, the issue about how regularly periodic fees will be determined has not yet been resolved. Registration might be for a three-year period, in which case there might be a requirement to register every three years, when a periodic fee might be charged. Those are the sort of issues that we would want to discuss with employers and with the GSCC advisory group, which is helping with the preparatory work on the establishment of the capital. However, registration will not be a once and for all process; it will need to be periodically reviewed. That is consistent with our desire to ensure that the highest standards are maintained.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Earlier, the Minister made it clear that he well understands that some of the people who would be required to register are on relatively low incomes. I was concerned that the periodic fee should not be onerous for such people, and that it should not act as a deterrent to registration. I am satisfied that the Minister understands that, and that through consultation with the council, the Government will make judicious use of periodic adjustments of the requirement to pay a registration fee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<H4><center>Use of title "social worker" etc.</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'or a social care worker of any other description specified by the appropriate Minister under section 52(1)(b)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may also take amendment No. 353, in page 26, line 11, at end insert 'social care worker'.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> These are probing amendments. The purpose of the clause is to protect the title of social worker. In the current climate, protection of title is becoming increasingly important in all sorts of professions allied to health care and medicine. We understand the Govemment's desire to protect the title of social worker, especially because the preceding clauses set out well defined routes to becoming a social worker and will require potential social workers to make a considerable investment in their education and training on specified courses.
<P>
The Bill will also place new requirements on those who want to become social care workers. The definition of "social care worker" has been widely drawn and we have just debated all sorts of categories of people who will be included in the definition. Our purpose in seeking to include protection of the title "social care worker" is simply to be even-handed. We do not understand why that title should be regarded as second class. It should especially not be considered in that way because of the registration, vetting and other requirements that will become an integral part of someone taking up a social care worker job. The amendments are to discover the reason why the Government deem unnecessary the protection of that title even though protection of the title "social worker" is deemed necessary.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I find myself in the unusual position of arguing against the amendment. I would not like to misrepresent the position of the hon. Lady or her party, but in the main we have argued for regulation and for extending regulation and she and her colleagues have argued for narrowing the scope of regulations. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge might argue that his party has been consistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If the Minister will read into the record my sedentary interventions, they must be accurate. I said "consistency". We have always argued for consistency. However the Bill applies to one group should be the way in which it applies to all groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That argument is interesting. I wonder what the justification for it might be. We must be clear about the exercise of reserving job titles. We are associating a criminal sanction with the use of the term "social worker" for people not properly registered with the General Social Care Council. The step is an important one for Parliament to take. We are invoking the full weight of the criminal law on those who want to misrepresent themselves as professionally qualified social workers. We must do that carefully, having studied the arguments and the way in which the profession has developed around a recognisable core of professional qualifications. We can then take the step that we recommend to the Committee and to the House to preserve properly that job title.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important to preserve the title, not least because of the bogus social workers who knock at people's doors? I have had experience of that. For parents, having someone knock at the door, ask the child to remove their clothes and check for bruising when that person has no grounds for being there causes considerable distress, especially when the family is involved with social services. The full weight of the law should bear on people who take part in such activities. We should do all that we can to send a clear message that the offence is extremely serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point; I am glad that he has reminded the Committee of that practice. We know about that--all hon. Members will know of such cases. Sometimes, those cases have resulted in terrible consequences. Obviously, an exercise in preserving a job title will not stop the activity--we cannot do that. However, it can attract a penalty for those who choose to abuse the job title.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to develop my argument, I will give way soon, but I want to make an important point.
<P>
I started by saying that we have argued for regulation--the hon. Gentleman would not dispute that--and that he has been saying that regulation goes too far in many areas and that we should pause rather than make things over-burdensome and bureaucratic. Here, we have an example of the Opposition tabling an amendment that would extend substantially the concept of regulation to 1 million social care workers who currently have no recognisable professional qualification. The hon. Gentleman has provided no justification other than his argument about consistency. Of course, consistency is an admirable concept and should be applied in that way in regulation, but we must be discriminatory, especially if we are to apply the sanction of criminal law. The hon. Member for Meriden did not make the case for applying the criminal sanction.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> It would apply specifically to cases in which a bogus social care worker inserts himself into a domiciliary context because, more often than not, a crime will take place. There are examples in my constituency of the family silver being stolen by a bogus social care worker who has been put into a home by a domiciliary care agency. Our proposal would act as a deterrent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It may act as deterrent, but not for that particular practice. People who say that they are social care workers when they are not would attract a penalty. However, if we take the step of protecting job title and make it a criminal offence to abuse a job title, we must have a specifically identifiable group of workers who have developed a core professional range of qualifications and experience that the public identify as important and for which it is worth preserving the title.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden is envisaging social care workers as an identifiable and registered group under the Bill. However, I have a practical issue to raise. The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) described the dangers of impersonating social workers. We are dealing with vulnerable people. Does the Minister agree that there is a lot of scope for confusion in their minds about whether someone is a social worker or social care worker? A person who knocks on the door and says, "I'm the social care worker and I've come to look at you" when he is not a social care worker, will not be guilty of a criminal offence, but a bogus social worker who knocks on the door and says, "I'm the social worker and I've come to look at you". will be guilty of a criminal offence. That distinction might not be easily understood by the ordinary person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman has made a fair point, but he might want to refresh his memory by looking at subsection (1)(b) which refers to a person who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>takes or uses any title or description implying that he is so registered.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As a social worker.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, but he might use any title in the context of that misrepresentation. We need to be clear about the purpose of the amendment and whether there is a loophole for the group of workers that the hon. Gentleman described.
<P>
I apologise to the Committee if my argument has been presented laboriously, but I am trying to make an important point about when it is appropriate for Members of Parliament to attract criminal sanctions for the misuse of a particular title. We must be constructive and our actions must serve a purpose. One of the most important purposes in this context is to give proper recognition to the professionalism and expertise that has been developed in the social work profession. That is long overdue. We must ensure that the procedures are similar to those for people who describe themselves as dentists, doctors and so on.
<P>
I understand that the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Meriden might have a different view and want to extend the criminal sanction to give the 1 million-strong social care workers, such as home helps, a specific job title, but that would not be sensible. The hon. Member for Meriden is not right to say that if we do not extend protection of title, we would expose the public and service users to an unacceptably higher risk. The Bill's purpose is to provide for the first time a proper regulatory set of arrangements.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden referred to the concepts of the domiciliary care agency. If people who are unfit to work as domiciliary care workers are doing what she described, there is an obvious risk that the agency will lose its registration status. If it holds itself out as a registered agency, it would be committing an offence. A proper set of protections is built into the Bill to cover her examples. I am not sure of the wisdom of extending the criminal sanction. It would mean an extensive roll-out of the job title measures that we have identified as necessary. The hon. Lady did not convince me that if we failed to do that we would expose people to another set of unacceptable risks. Given the nature of the Bill and the measures that we propose, that could not happen. Introducing statutory protection of titles beyond professional social workers would not add greatly to those protections. It would be a step too far.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. Of course we understand that one purpose of the Bill is to raise the status of the profession of social work. By requiring the qualifications that it does, the Bill should be successful in achieving that aim. However, it lays many requirements on social care workers. What is the point of requiring them to register if they cannot be sanctioned for misusing their registered title? The criminal offence would apply only in cases of intention to deceive a most serious offence.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made a good point; an 80-year-old or 90-year-old person will have enormous difficulty distinguishing between a social worker and a social care worker. My father, who is 92, has all his faculties, but certainly would not make such a distinction. We understand the distinction because we have debated the Bill, but the majority of vulnerable adults will not--and certainly not on a door-knock. We want to tighten up the individual responsibility of registered people to use their titles correctly. I cannot see the logic of stressing the importance of the title without finishing the job.
<P>
The Minister said that agencies providing social care workers should take responsibility. The awful but practical fact of life is that although agencies such as Help the Aged have the best intentions and certainly do not intend to deceive, individual helpers may still mislead. We want to place the onus on those who are accorded the title of social care worker to use it wisely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend might also remind the Minister that, in amendment No. 352, we seek merely to give him the power to designate that specific groups of social care workers should have a protected title. We are not talking about the whole 1 million, but about those groups where there is a risk of abuse of title.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. He answers the Minister's point about as many as 1 million people being involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I did not refer to that part of the amendment, but it is an important point and I am glad that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has reminded us. If we are to apply a criminal sanction, it should be done in primary legislation, not, as suggested by the hon. Gentleman, in secondary legislation. He has banged on about the inappropriate use of secondary legislation. He now provides a perfect example of when it would be inappropriate.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The Minister's intervention reflects the fact that he understands the seriousness of our argument. The harsh reality is that such abuse happens; perhaps we should seek another legislative means to ensure that vulnerable people are better protected from those who pose as social care workers. We would then be rather more reassured that the Government understand how real the threat is, particularly to older people in a domestic setting. The Minister seems to think that we seek to extend regulation in an onerous way. As usual, we merely seek to be consistent, just as we sought consistency in the regulation of private and public health care establishments. Our wish has not yet been granted, but we still have not conceded the argument.
<P>
We seek reassurance that adequate criminal sanctions will apply to people who have misused the title of social care worker, to ensure that they can be identified. There should be a deterrence to prevent people from even thinking about such misuse in order to gain access to vulnerable people. I should like to be satisfied that the sanctions will be better than they are at present, or that the Government intend to do something in future to ensure adequate sanctions to protect the vulnerable people to whom social care workers have access. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 57 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 58</center></H4>
<H4><center>Codes of practice</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 355, in page 26, leave out lines 27 to 30.
<P>
The amendment would remove paragraph (b) of subsection (1). I question whether it is appropriate to include such a provision in the Bill, which is about care standards and is presented as dealing with the prevention of abuse and the quality of care. Paragraph (b), however, appears to deal with the rights and interests of employees rather than of the person who is cared for. We could have all sorts of debates about whether such provision is desirable and about the best forum for it, but it fits  uncomfortably into the Bill, which is all about protecting the rights of people who are cared for and regulating the way in which that care is administered. The provision seems wholly inappropriate in that context.
<P>
Paragraph (b) also fundamentally changes what we had understood to be the function of the General Social Care Council--to register people who are in positions of access to vulnerable people, in order to protect the latter. To require the council to lay down codes of practice that regulate the standards of conduct of employers of social care workers is a quite different function. I am not sure whether such a function is appropriate for a body that is, effectively, a quasi-governmental organisation that can be directed by the Minister and which is required to act in accordance with general guidance issued by him. Will the Minister reflect carefully on whether the Bill is the right place for such provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has read rather more into the clause than he should have done. It is not about providing a framework for employment rights. The code of practice could expect employers to follow procedures for ensuring that unsuitable people were not recruited to the social care work force. Such procedures could involve taking up references, investigating work histories and carrying out proper checks on criminal records, perhaps in relation to the Protection of Children Act 1999. Those are just some of the issues that could be covered by the code.
<P>
I am slightly perplexed that the hon. Gentleman has read quite so much into the clause. I understand that he and his party have some antipathy towards the concept of employment rights of any description, although that is perhaps an argument which, as he said, we should have on another occasion. I hope that I have reassured him about the types of issues with which the codes might deal and about the importance of at least some minimal provision in relation to them. We would all expect a responsible care employer to be working to such standards. In a previous debate, the hon. Member for Meriden referred to criminals from unsuitable domiciliary care agencies going into people's homes under false pretences. No one wants that to happen; the codes must bite, and employers must have the proper standards and procedures in place to ensure that they have responsible social care workers.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has nothing to fear from the provision and I remind him that, before the codes are issued, the council must carry out a full consultation on their content.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Just for the record, it is not correct to say that my party does not support employment rights. We have heard such words from the Minister and his colleagues before and they are not true. It is a question of striking a balance to ensure that the rights do not ultimately become self-defeating, which has happened in the past.
<P>
I feel about the proposals much as I do when I look at one of those complicated drawings: I cannot see the picture until someone explains what it is I am supposed to see; only then is it crystal clear. Now that the Minister has explained the intention of paragraph (b), I can see it clearly, although my previous reading was that it was about the rights and obligations of employers towards the social care workers whom they employed. I ask the Minister to consider whether a change in the wording of the paragraph will make his meaning clear, so that there is no danger of anyone else falling into the same trap. I cannot think of such a change, but it is only 90 seconds since the Minister spoke. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 356, in page 27, line 15, leave out paragraph (d).
<P>
The amendment would delete clause 59(3)(d), which allows the council to make rules about courses; paragraph (d) allows the council to restrict the number of persons who may participate in courses. That seems to be a crude power to regulate entry to the profession by quantitative rationing.
<P>
When the council is up and running, after the transitional phases, people will need a qualification to get a job. There will be a Government-backed body, the council, which sets the qualifications required and authorises and certifies those courses that meet the qualification requirements. However, paragraph (d) gives the same body the power to set the numbers of people allowed to participate in those courses. They will need a qualification to get a job, and will have to go on a course to get the qualification, but will be able to go on a course only if a quango says that they are allowed to do so. That seems to be a step too far. I do not understand why it is needed, but as the debate has degenerated into party political mud-slinging, I will say that, although the Government have no deep-rooted commitment to the operation of the free market, it is important to allow the labour market to work.
<P>
The paragraph is oppressive; it is potentially damaging to individuals, and will interfere with a person's right to pursue his livelihood as enshrined in the now infamous Human Rights Act 1998. The Minister should put himself in the position of someone who is doing work that as a result of registration requires qualifications. That person might be unable to take a course that will lead to those qualifications because of a limit on the number of people allowed to take the course. There is no reason for the paragraph. I await the Minister's explanation of why it is necessary and how he can be sure that it will not be oppressive to individuals who want to better themselves by obtaining qualifications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall try to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the proposal is not oppressive. The size of a course is a factor in the quality of training, and the provision will maintain the quality of the courses.
<P>
The structure and shape of professional social work courses should be considered in a wider context and the time may be right to look again at the relevant issues. The hon. Gentleman made some important points; I will think again about this part of the Bill and about whether the provision is needed. I believe that it is necessary in order to maintain the quality of courses; the hon. Gentleman's view was that the paragraph imposes a national cap on numbers. The proposal is designed to approve courses that will be the responsibility of the General Social Care Council; it will also ensure that centres and courses are viable and sustainable. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is no scope for such a provision, but it will need to be expressed differently--possibly. I shall think about his argument, although he has the wrong end of the stick about it. The proposal was drafted to ensure the quality and viability of courses rather than as a heavy-handed attempt to impose artificial ceilings on the numbers of social workers provided by the training establishments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's offer to reconsider the proposal. I do not necessarily disagree with his interpretation that the potential restriction is to maintain the quality of individual classes, ensuring that there are not hundreds of people in one group. That would be a legitimate matter for regulation by the council. However, my reading of the paragraph is that it refers to the number of people who may participate in aggregate in the courses.
<P>
The Minister said that the council will be able to make regulations about certain courses, but he needs to distinguish between a course and classes or study groups taking a course. Brooklands college in my constituency has a staggering number of students. It may have 600 people on its catering course, but that does not mean that all 600 are taught together. Nor does it imply that the quality is low. There may be 60 classes or groups for those 600 people.
<P>
The Minister has made a perfectly valid point that the council might want in the interests of quality to stipulate a maximum student-tutor ratio. However, that is not what the paragraph says.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman interprets the paragraph as if it refers only to a maximum, but it could easily refer to a minimum.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister talked about the viability of the course and suggested that the paragraph might stipulate a minimum. However, I am not sure that the wording of the paragraph--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as to the numbers of persons who may participate in courses--<P>

<P>
could be interpreted as defining a minimum. I would need to go away and wrap a cold towel around my head and think about that. A rule worded in that way clearly suggests a maximum figure. However, I take the Minister's comments in good faith, as we are not disagreeing about substance. He tells me that there is no intention of limiting the aggregate number of people on courses, but that it may be necessary to regulate individual numbers in a course or tuition group. I do not disagree with him but, speaking as a representative of an average person trying to interpret an Act of Parliament, I find the meaning of the paragraph unclear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The clause deals with qualifications gained outside the council's area, in other European Economic Area states. We should be willing to accept people with appropriate professional qualifications obtained elsewhere in Europe. We should also accept, at the outset, that qualifications gained in Europe by people working in these fields may be more developed than those in the United Kingdom. People with appropriate qualifications will be able to come and work here, although whether they will want to do so is questionable, given the pay levels in social care work.
<P>
The amendments would insert an additional requirement on the council to specify conditions. Subsection 1(a)(i) will require it to specify the necessary qualification,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>designated as having Community equivalence for the purposes of such registration.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subparagraph (ii) will allow the council to specify any other requirements that it may want to impose. Those requirements could include language, which is an important issue and should be mentioned in the Bill. People who come to this country to do social work should not only have the qualifications and the experience but be able to communicate with the people with whom they will come into contact.
<P>
The issue applies much more widely than social care because it applies also to health care staff and professionals. The provision is a minimum requirement; there might be requirements for languages other than English. Our amendments envisage the possibility that the Welsh Assembly, for example, in exercising its powers under the Bill, might wish to make specifications in regard to ability in Welsh as well as in English--I emphasise "as well as", which is the phrase used in the amendment. That would be the Assembly's prerogative; it might be a little narrowing of its recruitment potential across the European Economic Area. When I travelled a lot in Europe, I used to wonder why all the taxi drivers in Helsinki were Finnish--when many taxi drivers in other European capitals are not from the indigenous populations. Then I suddenly realised that it is because nobody else in the world can learn Finnish. The same may be true of Welsh.
<P>
The serious point is that communication is a vital tool in any area of social work or social care work and it is essential that people from the EEA, who are well qualified on paper and who are registered to work in Britain, have the necessary competence in English. I would write into the Bill a requirement for the council to set down the levels, and means of testing them, that it thinks appropriate to ensure that the people working in the field can communicate properly with the people for whom they care.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has dealt with the subject. I appreciate his positive approach to Europe and the possibility that he envisages of people from the European Union playing a strong role in our local economy. He recognised that powers allow councils in England and Wales to make rules about what is required of those seeking registration. They therefore have the flexibility to consider language as one such requirement. That provision also exists in the Bill. It is important that those registered by the council have sufficient knowledge of the language that will be used in the community in which they serve, to allow them to do their job. The clause already provides for the councils in England and Wales to impose requirements other than training on those applying for registration. The question is whether language should be included as one of those provisions. I would agree that it could, but that it is primarily for the local employer to make a judgment about language competence. The language competence required of social workers must be judged by local level, just as it must be decided locally what is required of social workers in the community that they serve. A social worker may require diverse language skills.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that Welsh is not a difficult language. My own three children are learning and growing up with Welsh. Many people in Wales are learning Welsh and it is used considerably more than in the past. Many people find it an interesting challenge to learn Welsh. Wales is already subject to the provisions of the Welsh Language Act 1993, which the hon. Gentleman's Government introduced. It places a duty on statutory bodies to prepare a Welsh language scheme, to be approved by the Welsh Language Board and setting out how those statutory bodies relate to services provided in Welsh. That will make certain that it is the responsibility of the statutory bodies as employers to ensure that their work forces have the language competence to communicate with and deliver services to local people through the medium of Welsh, should those people want to use it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge seems to recognise that the Bill provides for councils in England and Wales to make such provision. I hope that he will consider the matter and agree that employers should determine the needs of their communities locally. A range of languages, including, for example, Somali, Albanian and Welsh, might be used locally, and it is important that employers make that decision locally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Under-Secretary is making the different point that an employer will have particular and specific requirements for someone to be employed in his area. We are suggesting that requirements should be registered with the council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> That is true, but, ultimately, employers will determine whom they want to employ, and they will view that qualification accordingly. The powers of the Bill provide sufficient flexibility to ensure that, should councils want to specify employment and language as a key issue, they will have the power to do so. However, to specify that in the Bill as the hon. Gentleman proposes would be restrictive and counterproductive to the general aim of encouraging more applicants from mainland Europe to work in that part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am interested in the Under- Secretary's assertion that Welsh is not difficult to learn. He might be interested to learn that I worked in Wales for nearly five years, and to this day I cannot pronounce the name of the place in which I worked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) certainly had a great deal to learn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Anyway, reassured by what the Under-Secretary said, I may go back and have another crack.
<P>
The Under-Secretary need not worry about finding a Conservative Member who is not committed to the freedom of movement of labour, capital and goods in the European Union. Indeed, we regard that as the very essence of the EU and the reason why it can deliver real added value to the people of Europe. I am sure that you, Mr. Gale, would not appreciate it if I were to move into a wider debate on European matters. We are discussing an issue that relates to the freedom of movement of labour and making that work in practice; we all support that concept.
<P>
The Under-Secretary argued that language should be left for individual employers to decide. As I said in my intervention, specific language requirements may apply. He used Somali as an example; having stood as an unsuccessful candidate for Parliament in the constituency of Newham, North-East, I have personal knowledge of areas in which social workers would need to be able to speak Somali. Nevertheless, competence in the English language is a core skill that people must have in order to be on the register.
<P>
I accept the Under-Secretary's point that councils will have the power to require such a competency before registration, but I rather hoped that he might agree that it was sufficiently important to be specified in the Bill. Failing that, I hoped that he might give a clear sign that Ministers will expect the council to impose such a requirement through its powers under subsection (1)(a)(ii), and that they will if necessary use their powers of direction to ensure that the council imposes such a requirement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about revalidation. We shall need to explore the issue with the relevant national training organisation and local employers, and are carefully considering the professional training requirements of the social care work force. We are concerned, as is everyone, to ensure that the skills of the work force are regularly updated in relation to evidence, research, modern techniques and so on. I am probably not able to give the hon. Gentleman a specific answer today, as the work is still under way. I hope that some of the suggestions will be apparent in the near future.
<P>
As the Government do not in the main employ the work force, it will be best for revalidation of professional qualifications to be made in consultation with local employers by the Training Organisation for the Personal Social Services.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have a simple question. The amendment ascribes the functions to the appropriate Minister. Does it not seem as though the council might appropriately perform them, rather than their being one rung higher up the food chain and reserved for the Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We have considered that. I chose my words quite carefully. We have considered whether the function needs to be discharged by the General Social Care Council and have come to the view that it does not. There is no question that the work underpins the council's activities, but we intend to delegate the new powers to the employer-led organisation leading the training initiative in social care. That is the right line to draw as to where the responsibilities should lie.
<P>
We expect the national training organisation to work closely with the General Social Care Council in the development and exercising of the functions. Having considered the matter carefully, I am not convinced that the function necessarily has to be delivered by the General Social Care Council, and there is a strong argument for saying that an employer-led organisation such as the national training Organisation is the best body to carry out the work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the Minister's argument. However, it seems a shame that he has to take the powers back in order to delegate them. It would have been better if there had been a way to let the General Social Care Council delegate the function to the training organisation, but I suppose that there is an element of logic in what he says.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 354, in page 30, line 17, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'( ) The Assembly may authorise any person or the employees of any person to exercise the function of the Assembly under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would write a provision for Wales into the clause; drafting inaccuracies notwithstanding, it is intended to mirror the provision for England in subsection (4)(b). That subsection states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any functions of the Secretary of State under this section--
<P>
(a) may be delegated by him to the English Council; or
<P>
(b) may be exercised by any person, or by employees of any person, authorised to do so by the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision gives the Secretary of State a wide delegatory power.
<P>
Subsection (6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Assembly--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the body that has equivalent status to the Secretary of State, in respect of Wales--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may delegate to the Welsh Council any of its functions under this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to be equivalent to subsection (4)(a) but, when we look expectantly for subsection (6)(b), we discover that it does not exist. Although the Secretary of State in England may authorise a person other than the English council to exercise his functions, the Assembly in Wales cannot authorise a person other than the Welsh council in the same way. That difference does not seem readily explicable. The amendment would create symmetry between the provisions for England and Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I hope that I will be able to assist the hon. Gentleman by explaining our policy. The Government's broad intention is that, subject to any wider considerations arising from the devolution settlement in Wales, the Secretary of State and the National Assembly should have the same flexibility in carrying out their functions under this and other clauses. We are in the process of considering the drafting of the delegation of powers under the clause, which will enable the Secretary of State and the National Assembly to carry out their functions in the most effective way.
<P>
The Government are determined that the Department of Health and the National Assembly should be able to work closely and effectively together to promote better training for social care workers. We are keen that both councils should undertake to work closely together, and should do so alongside similar bodies that have been announced for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>
We are currently considering legal opinion about the best means of providing the flexibility that the hon. Gentleman seeks. We hope to table amendments later in the Committee's consideration of the Bill that will examine the points that he has raised. I hope that, on that basis, he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I might have been able to save the Government some money. I cannot see why they need to seek legal opinion when the words that they need are in subsection (4)(b), and were written by their own parliamentary draftsmen. They need only give the National Assembly the same discretion as the Secretary of State. His discretionary powers are set out with a view to his being able to delegate them to an independent sector body; that is the assumption that I read into the purpose of subsection (4)(b). I wonder whether there is a deliberate intention to exclude Wales from that possibility.
<P>
I did not find convincing the Under-Secretary's argument why the wording for Wales did not mirror that for England. However, he told us that the Government would address the issue later in the Committee's considerationa. That means that next week we may have the answer to my question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Possibly on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That was what I was trying to draw out of the Minister. He said that it would be later in the Committee's consideration. I was wondering how that would be possible. I am not terribly satisfied, but I shall await the Under-Secretary's amendment. Perhaps we will understand the difficulty when we see what the Government intend to do to put Wales on an equal footing with England. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
