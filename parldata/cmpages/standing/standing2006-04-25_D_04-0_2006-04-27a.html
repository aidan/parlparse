Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), whoI am pleased to see returning to his place, that says that we all knowof cases where stables on sleds are claimed to be temporary underplanning legislation but remain in place for years. I personally wasnot familiar with stables on sleds, but there are all sorts of ways ofconfusing the notion of things being temporary or permanent.

In other words,what is involved in getting the necessary consent, how long will ittake and what is the cost involved?</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div><a name="06042751000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000516"></a>JimKnight:</b> I am grateful for that question. Recently, anexcellent code of practice was published with endorsement from variousbodies including English Nature, the Countryside Agency, the NationalTrust and the Open Spaces Society. It sets out useful guidelines on howcontroversy can be minimised and co-operative working maximised whenphysical changes such as fencing on a common are being contemplated sothat that fast-tracking can occur. We will be considering andconsulting on whether the power in clause 43 should be used to exemptworks of any particular character from the clause 38controls.</div> <a name="06042751000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noted,for example, the comments from the hon. Member for Meirionnydd NantConwy (Mr. Llwyd) about restocking after foot and mouth disease andabout hefted flocks. It might be possible&#151;I do notknow&#151;to use clause 43 to make some exemptions.</div><a name="06042751000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally, we cannot sensiblyput fast-tracking on the face of the Bill. We want to ensure that theprocedures are appropriate and proportional. Views differ widely aboutwhether works are beneficial and a fast-track system per se mightamount to pre-judging the merits of an application and run the risk ofunfairly sidelining one of the those views. We hope that we have theright balance and that the use of the code of practice willhelp.</div><a name="06042751000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042751000517"></a><b class="B">Mr.Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I am grateful for theopportunity to serve under your chairmanship,Mr.Weir.</div> <a name="06042751000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to drawto the Minister&#146;s attention to a case just outside myconstituency, at Llynclys common in North Shropshire. An applicationwas made by the Shropshire Wildlife Trust, which manages part of thecommon, to erect fencing to protect biodiversity and to reintroducegrazing after the common had been under-grazed for a number of years.It took a total of three years to get the necessary consents, includingthe consent of the Secretary of State, and the process was eventuallycompleted in 1998. Obviously, it is conceivable that procedures havebeen speeded up in the past few years, but I have my doubts. Someguidance needs to be provided on the question of fast-tracking and howlong it will take in practice.</div><a name="06042751000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000518"></a>JimKnight:</b> I am certainly interested in such examples, wherethe delays and periods of time taken to process applications areunacceptable. My officials and I would want to ensure that we can dealwith such issues as speedily as possible. If controversy has beenminimised at the point of application, that makes things considerablyeasier and moreachievable.</div><a name="06042751000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042751000519"></a><b class="B">Mr.James Paice</b> (South-East Cambridgeshire) (Con): Before theMinister moves on to the last amendment in the group, which is slightlyseparate, I shall challenge him, having listened to what hesaid.</div> <a name="06042751000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Ministerdoes not seem to believe in any sort of de minimis situation, to repeata phrase that I used earlier. My right hon. Friend the Member forPenrith and The Border (David Maclean) referred to a temporary bit offencing to seal a hole in a wall during repair. Is it really theMinister&#146;s view that everything, apart from any exemptions thathe may come up with under clause 43, should go to the Secretary ofState? <div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>Fundamentally, I was trying to introduce a sense of proportion as towhich things must undergo the inevitable panoply of time andbureaucracy involved in going to the Minister or the Secretary ofState.</div><a name="06042751000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000520"></a>JimKnight:</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman&#146;sintention is sound. I agree that we need to make things as efficient aspossible. As I said before lunch, it is very unlikely that trivial orinsignificant works on commons would be regarded as contraventions ofclause 38 as it is worded, because it uses the same wording as section194 of the Law of Property Act 1925. During the last 80 years, we havefound that there is effectively some de minimis, and the courts are notwilling to take action if frivolous, minor pieces of work are broughttothem.</div><a name="06042751000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000521"></a>Mr.Paice:</b> But as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwysaid this morning, we do not want to find out whether the court willact on it. By the time such a case gets to the court because somebodyhas raised a complaint, the commons association or whoever did thatminimal work has gone to the huge cost of employing legal advice andrepresentation, not to mention the cost to the public purse oforganising the court. We are trying to avoid all that. Simply sayingthat the court will not listen to the complainant and will find againstthem rather than the person who did the work is not really the samething. We are trying to prevent that situation from arising in thefirstplace.</div><a name="06042751000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000522"></a>JimKnight:</b> I have no desire for people to go to court unlessthey need to. The balance of judgment is whether the Committee believesthat a great queue of people are waiting for the opportunity to reportlandowners to court for undertaking the most trivial of works, and thatwe therefore need to pin the matter down in legislation, or whether itbelieves that we need to keep our present flexibility and ther√(c)gime that has served for the past 80 years. To get into theproblems of defining words such as &#147;permanent&#148;, inrespect of fencing, puts the balance in the wrongplace.</div><a name="06042751000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042751000523"></a><b class="B">Mr.David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): I am now in thefortuitous position of having the National Trust briefing, which I didnot have earlier, so I have greater sympathy with what the hon. Memberfor South-East Cambridgeshire is trying to do. As the right hon. Memberfor Penrith and The Border said, the issue is the definition of&#147;permanent&#148;. I could be persuaded if there were a way todefine what is likely to be referred to the Secretary of State withoutusing the word &#147;permanent&#148;. That sounds as though itwould not allow any discretion, and I always prefer to avoid going tocourt. The Minister might be able to consider that. Surely a positioncan be arrived at between mine&#151;I want some greaterprotection&#151;and that of the Opposition, who want to allow work tobe done without going to somebody further up theline.</div><a name="06042751000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000524"></a>JimKnight:</b> A position can be arrived at. It can be arrived atby using clause 43. If we can identify a form of fencing, for example,that does not prejudice the open character of the commons but achievesthe sort of effect that we have discussed&#151;protectingbiodiversity or protecting people from falling down deep holes inCumbria&#151;it might be appropriate to <div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>make a blanket exemption through clause 43 for that sort of work. Thatis why I am talking about flexibility, which the clauseprovides.</div><a name="06042751000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000525"></a>Mr.Paice:</b><b class="B"> </b>Would that include the possibility of a timescale? Does the Minister envisage that clause 43 will exemptworks&#151;an electric fence, for example&#151;that is only therefor six months? Could a time scale be part of anexemption?</div><a name="06042751000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000526"></a>JimKnight:</b><b class="B"> </b>I can perhaps reflect on that, and get someadvice about it. You never know, I might come up with an answer beforetoo long, or by the time we come to clause 43, given that we are nowdiscussing clause 38. We shall see. We shall have time to have anotherlook at the matter when we have finished the Committeestage.</div><a name="06042751000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.56 is an ingenious proposal. I am tempted to say, &#147;Nicetry,&#148; but that would trivialise what I know is a seriousproblem, especially in respect of Travellers&#146; vehicles. Iimagine that the majority of Committee members would sympathise withthe wish to deal with such problems when they occur and powers are inplace to enable local authorities to tackle them. For example, localauthorities can make byelaws, which are regulated under the Inclosure Acts or use their own local Acts. They may even make use of the offenceagainst camping on urban commons under section 193 of the Law ofProperty Act 1925.</div> <a name="06042751000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amore recent measure, part V of the Criminal Justice and Public OrderAct 1994, especially sections 62A to 62D, also deals specifically withthe problem. Those provisions were inserted into the 1994 Act by theAntisocial Behaviour Act 2003 and create new powers and procedures fora senior police officer to remove such vehicles from the land inappropriate circumstances. Section 62D ensures that the powers areexercisable specifically on common land. They have been available sinceFebruary 2004 and I am sure that members of the Committee willencourage their local authorities to use them.</div><a name="06042751000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all want new measures to bein statute, but the problems arise when local authorities do not usethem. I am not enthusiastic about adding more measures if localauthorities are not using the existing legislationadequately.</div> <a name="06042751000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) raised the matter ofvehicles advertising things. I agree with the hon. Member forMeirionnydd Nant Conwy that it is probably a matter for the planningauthority and the planning r√(c)gime, and happily I am notresponsible for it.</div><a name="06042751000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for MeirionnyddNant Conwy also mentioned 4x4 vehicles. Works that present noimpediment to able-bodied people in trying to address the problem mightnevertheless impede the disabled; other works might impede horseriders, those exercising common rights and, dare I say it, even thosewho are lawfully allowed to drive on the commons. I argue that theclause as drafted ensures that all these issues are considered and donot get overlooked. However, perhaps someone will come up with aningenious device that will put a constraint on 4x4s if they are causinga problem and churning up the common, but allow the other users, whomwe want to <div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>be able to enjoy the commons, to do so. If such a device is found and isseen consistently to work, clause 43 can be used in that respect.Exemptions will be for minor and temporary works, so a time scale isinherent in the concept that lies behind clause 43. I hope that thathelps the hon.

That is so even if the timelimit for implementation of the permission is extended. I hope thatthat helps the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000527"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I shall not detain the Committee by going back over

amendments Nos. 54 and 55; we have probably gone as far as we can on

those two. I understand the Minister&#146;s points, but I hope that

we can find a way through clause 43 to ensure that we do not have to

have recourse to law to deal with what I would consider to be vexatious

or minimal issues&#151;those brought by somebody who has a bee in his

bonnet and wants to pursue it. It is all very well to say that the

courts do not have to find for the complainant; that is small comfort

for a defendant who has been caused a lot of trouble, inconvenience and

cost. Perhaps we can return to that under clause 43 or outside the

Committee. If we cannot, we will have to do so on Report, because

important issues arise from the temporary nature of some

actions.</div> <a name="06042751000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment

No. 56, which concerns Travellers, I am glad that the Minister did not

read out the first comment that he was going to make. That would have

trivialised an important situation. As one of many Members who have

such problems, I am very familiar with the legislation. It is easy for

a Minister to read out all the legislation that exists, but some of us

know that it does not work like that on the ground. The 1994 Act, which

my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border piloted

through the Committee stage as Minister of State in the Home Office,

made significant changes, and as shadow Minister for the police I was

instrumental in persuading the Government to make further changes in

the context of the Anti-social Behaviour Act

2003.</div><a name="06042751000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as common

law is concerned, the lord of the manor is still required to agree the

removal of Travellers before the police can do anything. That is often

the stumbling block, particularly if he is not easily contactable or,

for some reason, is unwilling to take action. I am simply trying to

underline the fact that the situation is illegal and there are still

serious issues to be addressed. At this very moment, there are commons

in my constituency that have Travellers on 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>them, and there are serious difficulties in removing them, despite all

the attempts to legislate. We should not trivialise the issue in any

way.</div> <a name="06042751000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a

good debate on an important matter, and there are further amendments to

be debated under this clause, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div>

<a name="06042751000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000530"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I will attempt to be brief. Normally, under clause

38, proposed works that would impede access to or over common land

would need the prior consent of the national authority. Such works

might include fencing, building, surfacing or earth works. Subsections

(6)(a) and (6)(b) exempt a particular type of work from that

requirement. Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are designed to emphasise the

fact that in order to be exempt in that way, works must be carried out

under a power conferred by or under an enactment&#151;for example,

those undertaken by a statutory board of conservators. Amendment No. 12

is consequential.</div>

<a name="06042751000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 11 relates to

commons management schemes made under the Metropolitan Commons Act 1866

or the Commons Act 1899. Essentially, such schemes give conservators in

the first case, or district councils in the second, powers to manage

commons for public benefit. Clause 38(6)(c) exempts works authorised

under such schemes from national authority consent unless consent is

required by the scheme itself. Since drafting we have discovered that

existing schemes are not consistent in the way that they treat

particular types of work such as erecting buildings, so the amendment

makes the position on consent consistent across such cases. Amendment

No. 13 is a technical amendment to put it beyond any doubt that, as for

consents under the current works control regime, clause 38 consent is

free-standing and does not affect other rights or constraints that may

have a bearing on the lawfulness of the works

proposed.</div><a name="06042751000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000533"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> This group follows on from the group that we were

discussing a few moments ago. The intention is the same. It is not to

undermine the role of the national authority but to minimise

unnecessary intervention and bureaucracy in order to speed up the

process of management of the commons. I have no doubt that the Minister

will again refer us to clause 43; as it has no amendments, we may have

a long debate on that clause when we reach it. I am seeking to amend

subsection (6), as opposed to subsections (2) and (3) in the previous

group. I confess to being at somewhat of a loss as to the difference

between this and clause 43. Subsection (6) states:</div>

<a name="06042751000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The prohibition in

subsection (1) does not apply to&#148;</div>

<a name="06042751000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d). Clause

43 also lists circumstances where clause 38 is not to apply. I am not

too sure what the distinction is: I might just as well have tabled

these amendments to clause 43.</div>

<a name="06042751000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The four amendments address key

areas. Amendment No. 57 is straightforward. It may well

happen&#151;indeed, it is probably desirable&#151;that a statutory

commons association makes an agreement with a public body, probably

Natural England or the Countryside Council for Wales. The purpose of

the amendment is to facilitate the carrying out of works under such an

agreement. An agreement with a public body should be sufficient to give

the works the go-ahead. Amendment No. 58 applies where a statutory

commons association believes that an action is necessary for the

welfare of animals. Amendment No. 60 seeks to insert a similar phrase

in clause 43.</div> <a name="06042751000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

House is always concerned about the welfare of animals. Even with the

speeded-up process and the codes of practice, sometimes actions

necessary to assist the welfare of animals need to be carried out very

quickly. Whatever system is in place, it will not always be quick

enough. Therefore if it is felt that a measure is needed to protect

animals&#151;predominantly grazing animals, but it may be wild

animals&#151;a decision of the statutory commons association should

be sufficient.</div>

<a name="06042751000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 59 comes back to

the point raised by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy a few

moments ago and which I mentioned in Second Reading. It is the issue of

unlawful access of vehicles on to the common. I heard what the Minister

said about disabled access. Obviously none of us wants to effectively

debar the disabled from accessing commons in their appropriate

vehicles. However, the Minister knows full well that there are a number

of commons with serious problems of incursion. That might be illegal

and the Law of Property Act 1925 might say that a person should not go

more than 10 m off a highway, but we know that it happens. There are

times 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>when the only way to stop that happening is to erect what some people

call &#147;tank traps&#148; and &#147;ditches&#148; and all

sorts of other impediments to vehicular access to a common. That has

nothing to do with the right to roam or people walking and enjoying

their rights of common, but relates to people taking vehicles on to the

common, which is often to the detriment of other users.</div>

<a name="06042751000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will

go away and think in more detail about the matter because there needs

to be provision for such measures when local people agree that it is

necessary in order to protect the rights of the vast

majority&#151;the legal users of the common, whether they be holders

of commons rights, walkers or anybody else who wishes to access the

common lawfully.</div><a name="06042751000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

hope that the Minister will understand that the amendments are designed

to be constructive and helpful, to reduce bureaucracy and to assist

works that protect our commons, rather than those that hinder them. I

hope therefore that he will look favourably upon, if not the fine

detail, at least the principles behind them, particularly on the issue

of unlawful vehicular access. I hope that he will agree to go away and

reflect further, because clearly I am not the sole proponent of that

view.</div><a name="06042751000098"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000534"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I have always reflected carefully on everything

that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire says, and I will

continue to do so.</div><a name="06042751000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Gentleman asked about the distinction between the exemptions under

clause 38 and those under clause 43. Under clause 38, those exemptions

are automatic&#151;the regime will not apply, per se&#151;whereas

clause 43 provides the national authority with the power to exempt

particular categories of works by order subject to the negative

resolution procedure. I hope that that helps to set out the

difference.</div><a name="06042751000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause

38(6) gives a global exemption from consent only to works carried out

under statutory powers. Those must relate to either the common in

question or common land in general. For example, such powers might be

exercised by a board of conservators, a local authority or a statutory

undertaker. Works carried out or organised by a commons association

using powers conferred under the Bill are excluded specifically from

the exemption because commons associations are not required or even

intended to be fully representative bodies, as was discussed on Tuesday

during our deliberations on the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the

Member for Stroud. Often they represent only those with a legal

interest in the land because of the limited nature of the functions

that can be conferred on them under part 2 of the Bill.</div>

<a name="06042751000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be inappropriate for

the Bill to give commons associations carte blanche to undertake

particular types of works on a common because they are not fully

representative. For example, management agreements might envisage

extensive lengths of fencing to separate areas of different grazing

intensity, but it would not be right for the Bill to rubber stamp such

works by associations if they would impede access to a common, or to

allow them to make agreements that rely on such works. Those proposed

works should receive the same scrutiny as they would if they were

proposed by the owner of the land.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div><a name="06042751000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">On animal welfare and vehicular

access, the examples given in this debate and elsewhere of why certain

works might be needed for animal welfare reasons reinforce, to my mind,

the need for such works to receive careful scrutiny. For example, using

fencing to channel animals away from recreational hot spots, or to keep

them from straying on to roads could have a significant and

long-lasting effect on the open and unenclosed nature of commons about

which I talked. Proposed work on shelters or feed stations for animals

is of a scale and significance that should receive proper scrutiny

through the consent r√(c)gime and I am resistant to doing anything

that threatens animal

welfare.</div><a name="06042751000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30

pm</div><a name="06042751000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I responded

earlier to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy on vehicle access

and there is not much to add. I questioned my officials when I had read

the briefing from the Country Land and Business Association which

mentions tank traps. I am satisfied that it will be possible to use

clause 43 as and when such devices come forward so that they do not

prejudice disabled horse riders and others who want legitimate access.

I hope that the Committee will be equally

satisfied.</div><a name="06042751000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall

resist amendment No. 60 for similar reasons. We intend to consult

widely on whether and how we should use the power in clause 43 to

exempt particular types of work from the regime, but we are clear, as I

said earlier, that we will use it only in relation to minor or

temporary work. The sort of work that the hon. Gentleman has in mind is

significant and potentially controversial in its effect on a common and

its use by others. As I said, such work needs proper scrutiny and I

hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his

amendment.</div><a name="06042751000105"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000535"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I will not prolong the Committee&#146;s

consideration. I have made my points and the Minister understands that

there is concern on the Opposition Benches about the general impact of

clause 38 on sensible measures that people may feel are necessary and

about the need to reduce what appears to be a massive sledgehammer to

crack a nut: having to go to the Secretary of State for approval for

virtually everything. That is what we are trying to remove.</div>

<a name="06042751000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that the Minister

will have caused further debate on clause 43. We may return to some of

the issues then and, I suspect, on Report. In the meantime, I beg to

ask leave to withdraw the

The protection of common land and town andvillage greens is an important matter for all the reasons that havebeen discussed. For various reasons, it is sometimes difficult toprotect such land from inappropriate development. For example, theowner may be absent or uninterested in the land, or the land may be soremote that development can occur on it without the appropriateauthorities being aware of it from the beginning. It is for that reasonthat the Government have introduced this part of the Bill, which dealswith the protection of common land and town and villagegreens.</div><a name="06042751000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intentionof the amendment is to make such double protection even more effectiveand efficient. Almost all of clause 40 deals with things that must beincluded in regulations, and we would like to add that the nationalauthority should alert the local planning authority of potentialdevelopments so that it can take action to ensure that a planningapplication is solicited if one is needed for the work, or at leastkeep an eye on the land on which the development isproposed.</div><a name="06042751000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The secondpart of the amendment, which would require the planning authority togive notice, would make the most of the double protection that theGovernment want in the Bill. I hope that the Minister sees fit toaccept the amendment so that the requirement can be included inregulations and make the most of the intendedsafeguards.</div><a name="06042751000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I drawattention to a golf course that appeared on Cilsanws common, which isin a constituency that neighbours mine. It is causing considerableproblems to the commoners and the people who live around the common.Somehow, it appeared without planning permission or permission undersection 194 of the Law of Property Act. My amendment may not befoolproof, but it would contribute in some way to safeguarding againstcompletely illegaldevelopments.</div><a name="06042751000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">As theMinister knows, it is always more difficult for a borough, nationalauthority or local planning authority to deal with a development afterit has been completed, as they must go through the process ofenforcement, appeals and goodness knows what. It is better to deal withit before it happens, and my amendment would in some way contribute toa more effective process andsystem.</div><a name="06042751000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000543"></a>Mr.Dunne:</b> I rise briefly to support my hon.

I am grateful to him for referring to my previousintervention in support of it.</div><a name="06042751000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point to the Minister isthat most amendments to common land management procedures are connectedto the growing cycle. The improvement of biodiversity and the reseedingof ground where grass needs to be replaced happen over not weeks ormonths, but an entire growing season. If we miss the growing season oneyear, it is one year later before we can start to take the measuresneeded. Putting pressure on the statutory authority to accelerateapplications is vital; otherwise those problems will persist for yearafter year.</div><a name="06042751000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000544"></a>JimKnight:</b> We have no problem with the spirit of amendmentNo. 66. We agree about the desirability of improving timing andstreamlining, but clause 40 contains the powers necessary to prescribethe procedures and timing that must be adhered to when works on commonsare proposed. Equally, we can issue guidelines on timings if weconclude that that is more appropriate. We will consider the issues indetail and consult publicly about how we intend to operate the system.I hope that that provides the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshirewith the reassurance that he seeks.</div><a name="06042751000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid that we will alsoresist the amendment tabled by the hon. Members for Brecon andRadnorshire (Mr. Williams) and for North Cornwall. The first aspect ofthe amendment is unnecessary, because regulations under clause 40(2)(f)on the steps to be taken by the national authority on receipt of anapplication would require it to tell the planning authority ifappropriate. We intend to consult fully on the content of thoseregulations, and that will provide us with the opportunity to put thatcase.</div> <a name="06042751000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The secondaspect of the amendment would require the planners to tell theauthority and others about planning applications for commons andgreens, but that would not be an appropriate legal requirement. Localplanning authorities must decide, with due regard to planninglegislation and guidance, what action to take on receipt of planningapplications and how to determine them.</div><a name="06042751000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend to issue to localauthorities guidance on the implementation of this legislation. Iexpect the guidance to draw planning authority attention to the issuesthat arise when development is proposed on a common&#151;perhaps toavoid the bizarre example from the hon. Member for Brecon andRadnorshire of a golf course on a common for which there was nopermission. Having said that, I do not want to comment on an individualcase.</div> <a name="06042751000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I expect theguidance to draw planning authority attention to those issues, becauseof the special protections that apply to commons. Commoners' rights overmany commons and some greens must not be prejudiced by any development.The sheep must be protected from the golf ball. I hope that, on thatbasis, the hon. Gentleman will not press hisamendment.</div><a name="06042751000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000545"></a>Mr.Williams:</b> I am not satisfied with the Minister&#146;sresponse. I am sorry to have caused him physical inconvenience at thisstage of the debate, but it is important to put in place as muchprotection as we can <div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>for these precious national treasures. I am therefore tempted to pressfor a vote, and I intend to do so.</div><a name="06042751000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000546"></a>Mr.Paice:</b> I moved the lead amendment, and I did not expectthe Minister to accept it&#151;surprise, surprise. However, Iunderstand what he said, which was that, under clause 40, he will beable to introduce in the regulations some points about timings.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000563"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> The amendment, which would place a duty on local

authorities is reasonable, and would improve the Bill. The question is

whether they have the necessary money and expertise to take enforcement

action. I understand the principle, and it is a good

idea.</div><a name="06042751000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to

ask the Minister one or two questions, given that we did not succeed in

the attempt to bring proportionality into clause 38 by inserting the

word &#147;materially&#148; to avoid de minimis cases. The

enforcement duty for infringements will lie with county councils, local

authorities and parish councils. That will open it up to every person

on the street. It is to be hoped that people will not use the law for

the wrong reasons or pursue minor infringements such as the use of

temporary pens for collecting sheep, butts for shooting and so on. That

is a danger.</div><a name="06042751000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

had this debate twice before, and I do not want to delay matters. The

Minister says that the county court will not make an order, but getting

that far is a waste of the court&#146;s time and everybody&#146;s

money. It is undesirable that the Bill should leave an avenue open for

people to take what might well be vexatious action for whatever

reason&#151;they might have a personal grudge; I do not know. I am

concerned about the provision, because it could be

misused.</div><a name="06042751000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second

question for the Minister is whether, having given individuals the

right to litigate by taking such matters to court, the clause would

enable them to take enforcement action against perceived existing

breaches as well as future ones. I can anticipate his 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>response to my first question, because we have been over that ground,

but I should like him to respond to my second question about whether

the clause would cover existing

breaches.</div><a name="06042751000168"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000564"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I will think about that last point while I deal

specifically with amendment No. 78, which would place a duty on commons

registration authorities to resist encroachment on common land. I am

grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud for tabling

it.</div> <a name="06042751000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill goes

some way toward improving controls on works on common land. It will

clarify the application of the controls, modernise the consent regime

and, as we heard, enable any person to enforce against unlawful works.

It will no longer be possible to ignore the controls in the hope that

they will not be

enforced.</div><a name="06042751000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have

said, I want Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales to

become the Government&#146;s champions for the management and

well-being of common land. We see a role for them in encouraging

communities to take a more proactive attitude to protecting their

common

land.</div><a name="06042751000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Registration

authorities, in common with other councils, will have power to enforce

against encroachments, but my hon. Friend will appreciate our position

on the matter. A local authority&#146;s priorities are for the

authority, and not central Government, to decide. It is appropriate to

give the power but not the duty.</div>

<a name="06042751000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is not just a

legislative instrument. It will raise the profile of common land. We

will be working closely with local government in the next few years to

implement the legislation, assuming that it becomes an Act. That will

involve issuing circulars explaining authorities&#146; powers as well

as their duties under the Act and encouraging their greater involvement

in the management of common

land.</div><a name="06042751000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I counsel my

hon. Friend against seeing new duties necessarily as a solution to a

problem. I am sure that he shares my desire to see greater access to

the countryside, but duties alone are not always fulfilled, as we have

seen with the management of the public rights of way network by certain

local highway authorities in certain parts of the country. It is only

as a result of a combination of new duties&#151;such as rights of way

improvement plans, together with guidance and a great deal of hard work

by, in the case of England, the Natural England partners and the

Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in raising the

profile of rights of way in the past few years&#151;that we are now

seeing results in making the network better available for use. I want

to see a similar effort made to raise the status of common

land.</div><a name="06042751000174"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000565"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I understand what my hon. Friend is saying.

Obviously, I shall not be pressing the amendment to a Division, but I

am interested in the difference between someone who blocks a common and

someone who blocks a road. A local authority has a duty to keep the

highway open as, incidentally, do members of the public, who operate

under a power if they see someone blocking the highway for whatever

reason. The clause is really about consistency and making sure that

local authorities do what they should 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>do. As we know from previous debates, there are cases where, because of

the parking of a vehicle or some other reason, a local authority can

choose to do nothing. That is just not

acceptable.</div>

<a name="06042751000175"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000566"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> There are all sorts of rights of way and local

authorities make their judgments about the blockages on them. If it is

a busy highway, they are more likely to take action than if it were a

quiet footpath. They exercise their duties with discretion, and that is

my point. Therefore, I can not accept the amendment, but I hope that my

hon. Friend will accept that the Bill takes us into a new era for

common land. I am confident that, in future, the profile of common land

will be much higher and the controls far less likely to be breached

with impunity. We all have a role in encouraging local authorities to

use their powers in the public interest and I know that all members of

the Committee are keen to protect and enhance our commons.</div>

<a name="06042751000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">With respect to the comments

made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy about retrospective

enforcement against existing unlawful works, there was significant

debate in the other place where views on both sides were expressed. We

amended the Bill on Third Reading in the other place to prevent any

person from taking enforcement action against unlawful works before its

introduction. Local authorities and the legal interest in the land

remain able to enforce against such works within the normal time

limits. On reflection, we do not feel that it is fair to extend

retrospectively the scope for enforcement in that situation. I see the

hon. Gentleman nodding and therefore hope that my explanation is

sufficient. I ask him not to press the

amendment.</div><a name="06042751000177"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000567"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I am concerned that, under clause 42, power will be

granted to local registration authorities to amend existing schemes of

work. Although we have to be careful that we are not allowing a

diminution of the responsibility of local authorities, I beg to ask

leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06042751000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000573"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Again, these are technical amendments, which I do

amendment.</div><a name="06042751000193"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000574"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I shall be quicker on my feet in future. They used

to say that when I played football.</div>

<a name="06042751000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 81 is intended to

probe the Government by examining the powers to override existing

schemes of management, which links directly with what I said about

clause 41. I want to probe what the Government intend as the normal way

of doing 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>things. The amendment would ensure that the appropriate national

authority cannot override an absolute prohibition of works contained in

an existing scheme of management.</div>

<a name="06042751000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schemes of management are

important because they are the existing way in which things have been

done and it would be wrong if the Bill superseded schemes that are

already working well. Where they are not working well, I hope that Bill

will give them a kick up the backside and make them improve.</div>

<a name="06042751000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is somewhat sad that the

clause appears to weaken the way in which existing schemes of

management operate and I am looking for the Minister to assure me that

that is not the intention. Where long-standing schemes&#151;I could

list them, but I shall not&#151;are extant and deserve recognition,

they do not need alteration. I hope that he will assure me that the

Government&#146;s intention is not to disrupt some of these schemes

that go back a long way in history and work very

successfully.</div><a name="06042751000197"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000575"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Clause 42, as a whole, applies to land covered by

an existing management scheme under either the Metropolitan Commons Act

1866 or the Commons Act 1899. Where the terms of such a scheme prohibit

works without any scope for any person to consent to them, the clause

allows such works if they receive consent under clause 38. Where such a

scheme provides that works are permissible with the consent of the

national authority, consent has to be given under the criteria set out

in clause 38. These measures are designed to increase flexibility while

improving consistency.</div>

<a name="06042751000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall resist my hon.

Friend&#146;s amendment because it would be a retrograde step. The

whole point of subsection (3) is to avoid an absolute ban under an

existing scheme on works on a common that would be beneficial, for

example, by helping visitors to enjoy the common. This is not a matter

of covering scheme commons with major new developments or removing

people&#146;s access rights. Rather, it is a matter of having the

ability to do something if it is appropriate for the land, taking into

the account all the checks and balances that the consenting scheme

system involves and all the views expressed to the national authority

on the subject. We do not want to shut down that new flexibility and I

hope that my hon. Friend will not seek to press his amendment to a

Division.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000577"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> It is a great clause.</div>

<a name="06042751000209"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000578"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> It may be a great clause, but I want to invite the

Minister to explain, briefly, why that is. Without rehashing the ground

that we have already covered, I should like to make two points. The

first is that the Minister said earlier that the clause is specifically

intended for minor and temporary works; that is its purpose. It does

not say so anywhere, so I invite him to clarify that point. If that is

the intention of the clause, should it not say so?</div>

<a name="06042751000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second point is that

subsection (1), which defines the orders, makes a lot of specific

statements about</div> <a name="06042751000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

carrying out by a specified person of specified works on specified

land; or...by a specified person, or a person of a specified

description, of works of a specified

description,&#148;</div><a name="06042751000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so on.

The orders are going to be so specific that one wonders whether they

will be of any value for exemptions. Officials of the national

authority will have to do so much work looking at such a proposal to

decide whether to exempt it that they might as well approve it. I had

understood from the Minister&#146;s interventions under clause 38

about this clause that it would deal with the problems that Opposition

Members have mentioned, rather than unnecessarily requiring the

national authority to deal with piffling&#151;the Minister himself

used the word trivial&#151;issues.</div>

<a name="06042751000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">As drafted, the clause does not

achieve the objective that the Minister has proclaimed for it. I accept

and support his remarks, but they do not reflect what clause 43 says. I

suggest that, by the time officials have done all the work described in

the clause in order to decide whether to exempt any work, the time,

bureaucracy and cost&#151;not just to the taxpayer but to the

applicant&#151;will have been so great that they might as well have

gone through the approval procedure. That was the straightforward point

that I wanted to make. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s trying

to clarify it for

us.</div><a name="06042751000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042751000579"></a><b class="B">Paddy

Tipping</b> (Sherwood) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman is right to

say that we need to clarify the point. This morning, under clause 38,

the Minister was clear about the use of the words

&#147;temporary&#148; and &#147;minor&#148;. I am keen to get

that on the record. The problem is that we could have different views

about the meaning of temporary and minor. I take temporary to mean

weeks and months, rather than years. I have seen 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>applications from bodies that are called temporary, but stretch into

years. It would be useful to have an idea about what is considered

temporary. We also need to discuss what constitutes minor.</div>

<a name="06042751000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning, the right hon.

Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) gave a number of

examples of things that were clearly temporary, and the Minister told

us that electric fencing would not be viewed as temporary. He is right.

In many cases, clause 38 should be used. However, in response to the

hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, he said that tank traps could

be regarded as temporary. I am not sure that that is correct. We are

talking about matters of judgment. I agree with the hon. Member for

South-East Cambridgeshire that the measure will create a lot of work, a

lot of difficulty and a lot of angst. It is in our interests to be as

clear as we can about what the clause stands for and what we mean by

temporary and minor.</div>

<a name="06042751000215"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000580"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> On a point of information and to try and enlighten

the Committee, I should say that the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy

Tipping) is quite right: we should tease out a bit more information on

this issue. On the main road between Dolgellau and Bala, in my

constituency we had temporary traffic lights for 27

years.</div><a name="06042751000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042751000581"></a><b class="B">David

Maclean</b> (Penrith and The Border) (Con): I want to return

to the point about minor works and fencing. It is not fanciful; almost

every day of the week in the Cumbrian fells and around the country,

gaps appear in stone walls and six ft of wall falls down. Every farmer

then automatically sticks a little bit of electric fencing or sheep

netting on it. Under clause 38, they would have to apply for permission

for that temporary fencing.</div>

<a name="06042751000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister says, &#147;No,

don&#146;t worry; clause 43 can exempt that sort of thing&#148;,

but will he confirm that clause 43 is general enough to exempt all

farmers in that hypothetical situation, or would the farmer who has

found a gap in his wall have to get a specific order to be exempted

from the provisions of clause 38? I shall assume that none of us wants

a farmer who puts up five yards of fencing for six weeks to have to go

to the Secretary of State for an exemption.</div>

<a name="06042751000218"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000582"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Generally, if a wall is bounding the

common&#151;on the perimeter, as is often the case&#151;it is not

part of the common, but the surrounding farm land. Therefore, the

farmer can do what he likes with it. Obviously it is a different ball

game if it is inside the

common.</div><a name="06042751000219"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000583"></a>David

Maclean:</b> There will be a mixture and many walls will be

inside the common. Cumbria is awash with walls; it is still a common,

but there are walls across the parish boundary and temporary walls are

used to hold sheep, particularly at lambing time.</div>

<a name="06042751000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">On walls inside the common that

are caught by the provision, will the Minister reassure the Committee

that clause 43 will allow him to make a general order? He might be

persuaded before Report that there is a genuine problem relating to the

temporary stopping up of a hole in a stone wall with a fence. He might

think, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>&#147;Yeah, that&#146;s okay, that is smaller enough, de minimis,

minor and is not going to drive a coach and horses through the law; I

am happy to allow that&#148;. Under clause 43, will he be able to

make general regulations that will apply to every farmer or commoner in

the

country?</div><a name="06042751000221"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000584"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is talking about stopping

up walls, but maintenance to existing works does not need

consent.</div><a name="06042751000222"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000585"></a>David

Maclean:</b> We are narrowing it down, but what happens when

all the stones have fallen down and there is a gap in the wall, which

the farmer plugs with a temporary fence while he spends the next few

weeks sticking the stones back up and rebuilding the wall with the

intention of doing a bit a dry stone walling or dry stane dyking? Is

that maintenance? It is the erection of a fence, not

maintenance.</div><a name="06042751000223"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000586"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> My interpretation is that that would be

maintenance because the farmer would not be erecting anything new or

substantial while he maintains the wall. If I am wrong, I shall write

to the right hon. Gentleman, but I am pretty sure that that would be

the

case.</div><a name="06042751000224"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000587"></a>David

Maclean:</b> I am grateful for that; we are getting some

elucidation, but still dodging the point. The regulations that can be

made under clause 43 are specific to individuals and commoners who have

to come along and ask for an exemption. If the Minister finds another

category of minor works that he thinks is perfectly okay to exempt

under clause 38, such as fencing, it does not seem that clause 43 would

provide the power to make that general exemption apply to everyone of a

particular category. It seems that, under clause 43, he can make an

exemption only once someone applies and goes through all the procedure

to get that exemption and become a specified person with a specified

works in a specified area. Will he be able to make general exemption

powers apply to everyone without their having to

apply?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000588"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I briefly endorse the comments made by my hon.

Friend and by the hon. Member for Sherwood. I would like also to

highlight two particular

problems.</div><a name="06042751000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems

unnecessary to burden commons associations with the cost of providing

the input to enable an order on perhaps minor issues to be written in

such specific language. The bureaucratic processing of all those orders

would also increase costs in the Minister&#146;s Department and

should not be treated lightly, not least if he hopes to meet his

Gershon efficiency

targets.</div><a name="06042751000227"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000589"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am grateful for this debate because it helps to

clarify matters. I was asked by the hon. Member for South-East

Cambridgeshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood to clarify

that we regard the provision as being for minor and temporary 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>works. We do regard it as such, and I shall look at whether it is

appropriate to put that in the clause title. However, for now, I can

give the clarification that the Committee

seeks.</div><a name="06042751000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have been

other questions about the clause being too specific. There is a danger

that because the word &#147;specified&#148; is repeated so many

times in subsection (1), one becomes blinded to some of the other

words. Subsection (1)(a) is very specific; it uses the word

&#147;specified&#148; three times. However, it ends with the word

&#147;or&#148; before moving on to subsection (1)(b), which starts

with &#147;a specified person&#148;, but then becomes more general

by referring to</div>

<a name="06042751000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or a person of a

specified description, of works of a specified description

on&#151;</div><a name="06042751000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">(i) any

land; or</div><a name="06042751000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">(ii) land of

a specified

description.&#148;</div><a name="06042751000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,

that allows us to issue exemptions to categories of works, rather than

applying, as does paragraph (a), to specified persons doing specified

works on specified land. I hope that that helps the

Committee.</div><a name="06042751000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend the Member for Sherwood talked about tank traps. As I said to

the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, the Country Land and

Business Association made an interesting point about tank traps.

However, I said also that if we could find a suitable device, we might

think about it. However, I am not sure that a tank trap is that device.

I hope that that is

helpful.</div><a name="06042751000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000592"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> Six of these amendments are in my name, but

amendment No. 104 is in the name of the hon. Member for Brecon and

Radnorshire. I shall let him have all the fun of mentioning every

common that might need to be included because its ownership is not

clear. I shall stick to amendments Nos. 82 to 84, which are technical,

and then say a little about amendments Nos. 85 to

87.</div><a name="06042751000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 82

to 84 try to clarify exactly what we would expect of a local authority

when there is no known owner and a clear need for works to be done or

stopped. This series of amendments is necessary to identify sites of

special scientific interest that are in an unfavourable condition and

it would force local authorities to take responsibility for that common

land.</div> <a name="06042751000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although

amendment Nos. 82 and 83 simply change &#147;may&#148; to

&#147;shall&#148; and amendment No. 84 includes &#147;may&#148;

elsewhere, they seek clarification from the Government. There seems to

be a vacuum in responsibility for the protection of common land with no

clear ownership. After all, it is in the public interest for such land

to be protected. Again, this is a matter for which local authorities

should be duty bound. I understand what my hon. Friend said earlier

about the relationship between duties and powers, and I intend to push

that issue. However, unlawful interference is not uncommon, and it is

too easy for local authorities to say that they do not have any

responsibility. They certainly do not have the means.</div>

<a name="06042751000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments Nos. 85 to 87,

the Government suggested that section 9 of the Open Spaces Act 1906 can

be used to acquire unclaimed land. The difficulty is that section 9

allows purchase only by agreement, and that is not possible if the

owner is unknown. Other statutes provide compulsory powers. For

instance, there is section 89 of the National Parks and Access to the

Countryside Act 1949, and schedule 2 to the Compulsory Purchase Act

1965, which includes an untraceable owner procedure that requires

obtaining a valuation, paying it into court and then obtaining a

vesting order.</div> <a name="06042751000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

essential that we find a mechanism for local authorities to deal with

the problem of land that has no clear ownership. Section 8 of the

Commons Registration Act 1965 allows for such a mechanism with regard

to village greens. The mechanism is not nearly as clear for common

land. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to clear that up. I also

support the hon. Member for North Cornwall, whom I am sure will explain

why we tabled amendment No. 104.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div><a name="06042751000246"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042751000593"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Dan Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I wish to speak to

amendment No. 104, which is tabled in my name and those of my hon.

Friends and the hon. Member for Stroud. In the same spirit as the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s amendments, this amendment is about the local

authority taking action where land is not in the state that we would

like to see. In many areas, the problem is that unclaimed land is used

for purposes that are a nuisance to the local community. The

landis not brought up to the standard that we

wouldlike for environmental purposes, for maintaining

archaeological features, or for ensuring that it is a useful amenity

for the community and that it is used as it was originally intended.

Our amendment seeks to ensure that a local authority would exercise

powers in the absence of a commons association and take action, so that

those issues could be resolved to the benefit of the local community

and those who enjoy the land.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000594"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member

for Stroud and the hon. Member for North Cornwall would go further than

clause 45 permits and impose a duty on local authorities to take

action. As my hon. Friend said, we recently discussed the issue of

duties and powers, and I shall not dwell on it. Authorities should

retain the discretion to act, and they should be responsive to local

priorities and electors.</div>

<a name="06042751000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, it would be quite

wrong to compel authorities to act in every case regardless of the

circumstances. An area of public land might be of little public value,

remote from any public access, and of no use to agriculture, and the

threat might be trivial or ephemeral, but a duty would require the

local authority to take up the cudgels just the same as if there were a

rave on the village

green.</div><a name="06042751000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept my

hon. Friend&#146;s admonition that given the discretion to act, local

authorities too often do not act all. That point has been made to me by

others, and I agree with him that that is sometimes unsatisfactory.

However, we hope to do two things that I believe might help. First, we

will work with local authorities and the Local Government Association

to improve understanding of the legislation and the authorities&#146;

role in implementing it. That will include the publication of guidance

to authorities, and we will consult on what that guidance might say

about authorities&#146; use of the powers under the clause.</div>

<a name="06042751000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we are considering

whether local access forums could advise authorities on taking action

under clauses 41 and 45 to promote public access to common land,

particularly where public access is currently restricted or excluded. I

am sorry to disappoint my hon. Friend again, but I hope that my

explanation of where the Government stand on amendments Nos. 82 to 84

is

adequate.</div><a name="06042751000251"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000595"></a>Paddy

Tipping:</b> In general, I support the approach of my hon.

Friend the Member for Stroud, but I think that there is a strong case

for using local access forums. That would be a much better way forward

than the first alternative involving education and consultation. I

press the Minister hard to consider local access forums as the way

forward, because they would consist of local people who know local

problems and can often find local solutions. He has found a neat way

forward.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000596"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support

for the second option. I consider myself well

pressed.</div><a name="06042751000253"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000598"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The Corby trouser press of the Committee

system.</div><a name="06042751000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to

amendments Nos. 85 and 87. I would be first to acknowledge that in the

common land policy statement of 2002, we committed to the vesting of

unclaimed land in a suitable body for long-term management. In

hindsight, however, there is a risk of confusing the questions of

ownership and management. We all want to promote better

management&#151;that is what the Bill is all about&#151;but we do

not need to tackle difficult questions of ownership

unnecessarily.</div><a name="06042751000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

accept that the 1965 Act provided for the vesting of unclaimed greens

in local authorities. We think it unlikely that the same approach could

be taken now. The 1965 Act created no mechanism to reverse vesting, for

example, and today such an approach would be likely to have human

rights implications. The fact that vestings under the 1965 Act gave

rise to few problems perhaps reflects the lower value of a green to the

owner than common land and, therefore, the lower likelihood of

challenge from a dispossessed owner. Whatever the merits of that

approach, it does not commend itself

today.</div><a name="06042751000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">In responding

further to amendments 85 and 87, I shall also refer to amendment No.

104, which was spoken to by the hon. Member for North Cornwall. It

would enable a local authority to assume full powers of management of

unclaimed common land where no commons association exist. We agree that

local authorities should be empowered to take on the management of

unclaimed commons so that they can be managed by local people with

community interests at heart. However, local authorities can already do

this in the majority of cases, through management schemes under the

Commons Act 1899. Moreover, our amendments to that Act will ensure that

such schemes are fit for purpose in the 21st

century.</div><a name="06042751000258"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000599"></a>Mr.

Rogerson:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his

reassurances, although I am cautious in my welcome. He referred to the

majority of cases. There might well be cases that cannot be resolved

through the powers that he described. How does he suggest those issues

should be

resolved?</div><a name="06042751000259"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000600"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and to the

Committee to sketch out what that small number of cases might be. Then

he can judge whether he wants to do anything

further.</div><a name="06042751000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is perhaps

unlikely that local authorities would want to invest resources in

managing a common that could be reclaimed at any moment by its owner,

but a scheme under the 1899 Act anticipates and protects against that

outcome. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud will accept

that if an authority has full powers of management, it does not need to

gain ownership of the land, as the amendment proposes. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>Beyond the 1899 powers, it is also possible to manage unclaimed land

hon. Member for North Cornwall will also agree that powers of

management cannot be bestowed like confetti, with authorities choosing

when and where to exercise them. They must be properly contemplated and

any commitment entered into should be by the making of a

scheme.</div><a name="06042751000487"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30

glad to be able to give my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud some

reassurance on amendment No. 86&#151;I regret that I have been a

little negative about most of his recent amendments. Clause 45 as

drafted would have the same effect if read in context. Schedule 9 to

the Environment Act 1995 sets out various powers which National Park

authorities may exercise alongside local authorities, and paragraph

6(a) of schedule 5 to this Bill amends schedule 9 to the 1995 Act to

include reference there to clause 45. It may seem odd not to include a

specific reference in clause 45, but it is helpful if the 1995 Act

maintains in one place an up-to-date list of these shared

powers.</div><a name="06042751000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers of

a conservation board are set out in the order establishing the board.

If the local authorities promoting a new conservation board wish it to

have the powers in clause 45, they can ask for that outcome. That is

the way that the legislation works, and it may be of interest to the

Committee to know that the boards established for the Chilterns and the

Cotswolds will be able to exercise the powers inclause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000601"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000602"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 88, in clause 46, page

27, line 11, at end

insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(7A) An order made

under paragraph (b) of subsection (7) may authorise the relevant

authority to carry out any requirement of an order which a person on

whom a notice is served under this section has failed to comply with

and to recover from that person the costs reasonably incurred by the

relevant authority in doing

so.'.</div><a name="06042751000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

will not delay the Committee for long. The amendment would simply

strengthen the provision when there is no immediate sanction available

for a court order for the removal of unlawful works that is not carried

out. The idea is to give greater power to the relevant authority to

take action to ensure that the problem is cleared up. It parallels

section 137ZA of the Highways Act 1980, which allows the relevant

authority to make good unlawful agricultural work.</div>

<a name="06042751000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">With your tolerance, Mr. Weir,

because presumably there will not be a stand part debate, I have been

asked by the National Farmers Union whether we would 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>consider the impact of non-agricultural work, especially by those who

want to bring vehicles on to a piece of common land or a village green.

There was an attempt in the other place to include a clause on how

vehicles of various descriptions would be excluded. It would be useful

to know whether the Government would consider tabling a proposal on

Report for a reserve power to deal with non-agriculture abuses of

common

land.</div><a name="06042751000270"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000603"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> I support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s final

comments. He is probably right in saying that, in a way, this is a

stand part debate. I should hope that, in view of my sickening

sycophancy towards you this morning, Mr. Weir, you will permit me to

take two minutes of your precious

time.</div><a name="06042751000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully support

the point that the hon. Gentleman made about reserve power, because as

the clause is currently framed it deals simply with breaches in

agricultural practice. As we have mentioned many times during the

debates on Tuesday and today, there is a great concern about

non-agricultural transgressions, that is, the damage all round that

motorcycles and 4x4 vehicles do to agricultural interests and the

natural, living environment. One hopes that the Minister will consider

this point carefully and respond, because there is surely a good cause

for making the clause a general reserve power for the Minister, not

just confining it, as is the case at present, to unauthorised

agricultural activities. We have been urged to take this course of

action by the National Farmers Union, the National Sheep Association

and the Welsh Commoners Association, to which I am indebted for telling

me about

it.</div><a name="06042751000272"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000604"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I shall address the amendment, then deal with the

other points that have been

made.</div><a name="06042751000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of

the amendment is to allow a national authority to take action to stop

an unauthorised activity on a common and recover its cost, where a

person fails to comply with a court order requiring them to cease that

activity. We do not see a role for a third party, such as the national

authority, trying to physically stop an unauthorised agricultural

activity. If, for example, a court orders a person to cease depasturing

livestock beyond the number of rights held, the authority would have to

find, identify and remove the offending animals. That would be

difficult on a large upland common. The authority would then have to

engage in further proceedings in order to recover costs from the

individual concerned, which might be unsuccessful if they had already

ignored the original court order. A more effective approach is to use

the judicial system to ensure that the individual, who knows his

livestock and where they graze, personally takes action. That may take

longer to achieve in some circumstances, but in the long run it will be

more cost-effective. The provision carries the ultimate sanction, once

a number of hurdles have been overcome, if it becomes necessary, of

contempt of court

proceedings.</div><a name="06042751000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend the Member for Stroud and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant

Conwy asked why we have addressed agricultural activities only and

wanted us to think about non-agricultural activities harming a common.

As they anticipated, my answer is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>that a range of instruments already exists for dealing with unlawful

activities that might be damaging a common, such as driving a motor

vehicle over it, or building on it without consent. It would not be

appropriate for the national authority to have powers of enforcement

against criminal activities that lie more properly with the police. We

have to be clear about where those responsibilities

lie.</div><a name="06042751000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 59 of the

Police Reform Act 2002 allows the police to seize any mechanically

propelled vehicle being driven in a careless or inconsiderate manner on

or off road.</div>

<a name="06042751000276"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000605"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> I hear what the Minister says and I know that he is

trying to be helpful, but I do not recall any prosecution or action by

the police along the lines that he is referring to. In fact, the police

cannot wait on the uplands for a 4x4 to cross the common. It is

virtually impossible to enforce the measure. In fact, it is very much

like the Hunting Act 2004&#151;no real regard is given to the way in

which it is enforced. The Minister&#146;s words give me no comfort,

and I would urge him to have another think about the

matter.</div>

<a name="06042751000277"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000606"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I will, as always, reflect on the proceedings of

the Committee. Not only has the Home Office issued guidance to police

in England and Wales on the legislation and the circumstances in which

it might be used, but the power has been used very effectively in a

recent clampdown in Wales, where a great many section 59 notices were

issued to off-road bikers who were riding illegally over commons in

Caerphilly and two bikes were confiscated. In that case, the police had

teamed up with countryside rangers from the local authority and the

Forestry Commission to target the problem.</div>

<a name="06042751000278"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000607"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> I am encouraged by that; obviously I must go home

more often.</div>

<a name="06042751000279"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000608"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising

the issue and for pushing me as hard as he did, because it gave us the

opportunity to identify that example. I hope that others will pay close

attention to the proceedings of this Committee and will notice that.

Perhaps hon. Members here will go out and evangelise about the

excellent work that has gone on in Caerphilly&#151;they could

campaign in their own constituencies for the powers to be properly

used, or use the antisocial behaviour toolkit issued by the Home Office

as part of its Together campaign.</div>

<a name="06042751000286"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000611"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Section 31 of the Commons Act 1876, with certain

exceptions, requires anyone intending to inclose or approve part of a

common to publish notice of that intention in a prescribed way at least

three months beforehand.</div>

<a name="06042751000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inclosure and approvement

relate solely to land that is still subject to commoners&#146;

rights&#151;the traditional common, rather than waste land of a manor

that has no common rights over it. Inclosure&#151;with an

&#145;i&#146;, not an &#145;e&#146;&#151;is the term that

describes the owner taking actions on the ground that have the effect

of completely stripping the common of the commoners&#146; rights.

Approvement is a lesser form of that, whereby the owner takes into his

exclusive use part of the common that is not required to satisfy the

commoners&#146; rights, while leaving the remainder subject to those

rights.</div> <a name="06042751000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 31

provided an opportunity for commoners or others to object to either

type of change before it happened, so it was a very important provision

in its time. However, it was, in effect, superseded by the protection

offered by section 194 of the Law of Property Act 1925. Any action on

the ground that would be sufficient to constitute an inclosure or

approvement would certainly impede the commoners&#146; access over

the land in question, and therefore require consent from the Secretary

of State under section 194. That would explain why we know of no case

in which the action required by section 31 of the 1876 Act has actually

been taken. When part 3 replaces section 194, it will similarly require

consent for works that impede the commoners&#146;&#151;or anyone

else&#146;s&#151;access to or over the land.</div>

<a name="06042751000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could simply leave section

31 extant, but there is a slight possibility that it could cause

confusion with the procedure that we will prescribe for proposed works

on a common. Our objective for part 3 is that the procedures and

criteria for proposed works be as consistent and clear as possible. On

balance, therefore, it is right to repeal section 31 as a provision

that has become

redundant.</div><a name="06042751000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection

nature of our work, we have spent a lot of time talking about the

legislative framework of the Bill. I am worried that, because we have

focused on that, we have not debated in great detail the vehicle that

will drive the Bill&#146;s important aims forward. As many members of

the Committee have said, Commons Bills do not come often and the whole

point of this Bill is to improve our common

land.</div><a name="06042751000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">My new clause,

which is supported by my hon. Friends the Members for Stroud and for

Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) is straightforward. Its aim is to place a duty on

Natural England to bring forward three proposals, the first of which is

to promote the formation of statutory commons associations. Throughout

our discussions, there has been a recognition on both sides of the

Committee that that will not be easy. People will hesitate to take the

step to move from a voluntary association to a statutory association.

They will need help, guidance and support. On Tuesday the Minister

recognised, as he has done today, the importance of Natural England in

such matters. His words were preceded by the comments of Lord Bach in

the other place, who was talking strongly about how Natural England

needs to be involved in the creation of statutory commons

associations.</div> <a name="06042751000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

debated widely, is a laudable objective in itself. It is to promote

more town and village greens. Research shows that people care about

their local communities and environments. The creation of new village

and town greens will not happen by itself. I want Natural England to be

involved. It is a new body with a whole range of tasks before it. It

faces a difficult period in being set up. I want Natural England to

know that the Bill is important, and I want it to have the power to

make sure that we have statutory commons associations, common land is

in good condition and that we move radically and quickly towards the

formation of new town and village greens.</div>

on Natural England&#146;s shoulders, it will be easier for it to

promote movement if we have a new name for the commons bodies. In all

sincerity, I believe that the name &#147;commons association&#148;

is no good. It will create difficulties and it will make promotion

difficult. We had a discussion on Tuesday when the Minister said that

he would think about it. Whether we adopt the term commons council or

another name is an important issue. It is not beyond the ken of all of

us to find a word. Councils might be a proper name&#151;I do not

know&#151;but associations in that context is not; it is a recipe for

disaster and will not assist the Minister&#146;s hopes in promoting

anything.</div><a name="06042751000313"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000620"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood. He

has made his argument clear. I have also made it clear that I prefer to

talk about commons committees because of the debate that we had about

councils, which I do not wish to reopen. I want to make a point about

village and town greens. We have understandably taken a great deal of

time discussing the minutiae of common land because the subject is

hideously complicated. We would have spent most of our time searching

through the interstices of every last detail with regard to such land.

As for village greens, for which the Minister wears his other hat, the

Government have a good story to tell about their work and that of the

national lottery, which has found available

money.</div><a name="06042751000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">To finish on a

more positive note, it is our objective, perhaps in word only if we are

talking about the Government&#146;s double devolution agenda and

looking at trying to encourage neighbourhoods in urban areas, for every

community, not only rural ones, to have a village or neighbourhood

centre.</div>

Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I have a lot of sympathy with

the aims that my hon. Friend is trying to achieve through the new

clause. On the creation of town and village greens and the role of

Natural England, does he anticipate that the duty will be a general

duty, or an advisory duty? Would Natural England be allowed some

discretion to advise on what might be a good plan for a village or town

green and what might be otherwise, or does he expect Natural England to

support every application willy-nilly?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000622"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s

situation&#151;he is trying to forestall reopening that debate. I do

not want to intrude on his private grief over what might happen if we

compel Natural England to find village greens where they are not

justified.</div><a name="06042751000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

important to recognise that every community needs its own space to be

protected. Giving that space the nomenclature of village or

neighbourhood green, or whatever we want to call it&#151;to return to

the debate on who is likely to be responsible for it&#151;would be an

excellent thing for the Bill to do. I hope that, wearing his other hat,

the Minister will go righteously from evangelism to promoting the

measure as a good thing that comes on the back of the Bill.</div>

<a name="06042751000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rest is rather technical.

Even though it is important to underpin in statute what has been

happening voluntarily for many generations, as my hon. Friend the

Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) said, it will not really set the

world alight. What we are trying to do in the new clause

could.</div>

<a name="06042751000319"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042751000623"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Paul Truswell</b> (Pudsey) (Lab): I echo the comments made by

my hon. Friends the Members for Sherwood and for Stroud. One of the

characteristics of this Committee is a preponderance of Members

representing rural or largely rural seats. I speak mainly as a townie

whose introduction to the arcane and abstruse but nevertheless

absolutely gripping issue of commons has been through an example in my

constituency, with which I have already bored Members on Second Reading

and in Committee.</div><a name="06042751000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

is important that some body should be responsible for promoting

awareness of town greens. The residents of many areas with town and

village greens do not know that they have one because it is not

formally designated. During debates, we have clearly identified that

communities such as Yeadon in my constituency become aware that they

could get that formal designation and all the protections that it

encompasses only if they go through the application process to

establish a town or a village green. Few people in Yeadon are aware

that that is a possibility. Indeed, those who originally raised the

idea were regarded as community eccentrics, as no one knew what they

were talking about until their helpful Member of Parliament collected

the information, much of which was provided by the Open Spaces

Society.</div><a name="06042751000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

organisations such as the OSS are small and have limited resources.

They do a fantastic job of providing support and information, but they

cannot easily discharge that role. I add my comments to those of my

hon. Friends. There must be some organisation&#151;Natural England

seems to be a good choice&#151;to promote awareness of town greens

and provide support for people who want to go through an often

convoluted and demanding

process.</div><a name="06042751000322"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000624"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am grateful, as ever, to my hon. Friends. They

will know that Natural England already has a power to carry out such

activities when they benefit the natural environment. The Natural

Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 gives Natural England the

overarching purpose of ensuring that the natural environment is

conserved, enhanced and managed for the benefit of present and future 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>generations. That includes promoting nature conservation and protecting

biodiversity, conserving and enhancing the landscape, promoting public

access and encouraging recreation in the

countryside.</div><a name="06042751000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Natural

England already has all the powers that it needs to carry out the

activities set out in new clause 4 provided that they are beneficial to

present and future generations. I worry that imposing a duty on it to

carry out those activities would remove its element of discretion over

whether such activities would be

beneficial.</div><a name="06042751000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

appreciate that new clause 4 might be an attempt to establish what the

Government see Natural England&#146;s role to be in implementing the

Bill. I told the fifth national seminar on commons in Cheltenham last

year&#151;an excellent event, which my hon. Friend the Member for

Stroud attended&#151;that I see Natural England becoming the

Government&#146;s champion for the management and well-being of

common land.</div>

<a name="06042751000489"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3

pm</div><a name="06042751000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want Natural

England to facilitate the establishment of commons associations where

better management of a common would help to enhance biodiversity and

public benefit, particularly on sites of special scientific interest,

for example. However, imposing a duty to promote their formation in all

cases might not be appropriate. Commons associations will be the key to

improved management on some commons, but will not necessarily be

appropriate for all of them.</div>

<a name="06042751000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same applies to promoting

the creation of greens. The Natural England bodies have a strong track

record in local open space creation and protection, and we expect

Natural England to build on that important work. Creation and

protection of registered town and village greens is only one part of

that activity.</div>

<a name="06042751000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Natural England is crucial to

the implementation of the Bill and to the well-being of common land in

general, but imposing a duty on it is unnecessary. I give an additional

reassurance to my hon. Friends that I will write to Sir Martin Doughty,

chair-designate of Natural England, enclosing a copy of what I have

said, so that my expectations in respect of common land are clear at

the outset.</div>

that Natural England will be a champion of common land, that it has a

record of excellence in respect of village greens, and that he will

write to Sir Martin Doughty, who is an enthusiast for these matters, as

is the new body. Given that Natural England is following our

discussions and will have the advantage of receiving a letter from the

straightforward new clause, but the Minister probably will not be able

to accept it as drafted as it may be deficient. It was suggested by the

Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, among others, because of

concern that professional advice to the national authority is needed on

how it should go about doing things.</div>

<a name="06042751000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish to destroy the

harmonious mood of the Committee in the past two days, but there have

been times when some Opposition members of the Committee have felt that

there was insufficient practical understanding of the implications of

what was being discussed. Without rehearsing those matters, it is

important that the Government, or the Welsh Assembly in the case of

Wales, have the necessary advice on the practicalities and implications

of the proposal.</div> <a name="06042751000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

discussed earlier matters such as minimal and trivial works, which are

all relevant to the Bill, and wider management issues such as what

works should, or should not, be approved. On Tuesday, the Minister

touched upon the body that he is setting up to bring together the

registration officers and advise and help them in their functions under

the Bill. That may be linked to my proposal, the principal purpose of

which is to invite the Minister to explain how he sees the national

authority moving forward. I hope that he will give us some more

information about setting up the organisation for land registration

officers and say where he will get practical advice to help him to

fulfil the significant amount of responsibility that he, or the

Department and his successors, will assume under the Bill. I stress the

word &#147;practical&#148;, because I say specifically in the

amendment that the national authority should be representative of

commoners as well as those with a public interest in the land. The

Government should use the real interests and the wealth of experience

and knowledge of people who have held commons rights and applied them

and used them for grazing&#151;or indeed used any of the other rights

that we have discussed&#151;in applying their responsibilities under

the

Bill.</div><a name="06042751000335"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000627"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The hon. Gentleman, as ever, is acting from the

best intentions in wanting to ensure that the national authority acts

on the best advice. However, it is not necessary to include that power

in the Bill, as the national authority already has the power to

establish a non-statutory advisory body, if it were felt to be

appropriate.</div><a name="06042751000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend

to establish a national stakeholder group to provide advice on the

implementation of the Bill&#151;but to do so on a statutory basis

would introduce an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and impose

additional costs. In section 101 of the NERC Act 2006, we repealed no

fewer than five committees established under various enactments, which

had become redundant. We have rehearsed the arguments about this Bill

being an opportunity that comes round rarely and wanting it to stand

the test of time.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div><a name="06042751000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be a separate

organisation from the national stakeholder group&#151;the Association

of Commons Registration Officers&#151;which we have already started

and funded for set-up costs. We also want to ensure that we use advice

from other bodies that currently exist, such as the Welsh Commons Forum

and the federations of commoners in Cumbria and Yorkshire. The

Federation of Cumbria Commoners, with assistance from a rural

enterprise scheme grant, has recently issued a series of good practice

guides for commons, which we thoroughly welcome. We want to make sure

that we are using such advice beyond the national stakeholder

group.</div><a name="06042751000338"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000628"></a>Mr.

outset, I did not expect him to accept the amendment. Indeed, he has

explained not only why he will not accept it, but why it is

unnecessary. Nevertheless, it has given him the opportunity to place on

the record the Government&#146;s intention to set up such a

stakeholder group.</div><a name="06042751000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Yes, it was much better when my hon. Friend was

Chief Whip, because he was not allowed to speak. Nevertheless, I am

pleased that the Minister will take up the idea of an advisory group,

and I hope that it will involve a lot of people with the on-the-ground

relates to an issue highlighted by a learned gentlemen who resides in

the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman

Lamb). It would clarify the situation relating to people&#146;s

ability to access property surrounded by common land. I am not greatly

familiar with the case that gave rise to the new clause, but I can see

how such circumstances might be a problem in an area with no recognised

roadway, where people have customarily crossed common land to access

their property. The new clause would provide an opportunity to deal

with that situation by having the parish council take on that right of

way and ensure that it is maintained. Any issues about crossing the

common land could be resolved in that way.</div>

Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): I am slightly puzzled,

although I appreciate the practical problems. Surely the hon. Gentleman

is not suggesting that what is at the moment a track that is used by

one or two people who live beyond common land should be kept up by the

local authority, involving all the costs of tarmacking and so on? Will

he clarify that?</div>

<a name="06042751000345"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000631"></a>Mr.

Rogerson:</b> Certainly. I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s

point. The intention is that the matter should go to the parish council

rather than the highways authority, so the track would not need to be

adopted in the same way as a road. The new clause refers

to</div><a name="06042751000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persons gaining

access to their property from the adopted public highway and by

visitors to such

property&#148;,</div><a name="06042751000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">so it would

affect the track that links to the public highway, which does not need

to be maintained as a highway. It is referring to a right of way, not

requiring it to be tarmacked and turned into a permanent road. That is

the intention of the new clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000632"></a>Mr.

problem of easements, which I have mentioned on various occasions. I

thought that we had clarified the matter under the NERC Act, following

questions that arose from the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

Can the Minister clarify that the new clause is not necessary, because

what the right hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay) achieved in that

Act stands in primacy over this measure? I could be persuaded that we

need to nail the matter down even more exactly, because it is a great

problem in my area, and I expect that it also affects the hon. Member

for North Cornwall and

others.</div><a name="06042751000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where there is

a lack of clarity about rights of way&#151;particularly vehicular

rights of way&#151;there should be some attempt to make it clear that

people crossing common land have extant rights of way. That has become

an issue in my area, where there is a dispute with the National Trust.

There is an understandable demand for a body to take ownership of

pieces of land, because some people have had difficulty in selling

their property in the absence of clarification about their rights,

particularly vehicular rights of way, and whether they should be paying

the so-called owner of the land. I hope that the Minister can provide

such clarification, so that I do not need to support the new

clause.</div><a name="06042751000350"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000633"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> In direct response to the point that my hon.

Friend has just made, I recall what we did in the NERC Act in response

to the problem raised by the right hon. Member for Bracknell in respect

of his constituents and others; the problem was not restricted to

Bracknell. That problem related to people who sought to access their

private property via RUPPs&#151;roads used as public paths. Some of

the changes that we made under that Act would have threatened their

ability to use those RUPPs with non-mechanically-propelled vehicles,

because they would have reverted to what would now be restricted byways

unless those people put in claims in time to convert them to byways

open to all traffic. Given that that section came into effect in

January 2005, as a retrospective measure, that would have been rather

difficult for them. We made an arrangement for them to have private

rights of way to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>their properties. That was not specific to common land; as I recall, it

referred to access to all private property that relied on

RUPPs.</div> <a name="06042751000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will not

surprise the Committee to hear that we do not feel able to accept the

new clause. It would turn what might, at best, be a private vehicle

right into a public one, much along the lines mentioned by my hon.

Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman). I imagine that

even the home owners in question might not be particularly happy about

that. The compulsory vesting of the land in question in the parish

council, irrespective of who owns it now, is also a step about which we

would be

nervous.</div><a name="06042751000490"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15

pm</div><a name="06042751000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise

that significant problems arose a few years ago, when home owners were

being charged large capital sums to secure a legal right to drive over

such land to their houses over commons, greens and the like. That

problem arose because of the High Court judgment in the case of Hanning

<i class="I">v</i>. Top Deck Travel in 1993. That case seemed to indicate that

home owners were unable to achieve prescriptive rights to drive to

their homes in such situations under section 14(1) of the Road Traffic

Act 1930&#151;or, in the case of urban commons, after the passage of

section 193 of the Law of Property Act 1925&#151;because both

statutes contain specific prohibitions on driving on such land. Quite a

few landowners responded to that judgment by seeking payments from home

owners for the privilege of continuing to reach their homes by

car.</div> <a name="06042751000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Faced with that

wholly unacceptable situation, the Government enacted section 68 of the

CROW Act 2000, to enable regulations to be made capping the amounts

payable by home owners in such situations. Those regulations were made

in 2002.</div> <a name="06042751000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Happily, the

House of Lords decided, in the case of Bakewell Management Ltd

<i class="I">v</i>. Brandwood and Others in 2004, that the original Hanning case

of 1993 was wrongly decided. We would never have enacted section 68 of

the CROW Act but for that case. Last year, we consulted on whether

section 68 should be repealed. We took stock of the legal position, in

light of the comments that we received, and we concluded that, in light

of Bakewell, it is clear that section 68 serves no

purpose.</div><a name="06042751000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a

choice, and I am relatively relaxed about it. Indeed, hon. Members

could canvass me on which way to go. We could leave section 68 extant,

and possibly revoke the regulations that we made under it, as they no

longer have any function. However, that might tend to perpetuate the

confusion that has been all too apparent, as it might lead people to

believe that section 68 had some residual purpose or utility.</div>

<a name="06042751000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively, we could use the

Bill to repeal section 68. That would send the clearest possible

message that the section is defunct. If the Committee favours the

latter option, we are willing to table an amendment on Report to repeal

section 68. I am sorry to have delayed the Committee with that

explanation but it is a fairly complicated

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000639"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> Amendments Nos. 41, 39 and 40, which stand in my

name, relate to the issue of the authorised severance of rights, as

does the schedule. As drafted, the schedule makes it possible for those

who want to transfer their rights voluntarily to transfer them to the

commons association or to Natural England or the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>CCW in Wales. If they want to transfer them to the latter two, various

things must be done under subsection (2).</div>

<a name="06042751000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is some concern among the

public about why Natural England or CCW would want, or should have,

these rights. Neither organisation is likely to use grazing rights, as

they are not farmers; they are not likely to want to cut turf or carry

out any other rights that may be relevant. The understanding is that

they will want to acquire them simply to extinguish them, to ensure

that they are not used for conservation purposes. I question whether it

is right for them effectively to extinguish those rights without other

rights holders having the opportunity to be involved. Amendment No. 41

would remove the opportunity to transfer rights to Natural England or

the CCW but leaves the possibility of transferring them to the

statutory body.</div>

<a name="06042751000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 take

a slightly different tack, which is probably preferable. They would

enable the transfer to the statutory body but would then allow that

body subsequently to transfer the rights, with or without some form of

payment, to anybody else who already held similar rights on that piece

of land, and that is the right way to proceed.</div>

<a name="06042751000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is a concern about

over-grazing&#151;there is in some cases, although on many commons

there could increasingly be the problem of under-grazing&#151;the

process that the Bill sets up, the concept of statutory bodies having

agreements under the stewardship schemes and so on, with Natural

England and the CCW, is about the totality of management. That is the

way to address the problems of over-grazing.</div>

<a name="06042751000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">The remarks that I made on

Tuesday are relevant in that regard: some people may have

over-registered in the first place, for whatever reason, and that is

often the cause of over-grazing. I strongly doubt that the people who

over-registered will voluntarily transfer their rights to Natural

England so that they can be extinguished; I might have more sympathy

with the idea if that were the case.</div>

<a name="06042751000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">I challenge the idea that

Natural England or the CCW should be the recipients of the transfer of

rights. If people want to give up their rights and transfer them, they

should go to the association or statutory body, which should decide

whether to keep them, to extinguish them or simply not to use them,

which would be entirely within their rights, or to transfer them to

other rights holders.</div>

<a name="06042751000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The under-grazing issue is

especially relevant because the people who are most likely to want to

transfer their rights are those who do not use them. It would be of no

value to transfer them to Natural England to extinguish them, because

they are not being used in the first place. Where there is a problem of

under-grazing I contend that if those who are not using their rights

could be persuaded to transfer them to the association and subsequently

transfer them to someone who wants to use them it would go a long way

to address the problem of under-grazing.</div>

<a name="06042751000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some ways, this part of the

schedule is backto front. As far as under-grazing is

concerned, transferring to Natural England will not work. As far as

over-grazing is concerned, agreements with Natural England through

Government stewardship schemes 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>are a better way forward than transfers, because I strongly suspect that

the people responsible for the over-grazing will not be the ones

voluntarily transferring their

rights.</div><a name="06042751000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendments

suggest that we should shift the balance and give the responsibility

for agricultural management, which includes the use of rights, directly

to the statutory body and let that body decide who should have the

transferred rights. That is why I have moved the amendments. I hope

that the Minister will consider them

carefully.</div><a name="06042751000378"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000640"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I rise to speak to amendment No. 69. The issue was

brought to my attention by the Royal Society for the Protection of

Birds, which wishes to take a slightly different perspective from the

hon. Gentleman. The amendment would constrain the circumstances in

which a commoners association, soon to be known as a commoners

committee, could prohibit the transfer of severed rights to Natural

England or the Countryside Council for Wales.</div>

<a name="06042751000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Royal Society for the

Protection of Birds is clear that it supports the Government position,

as drafted in clause 9, that there should be a general prohibition on

severance, as that will maintain the link between those who exercise

rights of common and the local community for whose benefit such rights

are exercised. However, the RSPB is worried that unless we amend

schedule 1, it will be possible to sever commons rights. It is unclear

why Natural England or CCW should not be the obvious

recipient.</div><a name="06042751000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

RSPB&#146;s main concern is that unless the Government reinforce what

they are saying in clause 9, severance could go a step too far.

Allowing a commoners association or committee to constrain the natural

recipient&#151;either Natural England or CCW&#151;does not seem

sensible.</div> <a name="06042751000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The RSPB is

concerned for two reasons. First, the Bill&#146;s current wording

could risk the loss of an important tool for delivering DEFRA&#146;s

public service agreement target for sites of special scientific

interest, which requires that 95 per cent. of SSSIs by area should be

in favourable condition.</div>

<a name="06042751000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, clause 28(3)

disapplies section 28G of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which

makes it clear that a commoners association or committee is not

regarded as a public body with a duty to further the conservation of

SSSIs consistent with its primary duties. The RSPB is worried that that

would not necessarily be an ultimate priority of commoners committees,

whereas it would be a prime responsibility of Natural England and CCW

as public bodies. I hope that the Minister hears me and understands why

those public bodies, with their particular responsibilities, are

important as the natural recipients of severed land

rights.</div><a name="06042751000491"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000641"></a>Mr.

Rogerson:</b> I rise to speak to amendment No. 108, which was

tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and me.

Its aims are broadly similar to those of the amendments tabled by the

hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div><a name="06042751000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not think that severance

in principle is a good thing. We should like the rights to remain with

the dominant tenements where they have customarily done so. If,

however, it is felt for some reason that that must happen for the

management of a common, we believe that it is vastly preferable that

those rights should go to people who are actively involved in the life

of the

common.</div><a name="06042751000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under-grazing

is a growing problem. I could provide examples from Bodmin moor, where

archaeologists are showing changes that have occurred and explaining

how features of the landscape are no longer visible because of

under-grazing. Under the single farm payment r√(c)gime and the move

away from production, that problem is likely to grow. As for whether

farmers in England will ever receive their payments under the single

farm payment scheme, that is a discussion for another

arena.</div><a name="06042751000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point

relates to the history of common land and how it has been managed in

the past. We have gone back to Acts dating from 1285 and the principle

is that common rights are exercised by people who have dominant

tenements in such areas. It is dangerous to move away from that

principle, so we want the Minister to accept the amendment to prevent

the rights from being moved to national

organisations.</div><a name="06042751000387"></a>

Itstates:</div><a name="06042751000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Thusthe legislation provides a mechanism to facilitate the bettermanagement of common land through the reduction of stock in instancesof over-grazing, and reintroducing or increasing stock in instances ofunder-grazing.&#148;</div><a name="06042751000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">The RSPBappreciates that the problem of under-grazing has a knock-on effect onthe whole environment. Who better to deal with that issue thancommoners? Why should such matters be farmed out to a national body forit to decide what is best for local people? I do not follow such logic.If the Government are serious about the Bill, they must realise thatthe amendments are good. They would lead to a proper, balanced use ofthe common.</div><a name="06042751000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thearguments advanced by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshirewere persuasive, inasmuch as those who have over-registered will notcare what happens to the common. However, people who are on the groundday in, day out care passionately because, if their stock over-grazes,it will destroy for everyone not only themselves as farmers, but thewhole environment. The more local, the better. The amendment would plugthegap.</div><a name="06042751000390"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000643"></a>JimKnight:</b> The powers of a commons association to dispose ofrights of common acquired under schedule 1 will be determined in itsestablishment order. The order could confer a freedom to dispose ofrights in gross as it thinks fit or it may provide that the associationmust retain the rights subject to arrangements for temporary letting.That will be a matter for discussion and negotiation in the context ofthe draft order. It is more appropriate to decide such matters on acase-by-case basis than to confer a blanket authorisation under theschedule. That is my response to amendments Nos. 39 and40.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div><a name="06042751000391"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000644"></a>Mr.Paice:</b> I appreciate that time is short, but we need to getmatters clear. If what the Minister said is the case, what is thepurpose of schedule 1? If we are to have flexibility, a word that thehon. Gentleman has used repeatedly in Committee, and settle suchmatters under individual orders for individual associations, why do weneed schedule 1? It stipulates clearly the rules governing who shouldtransfer to whom and how in cases of authorised severance. I press himfor clarification of the interaction between schedule 1 and theflexibility under the order to which hereferred.</div><a name="06042751000392"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000645"></a>JimKnight:</b> I may receive clarification, but I think that theorder is flexible only as regards the actions of the commonsassociation in respect of severance. Obviously, not everywhere willhave commons' associations. There are clear restrictions on suchmatters.</div><a name="06042751000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">As foramendment No. 41, the powers of severance under paragraph 1 arelegitimate tools available to Natural England and the CountrysideCouncil for Wales to help tackle problems of over-grazing. I agree inprinciple with what the hon. Gentleman said about under-grazing.Natural England seeks to retain the powers only to tackle over-grazingas a last resort. There is also a role for Natural England where thereis under-grazing and no commoner is willing to exercise his or herrights. In such a case, Natural England could perhaps acquire rights byseverance in order to reintroduce grazing if it thought that that wasthe best option.</div> <a name="06042751000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">Wecannot reasonably expect all upland commons to be managed by commonsassociations or entered into agri-environment agreements. Elsewhere,where co-operation remains unforthcoming, we may have no othereffective mechanism to help reduce over-grazing but to acquire and sequester rights so that grazing pressures are reduced. There are nopowers to require rights to be sold. They must be sold, as the hon.Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, with the vendor&#146;sconsent.</div><a name="06042751000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">Voluntaryacquisition of rights by English Nature has sometimes been disruptiveof existing hefting patterns. We have therefore amended the Bill toimpose a duty on Natural England to consult voluntary commoners' association before proceeding. We do not think that the powers will bewidely used. To date, they have been used only in a limited number ofcases, but it would be foolish to throw away a power that may still berequired to help the achievement of the PSA target.</div><a name="06042751000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now come toamendment No. 69 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud. I amgrateful to him for his suggestion. However, we think that it isunlikely that Natural England or CCW will act to acquire rights in thatway, other than in the most pressing circumstances, namely where thereis no other reasonable way of reducing grazing activity on designatedcommon land. His amendment will therefore effectively neuter the effectof paragraph 1(4) of the schedule, because it would refer to the onlycircumstances in which the provision is likely to haveeffect.</div> <a name="06042751000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, webelieve that it is very unlikely that Natural England will need toacquire rights by severance on a common in which a commons <div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>association is established. That would suggest that the association isseverely underperforming. So although an association may possess aveto, it would reflect poorly on the association if it were ever calledon to contemplate exercising it. At that point, Natural England mightwell talk to the National Assembly for Wales or the CCW about theperformance of the association, so we see no practical need to amendparagraph 1(4) in this way.</div><a name="06042751000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I turn to amendmentNo. 108 tabled by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire. The hon.Member for South-East Cambridgeshire asked an interesting question onTuesday, when we discussed clause 8 stand part. He asked whether rightscould be deployed if the dominant tenement was fully surrendered todevelopment. The amendment could perhaps provide an answer to thatquestion. The owner of the dominant tenement could sever the rights andsee them redeployed to other commoners. I can see the attraction inthat it would help the rights remain in agricultural use, even when thedominant tenement had been taken out of agricultural use.</div><a name="06042751000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the most part, we thinkthat clause 11 provides a sufficient answer. Complete development willseldom arise, but we also foresee real difficulties with thatparticular approach. How many commoners, even though selling out theirfarm for development, would want to distribute their rights among allthe other commoners in the community? We all know of situations inwhich there is festering antipathy between one group of commoners andanother. How would the outgoing commoners secure payment for the rightsif the transaction were on the basis of all or nothing?</div><a name="06042751000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">More practically, many of ourcommons are not neatly registered as one common with a clear statementof rights held by each commoner. Rights are often exercisable overdiffering areas of the common or over more than one common. In suchcases, the formula proposed under the amendment could cause endlessbickering. However, I am still thinking about the scenario that wasoutlined by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire on Tuesdayand, if I come up with a magical solution, I will offer it onReport.</div> <a name="06042751000401"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendmentagreedto.</i></div><a name="06042751000402"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendmentmade</i>: No. 27, in schedule 1, page 32, line 33, at endinsert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) In a casewhere there is no commons association established for the land overwhich a right of common to which section 9 applies is exercisable, theappropriate national authority may by order provide that a person withfunctions of management conferred by any enactment in relation to thatland is to be regarded, for any or all purposes of this paragraph, as acommons association established for the land.'&#151;<i class="I">[JimKnight.]</i></div><a name="06042751000403"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000646"></a>DavidMaclean:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 105, in schedule 1,page 33, line 45, leave out &#145;and his consentobtained,'.</div><a name="06042751000404"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000647"></a>TheChairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discussamendment</div> <a name="06042751000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 63, inschedule 1, page 34, line 3, at endinsert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;including provision thatthe appropriate national authority may deem that the consent of theowner of the land has been obtained where it appears to the authoritythat such consent has been withheldunreasonably.'.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div><a name="06042751000406"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000648"></a>DavidMaclean:</b> We now come to one of the most crucial amendmentson the amendment paper, and that is not just my arrogant opinion, butthat of the Federation of Cumbria Commoners which the Minister waspleased to praise earlier for issuing excellent guidance.

I know that they have a different view, perhaps because they havelarge landholding and grouse-shooting interests unlike the commoners. Iam delighted that a Labour Government will at last back the commonersover those with big vested shooting interests. I support the right ofpeople to manage their grouse moors and to shoot on them, but theyshould be paying the market price for buying up commoners&#146;rights. If I had such a veto and was a grouse-owning landlord I wouldveto every transfer of rights. The rights would then become worthlessand I would buy them up for a song myself.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000657"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> We are running out of time, so I shall be quick. I

have not tabled the amendment just to get the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>board of conservators into the Bill. The amendment is important. It

applies to those open spaces that were provisionally registered by

their public body owners in the knowledge that that was not strictly

correct, because all rights of common had been acquired and

extinguished many years previously&#151;nevertheless, no objection

was raised and the registration became final. It is believed that that

was done to perpetuate the memory of historic status. The amendment

applies largely to urban centres, particularly London, where there are

still a number of metropolitan commons as defined under the

Metropolitan Commons Act 1866.</div>

<a name="06042751000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move the amendment on behalf

of the Open Spaces Society. I shall read the final sentence of its

submission:</div><a name="06042751000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It

would be mischievous pedantry for this to be reopened now with no

benefit to anyone, and the amendment would prevent

this.&#148;</div>

<a name="06042751000426"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000658"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The purpose of paragraphs 4 and 5 of the schedule

is to enable rectification of the register when land can be shown to

have been wrongly registered under the Commons Registration Act

1965.</div> <a name="06042751000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot agree

to the amendment; it would not be right to exclude certain types of

landowner from the benefit of the provisions. As I understand it, the

amendment accepts that land owned by some local authorities may have

been incorrectly registered, but as those authorities&#146; purpose

in seeking to remove the land from the register may be motivated by the

possibility of development, we should make a special case for

them.</div> <a name="06042751000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not accept

that. I certainly recognise the possibility that some authority-owned

land was registered without objection, notwithstanding that its

eligibility for registration was doubtful; some parks and recreation

grounds may fall into that category. I find it less credible that we

should expect a flood of applications from opportunist councils and

charities to have the land removed from the register.</div>

<a name="06042751000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions of the schedule

should apply equally to all landowners. We should not say that we

acknowledge that some land was improperly registered and that we are

going to enable the land to be removed from the register, but that we

do not trust local authorities to do the right thing. It is certainly

possible that some wrongly registered land will be developed as a

result of application under schedule 2. That would be unsurprising,

because a mistake in registration may have held up development.

However, we cannot complain about that result. I hope that my hon.

Friend will withdraw his amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000660"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in schedule 4, page

41, line 28, leave out</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;on or after

28th June 2005

but'.</div><a name="06042751000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

move this amendment, tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the

Member for Sherwood. We seek clarification on why a specific date is

set. The implication is that any transitional arrangements for

enforcements against unlawful works under this schedule prior to that

date will no longer be permitted. We are disappointed that, along with

the lack of a specific duty on local authorities to take action against

unlawful work, that element of the schedule would seem to be a

diminution. I could quote many cases, but I shall sit down and either

allow the Minister to say something or allow my hon. Friend the Member

for Sherwood, who has now risen, to back up what I was

saying.</div>

<a name="06042751000437"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000661"></a>Paddy

Tipping:</b> I am conscious of the time, and I apologise to my

hon. Friends. The amendment&#146;s intention is to return the Bill to

the form in which it was originally published. Perhaps the Minister

will tell us why the proposal to insert the June 2005 date was accepted

in the House of Lords. Many obstacles across the country prevent a

right to roam. Had that date not been put in the Bill, people who feel

strongly on those issues could have taken enforcement action. Powers

are available for the future but not in respect of the

past.</div><a name="06042751000438"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000662"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> As my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood has just

said, the Bill extends the power to seek enforcement action against

unlawful works to any person or organisation in future. Amendment No.

36 is about the past. The issue it raises boils down to whether any

person or organisation should be able to ask the court to enforce

against unlawful works that were undertaken before the Bill began its

passage through the other

place.</div><a name="06042751000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,

the question is not that simple. The Limitation Act 1980 rules out

enforcement against works undertaken more than 12 years ago, and the

effective window for action tends in fact to be much shorter than that,

because the courts, which have a discretion rather than a duty to act,

tend to look critically at any suggestion that they should enforce

against works that are more than a few years old. So, there is likely

to be a limited number of cases in which the amendment would make a

practical difference to the enforcement position.</div>

<a name="06042751000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view is that where works

were undertaken within that narrow time window without consent, it

would not be right for us to open up the scope for anyone at all to

seek enforcement action. In the end, those responsible for such works

did what they did, and bore the cost of doing so, on the basis of the

limited enforcement regime that then applied. There is a strong

presumption against legislation having a retrospective effect. We think

that the provision as it stands, without the amendment, strikes a fair

balance. We do not think it would be just to allow any

person&#151;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div><a name="06042751000441"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000663"></a>Tom

Levitt:</b> I shall be very brief. If an existing barrier were

to be changed, does the Minister envisage that it would count as a new

barrier, which could then come under the clause as the Minister

envisages it, or would it be caught under the old pre-June 2005

issue?</div>

<a name="06042751000442"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000664"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> If further works, such as maintenance or an

extension, are undertaken in relation to old works, that may allow any

person to take enforcement action against them if the new works do not

have consent. I hope that answers my hon. Friend&#146;s question. I

hope that on that basis, my hon. Friends will not press the amendment

to a

Division.</div><a name="06042751000443"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000666"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Given that we have concluded our deliberations,

may I take the opportunity to thank you, Mr. Weir, and Miss Begg most

warmly&#151;I am pleased to hear that other Committee members

agree&#151;for your excellent stewardship of our

proceedings.</div> <a name="06042751000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish

to thank the Committee for the constructive and helpful way in

which&#151;</div><a name="06042751000455"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000667"></a>David

Maclean:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. As

the most senior Privy Councillor present, with years of experience in

these matters, and because of the non-partisan nature of the

proceedings, I trust that when the Bill gets Royal Assent,

the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>Minister will hold a proper little drinks party to thank his officials,

and that he will feel it important, on this occasion, to invite all

members of the Committee, who have behaved impeccably&#151;including

the officials, yourself, Mr. Weir, and Miss Begg&#151;to Nobel house

to continue our bipartisan relationship, and so that the Minister is

not accused of favouritism.</div>

<a name="06042751000456"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000668"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I think that I am grateful to the right hon.

Gentleman for that invitation to a party that I am now going to host. I

am sure that it is something that we can consider, because it is proper

that everybody should be thanked, particularly my officials. Much

praise was given to them on Second Reading on account of the clarity of

the explanatory notes. I hope that they have also made my notes

clear&#151;their in-flight refuelling has been prompt and effective.

I should also like to thank the Whip for his work in steering us almost

exactly to time.</div>

<a name="06042751000457"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000669"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> Mr. Weir, I am not going to try to emulate my right

hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, not least because I

am not as generous as he is with other people&#146;s money&#151;or

with my own. However, I entirely endorse the remarks that the Minister

has made, and add my thanks to him and his officials for the way in

which they have conducted themselves not only in Committee but prior to

the Bill&#146;s coming to Committee. They have been more than open to

discussions about how we might handle matters. I am grateful,

particularly, for the way in which the Minister has responded&#151;in

most cases&#151;to amendments that we have proposed and to the issues

that have arisen from them. He promised to go away and consider a

number of matters, but he agreed to consult openly on three: possible

alterations to the register; the name of the statutory bodies; and

developments that are already under way. I look forward to those

discussions.</div> <a name="06042751000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

understand that we will not debate this Bill on Report next week or the

week after, so we have a reasonable amount of time. However, I am sure

that the Minister will want to ensure that before we reach that stage

we continue to deal with the issues, as my right hon. Friend said, in a

non-partisan way so as to get it as right as possible, because we will

not be the ones&#151;nor, probably, will our immediate

successors&#151;who are asked to address the matter again. I am

particularly grateful to the Minister for the attitude that he has

taken, and to you, Mr. Weir, and to Miss

Begg.</div>

<a name="06042751000459"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042751000670"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> I, too, would like to thank you,Mr.

Weir, and Miss Begg, for your wonderful chairmanship, which has

contributed to the success of our consideration of the Bill. I, too,

welcome the Minister&#146;s positive approach to it, and he can be

assured of our equally positive contribution. A number of issues that

have been highlighted during our considerations are outstanding, and

the Bill would be improved if they were addressed. I look forward

to

<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>working with the Minister and his team in trying to ensure that we come

to the best possible conclusion on those

matters.</div>
