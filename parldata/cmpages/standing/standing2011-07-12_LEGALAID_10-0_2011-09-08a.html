Andy Slaughter</strong> (Hammersmith) (Lab):<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000726">&#160;</a>
                  </span> It is a pleasure to
see you in the Chair for our final sitting this week, Mr Hollobone.
When we adjourned this morning, I was encouraging the
Minister—by way of further encouragement, I will sit down
shortly to give him a chance to respond—to explain in detail how
clause 9 and the regime of exceptional circumstances will work. The
Government have a duty to do so, having relied on that as they
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I mentioned
attending yesterday afternoon’s meeting of the all-party group
on legal aid, which is ably chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for
Makerfield. Historically, hon. Members of all parties have
attended—the right hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
(Tom Brake) has done so, and the Minister has been invited to attend;
it is a shame that yesterday only I and Lord Bach attended—and I
hope that, notwithstanding the serious disputes, it will continue to
function in that way. The message that I was asked to bring to the
Minister specifically on clause 9 was that practitioners want to know
how the regime will operate, and how they can use it effectively, not
to get round Government powers but to ensure that meritorious and
acceptable cases are heard.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">

                  </span> My hon. Friend refers to
yesterday’s meeting of the all-party group. A specific
query—I am sure he agrees that it is important that it is
answered—is whether the telephone gateway operators will tell
people about the exceptional cases funding. If so, where will they
refer people to obtain advice on making their case, and will there be
legal aid for that? If the court considers that someone needs an
application, what will they have to do? The group raised a number of
questions that I hope the Minister will
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is a good example of what I was talking
about, and I am sure the Minister will take it and other points on
board. I quite liked this morning’s idea of attribution, and
although it may extend our sitting, I will attribute everything from
now on because that will show how many and varied are the organisations
opposed to the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Citizens
Advice made two specific points that are not covered in its general
remarks. It
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It
is perverse that the proposed new criteria for civil funding set out in
schedule 1 are structured around crisis point situations such as
immediate homelessness and domestic
abuse”.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000637">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>It
said that that also applies to clause 9, and it is absolutely right.
The Government are setting up a system that works entirely in crisis
situations—the exception rather than the rule. That is no basis
for legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bar Council ventured the view that, even in their narrowly drafted
clause, the Government may not achieve what they wish to achieve. It
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“An
oddity immediately arises from the prima facie exclusion of private
family law from legal aid, given the apparent Strasbourg view that at
least some non-domestic violence private family cases can be
sufficiently important to require legal aid, given the importance of
the issues to the lives of the parties, especially the

Amendment 96 would allow the director additionally to fund excluded

in the particular circumstances of the case, having regard to the
interests of justice. The phrase “interests of justice”
is capable in the context of wide interpretation, and I have no doubt
that that is the right hon. Gentleman’s intention. However,
amendments 96 and 97 would together result in a power considerably

where, in the particular circumstances of a case, failure to do so
would be likely to amount to a breach of the individual right to legal

impossible or lead to an obvious unfairness in the proceedings. It is a
high threshold, but in considering whether legal aid should be provided
in an individual case, the director of legal aid casework will need to
take into account such things as the importance of the issues to the
individual concerned and the nature of the rights at stake, the
complexity of the case, the capacity of the individual to represent
themselves efficiently and alternative means of securing access to

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would have the further effect of retaining the significant
wider public interest criteria for all excluded cases. We believe that
that would not focus our limited resources effectively enough on those
matters that we consider sufficiently important to justify the use of
public funds.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Significant
wider public interest currently means that the resolution of the case
has the potential to benefit other people, and that legal aid will
assist in delivering those benefits, but in the Government’s
view, the simple fact that a number of other people may stand to
benefit from the resolution of a case does not necessarily mean that
the case should be funded exceptionally. For example, the criteria can
be used to fund business cases where the likely beneficiaries would be
other business men. Again, our approach on that point is consistent
with our overall approach in the Bill. We propose that public interest
should be a feature of the merits test for individual in-scope cases
and that it should no longer be used as a basis for bringing tranches
of cases back into scope.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000093">&#160;</a>

but let me continue for the moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman will be aware that clause 94 allows funding
to be provided for representation in inquest cases where the director
makes a wider public interest determination. It is right to retain
wider public interest criteria in such proceedings because by their
nature, inquests are concerned with matters different from those
involved in civil litigation more generally. Inquest proceedings may
offer lessons to be learned about potentially life-threatening
practices that could affect other lives. In the Government’s
view, providing exceptional funding for cases and inquests where there
is a significant wider public interest may help to prevent
deaths.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The wider
public interest test is narrowly drawn for inquests in that it is the
litigant’s representation at the inquest that must provide wider
benefits, not merely the holding of the inquest itself. In addition,
the cases described in proposed subsection (3A) would not be likely to
require exceptional funding as they are precisely the types of case for
which legal aid would generally remain available. The new scope of
civil legal aid targets funding on those who need it most and the most
serious cases in which legal aid or representation is justified. The
Bill therefore provides that funding will continue to be routinely
available for cases where people’s life or liberty is a stake,
and where they are at risk of serious physical harm or the immediate
loss of their home. Legal aid will continue to be provided for cases
involving significant breaches of human rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me take
the right hon. Gentleman back to the fundamental purpose of the reforms
and the exceptional funding system. I remind the Committee that the
changes included in the Bill will make civil legal aid more focused,
effective and sustainable. Legal aid has expanded far beyond its
original scope and many of the current areas of availability should not
require any legal expertise to resolve. The changes will encourage
people to seek early resolution of disputes and improve affordability.
Access to legal aid will remain for those most in need and for the most
serious cases in which legal advice or representation is justified. It
is right to have an exceptional funding scheme to provide an essential
safeguard for the protection of an individual’s fundamental
right to access to justice, and clause 9 achieves that important end,
but expanding the criteria for exceptional funding in the way suggested
by the amendment would undermine our approach on scope and our
rationale for making changes to the legal aid
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000098">&#160;</a>

lacking mental capacity. Let me make it clear that children and those
who lack mental capacity are among the most vulnerable members of

               <p class="tabbed">As
I stated, clause 9 will enable the director to provide funding in an
individual case where the failure to do so would be likely to amount to
a breach of an individual’s rights under the ECHR. The
individual’s capacity to represent himself or herself will
obviously be an important part of that assessment, but the question
whether legal aid is required to protect fundamental rights of access
to justice will always turn on the individual facts of each case. The
right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd made a point about that.
Parents often bring cases on behalf of children, as their litigation
friend. That would be taken into consideration in deciding whether they
have the ability to present their own case, but the amendment would
introduce a blanket rule that was not capable of taking into account
all relevant circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
considering whether exceptional funding should be granted in an
individual case, we will consider the client’s ability to
present their own case, the complexity of the issues, the importance of
the issues at stake and all other relevant circumstances. Where a child
brings an action without a litigation friend, that will be a relevant
factor in deciding whether they have the ability to present their own
case. However, in the vast majority of non-family civil cases involving
children, their parents and guardians bring proceedings on their
behalf. That means that children do not generally need to instruct a
legal adviser themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Stretford and Urmston asked whether there would be legal aid
for gathering evidence of abuse. Funding will continue to be available
where there are allegations and civil claims of abuse of a child or
vulnerable adult. People do not need to prove the abuse exists first.
She also asked about retaining funding for children. I can tell her and
the hon. Member for Stockton North, who spoke about funding and asked
about costs, that we will continue to provide approximately £130
million of legal aid per annum for the representation of child parties.
That represents about 95% of the current spend, so the percentage
reduction in the spend on children will be about
5%.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000104">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 227
would ensure that civil legal services were provided for the purposes
of making an exceptional funding application. I assure the Committee
that the Government will implement appropriate procedures to ensure
that those who require exceptional funding will, in practice, be able
to access the scheme. To that end, we will of course engage with all
interested parties, including key stakeholders, to discuss relevant
procedural issues such as contracting and remuneration and the
important practical questions surrounding applications to which her
amendment alludes. On that basis, I hope that hon. Members will
withdraw their amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000109">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Although I am
partly reassured by some of the things that the Minister said, I still
have doubts. Some powerful and well argued speeches were made this
morning, not least by the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston. It
would be better in the circumstances if the Minister took away the
matter for further consideration, because my amendments were not meant
to drive a coach and horses through the Bill. He said in response to an
intervention that class actions are a thing of the past. Many citizens
over the years have had redress through class actions funded by legal
aid, and many landmark decisions and changes in the law have been
made.  All that will become a thing of the past, which is
disappointing.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000112">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I am not one
to press everything to a vote for the sake of doing so, but I believe
that this part of the Bill is important, so I seek the
Committee’s leave to press both my amendments to a Division. I
do so in the knowledge that despite the outcome of the Division, the
matter will undoubtedly be revisited in the other place and when the
Bill returns to the Floor of the House. I hope that in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 422<a class="bkMark" name="Column422">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the ensuing weeks and months, the Minister will reflect further on my
amendment and understand that neither it nor the others were intended
to be wrecking amendments, but were intended to improve the Bill. If we
are here to do anything, we are here to improve the Bill, whether we
are helped by Liberty, the Bar Council or anybody else. If we decide to
use their advice, that is a matter for our discretion, much as the
Minister—with respect to him—read verbatim the brief that
he was handed by civil servants.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000113">&#160;</a>

persuade members of the Committee are unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 98
would build an assurance into statute that the Lord Chancellor will
ensure the merits criteria that he sets for civil legal aid reflect the
factors listed in subsection (3). I can confirm that the Lord
Chancellor must consider the extent to which the factors ought to be
reflected in the merits criteria and that is made clear in the wording
of the clause. It is important that we retain some flexibility in
setting the merits criteria so that we can take account of changing
economic and policy circumstances. In addition, it would not make sense
to force the Lord Chancellor to reflect all the criteria in the merits
tests of all cases. That is not what currently happens. The formulation
in the clause is based on section 8(2) of the Access to Justice Act
1999. Having a set of factors underpinning the merits criteria means
that fundamental principles will remain enshrined in the tests of
receiving civil legal aid—common-sense principles, such as cost
versus benefit, prospects of success and the seriousness of the matter
in
hand.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000169">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
99 would put the onus on the director of legal aid casework to
demonstrate a range of circumstances before being able to refuse an
application for legal aid on the basis of alternative funding being
available. In my view, the amendment would be technically unworkable.
The clause as drafted already deals with the underlying concerns. The
amendment would prevent the Lord Chancellor from making regulations
that preclude the refusal of legal aid on the basis of alternative
funding being available unless the director can show first that the
funding is practically accessible;<strong> </strong>secondly, that it is
reasonable to expect the individual to access it; and thirdly, that the
funding would not prevent the individual from being awarded
damages.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000170">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
is not right that the emphasis should be on the director to demonstrate
all those things to refuse a legal aid application. As with nearly all
legal aid applications, the emphasis must remain on the applicant via

formulation proposed would create an inverse application system with
all the additional resource implications that this would require on the
part of the director. Subsection (3)(f) refers

Committee can be assured that the wording of that subsection shows that
we are already taking into account the practical concerns that appear
to have motivated the amendments. We have made a clear and explicit
link to the likelihood of an individual being able to use alternative
services. Our approach is practical rather than theoretical, so I hope
that the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd will accept my

there is a reasonable expectation that the individual will access such
funding will be considered, I am partly reassured. If such
considerations, which are two of the three main components of my

amendment or indeed the clause, because clearly the system that we have
at present is a system in which funding for advice and
help—legal and more general advice—is a moveable feast
and comes in a variety of forms, which is quite right. Many of those
different funding streams are being cut. On Tuesday, we discussed
issues such as the financial inclusion fund, local government funding

kind.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000177">&#160;</a>

non-professional. I am sure his words will come back to haunt him. He

               <p>That
attitude to pro bono work is not one that will be recognised by the
sector. The Minister has no doubt seen representations from the Free
Representation Unit, which states that pro bono—even at its most
professional, which is what the FRU is—cannot possibly replace
legal aid funding in that way. My fear, which may or may not be put to
rest, is that the door will be opened, when an assessment is made, to
unsatisfactory alternatives, not because pro bono advice in context is
not excellent in this country, but because it is being asked to do a
job that it simply is not there to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000181">&#160;</a>

amendment is short and simple. If a civil aid certificate is not
granted that determination should be communicated in writing to the
individual or their representative. The amendment would ensure that
when there is a refusal there would be a reasoned and written decision.
When the interests at stake are so important—for example,
deprivation of legal assistance—it is imperative that such
decisions are rational and based on an accurate assessment of the

to secure an acceptable standard of decision making and ensure that

               <p class="tabbed">The other
day, I delved into history and referred to a time when legal aid boards
were assisted by panels of solicitors. Whenever there was a refusal
under that procedure, a reasoned written decision was given and it is
basic fair play for all concerned that any refusal should be based on
reasonable grounds. We were never slow to explain why a legal aid
application had been refused. That is very important, but a provision
for such a written decision does not appear to be in the Bill at all.
If the Minister assures the Committee that it will be in the Bill that
would be the end of this particular debate, but the provision is rather
important. This is a simple amendment but a significant one none the
less.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000217">&#160;</a>

undermine the fundamental right to legal advice when someone is
arrested and held in custody in a police station. The provision was not
consulted on by the Government—something that has been widely
criticised. Given the importance of a situation where a person is
deprived of their liberty and held in a police station, the provision
should have been subject to consultation. I dare say that the Minister
will say that all the usual suspects, to coin a phrase, will come back
to say the same thing—the Bar Council, Liberty and the rest of
them. That may well be the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000236">&#160;</a>

The contention is that the introduction of means-testing is
inappropriate at a police station, when individuals are at their most
vulnerable and in need of professional assistance. The Bar Council has
assisted me in tabling amendments 102 and 105. Our other friend,
Liberty, has assisted in tabling amendments 103 and

subject to means or merits-testing. The Lord Chancellor would still be
able to make prescriptions on the form and content of determinations,
time limits and circumstances in which they must be withdrawn, but only
in so far as regulations do not lead to an assessment based on the
interests of justice or financial
eligibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000240">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
pose one possibility to the Minister. In years gone by, I represented
clients in police custody. On more than one occasion, they had far more
means of wherewithal 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 429<a class="bkMark" name="Column429">&#160;</a>
                  </div>than I could ever dream of. That may be questionable, but I want to make
the following point in relation to the Lord Chancellor’s
savings. Surely the initial interview at the police station could
proceed on the basis that the solicitor would be paid for the first
couple of hours. The means test could then kick in at a later stage. If
there is to be a contribution or if there is to be a refund, it could
work in that way, providing a balance between the freedom of an
individual facing custody and a means test.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000241">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have to be fair and reasonable; sometimes I could not understand why
people of substantial means were given free legal advice. On the other
hand, by doing what the Government are now saying, people of no means
will lose out. I am not concerned about those who able to finance the
advice; we are not here to prop people up on public funds. Inevitably,
however, the weak and vulnerable—the people who really need the
free legal advice—will not get it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000242">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many have
expressed concern, including our old friend Liberty, about the broad
powers under clause 12. I believe, as Liberty does, that justice
requires as a bare minimum that individuals taken into police custody
have access to legal advice and representation when facing criminal
allegations, with the potential loss of liberty and disruption and
damage to reputation that that entails. As the Minister, who is a
lawyer, well knows, the first couple of hours in custody can be make or
break as to whether the case goes to interview. Most people, when
facing a police interview, particularly for the first time, are anxious
and are often unable to think clearly and respond in a manner
appropriate to the facts of the case, and may not be cognisant of their
best
interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000243">&#160;</a>

suggesting that it would be a good idea if, by some means, someone who
is in the police station could be given free legal advice for an hour

future legal aid for that person. If that procedure were followed, it
would save money, because it would save time and enable the

               <p class="tabbed">Clause
12 makes provision about initial advice and assistance for an
individual who has been arrested and is held in custody at a police
station or other premises. I raised that provision on the Floor of the
House on Second Reading, and the Minister told me that the Government
have no intention of using it if it becomes law. Frankly, with the
greatest respect to the Minister, I simply do not believe the
Government when they say that. I do not suggest for a second that the
Minister misled me when he responded to my comments in the Chamber, but
I think that Governments—including, I am sure, my
own—occasionally say that they do not intend to use particular
provisions in legislation, but of course they do so at some later
point. I respectfully submit that it is absolutely dangerous for the
Government to say, flippantly, that although the provision is in the
Bill they have no intention of using
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000251">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Absolutely. The right hon. Gentleman is a member
of the Bar and has worked as a criminal solicitor, and he makes a valid
point, one that I, too, intend to make shortly. He is right, because
section 58(1) of the 1984 Act provides for just
that—free and independent advice in private from a solicitor of
a defendant’s own choosing. I do not know whether that is the
provision’s exact wording, but that is certainly its sentiment.
I ought also to expand on another point regarding inferences from
silence, about which there is a definite danger relating to European
Court case law.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000256">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clients held
in police custody who are suspected of criminal offences are at their
most vulnerable. Of course, not all detainees are guilty;
some—shock, horror!—are innocent. It does happen. The
evidence suggests, in fact, that the vast majority of people who are
arrested, taken to a police station, and held and questioned, often for
many hours, are released without charge or further action. It is the
most vulnerable who are in that police station situation, and we must
remember that the important presumption in this country is that
suspects of criminal offences are innocent until proven
guilty.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000257">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Speaking
from a practitioner’s point of view, any attempt to introduce
means-testing in a police station—make no mistake about
this—is completely unworkable. Means-testing requires
documentary verification of financial resources, which may not be
available to the individual in custody. When I was in practice, I
experienced numerous cases of clients attending the magistrates court
for the first time. I would start to fill out the CDS14 and eventually
it would become apparent that there was not enough information to put
on the form to submit the application properly. I would therefore ask
the magistrate for an adjournment of the case to allow me to make
further inquiries about the means of the defendant, but it is
impossible to make such inquiries in a police station scenario. The
defendant might be arrested for a serious criminal offence, so the
representative, whether a solicitor or an accredited police station
representative—<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000258">&#160;</a>

the provision for means-testing clients in a police station was
completely unworkable. It is not hard to imagine situations in which
legal representation might be denied due to difficulties in assessing
means. That is serious. I give the Committee an example involving a
client I represented. I was on call one weekend a couple of years ago.
At about 3 o’clock on Sunday evening, or rather Monday morning,
my pager sounded. I answered it and contacted the police station, to be
told that the client wanting to speak to me was a chap who had been
arrested in London and brought to Hull on suspicion of murder. They
wanted me to give him advice over the phone, but I thought that it was
best to see him face to face, for obvious reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Members can

arrested or the seriousness of the case, but about how much cash he
has. It is absolutely unworkable, and it beggars belief, I respectfully

put it in the bin now. I invite the Minister to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
other, important legal reasons why the provision should be scrapped.
Section 34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 provides
that a trial court can draw an adverse inference from a
defendant’s decision not to speak to the police or at trial.
That point is significant because there is case law on the subject; I
was researching it yesterday
evening.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000267">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
1996 case of John Murray <em>v.</em> the United Kingdom makes the
position clear. I bothered, somehow, to read the entire judgment, which
makes it clear that inferences from silence may be drawn only if a
defendant has had the opportunity to take legal advice. It is important
for the criminal justice system to have a provision that makes it
possible for a trial judge to invite a jury to draw an inference from
someone’s silence when they have been given a good opportunity
to speak to the police. Such a provision allows the members of the jury
to put their minds to the fact that the defendant, for whatever reason,
has chosen not to speak when they have had every opportunity to do so.
From my experience as an advocate, I know that the device tends to
assist the jury in coming to their conclusion and their findings in the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000268">&#160;</a>

representations. I am concerned that the Government have failed to

it was published, the clause was the cause of great consternation and
controversy. In fact, a lot of the Bill is the subject of controversy,
but this clause particularly so, not simply due to its contents but as
a result of the surrounding circumstances. As the right hon. Member for
Dwyfor Meirionnydd said, there was no consultation; the provision came
out of the blue. The Minister might wish to clear up all the confusion,
and to explain why that happened in that way with this clause. I accept
that it was an honest misrepresentation, but when on Second Reading it
was understandably put to the Lord Chancellor that the provision was an
outrageous step to take, he claimed that its provenance came from the
previous Government. I am pleased to say that he has put the record
straight on that—saying that that was never the case. I wonder,
however, why the matter even arose, other than that it was due to the
Government’s own
embarrassment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000272">&#160;</a>

then had the issue of not implementing the clause, with which I know

objections to the clause are many and from many sources. We will, of
course, attribute them as has now become customary. However, the clause
should not be in the Bill even if there is no intention to implement

importance should be dealt with on a subsequent occasion perhaps many
years into the future without being considered as a part of primary
legislation at the time when the Government intend to implement it. For

right to speak to a solicitor when detained in the police station is an
important bulwark against abuses of power against individuals who are
entirely under the control of individual police officers. In addition,
it serves as a protection for the police against false allegations of

past 25 years, having been introduced in the light of the abuses by the
West Midlands and Metropolitan Police in the 1970s and early

                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> The hon. Gentleman did stay, and I
apologise for suggesting that he did not. He set a very good example
that I am sure all other members of the Committee will follow in future
when the Minister and I are speaking on such important matters in the
Chamber. Fortunately, a large number of Conservative Members of the
Eurosceptic persuasion stayed to keep the Minister company and
therefore I had quite an enjoyable ringside seat for that
exchange.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000283">&#160;</a>

                  </div>a point that the Government and the Opposition disagree on. It is
important because it will give something like the same rights that we
now take for granted under PACE to other jurisdictions throughout the
EU among the other 26 countries who have—let us say—a
variable record on the detention and treatment of suspects on arrest.
Indeed, <em>Hansard</em> refers to some of the notorious cases of British
citizens who have been detained in the most appalling conditions by
European countries and treated appallingly in ways that we would find
very peculiar here. Therefore there was a disagreement about whether to
support the opt-in at the moment. However, I do not think that there is
any disagreement now that supporting the opt-in is the
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000284">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My fear is
that, whether it is intentional or not, the enactment of clause 12 will
leave the door open to a weakening of the position that we have
carefully crafted and established in the light of evidence and bad
practice in this country. That is something that I would regret. That
fear—whether it is grounded or not—could be easily
assuaged, simply by withdrawing the clause. The Minister says that he
has no intention of implementing it, but there cannot be any basis for
weakening rights, even if it is—as has been said in the
submissions—to protect the police. We now have video in custody
suites, which we did not have before, and we have clear codes of
practice and clear guidance. In that respect, policing has improved
immeasurably in the last 25 years. Whether it is to protect the rights
of the suspect—the arrested or detained person—or simply
because it is an important constitutional principle, the clause has no
part in any justice Bill. I ask the Minister to withdraw the clause, or
to explain why the clause, which he says he has no plans—I think
that was his phrase—to action if enacted, remains in the Bill.
It appears to have nothing to do with the other provisions in the Bill
and nothing to do with the intention of the Government in introducing
these proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000288">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>This group of amendments, starting with
amendment 102, seeks to amend clause 12, which deals with legal aid
determinations where an individual is arrested and held in custody at a
police station or other premises. The broad effect of the group of
amendments would be that people held in custody at a police station
would qualify automatically for initial advice and initial assistance
under clause 12, where the interests of justice require it. As the hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull East said, advice and assistance in a
police station is not currently means-tested, and I can

			Column number: 436<a class="bkMark" name="Column436">&#160;</a>
                  </div>confirm that there are no immediate plans to change that. Clause 12 does
not require means-testing. Rather it provides for flexibility to make
regulations to apply means-testing if it were considered appropriate to
do so in future. The hon. Gentleman and others had concerns about both
the principle and the practicality of means-testing in relation to
advice and assistance to those in custody and the interaction with the
codes of practice issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000289">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">On
the point of principle, the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull East also asked about the requirement in
section 34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. He said
that an adverse inference could be drawn from silence and he cited the
case of John Murray <em>v</em>. United Kingdom. He said that access to a
lawyer was necessary in that instance. It is clear that in cases in
which the European Court of Human Rights requires the provision of
legal aid it is permissible for legal aid to be subject to
means-testing. Article 6(3)(c) states that the right to free legal aid
is for persons who do not have sufficient means to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 437<a class="bkMark" name="Column437">&#160;</a>
                  </div>pay for legal assistance. He also questioned the value of early advice
to the later prosecution process. Of course, that is often helpful and
the right thing. However, we cannot force people to accept legal
advice. In fact, only about 56% of people held in custody ask for
advice from a
lawyer.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000299">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It really is turning things on their head if we
say that because some people do not ask for legal advice, we should use
our own discretion as to whether to give legal advice. We were lectured
by the Government for more than a decade about unnecessary legislation,
so I am afraid it rings rather hollow to say that we are putting
clauses in for a rainy day in case we need them. Will the Minister
simply answer this point? Will he justify the purpose—let us
leave aside the timing—and explain why the Government think it
is the right thing to
do?<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000300">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I was going to come to that, but first I must
point out that the hon. Member for Hammersmith made reference to the
opt-in to the directive, which I think reinforces the high standards of
access to legal advice that exist in this country. I am pleased that he
brought up that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000301">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
answer the hon. Gentleman’s substantive question, yes, our
general starting point is that those who can afford to pay for or
contribute towards the cost of their case should do so. Presumably,
that is, or was, the policy of the Opposition when they introduced
means-testing for magistrates courts and the Crown court. Likewise, it
seems counter-intuitive that the state should pick up the bill for
police station advice for those who can readily afford to pay. We also
start from the position that criminal legal aid will be available where
required by the interest of
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000302">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
accept that any financial eligibility assessment would have to be much
simpler than the current means test representation in the magistrates
court or the means test applicable to the contribution orders in the
Crown court—a point that was made by the hon. Member for
Kingston upon Hull East. Any means test may have to be carried out
after the provision of advice and assistance.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000303">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I find that extremely frustrating. Could the
Minister give me an example to show how that would be workable? How,
practically speaking, would it be possible for a solicitor attending a
police station to go through the means-testing procedure so that they
are able to satisfy an application for legal aid? Give us a
clue.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000304">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My opinion is that as things stand, the
practicalities are the greatest stumbling block, and costs could be
significant. The right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd weighed up
the benefits of free advice in a police station with the other side of
paying for that and my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe looked at
some of the practicalities.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000305">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">England and
Wales will not be the first jurisdiction to restrict legal advice in
police stations on financial eligibility grounds or to require the
payment of a contribution. At the moment, in Ireland, the Garda station
legal advice scheme is available only to persons who are in receipt of
social welfare payments or persons whose earnings are less than
€20,316 per annum. In Scotland, police station 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 438<a class="bkMark" name="Column438">&#160;</a>
                  </div>advice is available to all, but those who can afford to do so have to
make a financial contribution of between £7 and £135,
depending on their disposable income level. However, as I have already
indicated, we do not have any immediate plans to introduce
means-testing in England and Wales for those in
custody.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000306">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would also prevent the Lord Chancellor from setting out in
regulation the procedures that the director must follow in making
determinations as currently provided for in subsection (6). They would
also mean that initial advice and assistance would not be defined. The
Access to Justice Act 1999 does not define what is meant by advice and
assistance, whereas the Legal Aid Act 1988 did. We considered that a
definition of initial advice and assistance would be helpful, and that
is provided in subsection (8). The definition is relatively wide, so we
felt that it would be wise to enable the Lord Chancellor to specify in
regulation that certain things are not to be considered as initial
advice and assistance under clause 12. The 1988 Act contained a similar
power. I stress that the intention is not to use the power to exclude
the sort of advice and assistance currently provided as part of the
criminal defence service.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000307">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are not necessary. It is appropriate that the Government are
able to define and establish appropriate qualifying criteria and
procedures for a service that is paid for by the public. The Bill
already reflects the important principle that criminal legal aid
determinations made by the director should take into account the
interest of justice. I therefore invite right hon. and hon. Members to
withdraw their

discussion about the clause. I hope that Government Members note that
we have not pressed for stand part debates, because we have had
adequate discussions about clauses that we regard as controversial and

clause 12 should not be in the Bill. The right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull East
have argued in great detail and with authority. The Minister’s
response confirmed my view. He seemed to say that not even the
Government regard the measure as practicable, that there are barriers
to its being put into effect and that they share our enthusiasm for the
current statutory framework and the security that it provides. There
can therefore be no basis for the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000342">&#160;</a>

is a fundamental matter of civil liberties. I will not do this often
during our debates in Committee, because there is frankly not much
point, but I look briefly to the Liberal Democrat members of the
Committee. They have represented themselves, certainly during my time
in the House, as the party of civil liberties. They have raised
concerns about the liberty of the subject many times, and this matter
could not be a clearer instance of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000343">&#160;</a>

can see other instances in the cases that were cited last night,
although I am pleased to say that we will not now have a regime with
such a tie in this country. There have been causes
célèbres concerning British citizens abroad because of
the failure to obtain clear advice—the advice is sometimes
straightforward, although it might not be clear to a lay
person—about their rights on arrest, and their rights to demand
to see evidence or to

               <p class="tabbed">That
is not the same, as the Minister implied, as looking at the case when
it comes to the magistrates or the Crown court, where there is more
independent scrutiny and there has been more time to assess the
situation than for someone in extremis, who has been arrested and
detained and who urgently needs to have advice. It is difficult to
think of any circumstances in which those people should not be entitled
to that advice. For those reasons, and because of the paucity of the
Government’s explanation, we oppose the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000345">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I associate myself fully with what the hon.
Gentleman has said. I will not repeat the arguments, but I feel equally
strongly about the matter. As well as the question of liberty and civil
rights, the point is that we are being asked to make bad law—to
legislate an unworkable part of the law. In my 20 years’
experience in this place, this is the first time I have heard a
Minister say in Committee, “You know, it isn’t workable,
but we’ll have it anyway for some time in the future, but who
knows?” Either it is workable, subject to regulations being
approved, or it is not. Clearly, it is not, and we are being asked to
pass bad legislation, which is not why we are
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000346">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We have spoken about the issue at length, so I
shall be brief. From the Government’s point of view, the issue
is not about fundamental rights to civil liberties. We have civil
liberties and due process in this country, and in no way are we
proposing to delete them. The question of charging is not for the ECHR;
other countries currently charge. I have been into the various legal
aspects that hon. Members have
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000347">&#160;</a>

agree that there are questions about practicalities, and we are not
currently consulting on the measure because we are not proposing to put
it into effect. At some time in the future, it might be seen as
something to bring forward, and at that point we would have to look
carefully at the practicalities—how it is conducted in other
countries and how it might be done cost-effectively—and there
would then be a full consultation. But we are not at that point
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000348">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> These amendments are short, in that they would
change only two words, but their effect would be far-reaching. They
would ensure that the Lord Chancellor made provision for criminal legal
services to be available for those within the criminal justice system
in specified circumstances, having regard to the all-important
interests of justice. That would reflect the current regime under the
Access to Justice Act 1999. The amendments would further oblige the
Lord Chancellor to provide the right of appeal against a decision not
to provide legal services, which I referred to on the first day of our
deliberations. In the past, that has always worked well. I hope that
the Government will reflect on it and bring it in. It is only right
that that should be
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000379">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">With
the abolition of the Legal Services Commission and the transfer of its

accompanies primary legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000380">&#160;</a>

subject of criminal proceedings, should be able to receive advice and
assistance.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000382">&#160;</a>

creates a power to make regulations to prescribe what advice and

section 13(1)(b) of the Access to Justice Act 1999. We have conferred a
power to make regulations in clause 14 for consistency with that
section, which provides that the Legal Services Commission’s
duty to provide advice and assistance to the individuals mentioned
there only arises in prescribed circumstances.

we see these regulations? Frankly, the issue is difficult. I associate
myself with the amendments tabled by the right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd; they seem reasonable. On the other hand, it is difficult
to take a clear view on some of these matters without the regulations

               <p class="tabbed">Although
clause 14 of the Bill and section 13(1)(b) of the Access to Justice Act
1999 are framed differently, their overall effect is essentially the
same. Advice and assistance for criminal proceedings is distinct from
that provided for in clause 12 for individuals in custody. The services
covered by the clause include those provided by a duty solicitor in
court or to a prisoner preparing for his appearance before the parole
board. In making a decision on regulations under clause 14, the Lord
Chancellor will take into account any legal obligations, including the
requirements of article 6 of ECHR, and clause 14(3) requires
the Lord Chancellor, when making regulations under the clause, to have
regard in particular to the interests of justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000386">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We consider
that maintaining the status quo is to be preferred to moving towards a
duty on the Lord Chancellor, which would remove his discretion to
consider a range of factors in deciding what and where advice and
assistance is most appropriate for individuals subject to criminal
proceedings. Amendment 107 would require regulations made by the Lord
Chancellor under clause 14(1) to provide for reviews or appeals in
relation to determinations on legal aid set out in clause
14(9).<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000387">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We think it
more appropriate to allow the Lord Chancellor to make regulations if he
considers it appropriate than to require him to do so. It is our
intention to retain the existing arrangements, whereby advice and
assistance have a sufficient benefits test conducted by the litigator.
There is no appeal to a court or LSC based on the test, and there are
no plans to introduce appeals provisions immediately, although clause
14(9) will allow us to introduce provisions for reviews and appeals in
future if that is considered appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000388">&#160;</a>

return to the amendment’s effect, procedures for review and
appeal might not be necessary or proportionate, in any event, in
establishing whether all criteria specified in regulations under
subsection (5) were met. For example, if the criterion were that the
provider must hold a contract to provide such services, an appeal would
not be necessary to establish whether the provider held a contract. We
therefore believe that a duty to secure such arrangements would be
unnecessarily heavy-handed. I invite the right hon. Gentleman to
withdraw his amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000389">&#160;</a>

will explain the purpose and effect of the amendments. Section 12 of
the Access to Justice Act 1999 enshrined the right to legal advice for
individuals involved in criminal investigations or proceedings. That
right would be withdrawn under schedule 5 of the Bill, and it has not
been replaced by an equivalent provision. The amendments would ensure
that an individual qualifies for representation in the interests of
justice when any of the five factors in subsection 2(a) to (e)
apply.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 126
is designed to limit broad Executive powers to set the agenda for
provision of criminal aid. It would remove the Lord Chancellor’s
power to add to or vary the factors to be considered in determining
whether an individual qualifies for representation in criminal matters,
except in primary legislation. There is no objection to the matter
coming fully before the House in a proper manner, in the form of a
short Bill. However, it should not happen
otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000411">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I rise to speak about amendment 126. The clause
provides for the way in which the director or court must make
determinations about whether an individual qualifies for representation
in criminal proceedings. Subsection (1) requires the director or a
court to determine whether an individual qualifies on the grounds of
means and in the interests of justice. Subsection (2) lists the factors
that must be taken into account when deciding whether a person
qualifies for such representation.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000412">&#160;</a>

16(3) gives the Lord Chancellor a power to add or to vary those

the Bill to allow the scope of qualification for representation to be

carefully to the Minister in the previous debate in which I, too,

represent clients for free, perhaps in a police station setting, given
that they are intent on keeping clause 12 in its entirety. Perhaps the
hope is that the client whom the lawyer represents may be charged, and
eventually the solicitor may be paid for the services. That is
absolutely appalling, to put it mildly. The Government should consider
the position and support the amendment. I

we look at the criteria under subsection (2), which my hon. Friend has
just run through—matters to do with the loss of liberty; a
substantial question of law; individuals’ inability to
understand proceedings, and complex matters of tracing witnesses,
expert cross-examination and the interests of another person—I
invite the Minister to say under what circumstances he can envisage
that that should not be the case. Even if he can envisage that, why
should that not be a matter for primary legislation and full
consultation and debate rather than being done by order? He could have
included in subsection (3), “may amend the order by adding a
factor”, and it might not have attracted so much attention. The
idea that such fundamental aspects can be deleted by order is very
worrying. It adds to matters such as the dormant clause 12 and what I
referred to a few moments ago: the excess of delegation to regulation.
That is not proper scrutiny. These are fundamental changes to the
system of law and nonsense is being made of the Committee by our having

			Column number: 446<a class="bkMark" name="Column446">&#160;</a>
                  </div>were incorporated into legal aid legislation under both the Legal Aid
Act 1988 and the Access to Justice Act 1999. They broadly reflect the
requirements of the ECHR. Article 6(3)(c) of the ECHR provides
expressly for the right for a person to defend himself in person or
through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not
sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when
the interests of justice so require.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000424">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
considering the interests of justice aspect of this test, the European
Court of Human Rights has considered the following factors: the
seriousness of the alleged offence and the severity of the potential
sentence; the complexity of the proceedings and the personal
circumstances of the individual and their ability to make a useful
contribution to their legal analysis without legal assistance and to
put their case in a concrete and effective way. A decision on the
interests of justice test is based on the facts of each and every case,
and takes into account the circumstances of the individual. It is, with
respect, too simplistic to say that the test is automatically passed if
any one of the factors is
present.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000425">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will give an example to illustrate my point. In some cases, it may be
enough for only one factor to be met—for example, because the
risk of imprisonment is so high if the person is convicted or because
the person’s ability to represent themselves is so impaired. In
other cases, the cumulative effect of the factors may be needed for the
interests of justice to require legal aid. For example, if the risk of
imprisonment is very remote due to established case law, other factors
may need to be present for the interests of justice to be
met.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000426">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
interests of justice test has served us well for 45 years
and I can see no justification for such a radical departure, which
would serve only to provide legal aid to individuals when it is not
really in the interests of justice to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000427">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
126 would omit subsection (3) from clause 16, which is the power for
the Lord Chancellor to use secondary legislation, subject to the
affirmative procedure, to add or vary the list of factors in
subsection (2). I should point out to the hon. Members for
Kingston upon Hull East and for Hammersmith that such a power is
included at paragraph 5 of schedule 3 to the 1999 Act. Although that
power has not been used to date, it continues to be appropriate to have
a power to add or to vary the factors, to allow for legal developments
on the requirements of the interests of justice. Given my explanations,
I urge the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000428">&#160;</a>

undoubtedly be returned to when the Bill returns to the Floor of the

               <p>The
amendment would remove the power of the Lord Chancellor to create
exceptions by regulation to the right to appeal a decision by the
director that an individual is not eligible for representation within
the legal aid system. In effect, the amendment would add an extra layer
of protection for individuals refused legal aid in criminal matters.
That is particularly important in a context where the executive is
seeking to reserve to itself extensive powers to regulate criminal
legal aid provision by means of secondary legislation. Having been here
a while, I understand that secondary legislation is an important part
of the way we do things in this place, but the Bill is beginning to
read like a charter for someone to introduce whatever they like under
secondary legislation. That leaves me feeling rather uncomfortable. I
hope that the Minister will consider the amendment in the light of what
I have
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000436">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As the right hon. Gentleman has just said,
amendment 127 would remove the Lord Chancellor’s ability to make
exceptions from subsection (6) of clause 17. That subsection
provides that in appeals against a determination by the director, the
interests of justice do not require representation to be made available
for the purposes of criminal proceedings or do not require such
representation to continue and may be made to a prescribed court,
tribunal or other body. The current position is that an appeal to a
court is allowed in relation to proceedings in magistrates courts when
the court staff have determined that the interests of justice do not
require representation. Our intention is to maintain the current system
and to make regulations that provide an appeal route for those who fail
the interests of justice test if the test was carried out
administratively rather than by a court or
tribunal.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000437">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Appeals
are not necessary in the Crown court as all cases on indictment are
deemed to have passed the interests of justice test. It is appropriate
to allow for exceptions from any right to appeal so as to exclude Crown
court cases and any cases where the interests of justice test was
conducted by a court or tribunal rather than
administratively.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000438">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of allowing an appeal is to enable an independent court,
tribunal or other body to reconsider the interests of justice test
afresh. There will still be some circumstances in which a court may
grant an initial representation order. In those cases, the court will
effectively have conducted the interests of justice test. It is
therefore inappropriate to give an individual another avenue of appeal
if the initial decision was made by a court or tribunal. I therefore
urge the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000439">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is understandable that regulations need to
be made with respect to eligibility, and I do not want to make a point
on that, but it means that we do not have clear guidance on where the
Government are going, other than what was in the consultation documents
and the amendments to one or two of the more outlandish proposals on
contributions. Those suggested—I think the phrase that the
Government used was “skin in the game”—a wilful
desire for people, whatever their income or hardship levels, to make
some investment as a principle more than as a financial contribution.
That certainly was a departure. I hope that the Government will not
persist with that attitude, as it brings a completely new element into
the purpose of legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000463">&#160;</a>

consultation paper and what the right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd has referred to. However, we know that the Government are
looking everywhere for money and take a cavalier attitude to the
provision of legal aid, whether through scope or eligibility. For that
reason, it would be appropriate to have some restraint on the powers of
the Lord Chancellor. To anticipate the Minister’s point, that
might not have been appropriate in previous Acts. I take what the right
hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd says: the amendments are probing in
nature, and they have been designed to show the sorts of levels that
may be acceptable at the moment. However, they would at least give the
Minister an opportunity to indicate where the Government are going on
eligibility and how they intend to deal with those matters in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000464">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Amendments 129, 130 and 132, which I take as
probing amendments in line with what right hon. and hon. Members have
said, would make the Lord Chancellor’s powers to set financial
eligibility limits for legal aid and require contributions subject to
certain limitations and qualifications specified in primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000465">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Financial
limits and thresholds for legal aid eligibility have always been set
out in regulations without the qualifications and limitations proposed
by the amendments. Our approach in the Bill is fully consistent with
the approach in the 1999 Act and its predecessor, the Legal Aid Act
1988, in which the Lord Chancellor had a general power to make
regulations about financial eligibility, and the detailed rules were to
be set out in the regulations. We are being clear about how we intend
to exercise that power. To give the clear guidance requested by the
hon. Member for Hammersmith, we intend to replicate the position under
the existing regulations, subject to the three specific changes in
relation to civil legal aid that we confirmed in our consultation
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000466">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
first is abolishing capital passporting, so that all applicants for
civil legal aid will be subject to the same assessment of disposable
capital. The second is imposing a limit of £100,000 on the
disputed assets that can be disregarded when assessing eligibility for
civil legal aid 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 451<a class="bkMark" name="Column451">&#160;</a>
                  </div>at all levels of service, to ensure that legal advice is not provided to
wealthy people contesting ownership of substantial properties. The
third is imposing a modest increase to the monthly income contributions
that civil legal aid recipients with higher incomes are required to
make.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000467">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clauses 20
and 22 provide the framework within which regulations on financial
eligibility and payments by people in receipt of legal aid can operate
for civil and criminal legal aid. There are different financial
eligibility tests for civil and criminal legal aid. However, given that
the amendments appear to be directed specifically at civil legal aid, I
shall approach them on that basis. First, I should observe that the
amendments apply to both criminal and civil legal aid, which would not
be appropriate, given the differing systems in respect of means-testing
and
contributions.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000468">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Part
of the amendments aims to ensure that legal aid applicants with
disposable capital of £3,000 or less are not required to make
any capital contribution. We originally consulted on a proposal to
require a £100 capital contribution to civil legal aid from
persons with disposable capital of £1,000 or more. However,
having considered the responses to the consultation, we decided against
that proposal. We recognise that individuals with low levels of capital
may have assets that are highly variable, and which may represent a
contingency fund. We also recognise the importance of individuals being
able to save to pay for necessities. In addition, the collection of the
fee would deliver only modest savings, which would be offset to an
extent by the administration costs of collecting them. We therefore
have no intention to seek capital contributions to civil legal aid from
those who have disposable capital of £3,000 or less. The
amendments are therefore
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000469">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
the amendments aim to exclude capital in a primary dwelling from being
taken into account when assessing disposable capital. If they were
agreed, that might have the unfortunate effect of rendering wealthy
home owners, with high value properties, financially eligible for legal
aid, thereby diverting limited public legal aid funding from those most
in
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000470">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government originally consulted on proposals that would have tightened
the rules regarding capital held in a person’s dwelling.
However, we listened to respondents’ views about the equity in
their properties and announced that we will retain the current system
of capital disregards in relation to disposable capital. The present
system already allows for significant sums of capital to be disregarded
when assessing disposable capital. For example, £100,000 of
equity in the main dwelling house may be disregarded, and a further
£100,000 may be disregarded in respect of a mortgage for the
person’s property. The current system therefore ensures that
legal aid is targeted on those most in need, while it also recognises
the difficulties that there may be in releasing capital held in
property.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000471">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments also propose to set in primary legislation a threshold of
£316 for the monthly disposable income below which people would
receive free legal aid. That threshold is the current one for income
contributions for civil legal aid. Below that threshold, civil legal
aid does not require income contributions to be paid. The threshold
broadly reflects the level of subsistence benefits 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 452<a class="bkMark" name="Column452">&#160;</a>
                  </div>payments that are intended to cover basic elements, such as food and
utilities. Our consultation proposals therefore focused on increasing
the monthly contributions for people receiving legal aid whose
disposable income exceeded the
threshold.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000472">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
do not therefore intend to lower the threshold from that level. All the
thresholds will continue to be reviewed annually, in keeping with the
current regulatory system. The annual review will not necessarily
result in a change to the threshold, but enables the thresholds and
limits to be altered to allow for economic or legislative
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000473">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would also preclude monthly income contributions that exceed
30% of disposable incomes between £316 and £733, which
presumably relates to the Government’s announcement that we will
increase monthly income contributions to no more than 30% of disposable
income for people who are eligible for civil legal aid and who have a
disposable monthly income of £316 or more. We have therefore
made it clear that we have no plans to raise contributions above 30% of
disposable monthly income. The amendments are therefore unnecessary,
and the possibility that those figures may be revised to reflect
economic or legislative changes means that the amendments are
inappropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000474">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">More
generally, it is not appropriate to seek to set out detailed
qualifications and limitations on financial eligibility in primary
legislation. Those are matters of considerable technical detail, which
is why the thresholds have always been set out in regulations and
should continue to be so. Concepts such as disposable income are
meaningless without the sort of highly detailed and technical rules
that appear in the regulations and which do not sensibly belong in the
Bill. Indeed, it is most undesirable for such matters to be in the
Bill, because that would remove our ability to make the sorts of
technical changes to the detailed rules that are required from time to
time to ensure the effective operation of the
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000475">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments also seek to restrict the Lord Chancellor’s power to
alter the financial eligibility limits set out in the amendments to
alterations catering for variations in the value of sterling. The
financial limits that are set out in regulations are normally reviewed
annually and, following such reviews, the financial limits have
remained unchanged for the past two years. As with the current
regulations, changes will not be automatic. Any future change to the
income limits will be set out in regulations made under the Bill,
subject to parliamentary scrutiny, but the amendments propose
automatically to peg the thresholds to the value of sterling. If they
are intended to capture instances where applicants hold assets or
receive income in foreign currencies, that is already taken into
account when assessing legal aid eligibility and monthly income
contributions. If they are intended to allow for the limits to be
increased in line with inflation, that is already allowed for under the
current system of annual review. Again, the amendments are therefore
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000476">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
operate the legal aid scheme effectively and efficiently, we need to
continue to set out the details of the financial eligibility rules in
regulations rather than in primary legislation, and to retain the
current system of review. That will allow decisions on limits to be
taken in the light of economic and legislative changes, and for
Parliament to scrutinise those decisions and their likely impact
on

Schedule 2 enables regulations to authorise the court to make a motor
vehicle order as a form of enforcement action in relation to sums
payable for criminal legal aid that have not been paid.
Amendment 42 makes the language in paragraph 4 of schedule 2
consistent with paragraph 2(1) of the same schedule by referring to the
person to whom an amount is due for the provision of criminal legal aid
services, rather than the person to whom the amount is payable.

to put on record the serious concern that Opposition Members have about
the single telephone gateway and the way it is being rolled out. It has
been ill thought out and has not been properly consulted on, and is
opposed by almost all providers at all levels as a way of accessing
legal aid. It is one of the key concerns about the Bill, because it is
a way of strangling access to justice through technical measures at an
early stage. Ironically, it will particularly affect those who are in
most need of that help. Those views have been clearly expressed by
several colleagues at greater length and with more eloquence, so my
comments are simply for the record.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000511">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The effect of the proposals would be to reinstate
the system established by the Access to Justice Act 1999, whereby
provision is made in primary legislation for representatives to receive
payment for work that they have done and undertaken, notwithstanding a
subsequent determination that the individual is ineligible for legal
aid. The amendments would also remove the Lord Chancellor’s
power to redefine by regulation the relationship between service
provider and service recipient. The situation that I have described
arises in a few cases each year, and it can be financially burdensome
to providers. I am sure that the Minister will respond in detail to the
amendments, which raise an important matter, and I should be grateful

                  </strong> Clause 27 makes important provisions about the
providers of services. As the right hon. Gentleman said, amendment 110
would remove the Lord Chancellor’s power to make exceptions to
the general rules set out in subsection (1), but we believe that it is
important to be able to make such exceptions in specific areas. For
example, the Legal Services Commission relies on similar provision in
the Access to Justice Act 1999 to waive the rules of privilege and
confidentiality regarding disclosure of information relating to the
cases of clients, or former clients, funded by the commission. Such
information is used for audit and assessment, and other relevant
functions of the LSC, such as investigating the statutory charge. We
envisage making similar regulations in future, because such provisions
are necessary to ensure that public money is properly spent and that we
receive value for money from
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000518">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 111, subsection (3) allows regulations to specify when a
provider can be paid for work undertaken if the right to legal aid is
subsequently withdrawn. The amendment would allow providers to be paid
where legal aid is withdrawn for any reason. It is both fair and
appropriate that providers are paid for the work that they undertake in
some, but not all, cases where legal aid is subsequently withdrawn. It
is appropriate that the detail, including what payments are made, is
set out in secondary legislation. The Criminal Defence Service
(Funding) Order 2007, for example, includes detailed provisions about
payments to litigators depending on the timing of the withdrawal or
transfer of legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000519">&#160;</a>

regard to civil legal aid, the LSC will remunerate solicitors for the
work that they have carried out prior to the discharge or revocation of

clause 5 enables the Lord Chancellor or the director to transfer
services to a person or employees of that person authorised by the Lord
Chancellor or the director for that purpose, the code of conduct
provisions in clause 28 only extend the code to civil servants and
employees of a body established and maintained by the Lord Chancellor.
The effect would be that employees of a body or person to whom
functions of the Lord Chancellor or the director have been transferred,
but who are not civil servants or employees of a body established and
maintained by the Lord Chancellor, will not be subject to the Lord
Chancellor’s code of conduct. That code will include duties of
confidentiality and the avoidance of discrimination and conflicts of
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000527">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Bar
Council has assisted me in proposing the amendment. It believes that
the amendment would extend the code of conduct to cover all individuals
exercising functions of the Lord Chancellor or the director. It is an
important amendment and deserves careful consideration, and I look

say.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000528">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Amendment 112 would subject a body exercising a
function of the Lord Chancellor or the director under the delegation
provisions in clause 5 to the code of conduct in clause 28 when
providing services to an individual. The code of conduct under clause
28 must be observed in relation to the provision of legal services to
an individual by civil servants and by those employed by a body
established by the Lord Chancellor under clause 2. Clause 2 enables the
Lord Chancellor to establish a body to provide services under part 1 of
the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000529">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, the body established by the LSC to provide legal aid is the
public defender service. Public defenders are employees of the LSC. The
Bill will transfer responsibility for the public defender service to
the Lord Chancellor under clause 2 of the Bill. Those employed in the
PDS must currently comply with a statutory code of conduct. The code is
important to public defenders and provides them with some distinct
protections relating to their unique status as public servants and
legal professionals. The safeguards include a number of duties around
their conduct, including most importantly an overriding duty to protect
the interests of the client, and other matters, including how to handle
and report an excessive caseload.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000530">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government believe that the code is an important safeguard for public
defenders, and that is why we have replicated it in clause 28, which
adds to those existing

                  </div>safeguards and ensures that civil servants and the employees of a body
established and maintained by the Lord Chancellor shall, when providing
legal aid services to an individual, not be subject to the direction of
the Lord Chancellor. Amendment 112 would make the code not
apply to the public defender service. The Government do not support
that position.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000531">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman may wish the code at clause 28 to apply only to civil
servants and to a person, or employees of a person, to whom functions
have been delegated by the Lord Chancellor. The rationale behind the
delegation provisions is primarily practical. In practice, neither the
Lord Chancellor nor the director is going to be in a position to
personally carry out all the functions laid out in part 1. The
amendment is therefore not necessary. The code is specifically designed
to safeguard the professional status of public defenders and was
developed to complement existing professional codes of conduct rather
than to override them. We do not believe that the code needs to extend
beyond civil servants and the employees of this unique service. In the
light of what I have said I invite the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw
his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000532">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">This new
clause is short and clear. I referred to it earlier in the debate and I
hope that it will be uncontroversial. Funding for legal services is
made up from a variety of ways. Certainly under the previous
Government, it was obtained in an increasing variety of ingenious ways
and formed a composite whole. There is no objection as far as we are
concerned to legal aid funding coming from a variety of sources. It
may—who knows?—relieve some of the Government’s
current problems regarding their inadequate funding thereof. I urge the
Government to accept the new clause. It is unpretentious, and I would
be happy with a yes or no from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000586">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I will be brief. The proposed new clause would
provide
that:<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000587">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>We gave careful
consideration to alternative sources of funding to support the legal
aid fund when drawing up our consultation proposals. Hon. Members will
be aware that we consulted on two alternative sources of funding that
have had some success in other jurisdictions. The consultation paper
sought views on establishing a scheme under which the interest accruing
on sums held by lawyers on behalf of clients would be used to offset
the cost of legal aid. However, many respondents raised 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 462<a class="bkMark" name="Column462">&#160;</a>
                  </div>concerns about both the principle and the practical arrangements of
operating such a scheme, including concerns that the scheme would not
provide a certain income, would be easily avoided, might reduce the
level of pro bono work or competitiveness in the sector, and might
cause significant harm to some small businesses. Having considered the
responses, we recognise that the estimated financial benefits of the
proposal are uncertain, and the impact on providers unclear. We
therefore decided not to pursue the proposals at this stage. We have,
however, decided to proceed with our other proposal for an alternative
source of funding, namely the establishment of a supplementary legal
aid scheme. I briefly described that earlier. This approach will also
ensure that, so far as is possible, legal aid is no more attractive
than conditional fee agreements, as revised in accordance with the
proposals in part 2 of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000588">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Although
this is a rather substantial new clause and the hour is late, I am not
going to leave it unmoved. It would be inserted at page 20. It is in
the nature of a probing amendment, but it would oblige courts and
tribunals that deal with cases funded by legal aid to make these orders
against public authorities where acts of the latter have led to wasted
expenditure, whether that be costs relating to the legal aid fund or
costs incurred by courts or the tribunals
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000594">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
appears to me that the financial objectives being pursued by the
Government will not be well served by the scheme as currently set out
in the Bill. Many of the cost-cutting claims made by the Ministry of
Justice are inadequately reasoned and pay very little regard to the
wider savings that an effective system of early legal help can provide.
Findings by Citizens Advice indicate that for every £1 spent on
legal aid, £10 will be saved in costs to the welfare
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000595">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Without
early interventions, manageable problems can become expensive and
complex to resolve. In the context of social welfare law or debt
advice, for example, what begins as a small issue, which could have
been resolved with the early assistance of a lawyer, can become
extremely costly further down the line. The court’s time and
resources and the legal fees involved in a possession hearing far
outstrip the small sum necessary to secure legal help from a debt
caseworker. Further expenditure may include the significant cost of
re-housing a homeless family in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. The
risk of resorting to crime for those in financial crisis will
contribute to a great social ill and will frequently mean that the
state must incur all the costs involved in bringing a defendant to
trial, not to mention the wider financial and grave social
implications.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000596">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s case for the financial eligibility of reforms to
the legal aid system is based on flawed assumptions. As a starting
point, the Ministry of Justice claims that the legal aid system in this
country is far more expensive than systems in the EU. That is not the
case. Other outside bodies have said that that is an
over-simplification and that it does not account for the increased
litigation costs in an adversarial system of justice. Further, while
litigation costs in England and Wales are higher than those in some
European countries, our spending on sustaining and managing the court
system is lower than that in other EU jurisdictions. Those assertions
are borne out by research commissioned by the Ministry of Justice and
render the claim that our legal aid system is significantly more
expensive than those operating in comparable democracies somewhat
misleading. In that context, it is easy to see the folly of creating a
system in which many more people will be forced to represent
themselves, thus consuming more of the court’s resources and
shifting costs to another area of the MOJ’s
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000597">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Limiting
legal advice in the manner proposed in the Bill will undoubtedly cost
the UK more in the long term. In addition to ensuring that costly
litigation is a measure of last resort, legal aid helps to ensure that
public services operate effectively and that errors are corrected.
Without the checks currently provided by legal interventions, public
services will not be called to account and standards may well diminish,
resulting in poorer services and greater expenditure in the medium and
longer
term.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000601">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s proposals also perpetuate the myth that the legal
aid budget has reached its current size as a result of unnecessary
litigation instigated by unscrupulous lawyers. That is not the evidence
that we have seen. In the Green Paper that preceded the Bill, the
Government pointed to a culture in which individuals sought legal
remedies unnecessarily and before exploring less expensive and
combative ways of resolving their issues. Again, that is not accepted
by a breadth of individuals and organisations. None of those trends are
recognisable to those who know what is going on in the
field.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000602">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
implication that there is widespread profiteering among legal aid
professionals is an insult to those who work hard—indeed,
tirelessly—for an extremely modest income to support those who
cannot afford to pay for legal help.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000603">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
for the vast majority of individuals embroiled in litigation,
participation in court proceedings provokes great anxiety and is a
significant disruption to their lives. For them, as for many people,
litigation is very much a last resort, only reached after protracted
attempts to resolve a dispute by other means, including both formal and
informal complaints.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000604">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Among the
other organisations in this sector, Liberty believes that the most
effective and just way of curtailing legal aid expenditure is to
encourage a better quality of decision making by public bodies. It is
to be hoped that imposing costs orders on the wasteful activities of
those public bodies would encourage a better quality of decision
making, which in turn would reduce the number of cases that are
unreasonably pursued by public authorities.

                  </div>Although that might initially seem like a simple shifting of costs from
one area of the public sector to another, the belief is that the
increased cost liability in this context will undoubtedly help to
combat a culture of poor-quality decision making and an overt

that are liable to be overturned by the judiciary.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000605">&#160;</a>

new clause that the right hon. Gentleman has tabled and also to set a
challenge to the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Hammersmith, who
says that all of my interventions are spurious. I agree with the
principle that the Law Society is proposing. The reason is that, as we
agreed with the hon. Gentleman and with other Conservative colleagues
in the Justice Committee, the principle of cross-charging within
government is a sensible one, because it encourages better practice.
The idea that robbing Peter to pay Paul is a false economy is not
necessarily right if one can put together a scheme that properly
encourages good practice while at the same time ensuring that claims
and litigation are not put off when they need to be brought
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000607">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Having said
that, I am afraid that I must say to the right hon. Gentleman that the
new clause is not only poorly drafted but rather contradictory in parts
and needs considerable improvement. I hope that the Minister will
follow up on the evidence that he gave to the Justice Committee, when
he seemed very open to the next stage of reform of legal aid, by
looking at cross-charging, insurance systems and a series of other
mechanisms for improving the funding of the legal system. I hope that
at some point in the future the Government will be able to come back to
this idea as a general
idea.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000608">&#160;</a>

thought that we were all going to end the day in perfect harmony, like
in a Mozart opera, but he strays slightly to criticise the new clause.
It might not be perfect. It is, as the right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd said, a probing measure, but it raises an important point,
and one that underlies a great deal of this Bill. It is that blame is
being attached to legally-aided litigants. That will become relevant as
a useful introduction perhaps to part 2 of the Bill, which we will
debate next Tuesday, when we will discuss claimants using conditional
fee agreements. They are held up as the villains and the wasters of
public money in both cases, but often the fault might lie with
defendants, or tort visas, or others who, through their poor decision
making or obstinacy in legal process, are the principal causes of
additional costs to the public purse. Before the Minister responds, I
only say that to show that, without wanting to go into the details of
the clause or delay the Committee further, an important principle is
established here. We should identify the villains and, even if we do
not punish them, we should at least give them incentives to ensure that
the public purse is not unduly dug into.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000609">&#160;</a>

made by Members on both sides of the Committee. My hon. Friend the
Member for Ipswich 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 466<a class="bkMark" name="Column466">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd have quite rightly
reminded the Committee of the work that has been done by the Justice
Committee on the polluter pays principle, and on encouraging and
incentivising Departments to get the decision making right in the first
place rather than shifting the cost on to the Ministry of Justice and
the administration of justice. Not to do so seems unfair to the
Department and to the Ministers who represent it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000610">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
principle of wasted costs is well known to the law. The Prosecution of
Offences Act 1985 contains provisions that are fairly similar to those
set out in the subsection (2) of new clause 3, in particular the
phrase:<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000611">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“improper,
unreasonable or negligent act or
omission”.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000679">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Such
provisions empower courts to impose orders against a prosecuting
authority, particularly the Crown Prosecution Service, if there has
been misconduct that falls short, in the court’s opinion, of the
high standards that are expected. Wasted costs orders are administered
on a regular, if not a daily, basis by Crown court judges up and down
the land. I note that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe nods
assent. I hope that she has not been on the receiving end of a wasted
costs order in her capacity as prosecuting counsel, in which I believe
she worked less often than in her capacity as defence counsel. As
somebody who prosecuted about as many times as he defended, I
encountered mercifully few wasted costs orders.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000612">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The point
remains that that sword of Damocles could be exercised or threatened by
the court if they thought that the conduct of the Crown Prosecution
Service was falling below the standard that we should reasonably
expect. Often, the threat of a wasted costs order would be enough to
get the authority to do its job correctly.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000613">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Before I sit
down, I want to make the point that in the context of the Department
for Work and Pensions, the scenario could be somewhat different. I
imagine that the decision makers in the Department for Work and
Pensions might be subject to a different budget from those who were
responsible for conducting appeals in the tribunal. There may well be
an element of distance between those two parts of the Department that
possibly would not create as much of an incentive to carry out its
decision making in a proper way, as for example within the Crown
Prosecution Service. I am more familiar with the culture of the Crown
Prosecution Service from my work with it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000614">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">None the
less, the principle as adumbrated by the right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd is important, and I know that the Government will give it
anxious consideration. For the purposes of today’s debate, the
probing new clause is welcome and it has allowed Members to look again
at what some of us consider to be an important principle, namely that
the polluter should start paying for their
mistakes.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000615">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> New clause 3 is probing, and it is intended to
oblige courts and tribunals dealing with cases that are funded by legal
aid to make wasted costs orders against public authorities where those
public authorities’ acts have led to waste and expenditure,
whether the costs relate to the legal aid fund or to costs incurred by
the courts and tribunal system. We have had some debate about the
extension of the so-called polluter pays principle. I was interested to
hear the remarks of my colleagues who described their experience 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 467<a class="bkMark" name="Column467">&#160;</a>
                  </div>on the Justice Select Committee on this matter and its report, to which
I contributed. Under the polluter pays principle, public bodies that
are party to a case and that are responsible for legal aid costs being
incurred should bear that cost rather than the legal aid fund. That was
suggested by a number of respondents to our consultation on legal aid
reform as a possible alternative to our reform proposals. We analysed
that carefully in our response to the consultation, setting out in
detail our conclusion that there is no realistic scope to extend that
principle further.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000616">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
there would be no additional savings to Government overall if the legal
aid fund was simply financed by a different part of Government.
Secondly, we are also concerned that a stricter application of the
polluter pays principle in cases involving legal aid funding may have
unintended and undesirable consequences, as pointed out by my hon.
Friend the Member for Ipswich. For example, public authorities could be
discouraged from intervening in cases of suspected child abuse by
concerns about costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000617">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Instead, our
focus is to work with other Departments and public bodies to ensure
better decision making at the outset and throughout the conduct of
cases. For example, in the context of social security, the Government
are working to deliver improvements in decision making and review
processes, and to simplify appeal processes. My Department is also
taking forward similar work jointly with other Departments. We are
working, for example, with the UK Border Agency on the handling of
asylum cases to improve customer service and ensure that resources are
focused on the right cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000618">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
different courts and tribunals have different costs regimes, which have
been designed specifically for the forum in question. If the proposed
new clause were accepted, it would affect legislative provisions beyond
legal aid which determine the costs regimes in courts and
tribunals.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000619">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Wasted costs
orders ordinarily have a narrower application than the new clause
proposes, relating to the conduct of legal representatives rather than
the administrative errors which give rise to the proceedings. In many
civil courts, however, judges already have the power to award costs in
the circumstances set out in the proposed new clause, should they deem
it appropriate to do so in the circumstances of the case and with
regard to the behaviour of the parties. That currently results in costs
from public authorities being paid to the legal aid fund in some cases
where a costs order is made in favour of the legally aided
client.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000620">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally, the
proposals suggested would make it mandatory for the court to make a
wasted costs order in the circumstances described in subsection (2) of
the proposed new clause. It is therefore likely to encourage a
significantly higher level of satellite litigation over wasted costs
orders, while it is unlikely to result in a significant increase in
orders for costs, compared with the existing systems of costs and
wasted costs orders. That is likely to create a disproportionate burden
on court and tribunal resources for little overall return.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000621">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government do not consider it appropriate for the Bill to alter
radically or impose costs regimes on courts and tribunals, which are
provided for elsewhere. I urge the right hon. Gentleman to
withdraw the new clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000622">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This has been a short but good debate. We have
heard some useful views on both sides of the Committee. I take issue on
a single point made by the Minister. He said that if the proposed new
clause were to succeed, it would be a matter of shifting the legal aid
budget on to another Department. That is really not the point. At the
end of the day, there would be better decision making at first
instance, and thereby, there would be fewer applications to courts and
tribunals, which is the underlining ethos of the proposed new
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000623">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will not
press the new clause—that would be silly. We have had a useful
debate, and there are different views on both sides of the

                     </span>
                  </strong> I think another point made by the Minister might
be the Government’s strongest argument. There is perhaps a
difference between the CPS being the subject of a wasted costs order,
because of an error in its decision making and procedures relating to
prosecuting a case, and an error made by a decision maker in the
Department for Work and Pensions, which is then a different stage from
the conduct of a case by the DWP before a court. A wasted costs order
made against the CPS would be for misconduct with regard to the case
before the court, as opposed to any original decision, or relating to
the subject matter of the case. It is analogous, for example, to a
wasted costs order being made against the CPS for something that the
police did—if the police messed up their investigation. That
might be the Government’s strongest point, and perhaps
we  should look at it again when we reconsider the whole
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000625">&#160;</a>

but where does this brief example take him? Three or four months ago, I
did a disability living allowance appeal before a panel, as I
frequently do. I must have done 200 or 300 of them—obviously, as
a Member of Parliament, not as a lawyer. We arrived at the hearing
centre in Colwyn Bay, and we soon realised that no one on the panel
spoke Welsh. The applicant wanted the matter dealt with in Welsh, and
the hearing had to be scrapped. The chair of the tribunal said,
“It’s a shame, but I can’t award you
costs”—to avoid that nonsense happening again. Very
fairly, he said, “If it does happen again, I will write to the
Government, because I am desperately unhappy about it.” He was
right to say that. I will turn up at the next—I do not want any
costs for going to it—but the individual, who was appealing for
a DLA payment, had to find his  way 50 miles back home and then
come back again.  We are looking at that kind of bad or
negligent decision, maladministration or whatever else we
might call
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090873000626">&#160;</a>
