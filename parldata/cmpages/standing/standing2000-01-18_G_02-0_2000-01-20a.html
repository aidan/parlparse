<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 11, line 36, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or
<P>
(c) the description of the candidate given in his nomination paper includes the word ``Independent'' and no more than five other words which do not contravene the restrictions laid down in Section 24(2)(a), (c), (d), (e) and (f).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 2, in clause 33, page 20, line 17, after `Independent', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and not more than five other words'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should inform the Committee that amendment No. 1 applies to line 37 on page 11 and not to line 36, as the amendment paper suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. I hope that this and future sittings will be constructive. The Opposition have made clear our intention to table constructive amendments, and the Government have suggested that they will be interested to hear about our amendments and to listen to suggestions on how the Bill can be improved.
<P>
The clause precludes election candidates from describing themselves in the traditional manner. Although that change is primarily related to the registration of political parties, it would have other important effects. I refer the Committee to nominations for the Ceredigion by-election, which closed yesterday. One candidate in that election used six words to describe his candidacy, calling himself the ``Wales on Sunday—Match Funding Now'' candidate. The clause would ensure that if that person had not described himself as an independent or had not described himself at all, ``Wales on Sunday—Match Funding Now'' would be a political party. I do not think that the Government intend Western Mail and Echo Ltd. or its parent company, Trinity Mirror Newspapers, to be political parties.
<P>
Another candidate in the Ceredigion by-election, which is tomorrow, describes himself as the ``Independent Green: Save the World Climate'' candidate. His description would fall in line with the terms of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and I. The candidate uses the word ``independent'' and goes on to describe himself with the words ``green'' and ``save the world climate''. That is a reasonable compromise that works in line with suggestions made in the Bill as originally drafted.
<P>
Many candidates, especially in local elections but also in by-elections, are not members of political parties and often describe themselves as independent. Last May, a candidate in my ward who was standing for elections to my north Dorset district council described himself as an ``Independent Conservative''. That description was perfectly legitimate. The candidate was previously a true independent, but he went on to describe himself in that way. Subsequently, he became an official Conservative member of the council and is now chairman of the planning committee. His election was sufficient for us to secure an overall majority and take control of the council.
<P>
None the less, the point of the amendment—land obviously there will be consequences with respect to subsequent clauses—is that someone who does not simply describe himself as an independent or leave the relevant section on the nomination paper blank, cannot therefore be deemed to have created a political party. The electorate should not be misled in those cases as to whether the candidate represents a political party and the word ``independent'' should perhaps be included in the description on the nomination paper, and therefore on the ballot paper, to avoid confusion. However, we want five more words to be allowed on the nomination and ballot papers, to come into line with the current legal status of local authority, parliamentary and European Parliament election candidates.
<P>
The restriction to five additional words has been suggested because, while we want such a description to be permitted, we think it should be modest. Nominations closed yesterday in the Ceredigion by-election and it is clear that a maximum of six words, as provided for by the Representation of the People Act 1983, is sufficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I support the amendment and want to consider other aspects of it that may be relevant. The Official Opposition are concerned about categorisation, which, as a result of the implementation of the report, gives an edge to recognised political parties.
<P>
Independents have an honoured place in our political system. Their resources are usually extremely limited and their ability to communicate with the electorate is therefore a matter of particular importance. One way of doing that is by showing on the ballot paper what they stand for. To force them into a category in which all they can show is their name, or their name and the fact that they are independent, does not do justice to the various and varied causes that they are likely to be championing. At the general election, because of previous events in my constituency, quite a few independent candidates stood, but they chose a wide variety of platforms. In such circumstances, it is important to be able to identify from the ballot paper the cause that is represented.
<P>
If the Minister will not accept the amendment, will he explain what the problem is, with respect to forcing independents to use that one-word definition? While we were drafting the amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) and I spent some time thinking about the reverse arguments. A problem that colours the entire provision is the extent to which people will try to slip round the registration rules for political parties by stating that they are independent, whereas they are really operating in a coalition with each other. However, there will be little to prevent them from doing that, even if they merely put themselves down as an independent on the ballot paper. If two or more candidates who are standing on the same platform, which could be for a district council election, are forced to define what they are standing for, their status as independents may be called into question.
<P>
I accept that this is a difficult matter, but that does not remove our responsibility to ensure that independent candidates have a means of communicating with the electorate. Political parties go into an election with a manifesto. It is clear on the ballot paper who the candidates are and which party they represent. Most of us have anecdotal evidence that it is useful for an individual candidate to be identified as the representative of a party. Although we may try to communicate with a wide swathe of the electorate, many people go into the polling station without the slightest idea of the name of the candidate of the party for which they wish to vote.
<P>
We must accept that identification is a great advantage. To deprive independents of the ability briefly to inform the electorate what platform they are standing on, which may have received publicity, would be a retrograde step. Democracy is diverse. If we want to encourage participation in it and respect the views of independents and minorities—as that is what they will often be—it behoves us to do what we can to ensure that they are able to communicate with the electorate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment and I am interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's views on it. What does the clause aim to regulate? The Bill has two purposes. First, it ensures that we avoid financial abuse, fraud and some of the shadier events that have featured in high-profile press reports. Secondly, it incorporates legislation that requires parties to be properly named and identified. That is aimed at preventing passing off by a candidate who represents himself or herself as standing on behalf of another candidate or party.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) was the most spectacular victim of that. In the European elections before last, another candidate purported to be standing in the name of my party, the Liberal Democrats, and deprived him of election. I have every reason to support the implementation of that provision and I do not want it weakened. However, we appear to be tying two ideas together which, perhaps accidentally and certainly incidentally, produce an unwanted side effect.
<P>
By requiring the name to be included in the Bill, we are giving people who want to stand for election two stark choices: either they can go into the election unidentified on the ballot paper or they can register as a political party. Other provisions in the Bill make it clear that that cannot to be done by three people around a coffee table one Saturday afternoon; it is a major enterprise. Is the Parliamentary Secretary sure that by linking perfectly sound legislation, which is not connected with political funding and registration, with the Bill, we are not being hostile to democracy?
<P>
The Bill's purpose is not to reduce competition or to restrict the choice open to the electorate. There is a clear risk that, with the present wording, that might happen.
<P>
A broader point arises concerning the way in which the Bill will deal with what I regard as de minimis political activity. Do the Government intend that every candidate who plans seriously to be elected to public office must be a member of a political party, which, in turn, must be registered? Do they accept, instead, that people of en want to stand for election to put a case to the public but not to form or to join a political party?
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I give a hypothetical example, which I hope will never arise. A proposal for a bypass in my constituency is widely supported Candidates might feasibly wish to stand in favour of the bypass in local government elections or even in a parliamentary election. However, it seems that they will not be able to identify themselves as being from, for instance, the Hazel Grove bypass action now group, without registering as a political party, with all that that involves. They could stand only with the word ``Independent'' on the ballot paper, and rely on other activities to promote their name and to get themselves before the public.
<P>
The Bill might be a secondary effect. Independent candidates not registered as a political party would be committed to extra expenditure and might be challenged to spend much more than they had planned simply to ensure that they were identified in the public mind with the cause for which they were standing.
<P>
It is important for us, as political parties, to have careful regard not to pass self-serving legislation. I do not want to see a Hazel Grove action now candidate standing against my councillors in Hazel Grove.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): You will get one now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Perhaps I shall, but I would like to think that we had had so much publicity that people in Hazel Grove would be aware of the issue. Let us suppose that there were such a candidate. Of course, I would not like that and would want to resist. However, I hold elected office and have a responsibility for legislation. My job is not to make it more difficult for my competitors to contest in a democratic system
<P>
I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. The broader point concerns our not suppressing competition unreasonably, and our introducing sensible and fair de minimis provisions, which allow minimal political activity to continue without the encumbrance of legislation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): In supporting what has been said, both by my senior colleagues and by the Liberal Democrat spokesman, I should like to give a brief illustration, which goes back to south Wales in the 1960s and 1970s. In Swansea an active anarchist, Mr. Ian David Bone, used to describe himself on the ballot paper as the ``Community control, yo ho ho!'' candidate. That was an effective way of his getting a message across. I do not recall seeing him distribute any literature, probably because he was too anarchic to raise the funds to print any.
<P>
I favour his having had the latitude so to describe himself. It could have been said that belonging to a political party was against his political principles as an anarchist. I see no disadvantage in allowing independent candidates the extra self-description that the modest amendment would permit them. If the Government intend to resist the amendment, I urge them to be a little more liberal.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> I, too, begin by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. Those of us who have seen you in your running gear on the street and in the Lobby know that you will keep us on track and to our timetable. It will be achievable because, as was said earlier, we are all running in the same direction. It is unfortunate that the first set of amendments highlights a difference between us.
<P>
What unites us, as the hon. Members for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) and for Beaconsfield said, strongly, is a belief in the value of independents, who are an important part of our political system. We should be careful; the ceiling will come down if I do not give sufficient praise. I would like more genuine independents in the political system and it is important that the Bill keeps a role for them.
<P>
The purpose of clause 19 is to bring all organisations that put up candidates for election within the controls of parties' income and expenditure. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 would undermine that objective. There are enormous gains in being a member of a political party. Everyone in the Committee is a member of a political party; it has disadvantages, which we frequently complain about, but disadvantages too. We should recognise advantages those advantages and be clear about them. Independents standing under a banner could, in effect, be members of political parties, but not acknowledge that fact. They would not, therefore, be playing on the same playing field as the rest of us: they would have the benefits of the Bill without being subject to its constraints.
<P>
The key feature of a political party is that it puts candidates up for election under a common banner. We know that a Labour candidate in London is part of the same party as a Labour candidate in Nottinghamshire. They may have a different approach, but if the amendments were accepted, who could say that an Independent Against Europe candidate standing in Beaconsfield was not in alliance with a similar candidate standing in North Dorset? Indeed, the Independent Against Europe party could field candidates across the country. If the amendments were accepted it could secure all the advantages of having that description on the ballot paper without being subject to the controls on parties' income and expenditure set out in parts III to V of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset drew our attention to that marvellous, attractive place in Wales where a by-election is taking place. It has an attractive name, which is difficult to pronounce: Ceredigion. The hon. Gentleman gave us two examples of people who are standing in that by-election: the ``Wales on Sunday, Match Funding Now'' candidate and the ``Independent Green Save the World Climate'' candidate. It will be an exciting by-election, and, as I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)—I am always keen to keep in with the Whips—he must go and help in the campaign, because I am told that we are going to win. It is clear from the campaign fought by those two candidates that they could be members of political parties, independents who could stand throughout Wales.
<P>
Hon. Members are well aware of discussions about the problems of objective 1 funding in Wales. Although the ``Wales on Sunday, Match Funding Now'' candidate is an independent, there could be ``Wales on Sunday, Match Funding Now'' candidates in local, Assembly and parliamentary elections standing under that banner. If the amendment were accepted, they would stand as independents, but in reality they would be part of a political party. They would have the benefits of being members of a party without—the constraints that are on other parties. A person standing as an independent should play the same game as everyone else.
<P>
Our intentions are clear: we want to ensure that independents can stand. However, I strongly believe that the amendment would drive a coach and horses through the Bill because a political party is identified by the people who stand in elections. If candidates standing as independents were allowed up to five extra words in the description, they would have the benefit of being members of a political party without being subject to the Bill's constraints. It is an issue of concern to all political parties, and there is unease about the matter.
<P>
We all want a strong independent element and the Bill will not remove that. It is a safeguard to ensure that independents are not members of pseudo-parties. People can stand alone, but the sensible approach is that the Bill's constraints should apply to all parties—Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat—and to independents if they are, in effect, members of a political party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I have been following the Minister's argument carefully and I understand what he says in respect of the problem of groups of people standing on an identifiable platform getting together for a single election to field candidates across the country. I accept that, as drafted, the amendment would cause problems; but what happens to the poor old independent who is standing on his own on a single issue, yet cannot state what it is? He is the victim, is he not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> In that situation, the independent will have to submit his nomination form. Every candidate has to be nominated; the independent will have to persuade people that what he stands for is acceptable. He will have to get his form into the office on the due date and that, in a sense, is the check. He will not have the advantage, as the hon. Gentleman recognises, of appearing on the ballot paper with a label attached to his name. I make no bones about the fact that that is a clear disadvantage. It will disadvantage genuine, individual independents who want to pursue a particular aim.
<P>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should take a look at the current list of registered political parties. He would see a great range. I shall perhaps, in future, amuse Committee members when we are sitting late into the night—I hope that that will not happen—by regaling them with some of the aims and objectives of registered political parties. It is clear, for example, that the Morecambe bay independents have had a campaign strategy; they are a group. The Bill is intended to ensure that an independent cannot be a de facto member of an unannounced group.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept that there is a down side to the measure. However, as the central purpose of the Bill is to identity political parties and attach to them prescriptions and advantages, we need a mechanism for ascertaining what a political party is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I do not know the composition of the Minister's local authority, but my experience of local authorities is that sometimes independents join together in a group to gain control. That has happened in Dorset. West Dorset is still notionally an independent-controlled local authority. There is an independent group, which meets and selects a leader. In my experience, in the run-up to an election, those groups meet and discuss matters, along such lines as saying, ``Mrs. Smith is no longer standing for Little Poddlington ward; can we find another independent to stand there?'' Have those independents turned themselves into a political party according to the Minister's definition? Would they get round the Bill?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister replies to that intervention, which was a little long, I want to issue a general warning that I expect interventions to be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My experience of independents is that they are really Tories in disguise. It is possible to look across the east midlands and trace the history of some so-called independents, who turn out to have a long track record. I have tried to finger them on that—not very successfully, unfortunately.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset describes a not uncommon occurrence—independent groups in council elections. It will be for them to decide whether they are a political party. There are big advantages to be had from registering, but, as has been discussed this morning, there is a down side too. If members of a council wanted to stand under a particular banner and were, de facto, a group, it would make sense to register. However, if they did not want to register, it would be a matter for them, but they would appear on the ballot paper with the single word ``independent''. Independent candidates have independent aspirations. How they campaign politically after the ballot, when they are on the council, is up to them.
<P>
There could be many people, in a range of councils—such as North Dorset, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire—standing as independents, but who, once elected, were really members of a united political party with common aims and aspirations, who would not suffer the constraints of the Bill. It will be for individuals to decide. They will have a stark choice—independence or a political party. The Bill is clear about that. We want a fair playing field for big and small parties. It should be clear that a political party comprises candidates standing under the same banner throughout the country. I welcome independents because they are healthy for politics and I hope that such people will stand in elections.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider two points? The hon. Member for North Dorset said that the independent cache could be an advantage on the ballot paper without any further description. I pointed out that an independent could have no pull on the electorate except his or her cause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be right, but it is clearly in the nature of politics that people stand for a cause and a purpose. In the example that he described, I am not sure whether a campaign for or against the bypass would be an advantage—one can never win in such situations. The clause contains no provision to stop people standing as independents or pursuing campaign aims for or against roads and seeing how much support they get. We want to ensure that people do not have the advantages of being in a political party without declaring it. I understand the sensitivities involved and I am aware of the strong desire to ensure that independents and the independent sector continue to strive. We accept the spirit of the amendment, but it would undermine the primary purpose of the Bill and I ask hon. Members to resist it if it is pressed to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am grateful for the contributions made by hon. Members who oppose the Government. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) put his finger on another aspect of the clause. The Bill's purpose is to ensure financial propriety in the management of political affairs. The amendments seek to protect people who stand in elections not as representatives of political parties, but as independents, even if they are championing particular issues.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove pointed out that people in Hazel Grove may wish to stand as candidates in favour of the bypass or against it. When the Conservatives were in government, we felt that the law should allow a candidate who is not standing as a representative of a political party to describe himself as being for or against even one issue. When electors are confronted with two or more candidates who describe themselves as independent, they may be confused about which one to vote for. That is why the Representation of the People Act 1983 allowed candidates to describe themselves as members of political parties.
<P>
I was intrigued by the Parliamentary Secretary's response to my intervention on when an independent group became a political party. If we accept his arguments against the amendment, I am concerned that an independent group could be a political party de facto. I referred in my opening remarks to the ``Wales on Sunday—Match Funding Now'' by-election candidate, who, according to this morning's Western Mail, does not propose to publish any literature or to campaign. None the less, the Bill would have ensured that merely putting his name on the ballot paper to make a political protest against the Government's inability to get match funding for west Wales and the valleys turned the Western Mail and Echo Ltd.—a newspaper publication company—into a political party. It would then be subject to the audit requirements of the Electoral Commission. That would be an entirely different ball game.
<P>
The proposal that the candidate could describe himself only as an independent would prevent that from happening, but it is a restriction on our political process. It would be a retrograde and disappointing step. I am sorry that the Minister is unwilling to accept our proposals. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> As has been established, the clause will require political parties to be registered if they are to field candidates at an election. Such a requirement is essential to the proposed controls on the income and expenditure of political parties. Under the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, there is already a scheme for their registration, to which the hon. Member for Hazel Grove has referred. However, the scheme is voluntary.
<P>
The Bill includes a compulsory registration scheme. The clause will make binding the scheme set out in the remainder of Part II, requiring political parties wishing to field candidates at a relevant election to be registered. A person may stand at a relevant election, other than as an independent, only if a certificate authorising his candidature, which must be issued by the nominating officer of a registered party, accompanies his nomination paper. The requirement is similar to that in the 1998 Act.
<P>
In elections involving the use of lists, a party may be nominated only if it is registered. A person will be regarded as standing as an independent candidate only if he or she uses the description ``Independent'' or else uses no description. The Committee has had an extensive discussion of the matter, which is the first central issue to have been considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> In discussing the amendment, we have obviously rehearsed our concerns about descriptions. The general registration requirements are consistent with the spirit of the Bill and with the Neill report, the implementation of which the Opposition support. Therefore, we do not wish to divide the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 20</center></H4>
<H4><center>The register</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Clause 20 provides for the maintenance of a register of political parties and for the transfer of that responsibility from the Registrar of Companies to the Electoral Commission. Such a register is central to the operation of the controls on political parties' income and expenditure. Without it, the Electoral Commission would not know whom it was expected to supervise. A register is currently maintained by Companies House under the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998. However, that register exists primarily to enable political parties that intend to put up candidates for election to protect the use of their name, a point that has been acknowledged. As the scheme confers only rights and no responsibilities on parties that are included on the register, it is entirely voluntary.
<P>
Subsection (1) provides for the continued maintenance of the register of political parties and its transfer from Companies House to the Electoral Commission. That gives effect to the Neill committee recommendation. It is the obvious course given that an Electoral Commission is to be established.
<P>
Under subsection (2), entries on the register that were made under the 1998 Act, prior to the transfer of the register to the commission, will continue to have effect. Subsections (3) and (4) will ensure that the transfer of responsibility does not require the commission to start from scratch in discharging that function. It will be able to make use of data that has been compiled by Companies House and to complete any outstanding work.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government intend to table amendments on the nature of federal parties. We hope to limit the number of amendments that we table and to give good notice of them. We want the Bill to be in good order. I apologise that it is not possible at this stage to table amendments on arrangements for maintaining the register.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Liberal Democrats made the point that the scheme does not take proper account of the federal nature of some parties. The Scottish Green party is wholly distinct from the Green party of England and Wales, but it has been disadvantaged by the scheme, which does not allow it to register in its own right. We propose to rectify that by allowing a party to confine its registration to one part of the United Kingdom so that it may be separately registered in England, Scotland and Wales. We will also provide for a separate register of Northern Ireland parties. That change will have an impact on other provisions in the Bill. As I said, amendments will be tabled on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am intrigued by the Parliamentary Secretary's comments on federal parties. When considering amendments, in particular those to part II, my colleagues and I went round the course to determine their implications for the Scottish Conservative party, which, although it is part of the Conservative family, is regarded as a separate party. We welcome the assurance that good notice will be given of Government amendments on federal parties. That will allow us to consider their implications for the Scottish Conservative party and the Welsh Conservative party, which has recently become more independent of the London party.
<P>
I have some questions on clause 20 with regard to information on the maintenance and transfer of the register from Companies House to the Electoral Commission, which has not been debated on the Floor of the House. Subsection (5) allows the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make provision for the transfer to the Commission of any property, rights and liabilities to which the registrar of companies is entitled or subject in connection with his functions under the 1998 Act''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to deal with restriction of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the transfer of property, rights or liabilities otherwise than by the order.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Minister quantify what subsection (5) deals with and tell us whether it will place a financial burden on the Electoral Commission? Will the registrar of companies present a bill for transferring the assets, even if they are on magnetic tape or computer disk? Does Companies House contain other forms of property—whether rights, rentals or whatever—that the Bill does not mention but which may be transferred and could become a liability to the Electoral Commission?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> We are content with the clause in its current form, although it was good to hear about the proposed amendments. I shall bring significant subsidiary points to the Committee's attention during debate on amendments to clause 21, so I shall reserve my remarks for that discussion.

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I was interested to hear about the family within the Conservative party. The hallmark of a good family is that they have extremely acrimonious rows. Long may that continue in the Conservative party. The Government have learnt their lessons and know that a row should occur behind closed doors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Only in Millbank.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Yes. Looking at the Government Benches, I see at least three or four hon. Friends who would not get through the door of Millbank Tower. A healthy spirit of independence still lives among Labour Members.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset spoke about transfer arrangements. He asked what would be transferred from the register of companies to the new Electoral Commission, and whether it would include property and liabilities. That is not the intention of the Bill, which allows the transfer of material, data and systems. Such matters will be for the Electoral Commission and for the registrar of companies to negotiate and decide. Our intentions are well known and well signalled, and I do not see any problems about the matter.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The timing of my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), who has just arrived, could not be better. I am pleased to speak to the amendments and was glad to hear the Minister's remarks. I appreciate that the concept of federalism does not have universal support in the Committee, and that it is not necessarily seen as a universally adoptable concept in the United Kingdom or in Europe. The point of the amendments is not, however, to persuade others that federalism is a good idea, but to provide freedom to practise it ourselves. We see the same sort of problem in the Bill as the Conservatives might see if it contained a provision stating that all property should be held in common among people belonging to the Conservative party. A provision ensuring separate Labour parties for men and women might cause the Labour party similar problems. In other words, I am speaking about a fundamental concept that relates to how we think about important issues. Such a concept could be equality or private property; in relation to the amendment, however, it is the system of government. That may seem bizarre and impractical. I am not here to persuade the Committee, which is entitled to its view, but to ask it not to introduce legislation that makes it illegal to practise one of the philosophical concepts of governance that is important to the Liberal Democrats and other political parties. The Minister was right to mention the problems that the Green party has encountered.
<P>
I was encouraged to hear what the hon. Member for North Dorset said about there being some autonomy in the Scottish and Welsh branches of the Conservative party, but the structure of any truly federal organisation, such as the Liberal Democrats, requires more than the provision of a bit of autonomy here and there. As the Minister said, it is possible to row and make up afterwards, although we have no evidence of the Conservative party making up.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will take advice on what should be included in the amendments that he intends to table. The Liberal Democrats have separate political parties for Scotland, Wales and England and a federal party to cover the United Kingdom. The argument that the Minister used in the previous clause does not automatically satisfy our concerns about this clause. It is not merely a case of having geographical subdivisions, but of having the capacity to have a federal party that covers the United Kingdom and its geographical subdivisions.
<P>
The amendment would allow that to happen. It sets out the responsibility of the treasurer of the federal party for the federal party as a whole—a role that we do not want to debase—while ensuring that the commissioner is properly connected to other federal components of the party. The amendment is not designed to weaken the Bill. We are happy to work with the Minister to ensure that that does not happen. The last thing we want to do is to provide a loophole that can be exploited by any party, whether it has good or evil intent. However, it is right and proper that we are allowed to have a form of political organisation that is fundamental to our thinking. We fear that is not possible as the Bill stands.
<P>
When we debate the Government's amendments, I hope that we do better than we did in our consultations on the draft Bill. My colleagues who were engaged in discussions with civil servants and others reported a state of mutual bemusement. We found it difficult to explain our issues and civil servants had problems comprehending our points. I am delighted to hear that progress has been made. Perhaps the diplomacy and politeness of the Minister's civil servants was mistaken for misunderstanding. I want discussions to continue so that amendments do not fail to achieve their purpose.
<P>
We have tabled an amendment that we hope will meet our objective. We are open to suggestions as to how it might be improved. I ask the Committee to bear in mind the fact that what we are discussing, arcane and unlikely as it may seem, is of great importance, not just to Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament—some of whom, I freely confess, do not share in every detail the party's enthusiasm—but to our colleagues in the constituent parts of the federal party. Had your co-Chairman, Mrs. Michie, been with us today, Mr. Maxton, I should particularly have drawn the Committee's attention to her presentation to the Procedure Committee. She stoutly defended the principle of federalism in the United Kingdom. I know that she is even more thoroughly appraised of those matters than I am.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> This is a good example of an attempt by the Committee and political parties to work together to solve a problem. The two amendments are concerned with the role of the registered treasurer of a party. In moving them, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove has raised some understandable concerns about the impact of the Bill on the structure of his party. I hope that I can allay some of those concerns. I have already mentioned that we intend to try to rectify the problem on Report.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman pointed out that the Liberal Democrats are a federal party with constituent organisations in England, Scotland and Wales, coming together under the umbrella of a national party structure. The constituent organisations have considerable autonomy, not least in their financial affairs. The Liberal Democrats are not unique in that. Other parties that are not formally federally constituted enjoy, in practice, some autonomy from the centre. The onset of devolution has clearly highlighted and perhaps enhanced the autonomy of the Scottish and Welsh arms of the main Great Britain or United Kingdom-organised parties.
<P>
I understand that in the case of the Green party the process has gone further. For some years, the Scottish Green party has been a wholly separate organisation from the Green party of England and Wales which is, in turn, now considering whether to divide into two independently-constituted organisations.
<P>
The Government acknowledge that the scheme for the registration of political parties needs to recognise federal arrangements. We are considering whether the scheme for the registration of parties can be modified to allow a party to confine its registration to one part of Great Britain. Were that possible, the Greens, the Liberal Democrats and others could register separately in the relevant country.
<P>
That would be relatively simple, but the hon. Member for Hazel Grove is—correctly, I think—asking for more. He gives the example of a federal party that is in a sense over the top—though one should be careful how one uses such terms—with constituent bodies in each country. We shall consider that. The further discussion with officials that the hon. Gentleman asked for will not be a problem; practitioners of the black arts sometimes bemuse those who view the issues in a more academic way. We shall try to find an easier solution to the geographical problem.
<P>
No easy solution is available to the problem that has rightly been presented to the Committee of a federal party over geographical limits. That will be a relatively complex issue, which is a reason why we have not been able to table amendments today. However, we shall not forget about it—we shall have further discussions and I hope that we shall be able to accommodate the hon. Gentleman's desires. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn on the understanding that the Government will advance their own proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for that response. I appreciate that the matter is complex. The drafting is useful, especially with regard to the concept of the approved federal structure. The issues are for further discussion, and I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 13, line 13, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for the financial affairs of the party and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment to seek clarification of who is supposed to be the responsible person. The Bill will give rise to several potentially complex issues and could lead to difficulties unintended by the draftsmen.
<P>
The thrust of the amendment is that there must be a person responsible for compliance with this provision of the Bill, and we welcome that. My party will ensure that it has a full-time compliance officer. However, the officer will not necessarily be the person with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``overall responsibility for the financial affairs of the party''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know how the Labour party operates; my impression is that the financial roles become more diffused from the top as the party organisation becomes larger. The party treasurer may not be the person with overall control of day-to-day accounting of the organisation—he may be responsible primarily for fund raising or for presenting the party's official front to the local organisations and associations, urging them to raise money. I acknowledge that, with smaller political parties, the treasurer may be the be-all and end-all of the system, doing everything right down to signing off the accounts.
<P>
Why, if compliance is necessary, does subsection (4) also state that the person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must have overall responsibility for the financial affairs of the party''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may wish to explain. I should also be grateful if he explained the meaning of that phrase.
<P>
We have lifted sections from the Companies Acts that do not seem to bear complete relation to the reality of political parties and their organisation. I shall discuss that when we reach the next amendment. A balance must be struck between the existence of a political party, however much one might dislike its presence, and its keeping financial probity. The essential issue is surely that there is compliance. If that is so, we should aim to ensure that there is a person with a responsibility to ensure compliance, with whom the buck would stop were there to be a failure of compliance. I should be grateful to hear the Minister's comments, and I shall confine my remarks until I have heard more.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Perhaps it would be helpful if we admitted that we come to the Committee as members of political parties that have existing financial structures. We are attempting to assess the impact that the Bill will have on them. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove spoke about the federal structure of his party, and the Bill's effect on it.
<P>
I shall reflect on how the Conservative party is structured at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> That will be fun.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Well, I shall allude to the changes and reforms in my party in the past couple of years, which hon. Members may not have followed as closely as those of us on the inside. Until recently, there was nothing that could be clearly identified in law as the Conservative party. There were three different structures. The parliamentary Conservative party—the body in this House—was responsible for electing the leader of our party and for other matters related to our activities in the Chamber and in Government. There was another body, known as Conservative central office, which was the office of the leader of the party, and derived its authority from whoever was, for the time being, the party leader. Then there were the myriad independent Conservative associations and other bodies, such as the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party, which were also independent of the party. Those bodies in the country came together in a federal structure, called the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations—
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Confederal structure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Yes, a confederal structure, as my hon. Friend says. Those bodies collectively provided the finance for the second arm, the office of the leader, through various payments.
<P>
We have changed that structure. The Conservative party is now an identifiable organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> A force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Indeed. Perhaps in a year or so it will be an even greater force. I shall expand on the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. As part of that structure, each constituency association—accounting units in the Bill—now has two financial officers, which leads to our probing amendment. We have a financial officer who is responsible for fund raising and for managing the budget of the local Conservative association, but he is not the treasurer—the accounting officer; the man who does all the bookkeeping, puts together the accounts, accounts to the Inland Revenue for any tax that might be due, ensures that the agent is paid on time and so on.
<P>
There are two distinct management functions. In tabling the amendment, we seek recognition of the two distinct financial roles: first, there is the important role, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield alluded, of ensuring that there is a responsible officer within the party organisation, or within its accounting units, who will be responsible to the party, to the greater public and to the Electoral Commission for ensuring that it has complied with the Bill's provisions, produced its accounts on time, and not taken donations, or spent money on activities that were not permissible. Secondly, nationally our party has the problem whereby the person who is called ``the treasurer'' is, in fact, the chief fund raiser and not the accounting officer. Will the Minister give us some guidance on the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I was grateful to hear about the history of the Conservative party and how it had emerged into such a confederated structure. I was even more interested in the comments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, when he said that one of the underlying issues for his own party is who is in overall control. I heard some of my colleagues make some helpful suggestions.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
This probing amendment covers some of the ground that the Committee covered in relation to a federal structure. At different levels in political parties, different people take different responsibilities for financial affairs. The hon. Member for North Dorset clearly recognised the concept of accounting units, which the Committee will want to consider. It will also want to discuss the responsibilities that are devolved to a local level. The Bill puts onerous duties on parties that register. Someone in the party must take responsibility for complying with them and it is really up to the political party to decide who that should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister has clarified the issue. When I read the clause, I was concerned that a dispute might arise when a political party nominated its compliance officer, who had full accounting responsibility, but was then told by the commission that that person was not the party treasurer. Such disputes must be ironed out now rather than later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman will recognise that one of the themes of the Bill is that a scheme must be established between the commission and the parties. Agreement can be reached by the commission and the different parties on their structure. The essential part of the probing amendment and the Bill is that one person from the party should be responsible. He may be called ``the treasurer''; it may be that other terms are used in negotiations between the commission and the parties. The term itself is not important. What is important is that one person is responsible for compliance. For argument's sake, let us call that person ``the treasurer''. The Bill makes it clear that the person who returns the compliance forms ensures that they are in order.
<P>
The Bill is also clear that that person is responsible across the party for fundraising. It does not necessarily mean that the person who has overall responsibility will do the day-to-day work; the reverse is more likely.
<P>
I imagine that the Conservative party is not that different from the Labour party in that a series of officials have responsibility for fundraising to ensure financial compliance. The Bill insists that a scheme should be agreed between the party and the commission, and that only one person—let us call him ``the treasurer''—is responsible for the party's meeting its compliance obligations. However, he is also responsible throughout the organisation for the money raised. Unless one person is responsible for that work, there could be real difficulties. I realise that this is a probing amendment, but I suspect that that is not a real difficulty. It is an issue that political parties will want to consider.
<P>
On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary suggested that political parties should begin to organise and prepare now. If it is our intention—I think that it is—that the Bill should be in place for the next general election, it would be wise to start making progress.
<P>
With those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister. He has gone a long way to reassuring me about how the scheme will operate. His earlier comments about the nature of compliance and who is responsible for it will, if there is disagreement with the commission on the scheme, doubtless be waved under the commissioner's nose when the commission is being told how to interpret the legislation.
<P>
We hope that the scheme will work well. I agree with the Minister that it may be necessary for political parties to alter their financial structure in order to adapt. Political parties have no reason to sit back and say that they will not change anything. It is simply a question of trying to avoid pitfalls and ensuring that the scheme works smoothly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 13, leave out lines 33 to 38.
<P>
The amendment might seem rather surprising. It may seem strange to suggest that being found to be criminally responsible for a failure to comply with the legislation should not bar one from being the treasurer of a political party. If my party ever suffered the misfortune of its treasurer being found not to have complied and being prosecuted for the offence, I certainly hope that we would not subsequently use his services as treasurer.
<P>
The Committee has a fundamental matter to consider. Members of Parliament lay down the law of the land and the people have to obey it. However, there is a difference between that and the political process because, by virtue of being a democracy, we grant people the right to change the Government at election time. We give them the right to put forward unpopular, unpalatable and, if they so wish, downright outrageous proposals.
<P>
For example, let us suppose that a party was set up consisting entirely of people who had been convicted of murder. Having all been released from Her Majesty's prisons and therefore having regained the vote and the ability to stand in an election, they could say that their aim as a political party was the legalisation of murder. Nothing would prevent them from doing that. We must therefore consider the position of those who operate a political party and who fail to comply with the law. If they fail to do that, they are prosecuted and punished, but the clause provides not only that such people will be prosecuted and punished but that they then might not be able to fulfil the criteria of being a political party at all, because some of the party's officers will be disqualified from holding office. I trust that the Minister will forgive me for raising that possibility, which I hope never arises. However, one can envisage small political parties effectively being struck off the register because they have failed to comply, been prosecuted or not produced returns. In the context of wishing to maintain the right of people to come together and form political parties, is that the correct approach to adopt?
<P>
That may appear to be taking the argument to extremes, but there is an issue involved. I hope that it does not concern my own party, or the Minister's party, or any mainstream party that has the opportunity to form a Government. But is the requirement—this is the key issue—really necessary? It treats political parties as though they were companies with fiduciary duties. I hope that my political party will always behave like a company with fiduciary duties and see itself in that way, but there is no reason why a political party should have to do so—unpalatable as that may be to me. I would therefore need to be persuaded that the legislation as a whole would fall apart if the provision were removed before feeling happy about letting it remain.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): I want only to ask a question, but I did not wish to try your patience, Mr. Maxton, by asking it as an intervention. My question is addressed to both the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and to my hon. Friend the Minister. As the clause that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield seeks to delete is worded, a registered treasurer could commit an offence if convicted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of any other offence committed in connection with a relevant election.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not clear whether that would relate to offences committed in other countries. The hon. Gentleman hoped that the clause would never apply to his or to our political party. It is conceivable that if the Opposition had a treasurer who gave money to political parties not only in this country but in another country he could fall foul of, for example, Belizan electoral law, for not registering a donation made to a Belizan party. That would be covered: the clause defines a relevant election as simply ``a parliamentary election''. I am sure that Belize holds parliamentary elections.
<P>
We therefore need to be clear that the amendment would not remove a clause that could affect the hon. Gentleman's party and to know whether the Minister believes that the wording of the clause might not also relate to offences. It is in the nature of electoral law, particularly disclosure law, for donations not to be disclosed or for some other minor infringement to occur that could, for example, disqualify Mr. Ashcroft as a treasurer of the Conservative party
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> In supporting the amendment, I highlight the way in which the provision to cover a party treasurer dying hangs with subsections (5) and (6). Subsection (7), which we seek to delete, states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person commits an offence if ... he is registered as treasurer of a registered party, and ... has been convicted''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of an offence. However, in subsection (5), if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the person registered as a party's treasurer dies'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the appropriate person to take over is the party's leader or such other person nominated, according to subsection (6). Although it would never happen in any of our parties, that means that if the treasurer died and the party's leader had been convicted of an offence, by taking the mantle of treasurer, the leader would immediately commit an offence for which he was not responsible—unless he had murdered the treasurer, and that is unlikely.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> My hon. Friend is right. One could envisage a situation—we had it with the poll tax—in which a politician might say that he so disagreed with the legislation that it was a matter of civil rights. He might refuse to submit the returns because he wanted to see them all altered, and was therefore prepared to suffer the penalty. As a result, his party might be prevented from running in an election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, which illustrates my point. I do not want to be pedantic, but we are dealing with the law. In so doing, we do not want to create a situation whereby people could be guilty of an offence simply by holding a post to which they were perfectly entitled. Due to an event over which they had no control, they might fall into a slot, however temporarily, in which they could be deemed to have committed an offence for which they could then be convicted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that I would be surprised by the amendment, and let me freely confess that I am. The hon. Member for North Dorset said that were dealing with the law, but in fact we are dealing with the real world. I find it incomprehensible and inconceivable that under any circumstances whatever a political party could have a leader or treasurer who had been convicted of an electoral offence. If I heard the hon. Member for Beaconsfield correctly, he agreed with that and said that there was no chance of it happening. He has shown us something of which I was already aware: his impeccable liberal credentials and his desire for a light touch. However, I say to him in a friendly way that he is taking it a step too far.
<P>
It seems clear that political parties play an important public role, and they also have fiduciary duties, a phrase that I think that he used. They try to collect substantial sums of money from the public. Therefore, there must be an element of respectability. Someone who has deliberately committed an electoral offence must be disqualified—that is as clear as night follows day. I ask the hon. Member for Beaconsfield to reflect on his position.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) is a great expert on these matters, and I have read a good deal of his work. He asked whether someone convicted of an electoral offence abroad could be disqualified under the terms of the Bill. Again, I do not think that that could happen, although he mentioned a certain gentleman about whom allegations are being made. Under the clause, only a person convicted of an offence at a parliamentary or other election in the United Kingdom would be disqualified. I might be tempted to reconsider the issue, but I hope that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will let his credentials tarnish a little and admit that we live in the real world, not in that of lawyers and elaborate hypothetical constructions, and not press his amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall deal first with the comments of the hon. Member for Battersea. I was already aware that the Bill applies only to the United Kingdom, so I hope that he will accept my assurance that, in drafting the amendment, what my own party might do and the circumstances to which he alluded never crossed my mind. I did not table the amendment to be flippant and to take up time of the Committee.
<P>
The Minister summed up the matter neatly when he said that political parties may acquire substantial sums and therefore have fiduciary duties. I concur with that, but I must face the fact that in a democracy people are allowed, under the law of incitement, to put forward views and seek election and public support on matters that fill me with horror. Even at election time, that law would have to be used sparingly. People are allowed to do some odd things and, as the Minister knows, given some of the activities of members of his own party, when people feel sufficiently strongly about something as a matter of principle, they choose to break the law and accept the consequences.
<P>
If people break the law, they must accept the consequences, otherwise there would be anarchy. However, Parliament should be wary of punishing someone and then introducing devices to prevent that person from forming a political party for the purpose of winning elections. If such a statement gives me impeccable liberal credentials, I am deeply content. I am reassured by the point that, if such circumstances arose, the matter could probably be challenged under human rights legislation, when that comes into operation. It would be interesting to advance such a matter in the courts. Although the Minister has not fully persuaded me of his argument, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The clause specifies those office holders who, in respect of each registered party, must be included in the register. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of schedule 1 to the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 require that a party wishing to register must supply the names and addresses of its leader and nominating officer. The clause will impose a fresh requirement whereby the party's treasurer should also. That is an important provision because much of the responsibility for compliance with the Bill will devolve upon the registered treasurer of the political party.
<P>
Subsection (4) specifies that the person registered as the treasurer must have overall responsibility for the party's financial affairs and for ensuring compliance with parts III to V and part VII. Subsections (5) and (6) are designed to ensure that someone will always be deemed to be the party's treasurer, even after death—including murder.
<P>
Subsection (7) makes it an offence for a person who has been convicted to be registered as the treasurer of a registered party within five years of the date of registration of the offence. We discussed that matter at some length, and I note that some hon. Members still have anxieties about it, but I hope that they will accept the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> We rehearsed our arguments about the clause in considering the amendments. The Minister has responded accordingly, and in some cases sympathetically, to the points that have been made. As I hope and suspect that I shall continue to say as we proceed, we wholeheartedly support the basic thrust of the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The amendments are designed to ensure that in providing a view about a party's structure, or approving a scheme, the Electoral Commission acts in a reasonable, fit and proper way. A theme of some of our debates so far, on which I hope the Minister will be able to provide a comprehensive overall view, is the need to ensure that we create a system that is practical in the real world, to use his words. It is comparatively simple to draft laws that make something illegal or prevent something from happening, but we are trying to draft a law that will not only prevent certain wicked things that we all want to prevent but will allow democracy to flourish. We must be careful, in applying weedkiller, not to kill the plant itself.
<P>
This is the first comprehensive and complete overhaul of our electoral arrangements since about 1883—117 years ago. The Bill may last another 117 years, during which many developments will take place in party structures. As I am sure the Minister will recognise, his party did not even exist in 1883. Who knows which party will be in existence in another 117 years? We must consider not only what this Government, this Electoral Commission and this Parliament may do, but what future manifestations of all three might do.
<P>
We therefore tabled two straightforward amendments to require the Electoral Commission not to withhold approval unreasonably, and to ensure that the compliance that it must secure relates purely to the specific financial and regulatory requirements of the Bill. Of course, we are all people of good will, and it would never occur to us to do so, but in some future manifestation the commission might be used as an instrument of oppression against a particular party, particular sorts of parties or all parties that do not have a majority of the votes. There are ways in which the commission might apply its regulatory functions that could be quite threatening. In a more authoritarian or totalitarian society, we would see the measure as possibly laying the foundations for an oppressive move.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister will be rightly indignant if I impute such motives. Of course, the Government have no such ideas in mind, but will he consider carefully how to build in a safety net at the start, which would prevent that from happening in the future? Will he give serious consideration to our amendments? Can he reassure the Committee and perhaps come back with his views on how to build in safeguards? We want to be satisfied that we are producing legislation that is good for another 117 years.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am not indignant about the amendments; they raise important and serious points. It is our intention to produce legislation that works in the real world, which is a theme that will run throughout the Committee. Another theme is that the Electoral Commission may take a tougher view of what happens at the top of political parties. As its attention reaches the constituency and ward level, we anticipate—indeed, we expect—a much lighter touch. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said, we want a new and revised process that satisfies everyone. That is our intention now and in future. The hon. Gentleman knows that the commission does not have a rubric or template to place on political parties. The Bill is clear, as are the Government, that political parties are unique in their way. The commission will have to agree a scheme with each one.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove has tabled two amendments. Amendment No. 13 would, at least on the face of it, circumscribe the authority of the Electoral Commission by requiring it not to withhold unreasonably its approval for a scheme submitted by a party. The amendment is unnecessary, vague and undesirable. The commission will be subject to judicial review and can be pulled up by the courts if it introduces irrelevant considerations. Subject to that, the commission should—necessarily, we believe—have the last word. There will be discussions, compromises and an attempt to find a satisfactory scheme. We have heard hypothetical examples all morning, but the commission must have the last word. The amendment would give the appearance of reducing the commission's authority without a real change of substance in the arrangements.
<P>
The same applies to amendment No. 14. Again, I understand and sympathise with the thrust of the amendment, which is to ensure that the commission does not apply a hidden agenda to the approval or non-approval of parties' schemes of control, but that it concentrates only on the need to ensure compliance with the obligations laid on parties. The amendment is unnecessary and perhaps—I hope that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove will forgive me—even slightly off the mark. The provisions of parts III, IV, V and VII apply to registered parties. Clause 22 is about what constitutes the party in question—which organisations are subordinate to it and which are not, together with the arrangements for supervising the financial affairs of the party as a whole. The amendment might give the impression of excluding from the commission's consideration the all-important question—not merely how the organisation identified in the party's scheme is to regulate its affairs, but whether the organisation is properly and fully described in the first place. I do not want to be dismissive of the points that have been made. I acknowledge the need to ensure that the legislation will work in the real world—in the dirty business of politics. The commission is being established precisely to gain experience scheme by scheme and to negotiate agreement with the different parties. As I said, I anticipate that the commission will consider the top of parties rather than the bottom end. With those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for his comments. My own description is that the business of politics is not so much dirty as untidy. We have to consider the short-term and the long-term difficulties. Any Electoral Commission, whether or not it has a hidden agenda, will want tidiness. Politics is not about tidiness and I hope that the Minister will recognise that none of the political parties is full of tidy solutions to simple problems. That is certainly the case in organisations that deal with human beings.
<P>
My concern is partly a fear about the search for tidiness and what that might do, and partly a longer-term fear that, on another occasion in a different environment, these controls might be used in oppressive and offensive ways. I have heard the Minister's comments and have no wish to divide the Committee, but it is a point to which I want to return more than once. The centralisation, the imposition of uniformity and the creation of tidy, neat and standard solutions all look excellent value for money when one is sitting in an office in Whitehall or Westminster, but they may not fit the real world of politics. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 14, line 33, leave out `none of the following shall' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the following may'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment may be considered vaguely controversial, or even partisan, although that was not my intention. It deals with trade unions, friendly societies and provident societies, which the Neill committee considered. I shall refer to what Neill said under the heading, ``Trade-union political funds''. The amendment should not be regarded as a judgment on the origins of the Labour movement. I am sure that there are more august students of the history of the Labour movement than me in this Room. That movement is inevitably tied up with trade unions in this country; they could be regarded as integral to it. Section 6.15 of the Neill report states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Trade unions have been involved in politics and the lobbying of government from the mid-nineteenth century onwards—initially through support for the Chartist movement. Trade union political activity increased significantly with the establishment of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and what would become the modern Labour Party. The Labour Party, a far more extensive political operation than the TUC, was initially funded by a compulsory levy on the members of affiliated trade unions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Neill then details the famous 1909 case of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants v. Mr. Osborne, but I do not want to discuss that. Through the amendment, I want to give the Electoral Commission powers that the Bill seeks to exclude so that it cannot take account of political activity by any organisation covered by subsections (8)(a), (b) and (c).
<P>
I would like to refer to Neill's concluding remarks on the subject of trade unions, and use his statistics to emphasise the significance of the amendment. Section 6.22 of the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In 1996, 42 trade unions maintained political funds, to which 4.9 million members contributed. Some 875,000 members, or 18 per cent, contracted out. In their written submission to us, the Labour Party mentioned that only 3.5 million trade unionists paid an affiliation fee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I will stand corrected if Labour Members want to correct me, but I think that that is something like 10 times the direct membership of the Labour party. A significant number of people therefore pay an affiliation fee to a political party but, under the clause, would be excluded from the remit of the Electoral Commission.
<P>
Neill goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``26 trade unions were affiliated to the Labour Party in 1996'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and mentions the money
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``spent on lobbying activities or on general political advertising as defined by the 1984 Act, much of which is likely to support the Labour Party.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The point is not partisan. I am reading from the Neill report, so figures did not derive from the Conservative party.
<P>
Neill's conclusion reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We have received no evidence to suggest that the legislation is not working satisfactorily, and no case has been made out for any reform. We do not propose any change in the law in this respect.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I respectfully suggest that in saying that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``No change should be made in the law relating to trade unions and their political funds'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Neill meant that he did not propose any change in the trade union legislation. He was not necessarily suggesting that the Electoral Commission should not take note in its decisions as to whether it connects the political funds of trade unions with the activities of political parties.
<P>
Subsection (8) would seek to exclude the following activities from being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``taken to be a constituent or affiliated organisation in relation to a party—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a)‚a trade union within the meaning of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 or the Industrial Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1992;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b)‚a friendly society registered under the Friendly Societies Act 1974 or a society registered (or deemed to be registered) under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 or the Industrial and Provident Societies Act (Northern Ireland) 1969''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall come back to subsection (8)(b) in a moment, because Neill is silent on the matter of friendly societies and industrial and provident societies. Subsection 8(c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any other organisation of a description prescribed by order made by the Secretary of State on the recommendation of the Commission''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I seek the Minister's guidance on that provision because I am intrigued to know what it means.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our amendment would delete the words ``none of'' and ``shall'' from subsection (8) and insert the word ``may'', thus making it state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``For the purposes of this section the following may be taken to be a constituent or affiliated organisation in relation to a party''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By Neill's own figures, 3.5 million trade unionists paid an affiliation fee to the Labour party. Therefore, they are affiliated to it as are the organisations themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr, Linton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Well, I look forward to hearing his contribution to the debate.
<P>
Such organisations are, by their own admission, collectively for their members affiliated to the Labour party or are affiliated to it themselves. I recollect seeing representatives of trade unions at Labour party conferences holding up cards displaying the number of members of the Labour party that they represent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes his point clearly. The cards do not illustrate the membership of the trade union, but refer to the number of individual members who decided to affiliate themselves to the Labour party.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He has made the point that, if such people are members of the Labour party through an affiliation fee and have paid their fee to a trade union, the trade union should be an accounting unit for the purposes of the Bill. I stick by my argument in favour of the amendment that the trade union, which is collecting membership fees for the Labour party and spending some of that money through its political fund on behalf of the Labour party or furthering its cause, should be regarded as an accounting unit under the Bill. The Electoral Commission should be able to require that body—presuming that it meets the financial thresholds as an accounting unit—to deposit its accounts and supply information about donations and its expenditure to the Electoral Commission. That is entirely reasonable.
<P>
As we have said several times, we support the basic thrust of the Bill. We want to impose on our political organisations, whether they be political parties, groups of independents or trade unions, a transparency whereby the electorate can see through the political organisations and know from where the money is coming and on what it is being spent. It is wrong to exclude trade unions from the provisions of the Bill when, by their own admission, it is clear that they have signed up 3.5 million members of the Labour party. We therefore suggest a simple amendment that would enable the Electoral Commission to provide the oversight that we think it should have of the activities of political parties, however large or small, and however much they represent nutcase factions or causes that we might find a little obscure. We should be able to see the accounts of anyone involved in a political activity.
<P>
I shall leave the question of trade unions for the moment—I am sure that other hon. Members will want to say something on that subject—and deal with subsection (8)(b), because the amendment would obviously affect that. That paragraph deals with friendly societies and industrial and provident societies; as I said, Neill was silent on that subject. He appeared not to consider those bodies. It is conceivable that I could create the North Dorset Conservative friendly society. I could collect subscriptions from my members and have a political fund that would escape the provision of the Bill. That is a hypothetical case, but what concerns me are the activities of friendly societies and industrial and provident societies in the modern world. If they have political funds, they should be covered by the general provisions for companies later in the Bill. Otherwise, if they are or regard themselves as being political bodies, affiliated organisations or other forms of quasi-political organisation, they should come under the surveillance of the Electoral Commission.
<P>
We are looking for transparency. It therefore seems entirely wrong that a body which performs some political function—it may provide support for a candidate who is standing for election or for a political party, either directly in the form of photocopiers or staff, or indirectly by providing research—should somehow be excluded from that supervision. We impose it on our own political parties and on other political parties. Some of those bodies may be quite small and they will doubtless regard the Bill's provisions as particularly onerous. We should allow the Electoral Commission to use its judgment to decide whether a trade union or a friendly society operates in a manner that makes it a quasi-political party or the accounting unit of a political party. That would require trade unions, friendly societies or provident institutions to be subject to the same provisions as direct political organisations.
<P>
I come to subsection (8)(c). The amendment suggests that the Electoral Commission may take those other constituent or affiliated organisations into account under subsection (8)(c), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any other organisation of a description prescribed by order made by the Secretary of State on the recommendation of the Commission.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That gives power to the commission, but it is not clear what organisations are meant—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is too much muttering among hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> If it is unclear to me—someone who is involved in the political process—I fear that it may be unclear to those who expect the legislation to bring some transparency to the way in which we order the financial affairs of our political organisations. It would be unclear to them and we will have failed them.
<P>
I—and I hope my hon. Friends—will pursue the amendment, which seeks to make our system fair, so that organisations will not be excluded from the authority or the supervision of the Electoral Commission, when they are clearly part of the political process. I would be interested to hear from my hon. Friends, as well as from Labour Members—who are no doubt more intimately involved in the political activities of trade unions—why they feel that the amendment should be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall be brief. I support the amendment because I find it strange that the subsection exempts those groups. I do not mean that they should be treated as though they were constituent or affiliated organisations, but removing the remit from the Electoral Commission of considering individual cases seems rather strange. No other group has been given that exemption. My understanding of the legislation—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—is that it gives the commission the power to investigate whether other organisations are constituent or affiliated if it thinks fit.
<P>
I am mindful of what the Neill committee said about the matter; I have read the Neill report and accept that Lord Neill might be justified—as far as trade unions, for example, are concerned—in being satisfied that the existing system is working well. I am not suggesting that it is not—but times and events change. We are setting up a commission that has extensive powers of interference and it seems odd simply to identify certain categories and exempt them just because they do not need to be looked at now.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset made some compelling points about friendly societies, which are not covered by the Neill report. All the organisations appear to be ones that could be taken as constituents of or affiliated to a party, just as all sorts of other organisations—one can think of political clubs of various kinds in that regard, for example. On the face of it, Conservative clubs come in all shapes and sizes; as has often been said, some of them have a link to the Conservative party that seems so remote as to be almost impossible to detect. To my certain knowledge, some of them have not contributed a penny to party funds since the beginning of time—or at least for as long as I have been aware.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): I am interested to hear what my hon. Friend is saying, but I wish he would bear in mind that I am not only the Whip on duty, but the national chairman of the Association of Conservative Clubs—and I am not sure that I go along with everything he says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Mindful of the presence of my Whip behind me, I shall be even more careful in my words henceforth. I am also prepared to acknowledge that some Conservative clubs have been assiduous in raising funds—although that is variable.
<P>
The point is that as matters stand, some organisations may be treated as affiliated organisations, and others may not, but the commission can investigate the matter without further reference to the House, whereas the clause includes a category of exempt organisations. Although I acknowledge that, for the moment the existing arrangements may be deemed satisfactory I do not understand the rationale for singling out particular organisations.
<P>
The amendment is designed to elicit from the Minister why those organisations have been singled out. Obviously, he will be mindful of the fact that, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset said, historically the trade union movement does not seem to have been a major contributor to Conservative party funds. Given those circumstances, it is especially important to avoid the suggestion of a partisan element in the exemption, as I am sure the Minister would be the first to acknowledge.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Why has the exemption been provided? What would be the problem with simply leaving those groups to be treated exactly the same as any other organisation that might now or at some subsequent date be involved and might be deemed a constituent or affiliated organisation?
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I should like to follow on from the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield about how circumstances change over time. It is a long time—more than 20 years, in fact—since I had the privilege of being elected to what was then called the general management committee of the Newham, North-East constituency Labour party. My memory from those days, although it may be slightly inaccurate, is that, regardless of the affiliation status of trade unions nationally in relation to the national Labour party, some affiliated local branches of trade unions were directly affiliated to the individual constituency Labour party. Indeed, those trade union-affliated branches became the key battleground in the fight for control of the constituency Labour party, and, thereby, in the question of whether the sitting Member of Parliament, who at the time was a member of the Labour Cabinet, would be deselected by his constituency Labour party and thus effectively removed from Parliament at the next election.
<P>
What happened then could happen again in a different scenario—for example, if socialists were to re-enter the Labour party. That may seem a far-fetched proposition, but it is not completely beyond the realms of logical possibility. Indeed, one of their small surviving band, the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner), occasionally refers pleasantly to my brief and undistinguished but interesting career as a Labour activist between 1976 and 1978.
<P>
It is a serious point that it was possible, by dint of affiliating a trade union branch to a constituency Labour party, to nominate delegates directly to the management committee of the constituency Labour party and thereby ensure the dominance and direction of its affairs. We did that, and so did out opponents, and eventually major court cases centred intrinsically on that integral link between the trade union branches and the Labour party.
<P>
The clause and, in particular, paragraph (a), strikes me as being rather like the line from Shakespeare that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The lady doth protest too much''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Trade unions are the one body to which the provision will not apply. As I am sure the Minister will point out, paragraph (c) provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any other organisation of a description prescribed by order made by the Secretary of State on the recommendation of the Commission''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will also be covered by the provision. In that case, why pick out trade unions at this stage? Why not let the Electoral Commission consider the way in which all organisations operate and decide whether it is necessary to single out trade unions? My experience, albeit from the depths of history, leads me to suggest that they should not be in the front rank of bodies that are exempted.

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am a little puzzled about the scale of the exemption. I do not have the same first-hand experience as the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), but if we consider the likely consequences of any such exemption, what is the most likely conclusion that will be reached? When there is a tightly constrained system, everything will be done to exploit the exemption. The hon. Member for North Dorset suggested how he might so exploit it when he referred to the North Dorset Conservative friendly society. I describe that as a oxymoron, although I am sure that such an organisation exists.
<P>
The exemptions, whatever their purpose, may result in parties ballooning into the exempted area in order to bypass the regulations. How will the Bill stop a ballooning effect and expenditure bulging out into certain areas, cloaked by the exemption? The Minister was reluctant to concede an exemption for the Hazel Grove bypass action group because of the way in which it would undermine the principles of the Bill and possibly, by extension, democracy would be on the verge of collapse. Yet, apparently, the Transport and General Workers Union does not present such a threat. I know that the Minister does not indulge in the sort of athletic prowess that you do, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> A slur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am delighted with that sedentary intervention because I am looking forward to the gymnastics that the Parliamentary Secretary will perform to persuade the Committee that the Hazel Grove bypass action group is more of a threat to democracy than the TGWU.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I want to put some Opposition Members right about historical events, but I shall not go too far otherwise I shall end up quoting relatives of members of the Committee. The hon. Member for North Dorset was right about the early part of the century and he quoted from an eminent source. However, he failed to recognise that, just as has happened in the Conservative party as it has in the Liberal Democrat party, things move on within political parties. The Conservative party went through a period during which the Conservatives and Unionists were working together. We have had the Liberal party and the Social Democratic party.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman failed to recognise two matters: first, that a wide range of statutes govern the role of trade unions and what they can and cannot do with their money. Secondly, he has not recognised the changes that took place in the second part of the century. I say that as someone who has been active in the trade union movement for more than 30 years. I freely admit that I have in the past, under the rules that used to exist, held up cards with numbers and cast votes. Indeed, I have used such vehicles in the past to influence the selection of candidates in several seats in the north-west of England and on the south coast. Because I did that, it does not mean to say that it was right.
