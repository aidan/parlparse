                     <strong>Luciana
Berger</strong> (Liverpool, Wavertree) (Lab/Co-op):<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000449">&#160;</a>
                  </span> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Crausby. I
will speak to new clauses 8, 9 and 10, which relate to the warm homes
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The new
clauses work as a package. The intention is threefold. First, the new
clauses would define the purpose of the Government’s energy
efficiency and energy saving policies in part 1 and ground them in the
Government’s existing climate and fuel poverty targets. The
purpose provisions are designed to ensure that the Government set a
credible level of ambition for the green deal policy. Secondly, the new
clauses would place a duty on the Secretary of State to produce a plan
for improving energy efficiency. That would require the development of
a coherent cross-departmental strategy and provide greater clarity and
certainty for businesses. Thirdly, they would create a means of
reporting on progress towards achieving the aims set out in that plan.
The 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 45<a class="bkMark" name="Column45">&#160;</a>
                  </div>reporting provision would ensure scrutiny and
appraisal of the relative contribution of the entire energy saving
programme to meeting the Climate Change Act 2008 targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When we first
tabled the warm homes amendment in the other place in January, we had
only a few voices of support, but those voices and that support have
grown. The present provisions are supported by more than 70
external organisations. Those include not just the usual suspects, but
a broad coalition of non-governmental organisations, trade unions and
businesses. It is not every day we find an issue that unites the WWF,
the Federation of Small Businesses, B and Q, Greenpeace, Asda, the
Co-operative group, Tearfund, Green Alliance, the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, Unison, Friends of the Earth, the National Union
of Students, the TUC and the Mayor of London. I could go on,
because, as I said, the list has over 70 names, but I will stop
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The proposals
are also supported by the public. A YouGov survey in May found that
more than half the population—54%—want their
MPs to support improvements to the Bill to link the green deal to
existing carbon reduction targets. A few weeks ago, I was invited to
join a public meeting organised by Friends of the Earth in Liverpool.
It was a Saturday, the sun was shining—it was a beautiful
day—and both Everton and Liverpool were playing. Despite all
that, I was amazed by the number of people who turned up to give me the
same message: we must get the Bill right and we need to keep pushing
Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">People out
there are really concerned about the state of our planet and current
levels of fuel poverty. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore noted
earlier, it is estimated that 5.5 million people in the UK live in fuel
poverty. That is why other Members will, like me, have been inundated
by letters and e-mails from constituents urging them to back the
proposals. I do not know whether anyone had the chance to look at
Twitter at lunch time, but there was a whole tweet of support for the
warm homes amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is not
difficult to understand why people are so worried. Like all of us here,
they know the huge challenges we will face in averting climate
catastrophe. This task is so big that it transcends party politics. It
is a question of morals; it is the right thing to do, and we owe it to
future generations to leave them a better legacy than the one we
inherited. The fact is that we are not doing enough. According to the
International Energy Agency, energy-related carbon emissions reached a
record level last year. We need to take tough decisions and bold action
if we are to get on
track.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When
in government, the Labour party started to take the tough decisions
needed to reduce our national emissions. The Climate Change Act
2008—a world first and supported by all the main Opposition
parties at the time—commits the United Kingdom to reducing
carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050. It is important to remember
that when the current Ministers were in opposition, they not only
supported the Act but argued for us to go further. The tough talk did
not come only from Conservative Members in Committee, but the current
Secretary of State. The right hon. Gentleman was constantly telling
anyone who would listen to be wary of Governments who set targets they
would never have to achieve. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It
is too convenient for ministers to set targets against which their
efforts can be measured only once every five years, when the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 46<a class="bkMark" name="Column46">&#160;</a>
                  </div>typical term of office is only four years. These would be Nimto
targets—Not in My Term of Office targets—and would not be
worth the paper they were written
on.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000379">&#160;</a>
               </p>

himself.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
fourth carbon budget, which the Government agonised over before finally
accepting just a few weeks ago, recommended that the 2020 emissions
reduction target should be strengthened to 42%. We heard earlier that
domestic homes are responsible for 23% of the United Kingdom’s
greenhouse gas emissions, including through their use of heat and
electricity, and that commercial buildings account for a further 12%.
Without accepting our amendments and clearly stating that the green
deal measures are part of how the targets will be met, they are little
more than “nimto”
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have high aspirations for the take-up of the green deal. We
heard earlier from the Minister, when discussing the programme motion,
about his aspirations for the green deal and its take-up; it is not
clear how they will become a reality. Ministers have stated repeatedly
that 14 million homes will benefit from the green deal by 2020.
Starting today, that represents 1,500,000 homes a year, which equates
to almost 30,000 homes per week—almost 4,274 homes each day. It
is clear that the Government need to be ambitious with their energy
saving policies; otherwise, the UK will fail to meet its climate and
fuel poverty
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
meeting the Committee on Climate Change’s suggested figure, the
level of retrofits and of carbon and energy savings are as important as
the actual number of homes taking up the green deal, and that should be
the Government’s primary focus. It is important to remember
that, as well as reducing carbon, the Bill needs to be about reducing
the cost of household energy bills and tackling fuel poverty. A better
Energy Bill could minimise the anticipated rise in fuel bills, which
would be vital, especially with the Bank of England predicting an
increase in gas and electricity prices of between 10% and
15% between now and March 2012. Anything that mitigates such increases
will surely be welcomed, especially by households whose budgets are
already severely
squeezed.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
shall address the Government’s amendments in a moment, but I
want first to refer to a key business and investor concern: the
uncertainty about the potential scale of the green deal market, which
will act as the guide to the size of investment required. Without
understanding the expected contribution that energy savings will be
required to make to meet the carbon targets and the required depth of
retrofit to properties, it is less than certain that such a market will
deliver on the Government’s
aspirations.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government tabled new clause 7, entitled the “Energy efficiency
aim”, better to explain their ambition for energy saving
policies. However, it would not be up to the task. There is no stated
qualitative ambition within the new clause. It calls on the Secretary
of State to take action as he considers appropriate on energy
efficiency to contribute towards an 80% emissions reduction target by
2050. Such a contribution is not qualified, which means that businesses
currently have little indication of what ambition is envisaged for the
energy saving
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new clause only references 2050 as the end date for necessary emission
reductions. That ignores the five-year carbon budgets established by
the Climate 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 47<a class="bkMark" name="Column47">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Change Act 2008 and the Government, which are of
more immediate concern to businesses planning their investments. There
is no clear trajectory for required energy saving or any clarity about
what is needed to meet the requirements of the carbon budgets. The new
clause also seeks to repeal section 2 of the Sustainable Energy Act
2003, which is arguably stronger legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Crucially,
new clause 7 addresses only residential accommodation, while the green
deal and other parts of the Energy Bill are designed to improve
domestic and non-domestic buildings. There is no logical reason to
exclude non-domestic buildings in new clause 7. It is clearly stated in
the Energy Bill green deal impact assessment that the programme is to
include households and non-domestic
buildings.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
new clause 7, the Government could do very little to promote energy
efficiency—leading to delivery on the ground through the green
deal and other policies—while still complying with the
amendment. There is no additional driver for action. As such, new
clause 7 provides little further clarity on what the Government expect
to see delivered through their energy saving policies. That will fail
to provide the certainty that businesses desperately want.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New clause 6,
on the contribution to carbon budgeting, requires the Secretary of
State to report to Parliament on the contribution of green deal policy
and the energy company obligation to carbon reduction targets. We have
repeatedly called for an annual report, so we are pleased with this
movement from the Government. However, I am keen to learn from the
Minister what level of reporting will be required by new clause 6. Will
that reporting include information on emission reductions and not just
on the number of homes? In new clause 6, there is no plan for delivery,
which is what we are calling for in the warm homes amendment. There is
also nothing in new clause 6 to ensure an implementation plan for the
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
amendment—the warm homes amendment—seeks to provide more
clarity and certainty for business by establishing a purpose for the
Government’s policies, and by stating that the Government should
deliver energy savings from the building stock that make a commensurate
contribution to our carbon budgets and reduce fuel poverty. A more
qualified level of ambition is set out in our amendment, one that
directly supports the wider energy policy
agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000052">&#160;</a>

primary legislation—is about creating a 20-year market, which is
a long-term project by any definition; it is certainly not within the
terms of any single Parliament. Secondly, the green deal, although
absolutely critical to this Government’s carbon reduction
ambitions, is not the sole mechanism for achieving the carbon
reductions that this, the greenest Government ever, will achieve during
their time in office. Does she acknowledge those two

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 48<a class="bkMark" name="Column48">&#160;</a>
                  </div>ambitions set within that time frame. He says that the green deal is not
the Government’s only mechanism for achieving carbon reductions,
but it is the only mechanism that they say they will achieve their
targets through. As I have said, 43% of our emissions come from
domestic and commercial properties—that is just under 50% of our
total emissions—so those emissions really need to be linked to
our carbon emissions targets. That is something I feel very strongly
about. We cannot leave it all to the other 57% of properties that are
creating emissions.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000054">&#160;</a>

All I will say in response is that the green deal is the policy by
which the Government are proving their green credentials. They have
professed themselves to be “the greenest Government
ever”, and we want to see that reflected in primary legislation.
I do not believe that it is enough to say that there will be an annual
report that does not relate to our carbon emissions targets. Those are
not separate entities or separate issues; they are interrelated and one
cannot look at one without the

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
warm homes amendment is important, because it links directly to carbon
budgets, so it is possible to set out what action is necessary for each
five-year period, which fits better with business investment cycles. I
reiterate that point. Those in business say that we need that ambition
enshrined in law to know what we should be doing to prepare, what
opportunities lie ahead and what investment we should be making at this
stage and every five
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the level of effort undertaken on energy savings should be informed by
advice from the Committee on Climate Change, so that it is sufficient
and relevant to the wider challenge. Overall, and taken together with
the second part of the proposals, which introduce a plan and a duty to
take action on energy efficiency, the proposals would firmly ground the
Government’s energy saving policies within the pre-existing
targets on climate change and fuel poverty and would provide business
with greater certainty on the action required.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have heard
the soundbite about the green deal, saying that millions of homes will
be improved, that hundreds of thousands of jobs will be created and
that this is an once-in-a-lifetime refit of the nation’s housing
stock and the most ambitious energy-saving plan since the second world
war. However, talk is cheap. In the five parts, 89 pages and 186
clauses of the Bill, there is no clear plan for how those ambitions
will be realised. To even come close to achieving the hopes that the
Government have for the green deal, Ministers need to set a clear level
of ambition along with the plan for achieving it. The warm homes
amendment will provide that, and I hope that Ministers will support it
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000059">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I apologise for being
late—I had a long meeting at the Treasury. I want to discuss new
clause 7 and particularly amendments (a) and (b), which I have tabled.
My concern about the new clause is that it is vague. It follows the
Minister’s speech on Second Reading, in which he said that his
Department
will<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000060">&#160;</a>

1131.].<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000380">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>However,
that formal aim is specified not as a number or as a percentage, but
simply as a requirement to take such action as the Secretary of
State<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“considers
appropriate to improve the energy efficiency of residential
accommodation”.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000381">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is incredibly vague language, and it differs from section 2 of the
Sustainable Energy Act 2003, which requires the setting of an aim for
energy improvements in the residential sector—the aim required a
16% improvement by 2010. Section 2(4) of the 2003 Act required the
Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to achieve that particular
numerical aim, but that section will be repealed by new clause
7.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new clause is also weaker than the further statutory aim under section
217 of the Housing Act 2004, which set a 20% improvement aim by 2010.
As with the 2003 Act, section 217(1) of the 2004 Act
requires the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to achieve the
20% target, and time has superseded that. In new clause 7, we have
something that is weaker than the two previous Acts of Parliament, both
of which were supported by the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and
Labour parties. In that respect, new clause 7 is step backwards, not
forwards.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The new
clause is also so vague as to be virtually unenforceable.
“Reasonable steps” is such as a nebulous term that it is
difficult to know how one would judge whether that has been achieved.
Again, that compares unfavourably with the 2003 and 2004 Acts, which
specified that reasonable steps had to be taken to achieve a specific
percentage of improvements, rather than the unmeasurable and unstated
amount in new clause 7. That is why it is unsatisfactory in terms of
dealing with climate change and fuel
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>

preceded the Government’s two late amendments, which we are now
discussing. I suspect that those same organisations would support the
amendments, because in all my discussions with them in many meetings in
recent weeks they have said that they support the warm homes amendment,
principally because they want a mechanism by which we, and people
generally, can judge the Government’s success or failure in the
green deal. Requiring the Secretary of State to report annually to

place.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000079">&#160;</a>

relate a local comparison, early in this century, the homes which were
built early in the 20th century were nearing the end of their life. The
local authority introduced a plan, saying to the people in those houses
that it would pay for half the refurbishment of their home if they paid
for the other half. When we went into details, people asked questions
such as, “What happens if I want to move out of the house? What
happens about interest rates, and who will set them? What will I be
liable for?” The local authority could not give them the answers
that they wanted. Ultimately, the people did not buy into the scheme
and the houses were pulled

                  </div>down at huge cost to the local authority, which had to rehouse the
people living in those areas. My worry is that if we do not have the
confidence of the people doing the work, and if we do not have the

the debate on Second Reading, hon. Members on both sides of the House
gave a clear message that the ambition we have for our energy
efficiency policies should be firmly anchored in legislation. Hon.
Members also argued that such ambition would carry particular weight if
delivered in a way that was transparent and open to parliamentary
scrutiny. That can be ensured only if appropriate reporting
arrangements are in place. I listened to the debate and was persuaded
by the arguments that were made. As a result, I announced my intention
to put a formal aim, together with specific reporting requirements, for
our energy efficiency policies in the Bill. While I take on board the
comments from Opposition Members, I am very pleased to be able to
fulfil that promise with
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clauses 7 and 6 were brilliantly articulated by my hon. Friend the
Member for Richmond Park. New clause 7 sets out a formal aim, which
serves the same purpose as new clause 8, at least in terms of linking
the purpose of green deal delivery to the delivery of our carbon
budgets, which of course are the overarching framework to which my hon.
Friend the Member for Winchester so rightly and accurately referred. I
understand the wish for Government to set out a formal plan for the
green deal and the ECO through new clause 9. As part of the forthcoming
consultation, we will publish in detail how the programmes will be
constructed, and that will give some of the market participants to
which the hon. Member for Blaydon referred much of the clarity that
they
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
think there is still a fundamental pressure pulling members of the
Committee in different directions. Labour Members, in their heart of
hearts, yearn for a plan—a centrally organised Government plan
like Warm Front. They yearn for, perhaps not an old style five-year
plan, but a Government-driven and Government-owned programme of works.
That is not the green deal; that is not how it will work. Nor are
targets the way it will work, because we have been down that road
before and it ended in failure. The previous Government legislated away
fuel
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Earlier,
at the beginning of this century, the previous Government, with years
ahead of them, legislated that fuel poverty would be abolished by
2016—by 22 November 2016, my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden
reminds me. Yet the hon. Member for Ogmore has already reminded us that
when the previous Administration left office, fuel poverty had risen
year on year since 2004 to 4 million. The hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree said that 5.5 million are living in fuel poverty. We all know
that we are nowhere near—certainly, if we had maintained the
previous policy direction—abolishing 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 54<a class="bkMark" name="Column54">&#160;</a>
                  </div>fuel poverty, and we have failed those who live in such poverty. Putting
something in the Bill will not wave a wand or compel a Government to
create some great wish that we would all share to either abolish fuel
poverty or meet our carbon emissions targets. It is much harder than
that and we need a game changer. We need a new solution and a
framework. We need to be able to marshal resources that are
commensurate with the scale of the problem. We will only do that with a
new market-based framework, where we can take private resources and all

these social aims. It will not be reached by a programme of any kind.

targets, although I do not agree with that point of view. In the NHS,
we have seen that without targets, waiting times have gone up. I want
to draw on the reality of why targets on fuel poverty are important. In
my constituency, Hyndburn, there are 5,400 households in fuel poverty.
That is not just a number. If hon. Members were to walk the streets,
they would have the perception that there are many poor people living
in fuel poverty, partly because of the condition of the property stock.
We need to do something about it. This is 5,400 households with
families, children and grandparents—real people, with real
lives. I do not accept that there cannot be targets because energy
prices are rising. Fuel poverty has risen because of rising energy
prices, but that does not mean that we can neglect a target that
involves the old Victorian stock, which is, by and large, the problem
in my constituency. The Minister needs to take targets more
seriously.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000100">&#160;</a>

Gentleman is right: this is ultimately about people. It is about
families and the houses they live in. On linking the green deal to the
delivery for those families of our fuel poverty targets, I want to
remind members of the Committee that the impending review of the fuel
poverty target and definition will take all that into account. It would
therefore be inappropriate to include a reference to the existing
target and definition when we have already announced that we will be

point that the targets have failed, despite all the efforts and all the

people move before they can extract the economic value of doing this
and because the installers are not trusted. The beauty of this measure
is that it overcomes the two fundamental bottom-up obstacles to change.
Frankly, we should focus on that and stop shilly-shallying around with
trying to target the reduction in fuel poverty. We all want to reduce
it, but we have to understand why it has not happened and work with

the simplistic belief that targets alone can deliver change. Targets
are the easiest thing to set and the hardest thing to meet. That is why
this Government are putting less focus on targets and a great deal more
emphasis on road maps for delivery. It is the delivery and achievement

certainly one of the most cost-effective means of reducing emissions at
present. As hon. Members have said, however, this is a decades-long
programme, and we cannot predict the future and say for sure that that
will always be so. Committing ourselves, therefore, to a long-term
carbon budget sub-target for energy efficiency might put us at risk of
not following the most cost-effective pathway in future. Furthermore,
targets are not the most important factor in ensuring transparency or
accountability, which can be realised fully only through clear, robust
reporting on deliveries. The reporting is ultimately the
guarantee.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000107">&#160;</a>

Liverpool, Wavertree has said, 14 million homes by 2020 and 26 million
homes by 2030 is the trajectory. New clause 6 will achieve as much by
putting a specific requirement in the Bill to report annually on what
has been achieved by

                  </span> When I serve on
a Public Bill Committee, I always try to ask myself why we are here.
What is the purpose of what we are doing? Why are we passing this Bill
and not another? What is our aim? It is germane to ask such questions
in relation to this Bill. Are we trying to bring about a green deal
because we are not very happy with fuel poverty and would like people
to have warmer homes? Do we think it a bit embarrassing when we see
snug, warm homes in the cold climate of Scandinavia doing much better
than ours? Perhaps we should do a bit better as far as our homes are
concerned, so maybe that is what 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 57<a class="bkMark" name="Column57">&#160;</a>
                  </div>we will do. Is it about providing a jobs programme for people to get
involved in energy efficiency, because we know we ought to be doing a
bit more on
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are various possibilities and they all have some validity. However, as
I understand it, the overall purpose of what we are doing is that the
green deal, if it is to be the success it is claimed it should be, will
not just radically transform the energy efficiency of our homes up and
down the country, but do so to the extent that it will make a
substantial contribution—indeed, the major
contribution—to bringing about a far more efficient domestic
energy environment, with huge gains in relation to our climate change
targets. Not only is that a nice aim, but it is vital inasmuch as we
know that one of the key things that we have to do to meet our climate
change targets is vastly and radically to improve the energy efficiency
of our buildings up and down the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
things stand, this is about the only measure that will really get going
on that particular target. I say “target” because the
target of energy efficiency in relation to climate change is an
integral part of the overall targets that we have all agreed to in the
Climate Change Act 2008. Moreover, the other day the Government agreed,
wisely, to the fourth carbon budget and its radical targets, a key
building block of which are enormous increases in energy efficiency in
buildings. Indeed, if that building block were knocked away, those
targets could not be met, and neither could what we have signed up for
in the Climate Change Act or what the Government have just signed up
for in the fourth carbon budget. There is, therefore, a serious purpose
to the Bill, but that purpose is integrally bound up with
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000118">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Part of the success of the
Government’s laudable signing off of the fourth carbon budget is
the absolute certainty that it gives to investors that the Government
are wholly committed. They can charge headlong and go for what we need
to do on carbon reduction. A similar thing applies here. If we are
serious about the green deal and about having an army of people on the
ground creating green jobs and doing work on the green deal, we should
not be worried about putting our money where our mouth is and pinning
it down to identifiable
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000119">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Indeed. My hon. Friend makes an important point
in relation, again, to targets. The question in my mind, therefore, is
not whether we have targets or not. It may be the case that we have
simplified and fewer targets and we can choose which targets we have.
We have effectively already had a number of targets chosen for us by
the Climate Change Act and what we have done since then. Those are not
negotiable targets or targets that we can wish away. We cannot have an
inquiry into whether they should be maintained or not. As far as I am
concerned, we are signed up to those and we must stick with
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
although a portfolio of contributions to that target can be made, the
choice that the Government of any particular era have is to change how
the palette of different elements that make up that target will look.
Nevertheless, there has to be a palette of those ingredients to make up
that target. Not only must there be a palette, but we have to know what
that palette will look like. If parts of the palette prove to be less
successful than 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 58<a class="bkMark" name="Column58">&#160;</a>
                  </div>others, that palette has to be made back up again by improving the
success of other elements of it. Energy efficiency in buildings is an
absolutely key part of the palette of measures that go towards those
climate change
ambitions.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">How
that palette is made up may vary between Governments. Indeed, the
Minister made the point a moment ago that the previous Government
thought they could wish away various things by creating targets and
believing targets had somehow been achieved by wishing them into
existence in the first place. I think that was the purport of what he
said. He is not right, but he believed that to be the case. He has said
that a different way of achieving that goal is to go about this by
using market mechanisms. The green deal is essentially a market
mechanism for getting to those targets. That is why we are here. We are
talking about different mechanisms but the same
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
is my thank you note to the Minister. In the other place, there was no
talk of targets or of new clauses 6 and 7. Indeed, I am afraid there
may have been apocryphal exchanges such as, “Well, it’s a
market mechanism, so we don’t need to actually measure whether
it works or not. The market’s going to deal with it. You
wouldn’t go and tell Marks and Spencer how to sell its goods, so
why should you tell people how to deal with this?” Even if it is
a market mechanism, Marks and Spencer plans and looks carefully at how
many jumpers it is selling. It has daily returns of what jumpers are
selling in what stores. If the jumpers do not sell, it decides to sell
different jumpers in different colours with different arrangements. It
does so very quickly because it is concerned that its targets should be
sorted out so that its market is working
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000123">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
we need to find out why we have introduced the Bill. I think we
understand that. Secondly, having decided why we are doing it, we want
to know whether it is actually working. Thirdly, if it is not working,
we need to know what other things we should do to make it work, so that
we can carry on reaching the targets that we decided we were going to
reach in the first place. As I mentioned, my sort of thank you note to
the Minister is to express my gratitude for putting in place some
clauses that were not there before, as he said on Second Reading that
he would. However, those clauses essentially talk about recording as
opposed to relating what we are trying to do with recording and then
looking at how we might do better if we are not doing as well as we
might.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
previous Government’s fuel poverty targets might not have been
reached due to fluctuations in energy prices on the world market over
time, because fuel poverty is related to energy affordability. However,
interestingly, from 1997 to 2010 the standard assessment procedure
rating of UK houses rose by no less than 13 points. Over the
last five years of that period, the SAP rating, averaged across all UK
housing stock, increased 1.5 times as fast per year as in the first
five years. One could say that an underlying target had been reached,
inasmuch as a lot of progress was made on increasing the energy
efficiency of UK homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If we do not
keep to such targets and such a pace and give ourselves targets to
reach on that key element by a particular date, we might as well have a
SAP rating target to stand by: an average of 70 by 2020, or similar. If
we do not have targets to adhere to and simply say, “It is a
market mechanism and we will not bother to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 59<a class="bkMark" name="Column59">&#160;</a>
                  </div>keep our noses to the wheel as far as getting where
we want to go is concerned, other than reporting what’s
happening,” we are setting ourselves up to fail. I do not want
the green deal to fail, because it is all there is at the moment to get
us to one of the most important targets of all in terms of reducing the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New clauses 6
and 7 are good, but no cigar. New clauses 8, 9 and 10 get us towards
the cigar. Whether we will get the cigar in the end we do not yet know,
but we need to understand that knowing, by whatever measure, that we
have increased the efficiency of homes radically by a certain period
and on a certain trajectory, using methods that we can analyse and
revise if they do not work, is essential to making the process a
success. That is why I think that the new clauses are an essential part
of the Bill. The Government can take their choice of which one they
want, but the new clauses are supported by many organisations, as my
hon. Friends have said, and point in the right direction in terms of
the framework on which the Bill should be built. Putting new clauses 8

                  </strong> While we are on the subject, I feel compelled to
say a few words about targets, because we should bear in mind the wider
context of the urgency of climate change and what the science demands.
It suggests that the cuts necessary are far greater than anything that
we are discussing. I feel compelled to put that on record. We should
remember that the latest science makes it clear that the concentration
of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> in the atmosphere, which has risen from 270 parts per
million in the 19th century to about 435 parts per million today, must
stabilise at 450 parts per million at most. To be safer, and to run
much less of a risk, scientists are increasingly considering a limit of
350 parts per million.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s carbon budget targets, which culminate in an 80%
reduction by 2050, are based on the aim of stabilising the
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at about 550 parts
per million of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> equivalent. Worryingly, the former
Government’s Stern report says that, at that level, there is
still a 75% to 99% chance that the global temperature rise will exceed
2° C. If that happens, there is, as we know, a high chance of
runaway and disastrous climate change. I strongly believe that it is
imprudent and immoral knowingly to accept that level of risk. To
achieve a much safer level of CO<p class="Sub">2 </p>in the<p class="Sub">
</p>atmosphere, global emissions need to drop by as much as 60% as
soon as 2030. Industrialised countries with high emissions, such as the
UK, can afford to, and need to, reduce their emissions much faster. A
90% reduction by 2030 means an annual reduction of about 10% per year
from now until 2030.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000130">&#160;</a>

Member for Brighton, Pavilion. It seems that there is a cross-party
consensus on the issue. There are concerns across the board about how
rapidly the scheme will be taken up, but the reality is that no one can
possibly know, because this is a new scheme and a world first.
Hopefully, it will become something of a template for other countries
to follow, but it is hard to make predictions about it.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000132">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It would be
mad to imagine that the existence of targets will make the difference
between success or failure; that is not the bit that will make any
difference. However, I ask the Minister to acknowledge a point that I
made on Second Reading. I urge all the Ministers at the Department of
Energy and Climate Change to do everything they can to persuade the
Treasury to allow them to introduce greater incentives into the Bill.
There are things that could be done. For example, we could reduce VAT
on a wider range of energy efficiency materials or provide stamp duty
rebates for people who pass their homes on in the best possible
environmental condition. I could also include some of the wider points
that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion made much earlier today,
but those two incentives alone could make the difference between a
runaway success and something that is less than a runaway
success.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000133">&#160;</a>

we should put our emphasis. I know that the Bill does not allow an

households and commercial properties, so the green deal should be
linked to the Climate Change Act and the target of an 80% reduction by
2050. Sadly, I am not reassured by the Minister’s response and I

this morning’s sitting, the Minister led the debate on how those
who will benefit most from the green deal and who will be least
penalised by the green deal element of their bills will be those who
will, for whatever vagary, end up paying more. He reassured us that the
green deal will come into its own in a winter spell. As the bills
increase, the green deal will come into its own. If there is a
different characteristic in the make-up of the household than
originally stated, that will assist. I was fortunate to discuss with
organisations and colleagues during the break the fact that matters
seem to have the Bargain Booze mentality although other off-licences
are available, when people bulk buy to save more, but have spent a
tremendous amount to get those savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000139">&#160;</a>

deal payment on bills, although we need more clarity. Much debate has
taken place about the variable interest rate, and we should appreciate
the opportunity to discuss that further, too. We welcome the commitment
to explore water efficiency with DEFRA colleagues, and we recognise the
fact that the hon. Gentleman understands the serious worries of
Opposition Members about the energy company obligation going to the
able-to-pay sector. We want to flesh that out when we reach later
clauses on the ECO, but it is raising much worry outside of the

them away. He was lobbied by several hon. Members and he has tabled
amendments. New clauses 6 and 7 clearly anchor the scale of our
ambition for the green deal in the Bill. Whether they are cigar or no
cigar, as the hon. Member for Southampton, Test said, I do not know,

Let us get this legislation on the statute book. Let us get the green
deal up and running. Let us create this new market and motor on with
dealing with one of the biggest causes of our carbon emissions, which
is our existing housing stock. Let us also recognise, however, that the

I think we are much closer in terms of purpose and intent than this
rather abstract debate around targets might suggest. We clearly know
what we have to achieve. I listened very carefully to the hon. Member
for Southampton, Test, who always has something worthwhile to say. I am
grateful for the thank you card, which seemed to come with something
from Marks and Spencer as well. I am afraid that I cannot quite offer
him in return the cigar that was proffered, but I hope he

articulate way, the science of dangerous climate change is becoming
more urgent and more pressing. We need to grip that, but one should not
in any way interpret the lack of targets or sub-targets in
the secondary legislation as being in any way an underestimation of the
important points that she made on the need for action. We recognise
that, if we are going to meet our carbon budget, which the
coalition Government have signed up to meet, and meet our statutory
obligations under the Climate Change Act 2008, to which everyone in the

points that have been raised in the clause stand part debate, I can
only repeat what I said this morning. I do not understand why the hon.
Member for Ogmore, who is normally as sharp as a pin on these issues,
cannot quite grasp what we are saying. We are saying that those who
spend most on energy in the “leakiest” homes will benefit
most from the green deal. I can assure him that there will absolutely
not be a one-size-fits-all approach. The application of the golden rule
will be cautious, as I said this morning, to ensure that it does not
over-anticipate the savings that might come from any particular
technological intervention or measure. Each house will be individually
assessed for its location, the type of building that it is and the
energy usage of its occupiers. A collection of those factors will not
only trigger the green deal but the ECO. Where the occupants of a
building are in fuel poverty, the green deal’s weighting of the
ECO will be increased and the very poorest people will benefit most
from the ECO. That stands to reason.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000153">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am not in a
position to spell out the exact split or ratio, even if I wanted to.
But in all honesty, we are in sympathy with both sides of the Committee
in what we are trying to achieve. I fully understand what the hon.
Gentleman is saying about the need to ensure that we embrace fuel
poverty within the ECO, but I do not think that this choice is a binary
choice, or at least in many cases it is not a binary choice, as we said
this morning. Many of those in fuel poverty live in these houses that
are hard to treat. We will certainly not be prioritising Blenheim
palace or Castle Howard as recipients of hard-wall insulation.

spent. Ultimately there will be a finite resource in any given year,

                  </strong> I wish to make some brief comments on
clause 2. I would like to direct Members’ attention to
subsection (5). We have not tabled amendments because I am confident
that the Minister will clarify my queries—not concerns—on
the matter. In the past few months there has been a great deal of
debate on microgeneration, the green deal and particularly the
potential of feed-in tariffs and the renewable heat incentive; indeed,
they have potential. There has been debate particularly on how they
would fit either within the green deal or alongside it. There is a
significant difference 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 65<a class="bkMark" name="Column65">&#160;</a>
                  </div>between having feed-in tariffs, RHI or other microgeneration initiatives
in the future as part and parcel of the green deal and their being run,
in the words used by the Minister this morning, as a green deal max or
green deal plus—a bonus on top of it. There is a substantial
difference, and I would like to test the Minister’s thinking on
that in Committee, because there was not a great deal of debate on the
matter and little clarity in the other place. This is a good
opportunity for the Minister to lay out his thoughts
constructively.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is probably fair to say that this is an area in which the Minister and
his team have been taking soundings, not only in the past few months,
but throughout the past year. The situation has been fluid, and there
has been a lot of speculation, so now is the time to see whether we can
have some clarity, albeit that there is more work to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000166">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
2(5) deals with microgeneration, including two pretty comprehensive
definitions in paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii). Paragraph (a)(i)
mentions<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“measures
for increasing the amount of electricity generated, or heat produced,
by
microgeneration”.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000394">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 is specifically referred
to. It is a great Act, and has been referred to earlier in the
proceedings. Paragraph (a)(ii) refers
to<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“any
other measures for increasing the amount of electricity generated, or
heat produced, using low-emissions sources or
technologies”.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000395">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is tremendous and is to be welcomed, because the two combined, taken
with the definitions referred to in the 2006 Act, are up to date and
quite wide ranging. Once again, the Minister is to be applauded for
listening and for working hell for leather over the past few months to
try to incorporate this in the Bill. This is the first opportunity we
have had to discuss
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000169">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
the list of possible microgeneration technologies in section 26(2) of
the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 differs from that in
the Minister’s document of May 2011, entitled, “What
measures does the Green Deal cover?” The Act refers to biomass,
biofuels, fuel cells, photovoltaics, water, including waves and tides,
wind, solar power, geothermal sources—of both types, I
assume—and combined heat and power. The Minister may be able to
tell me that, even though his document does not replicate that list, it
actually covers the same things. I would like clarity. Perhaps I have
misread, but can he confirm that the full range of microgeneration
technologies in the original Act is replicated in the proposals? If
they are not—they may well not be for a very good reason,
because the Minister has done some impact assessments and has seen that
some of them will not work in the green deal—which technologies
are excluded and why is that the
case?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is laudable that the Minister and his team are thinking widely about
how the various strands of DECC policy can be brought together in
relation to energy efficiency and energy generation in individual
properties. It is undoubtedly the case that that type of thinking has
the potential to revolutionise energy by decentralising it. Perhaps it
will also appear as a stronger thread—I look to the
Minister’s colleague, the Minister of State, Department of
Energy and Climate Change, the hon. Member for Wealden—in the
evolution of the next energy Bill, which is much awaited, in relation
to how 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 66<a class="bkMark" name="Column66">&#160;</a>
                  </div>we deal with decentralised energy, as well as large, distant, remote,
large-scale industrial energy. I would certainly welcome
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister explain the Government’s thinking in relation to a
phased approach—we have heard some speculation about
this—to the introduction of some of the technologies to the
green deal? Does the Minister want to see genuine trial, piloting and
experiments, and learn from experience so that we have a graduated
roll-out—that would make sense—or is this another
Treasury-restrained area impacting on DECC policy? I would prefer the
former, not the latter. If there is to be a phased roll-out under the
clause, which of the technologies is likely to be first in line to move
forward, according to the Minister’s current thinking? I know
that he will not be able to give a precise answer right here, right
now, but he must have some idea of the top two or three that will
proceed—the Bill has been a year in fruition—and which
ones will go later and which ones will not go at all. They may be the
ones that I referred to earlier which do not seem to be replicated from
the original list in the 2006
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000172">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
microgeneration measures have been broadly welcomed by stakeholders,
including Friends of the Earth, the UK Green Building Council and
everybody in between. However, they have also called, as we do, for
urgent clarity on how the green deal will integrate with feed-in
tariffs and the renewable heat incentives in particular. I ask the
Minister directly: in this green deal max, as he has described it
previously, can the microgeneration technologies be included as part of
the green deal package, or are they a bolt-on as part of the overall
energy package? Are they integral to it, or are they separate but a
lovely thing to add on? If they are to be considered as part of the
green deal itself, do the household and assessor have to work through a
hierarchy of energy efficiency measures, which is where the big wins
are, to make sure that the home is at a suitable standard before they
can even consider some energy generation? In simple terms, what would
be the point of putting solar photovoltaic panels on a roof or of
ground source thermal if the energy is simply leaking through the
roofs, walls and
doors?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Dave
Powell of Friends of the Earth highlighted the separate danger that the
£10,000 limit for the green deal is probably insufficient to do
both microgeneration and energy efficiency. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“There
is a danger that you end up with one or the other, when you should be
doing
both.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000396">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
agree with that, because there is a big win for Members if we get the
green deal right, not only in energy efficiency but in being able to
say to householders and our communities, “You can metaphorically
insulate yourself from rising prices by generating your own electricity
and heat.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000175">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is very familiar with the income that is derived from feed-in
tariffs, which currently accrues to community schemes or individual
householders. Will that income—or other income derived from
measures that he might announce next year on domestic
RHIs—contribute towards the financing of a wider green deal
package, including energy efficient measures for a property, to make it
stack up? If so, the plus side might be a boost in the attractiveness
of the green deal for some people. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 67<a class="bkMark" name="Column67">&#160;</a>
                  </div>However, the measure is market driven and it might
also bring a significant downside. The pot of money for FITs is now
restricted. We are waiting to hear about the matter any day, so I am
not asking the Minister to pre-empt the fast-track solar
review—but is it happening this afternoon, while we are in
Committee?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000176">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> It has happened already. The downside of a
capped, feed-in tariff pot of money as part and parcel of the green
deal is that it increases the attractiveness for everyone. People who
are in more modern homes that they have already insulated will grab at
the scheme and say, “Hey, yeah—we’ll put in a
little bit more of the thicker insulation and we’ll also have
the solar panels on the top.” There will be a rush to the
scheme, which might exhaust that pot of money much sooner than the
Minister is expecting, and I know he has concerns about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
addition, the money may not get to those people who would benefit from
it even more. It may not get to those communities in which we could not
only upgrade insulation to a higher level, but we could say to people
in those stone-built, terraced houses, “You’ve done all
that—well done. You can also do this before the pot of money is
used up.” If that is the case, will the Minister have to ration
the FITs and RHIs under the green deal, or will he go back to the
Chancellor to argue for more money in the next Budget or the one after
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
questions about the use of microgeneration in the green deal remain
unanswered or unclear, and I have raised the issue to be genuinely
helpful to the Minister so that he can put his initial thoughts on the
map for us. We may have to return at a later stage in the Bill with
some amendments to clarify the Government’s intentions, but I am
hopeful that the Minister can answer those questions today and satisfy
the Committee that he is clear about how we will integrate
microgeneration into the green deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I remind the
Minister that he launched enthusiastically a microgeneration strategy
earlier this year. At that launch, the chief executive of the
Micropower Council, Dave Sowden,
said,<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
UK’s microgeneration sector is at the heart of a
citizen’s energy revolution. In tough economic times, this
rapidly growing industry is helping consumers to go green, has created
thousands of jobs, aiding economic recovery, and attracting
manufacturing investment here in the
UK.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000397">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>He
specifically paid tribute to the solar feed-in tariff that was
introduced by the Labour Government a year ago with fairly strong
cross-party support. The Minister’s response to that was poetic,
if a little less restrained. He said,<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000182">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I am

               </p>
               <p>In
the light of the clause, I therefore ask the Minister whether
microgeneration in the green deal is just the seed corn for reaping in
future years, or whether we will get the harvest plentiful, and
earlier. I look forward to his response.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000183">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The clause is
at the heart of the Bill, because it sets out what energy efficiency
improvement means. It allows for a broad range of measures to be
covered by the new framework, including measures relating to reducing
energy consumption as well as energy generation measures. The clause is
deliberately inclusive, allowing the greatest number of consumers and
businesses to benefit from the new framework. It enables the Secretary
of State to specify which types of measure will be eligible for green
deal finance. The eligibility criteria will be set out in framework
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000185">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
eligibility measures are being informed by consultation with experts
and stakeholders and will be based on the latest science and evidence
about the performance and quality of products. Indeed, the Energy
Efficiency Partnership for Homes has just conducted a call for evidence
on behalf of DECC on the performance and cost of the
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To give the
hon. Gentleman some clue about our thinking, he is absolutely right.
When we first conceived of the green deal, it was as an energy
efficiency programme, but what became clear as we developed the policy
in more detail was that, as the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion said
earlier, householders will want a total, holistic, green prescription
for their home. For many, that will mean taking advantage of
microgeneration technologies. I share the hon. Gentleman’s
passion for microgeneration, if not his eloquence. While in opposition
in 2006, I wrote a pamphlet for my right hon. Friend the Member for
Witney (Mr Cameron) on driving forward a decentralised energy
economy.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One of the
first things we will do to reform the feed-in tariff system we
inherited from the last Government is make a direct link between energy
efficiency in the home and the applicability of feed-in tariffs. We
will use the early comprehensive review to do exactly that. The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right that there was no link. The scheme as we
inherited it allowed people to bung solar panels on the roof without
any regard to whether or not the home was energy-efficient. In terms of
the hierarchy of measures taken, it must be right to look first at
energy efficiency improvements, and then and only then to consider
further microgeneration possibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The green
deal, at its core, is an economic model based on a payment mechanism
through the Energy Bill. The mechanism is based on energy savings.
Although microgeneration, at current costs, is complementary to the
greening of a home in all the ways that we can easily imagine, in most
cases it does not lead to energy savings, certainly if one does not
include the benefit of the feed-in tariffs.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, it is difficult to envisage how to drive down the cost of
somebody’s bills simply by including microgeneration technology.
I have no doubt that that will change in due course as the industry
scales up and microgeneration takes off in response to feed-in tariffs,
innovation and consumer demands. There are early signs about both
renewable heat and renewable electricity technologies—we must
not forget renewable heat, as it is probably more important in carbon
terms, ultimately, than generating electricity in the home—but
they are still some way from being energy-saving in finance terms.
There is some indication that heat pumps might be getting close to
breakthrough point, but it is still early days.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000190">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">That
is why we have endeavoured as best we can, having listened to comments
from colleagues on Second Reading and from stakeholders before
drafting, to future-proof the Bill to ensure that when microgeneration
technologies become more cost-effective, they can be met within the
golden rule. However, at the moment, given the costs of such
technologies and the feed-in tariff, I would expect a green deal
provider or assessor to advise on the energy saving measures that could
be undertaken in a home. I would expect those measures to be captured
and paid for through the green deal mechanism in the Bill, with no
up-front payment. It would be paid for through savings, subject to the
golden rule, with potential support from the ECO. He or she will also
point out the potential of these microgeneration technologies. There
will also be, I hope and very much expect, competitive financing
propositions, which will mean that there is another no-cost, up-front
alternative so far as the customer is concerned, depending on the
technology. Others may choose to pay something towards it and capture
more of the feed-in tariff benefits for themselves, depending on their
ability to pay. At the outset, we see them working in tandem. As the
price of these technologies comes down, we hope that in due course
there will be the potential to incorporate them within the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000191">&#160;</a>

that the green deal market will not be confined to the big energy
companies and big business. I am grateful that we have the opportunity
to debate amendment 38 alongside it. Baroness Smith tabled an amendment
similar to amendment 38 in Committee in the other place. Lord Marland
agreed to take it away and discuss reduced fees with ministerial

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
willingness of smaller and non-traditional players to enter the green
deal marketplace will depend on how well they are able to compete and
how easily they can access the new energy company obligation, and any
administrative costs. We know that the ECO will make up a substantial
proportion of the green deal market, and that companies of all sizes
need to know that they can carry out an assessment of any house and be
confident that, regardless of the household’s income, they can
install energy efficiency measures. The draft document on the ECO
recognises the need for an open market to ensure the maximum possible
scale and range of energy efficiency delivery overall. It states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“it
may be difficult and expensive for smaller Green Deal providers to
engage and negotiate with energy companies even when they can deliver
energy efficiency improvements very cost effectively. Also, for equally
natural business reasons, an energy company might also be a Green Deal
provider and might have a preference for funding their own internal
Green Deal activity. The company might prefer to provide ECO subsidy to
its own Green Deal transactions, as this would allow it to grow the
Green Deal side of its business and gain market share (at the expense
of other Green Deal providers which had no such access to
funding).”<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000399">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>It
is important to highlight that there is a real danger that the green
deal will become a closed marketplace, uncompetitive and dominated by
the big energy companies, which is not unlike the retail energy market
as it currently
operates.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000201">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Concern
has been expressed by several organisations, including the Builders
Merchants Federation, that the green deal as it stands relies too
heavily on big corporate names and favours vertically integrated
businesses that will dominate the marketplace from the outset with a
one-stop-shop approach. Retailers and the energy companies dominating
the marketplace could jeopardise the green deal’s likelihood of
success for two reasons: first, it would drive down competition and
increase prices for customers; secondly, the suppliers that are least
trusted by consumers would be the main drivers of the
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">According
to the consumer advice group, Which?, only one in five of the public
find their energy supplier trustworthy. Research by YouGov for the
Great British Refurb campaign found that 46% of the public trusted
their local authority to deliver a green deal scheme, compared with
just 28% trusting their energy supplier and only 9% trusting DIY firms
or supermarkets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000203">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There are
strong economic reasons for ensuring that small and medium-sized
enterprises have equal access to the green deal market. The
construction sector is dominated by small firms that have been
particularly hard hit by the recession. Even despite some growth in the
economy in the first quarter of 2011, construction activity fell by
4.7%—the sharpest decline since the first quarter of
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
a Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament, I am proud to be part
of a movement not motivated purely by the pursuit of profit but by
values of openness, social responsibility and solidarity. As well as
being founded on strong principles, in practice co-ops and mutuals can
be more efficient and are a positive force in our local communities. I
am very pleased that the Government have also recognised the value of
employee-led models. In a speech on 17 November, the Minister for the
Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, the right hon. Member for Horsham
(Mr Maude) Francis Maude, said:<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
evidence increasingly shows that they reduce absenteeism, improve
performance management, encourage innovation, and increase
productivity.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000400">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
co-operative model also makes sense economically. Last year the
co-operative economy across the UK stood at 12.9 million members, who
were part of just under 5,000 co-operative businesses with a turnover
of £33.5 billion, contributing 237,800 jobs to the economy. And
there is clear evidence that the model is already thriving in the
energy market. Baywind is a wind co-operative in Cumbria that has
successfully carried out two share offers since it was founded in 1996,
and currently has more than 1,300 members. It is clear that the green
deal would benefit from having co-operatives and mutuals as part of a
wide variety of green deal providers in the marketplace. That is why,
in addition to ensuring access to the marketplace, we would like to see
a reduction in the fee paid to participate in the green deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000206">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The framework

participation in the

               </p>
               <p>Ministers
and officials indicated in my discussions with them that this fee is
likely to relate to the administration costs arising from registering
as an approved green deal participant. I want to make it clear that we
believe it vital to have strong regulations in place to ensure that
only reputable organisations are allowed to become green deal
participants. However, that should not be done in a way that prevents
organisations that are not purely driven by profit from entering the
market, owing to excessive administrative costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope there
is broad agreement among all members of the Committee that we do not
want to exclude from the green deal the charities, co-operatives,
mutuals and social enterprises that want to benefit our communities and
focus resources on vulnerable people or households in fuel poverty. A
reduced fee would not only lessen the financial start-up costs for
those organisations but indicate to them that they have an important
part to play in the green deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The green
deal could be a catalyst for growth. The Minister has said that he
would like to see 14 million homes transformed under the green deal by
2020—a task that would require work to be completed at the rate
of almost 30,000 homes per week. Small contractors 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 72<a class="bkMark" name="Column72">&#160;</a>
                  </div>working locally are the obvious choice for
homeowners and landlords looking to make energy efficiency improvements
to their properties. Local firms provide a personalised service,
procure goods and services from other local businesses, create local
jobs and provide training opportunities for young people through
apprenticeship
places.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
the Federation of Small Businesses has highlighted that, under current
proposals, small contractors are at risk of being excluded from
delivering this work because there is no finance mechanism to allow
businesses that are not tied to major green deal providers to offer an
alternative service. Energy companies, major retailers and banks will
therefore dominate the market, and the choice of providers available to
consumers will be reduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A more
desirable market would be one in which local businesses, co-ops,
charities and social enterprises, particularly those with a focus on
tackling fuel poverty, are guaranteed access to the ECO. The amendment
does not seek narrowly to prescribe how that process should be carried
out, as the matter obviously needs to be examined in some detail. It is
easy to imagine a scenario in which the Government mandate that half
the work done under the ECO should be carried out by small and
medium-sized enterprises, co-ops, mutuals, charities and so on, either
directly tendered by the energy companies or through a third party. I
would be grateful if the Minister addressed that issue in some
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000212">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
what extent does the Minister think the Government will intervene in
the marketplace through the regulation of ECO spending? We touched on
that previously, but I am keen for more detail. Does he agree with the
principle of co-ops, SMEs and charities being equally involved and
having equal access to the green deal market? Will he acknowledge that
if the green deal is dominated by the big energy companies and big
businesses, it will not meet the ambitions he holds for
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
mentioned at the start that in the other place, Lord Marland said he
would bring in proposals for reduced fees. I am surprised that those
proposals have not been introduced at this stage. Will the Minister say
why that is the case and what consideration has been given to
them?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000214">&#160;</a>

that benefits local economies, communities and businesses or whether it
will be perceived as a top-down process that is done to
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000215">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister knows and has said many times, there is enormous potential
for job creation. Tens of thousands of jobs could be created in local
economies around the green deal. In my constituency, there is huge
excitement among local groups such as the local 10:10 group, the new
Brighton Energy Cooperative, many local businesses and the local
authority. All those groups are chomping at the bit to get on with
doing this; they are very excited about it. It is important to signal
at this early stage that we absolutely envisage that such groups will
be strongly
involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000216">&#160;</a>

than from a local business or builders around the corner, they will be
shocked and disappointed. I simply want to underline that the
amendments go to the heart of what kind of green deal we envisage. The
amendments would bring us closer to the kind of street-by-street
area-based comprehensive approach that many of us would like the green
deal to become. I hope very much that the Minister will give the green

amendment, but I do not feel that I can do so wholeheartedly. We are
all describing a situation that exists to some extent currently. A
number of small operators—often building companies—are in
the business and offer solar installations. Part of the problem is that
people do not trust small operators or feel that they have the
financial backing to do this. They are not sure that they will be there
if there is a problem. There is the whole issue of customer care, which
we will talk about later in the

said that, I would very much like to hear the Minister’s
comments on how we could include the not-for-profit sector or, indeed,
small businesses as part of the overall contracting mechanism, as we
have done in other areas—for example, in relation to the
welfare-to-work reforms. It is absolutely right to say that a number of
very good organisations could and should be involved, whether they are
co-operatives, voluntary organisations or, indeed, small businesses.
Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether there are some ways to
include them and to ensure that there is trust and customer care behind
the process.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000219">&#160;</a>

amendments 38 and 83. Amendment 38 would ensure that where an
authorisation fee was payable by green deal participants, it would be
reduced for charities, social enterprises, co-operatives and mutuals.
We fully endorse the enthusiasm of the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree for co-operatives and we certainly want them to play an
important part in the roll-out of community-level green deal
programmes. We recognise that co-ops and other social enterprises will
play an important role in delivering the green deal and therefore we
need to ensure that we take appropriate steps to support their
involvement, exactly as she says. We are also considering ways in which
we can encourage other important social benefits to come out of the
green deal—for example, encouraging local firms to take on more
apprentices to help to bridge the skills gap that is evident in the
sector. However, we need to carry out further work in consultation with
those firms and organisations and with interested parties before
specifying the details of how authorisation fees will be
levied.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000220">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked why we have not followed through on Lord
Marland’s statement in the other place. I can assure her that
that stream of work is ongoing, but we need to do further work on how
fees should be levied on the various green deal participants before
making commitments to specific fee levels for different bodies. We want
to be as open and flexible as possible about the way in which fees can
be used to deliver wider policy objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000221">&#160;</a>

very much in the spirit of the stream of work going on at the moment.
This is not just about social enterprises or co-ops. We also want a
fully engaged SME sector. We want to ensure that local green deals
really do add value to the local economy. As much as we welcome the
enthusiasm and support of the well known, national brands, we want to
ensure that there is strong local participation. I was very pleased to
be able to attend an event at Brighton university, in the constituency
of the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion. We had a very constructive
round table and were able to thrash out some of the issues that we
would need to get over to ensure that there was local take-up. That
work stream is ongoing in the Department. It would therefore be
inappropriate to limit our flexibility at this point by being specific
and placing details regarding the levying of fees in the

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
83 would require the Secretary of State to ensure through regulation,
audit and the code of practice that all types and sizes of organisation
had equal access to the market for supply and installation of energy
efficiency measures under the green deal. The green deal will stimulate
the market in the UK, driving growth across the supply chain. We very
much hope that there will be opportunities for all types and sizes of
company in supplying and installing a broad range of measures under the
green deal. We have been working closely with business representatives
covering a wide variety of company types and sizes to ensure that our
framework can work for as many as possible. I would be very happy to
share that stream of work with my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes.
If there are any contributions that she wishes to make or ideas that
she wishes to share, I would welcome her input. We will continue to
work with the sector as we set out our code in secondary legislation.

area.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000224">&#160;</a>

it?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000226">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I perhaps would not frame it in those words, but
for me a benchmark for the success of the green deal would be that it
spurs a strong local response in communities throughout the country. We
do not want to see only high street UK; we want to see 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 75<a class="bkMark" name="Column75">&#160;</a>

that will come from the likes of Marks and Spencer, B&amp;Q, John Lewis
and Tesco that also specialise in a good consumer experience.
Absolutely at the heart of the green deal is choice—choice,
choice, choice—and competition. We recognise, however, that it
is sometimes easier for the national players to benefit from such
programmes than it is for smaller, local SMEs, co-ops or social
enterprises. We will ensure that their special needs are taken into
account in secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000227">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The three amendments that I will speak to deal
with green apprenticeships, which we addressed briefly in our
discussion of the previous clauses; the recruitment and training of
green deal assessors; and the use of the comprehensive assessment tool
by green deal assessors, which will reliably estimate the likely energy
bill savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will start
with amendment 33, which deals with that comprehensive assessment tool.
The aim of the amendment is to ensure that the green deal assessment
method reliably estimates fuel bill savings. I expect the Minister will
say that the assessment method will be part of the framework
regulations. The amendment seeks to make the assessment explicit and to
ensure that it will also be part of the green deal code of
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am keen to
press the Minister on a number of points. It is believed that the green
deal will succeed or fail subject to whether the initial property
assessment is conducted correctly. That is the basis on which the
energy savings will be guaranteed or not and it is the basis on which
people will know what options are available to them when someone comes
to their home. We talked earlier about that episode—someone
coming to people’s homes—being very important. It might
not happen again until the person moves home, if at all.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There will be
not only the golden rule calculation but the estimates of likely energy
bill savings and the likely period during which the improvements will
generate those savings. That requires assessment criteria to be based
on a common standard that is approved and widely available to all
participants.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I talked
about the Builders Merchants Federation before. The BMF has also been
very helpful with amendment 33, suggesting that there will be a
software package based on the Building Research Establishment’s
standard assessment procedure software or reduced data standard
assessment procedure software. The assessment will need to encompass
many factors, including the construction of the property, its
condition, the function of the property and the occupancy, as well as
the interaction of different energy efficiency measures. There are
other factors that might need to be considered, such as variations in
location and region. My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore spoke earlier
about towns that might not be very far from each other but that still
experience different climates during the winter. There are different
companies and different prices, but a standardised assessment scheme
will provide a fair platform for comparison of the benefits of the
green deal for each consumer.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000262">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
given the lack of transparency in the energy market and fluctuating
energy prices—only today we heard about a 19% price increase by
one of the energy companies—with an upward trend in those
prices, how does the Minister intend to ensure that each green deal
fulfils the golden rule without an accurate and reliable estimate of
the likely energy bill savings?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Without our
amendment how will the Government protect consumers, when research
shows that fuel bill savings calculated by standard assessment
procedure can be, on average, 50% less than predicted? I want to
reinforce that point. Fuel bill savings have been calculated in the
past and they can be hugely inaccurate—they can be up to 50%
less than predicted. A recent report by Which? revealed that in a trial
comparing insulation assessments, on average consumers were given
over-inflated estimates of energy savings. How will people assess
energy efficiency improvements for low-income households, which
currently under-heat their homes? Also, will each assessor work under a
standardised assessment scheme?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000264">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Whether the
green deal makes financial sense for a consumer will also depend on the
price of energy; that point has already been made during today’s
two sittings of the Committee. If energy prices are high, energy
efficiency savings paid for by the green deal will be more
cost-effective. If energy prices fall, the green deal may not make the
savings on energy bills as
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000265">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Estimating
how much money households can save under the green deal is difficult,
because it depends so much on energy prices, inflation, the type of
retrofit undertaken and the state of the house involved. The main
estimates for the domestic sector use central projections of energy and
carbon prices. Changing those assumptions has a substantial impact on
the overall cost-benefit balance. If low energy and carbon prices and
high capital costs are assumed, the overall costs outweigh benefits by
between £6 billion and £8 billion. With high energy and
carbon prices and low capital costs, the net benefits increase
substantially, to between £16 billion and £25 billion.
Central estimates of the net benefits are between £6 billion and
£11 billion. Those estimates were provided in the Library
briefing on the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Domestic
energy prices could rise by as much as 25% over the coming decade, as
the big six gas and electricity suppliers warned the Energy and Climate
Change Committee on 7 December. I alluded earlier to the Bank of
England estimate of a 10% to 15% rise in energy bills by 2012. Those
figures were echoed by Phil Bentley, the managing director of British
Gas, who said:<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“If
you look forward to 2020, we are all expecting to see higher wholesale

investments”.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000402">&#160;</a>
               </p>

the chief executive of E.ON, Paul Golby, said:<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000268">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>We
all know that that is the case. I reiterate that the point of the
amendment is to ensure that we have a comprehensive assessment tool
that considers all measures, particularly energy prices, so that green
deal assessors can reliably estimate the likely energy bill savings
that householders and tenants will enjoy.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000269">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
spoke in debate on previous amendments about green deal apprenticeship
programmes. People across industry have said that their immediate
concern in the short term is to upskill the existing work force. They
also want the number of trained individuals to match demand. Youth
unemployment is an issue that the Bill could address, creating a
long-term pipeline of individuals capable of doing the work required
for sustained implementation of the green deal. The basis of the
amendment is that currently, the Bill does not ensure that a
well-defined apprenticeship programme will be prepared as a component
of green deal implementation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000270">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On 8 March,
the Government assured us that at least 1,000 green deal apprentices
could receive Government funding towards their training. The Deputy
Prime Minister
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000271">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
green deal is about the future, and it is important we ensure that
future generations have the skills they need to take advantage of the
opportunities of the green economy. These apprenticeships are a perfect
example of how Government and business can work together towards a
low-carbon
future.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000404">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Those
1,000 apprenticeships appear against the backdrop of the 350,000
apprenticeships already assured by the Government. They are a drop in
the ocean, in terms of the Government’s wider apprenticeship
ambition. The amendment seeks to ensure that a portion of those
apprenticeships are designated for the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
subject was raised in the House of Lords by my noble Friend, Baroness
Smith, in debate on amendment 20. She cited the Aldersgate Group
report, “Mind the Gap: skills for the transition to a low carbon
economy”, which makes some points that should be reiterated. One
is that whatever the speed of our transition to a low-carbon economy,
we must fix the skills shortage in those areas. I say “skills
shortage” having spoken to the Union of Construction, Allied
Trades and Technicians, which stated its concerns about the skills gap.
The skill set is not completely new, so we do not need to build up new
skills from scratch, but we certainly need training courses and further
work to enhance the current skill set.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000273">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The biggest
problem identified in the Aldersgate Group report is that because the
debate on work force skills has moved on so quickly, people at various
levels in engineering and manufacturing in the UK, including at the
highest management levels, have not really understood the implications
for the degree of change necessary. If we are to meet the significant
challenges that we want the green deal to overcome, we must ensure that
the skills are available. Companies want to understand the nature of
the change and explain the required skills to the work force.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000274">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I mentioned
UCATT; in 2008, together with Cardiff university, it prepared a report
that highlighted that construction apprenticeship training is in
crisis. Construction employers do not want to train anyone, and that
leads to a lack of long-term thinking or planning. Half the industry is
composed of a work force that is officially self-employed, and if
companies do not want to employ anyone, they certainly do not want to
train anyone. That worry has been echoed by many organisations and
businesses. As the sector is made up of so many self-employed people,
it is difficult to ensure that people are trained effectively to meet
the scale of the demand that the Government are anticipating for the
green deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000275">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
skills gaps and shortages in the industry are likely to be exacerbated
by the fact that the construction work force is ageing. In its 2008
report, ConstructionSkills predicted that by 2010, the sector would
need 500,000 new entrants and a major expansion in the four main
trades: bricklayers; wood trades and interior fit-out; painters and
decorators; and plasterers and dry liners. We are all expecting such
people to be upskilled to meet the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
referred earlier to youth unemployment, and I repeat that the green
deal will provide a fantastic opportunity to help our young unemployed
people. According to the figures released in February by the Office for
National Statistics, youth unemployment in the United Kingdom rose to
almost 2.5 million and hit a record high. While UK unemployment reached
a rate of 7.9%, youth unemployment was marked at 20.5%. Those figures
mean that one 16 to 25-year-old in five is out of work—an
increase of 66,000. The amendment would provide apprenticeships that
would help those young unemployed
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000277">&#160;</a>

academies in the big six, including British Gas Centrica, but by those
linked to higher and further education colleges, such as Pencoed skills
academy and those in Aberavon and elsewhere in the country? Training
would then not be dominated by utility players, and a wider range of
players could deliver the
apprenticeships.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000278">&#160;</a>

would like more of the 350,000 apprenticeships that the Government have

               <p class="tabbed">Under
amendment 31, consultation would take place with industry, trade unions
and key stakeholders to provide a plan for the recruitment and training
of green deal assessors. Its aim is to ensure that the number of
trained assessors meets demand, that those assessors are trained
adequately, and that the best recruitment and training plans are
implemented through the consultation of relevant groups, including
trade unions. At present, the green deal does not guarantee that proper
steps will be taken to ensure adequate recruitment to produce the
necessary number of assessors to match anticipated demands. Likewise,
the green deal does not include a solidified training plan for
assessors, generated through consultation with expert groups, including
unions and key
stakeholders.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
earlier amendment on the assessment tool referred to the fact that the
assessment requires skilled assessors. The green deal will require
higher levels of assessment, and so more training for advisers and
industry-recognised standards such as the energy performance
certificate. The Government have talked about the army of assessors
that will be needed if we are to meet the ambition of the scheme. Where
will those assessors come from, if the planning has not taken place to
ensure their recruitment and training? The Secretary of State has said
that the green deal is likely to support 100,000 jobs by 2015, and up
to 250,000 when it reaches its peak. Is there a plan to ensure that
those people are appropriately trained?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I raise that
point in the context of what happened in Australia. I am sure that hon.
Members on both sides of the room will have heard of the Australian
experience. We have heard many comments about it from the Secretary of
State and the Minister. Australia’s green loan scheme was halted
specifically by a lack of proper plans for training and implementation.
The Auditor-General’s audit report No. 9 of 2010-11
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000284">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
primary cause for the administration problems encountered by the
program was, to a very large extent, an absence of effective governance
by the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population,
and Communities during the program’s design and early
implementation…and did not sufficiently identify and manage
other key risks to effective program implementation in a timely manner.
These risks included: the quality of assessor training posed by the
absence of an accredited training course; the lack of policy or
administrative measures to control assessment demand; and staff in the
Green Loans team collectively not possessing sufficient skills and
experience in key areas of program
management”.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000405">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Underestimation
of demand and lack of assessor recruitment led, in part, to the
collapse of Australia’s programme. That collapse meant that
trained assessors had wasted their money on a programme that left them
without other job prospects.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000285">&#160;</a>

amendments, I will go into more detail on where the Australian
programme went wrong, and what lessons we can take from it to
strengthen the green deal. Some 100 people lodged claims for
compensation after they were put out of work. I would not want the
Government to undergo a similar experience. Those applying to be an
assessor typically spent $3,000 on training, insurance and membership.
With the scheme set to shut down early, their future was uncertain. The
amendments seek to ensure that the Government consult effectively with
industry, trade unions and key stakeholders to provide an effective
plan for the recruitment and training of green deal
investors.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000286">&#160;</a>

green deal to go down the Australian route. I have been very mindful,
since its inception, of the need for robust consumer safeguards, a
strong regime around installation, and—this was the hon.
Lady’s key point—a properly trained cadre of installers
and assessors; I think that we are at one with her on that. The green
deal will succeed or fail on the success and calibre of the people who
are trained to recommend and then install the measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000287">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I would like
to take amendments 31 and 33 together, because they relate to the need
to ensure that the green deal is supported by comprehensive assessments
carried out by appropriately trained assessors—that is one of
the Government’s priorities. On amendment 31, I assure the hon.
Lady that in clause 3, provision is already made for secondary
legislation that sets out the qualification and training requirements
for
assessors.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000288">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The code of
practice and the overall authorisation scheme will set out, in
considerably more detail, the training requirements of assessors, and
will involve full consultation with a broad range of stakeholders in
their development. I must also clarify that, because the green deal is
a market-led initiative, Government will not provide a plan for the
recruitment of assessors, but will be laying down measures to ensure
their
quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000289">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 33, we certainly support the principle that the assessment
must be of robust and high quality and able to deliver a reliable
indication of suitable measures, including those likely to be eligible
for green deal finance, to help enable householders and businesses to
make informed decisions. It is also essential to deliver estimated
savings that can be used by the green deal provider to provide their
quotes and the final green deal plan. However, clauses 1 and 4 already
require a qualifying assessment to be carried out, and secondary
legislation will detail specifications for the standardised methodology
and scope of those assessments. Members can be reassured of the intent
that the specifications will address the need for a reliable and
standardised
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
37 seeks to ensure that, before making regulations or an order, the
Secretary of State must report to Parliament with proposals on a
specific green deal apprenticeships programme. I confirm to the hon.
Member for Liverpool, Wavertree that we have already announced funding
for up to 1,000 green deal apprentices, and we will review that
commitment as the green deal develops to ensure that we have enough
skilled people entering the work force. We fully recognise the value of
modern apprenticeships, and the coalition has made two significant
announcements to boost the supply of apprentices across the whole UK
economy.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000291">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
assure the Committee that we will continue to work closely with the
sector skills council, other training providers and industry
stakeholders to ensure that the supply chain is ready by the time the
green deal launches at the end of 2012 and that industry can capitalise
on the market opportunities that the green deal will
present.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000292">&#160;</a>

receive rapid inspiration that will enable him to tell us. The figure

a slow implementation in the first couple of years of the

be informed by the industry itself and by practitioners, not
by—I mean no disrespect to my officials— Department of
Energy and Climate Change civil servants. We are drawing on the private
sector’s knowledge for that and it is working with us. I cannot
give the hon. Gentleman a reliable figure at this moment, but the issue
will feature in secondary legislation and I anticipate that further

response. He should also talk to local authorities, which, over the
past five years, have gone through the decent homes work. Some of that
is not just about being a craftsman, but about relating to the public
in a way that people may not have in the past. There are the unforeseen
circumstances such as going into a home to re-lay pipes and ending up
disturbing asbestos. We can learn things from the experience of what
has been a big programme of work over the past five
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000295">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is absolutely right—the hon. Gentleman
makes a good point. If we go into those older homes and if we are going
to be more ambitious, there will certainly be things such as disturbing
asbestos. This is not just about simple installations. It is not like
popping some solar panels on the roof. It is an intrusive process, into
the fabric of the building. The hon. Gentleman makes another
interesting point. It is not just about having the skills to do the
job; it is also about having the interpersonal skills to reassure the
householder of the merits of the scheme and to assure them as the work
is going on. It can be intrusive or even distressing for people to see
their home being knocked around. It is important that we have a range
of skills and to not just think that this is about fixing certain
products into the home. That is why we are working with the industry.
The forum that we have created is mindful of those issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000296">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I understand
that it is frustrating for members of the Committee that we do not have
all the detail at this stage of the green deal process, but it is the
very nature of how we are doing it, by bringing forward the broad
framework in this legislation and the detail in secondary legislation.
There will obviously be a whole process leading up to that, involving
full stakeholder consultation. That is not just a glib nod towards
standard consultation; we want to have a collaborative approach in
building these regulations, in creating this framework and creating
these robust standards. That means working closely with those who
understand best practice in the industry and understanding how we can
further drive that forward. I hope that the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree will feel reassured by those points. On that basis, I urge
her to withdraw her amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000297">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the Minister for his comments, but I will
come back to amendments 33 and 37, on the green deal
apprenticeship programme and the comprehensive assessment tool. Those
two elements are so important that they should be enshrined in the
Bill. The comprehensive assessment tool should be enshrined because the
assessor coming into someone’s home is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, and if they do not give a reliable estimate of the energy
that the person will save, the whole of their green deal is rendered
useless. We want to see green deal apprenticeships work. I appreciate
that the Minister has said that the Government will provide the plan
for the recruitment and training of the green deal assessors, we want
to see a bigger ambition. Although we welcome the 1,000 green deal
apprentices, that is a tiny fraction of the 350,000 national
apprentices. We want the Government to do everything that they can to
challenge and address youth unemployment. This is a fantastic
opportunity, and we want to see it enshrined in primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000298">&#160;</a>

purpose of the amendment is to ensure that we definitely have those
things. We must have them to ensure that the framework regulations and
the code of practice identified in the clause are set as the minimum
compliance standards and that cowboy green deal providers are kept out
of the market place. The reason for the amendment is that the word
“may” obviously provides uncertainty. With the recognised
mandate from the Government and industry support, customers would be
able to remain confident that their green deal supplier is accredited,
accountable and trained to a high standard, which is the basis for the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000326">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Environmental Industries Commission, which represents more than 230
companies and organisations, of which 80 are active in its sustainable
buildings and energy efficiency policy group, believes that the
Secretary of State should regulate for a body to authorise persons to
act as green deal participants to ensure that there is industry and
consumer confidence in the scheme and in those providing related
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000327">&#160;</a>

know that the intention is there. I reiterate that the point of the
amendment is to ensure that those things definitely happen and that
there can be no wiggle room. Does the Minister not agree that the word
“may” instead of “must” provides wiggle
room, and therefore cannot be classed as watertight? I use that word,
because on Second Reading the Secretary of State said that the green
deal will

                  </strong> I am extremely concerned about
the big difference between “may” and
“must”—I am not the only
person—and, as my hon. Friend has alluded, about the quality of
workmanship that may occur under the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000330">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
issue with the green deal will be its sheer scale and size. The
overriding point is that the scheme will open the door to a large
number of contractors. The pressure will be on to get so many
contractors and assessors into it to deliver the
Government’s target of 14 million homes by 2020. In doing that,
there is a real danger that contractors will enter the green deal
market and, even with the best intentions, fail
to provide an adequate service, which will lead to ongoing
problems. Qualifications and training are also
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000331">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to draw the Committee’s attention to “The Consumer
Protection Report”, published on 11 May, which highlighted the
situation in the purchase of double glazing. People experienced poor
workmanship by accredited double glazing merchants and fitters, many of
whom had the industry marks and standards—some had dubious marks
and standards. Under a statutory instrument, double glazing might be
part of the green deal. The report highlighted concerns within the
industry about the poor quality of installation and also of selling
double glazing. I am sure that that is reflective of many trades where
there are good and bad workmen, and we cannot necessarily rely on
accreditation and some of the marks. I am concerned that we may be
introducing a code of practice; I believe that we must introduce a code
of practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000332">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I saw the
<em>Financial Times</em> at the weekend. I understand that the Minister
has tried to address the lack of trust that there might be in energy
companies by offering assurances about the green deal. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000333">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Green Deal will be the biggest home improvement programme since the
second world war, shifting our outdated draughty homes from the past
into the future, so it’s vital people can trust it. I have heard
too many cases of shoddy workmanship or dodgy technology from
government schemes in the past, so from day one there will be strict
rules about standards, information will be readily available and there
will be a proper route for
complaints.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000409">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
of the schemes that have been introduced are undertaken not by the
public sector but by the private sector. Private sector delivery is
what concerns me. If there were schemes that did not provide what
people wanted in the past, it is important that a code of practice
reinforces high standards and that the problem with double glazing, for
instance, is not repeated with private purchasers on the open
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000334">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When
we speak to people on the doorstep, they tell us that there is real
concern about the delivery of home improvements and contractors. The
Government may argue that a code of practice is more bureaucracy, but
this confidence issue will not go away. It is important that there is a
safety mechanism and that people who engage in the green deal know that
there is a robust code of practice, which will give them
confidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000335">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
of the people who will be most affected are those in fuel poverty. They
will have the greatest nervousness about the lack of a code of
practice, or a code of practice that may or may not be introduced and
that the Government are not really committed to. That causes real
concern. At the bottom end, there must be consternation among those
wishing to buy into the green deal about the safeguards in relation to
the contractors who may do the work. Without doubt, there are
contractors who will not provide the same standard of work as other
contractors, and there needs to be redress. Consumer confidence in
delivering the green deal is really important. That is the point that
the Minister was
making.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000336">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Anne
Robinson, director of uSwitch, said in that article
that<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000337">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“public

               </p>
               <p>That
reinforces the point about the security that people want in the
qualification, the training and the provisions within the code of
practice. One could make that argument for paragraphs (b) to (g), but I
do not wish to prolong the debate, because I think I have made the
point. If the Government want the scheme to be successful, they need to
give people trust in the system, which is a key
element.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000338">&#160;</a>

would make it compulsory for the code of practice to make provision for
every matter listed in clause 3(4). However, it may not be necessary or

practice will be made over the coming months and in light of the

               <p class="tabbed">Clause 35
defines the parliamentary procedure in relation to the code of
practice. I assure hon. Members that a draft code will be laid before
Parliament and will not be issued if either House resolves not to
approve it. That procedure accords with the recommendations of the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, and I hope that that
addresses hon. Members’
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000342">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Moving
on to amendment 40, it is our current intention to enable installers
and assessors to be authorised via membership of authorised bodies, for
example an installers’ trade body. Where that is done, we will
look to regulate those bodies. However, it is possible for the
Government to choose not to offer authorisation via such bodies if they
do not meet our requirements. If so, it will not be necessary to make
provision to regulate them. We would therefore like to retain the
Bill’s current, more flexible, formulation, particularly as we
enter discussions with those bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000343">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Consumers
will be protected by the green deal code of practice. That will require
green deal providers, installers and assessors to adhere to high
standards, and also robust accreditation and certification of those
standards throughout the delivery chain. In the event that green deal
providers fail to meet those standards, the Bill enables us to provide
for redress for consumers. That could include the withdrawal of
authorisation to carry out green deal work, the cancellation of a
customer’s obligation to make green deal payments, the award of
compensation or the imposition of a financial
penalty.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000344">&#160;</a>

appropriate regulation of green deal participants is vital if the

Deal”. In that document, the Department of Energy and Climate
Change set out its plans for consumer protection and redress. There are
other parts of this particular clause that we have had some difficulty
with, but we are fully behind the Government in this regard. The plans
that they set out in that document last week to set up the new green
deal code, the new green deal advice line and the appointment of the
United Kingdom Accreditation Service—I seem to remember
“UKAS” in previous incarnations—are all to be

more detail. It is not jam tomorrow, but lashings of consultations and

                     </span>
                  </strong> I will be brief because time is pressing. There has
been lots of talk on clause 3 about ensuring that the green deal ushers
a flourishing of suppliers, especially when we discussed amendments 83
and 38. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree particularly mentioned
that. She knows I agree wholeheartedly with that point. In his
response, the Minister referred to wanting to see a strong community
response to the green deal and that flourishing of suppliers.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000361">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It might be
helpful if I briefly mention on the record an organisation with which I
have been working in my constituency that is a good example of such an
approach. That organisation is called GreenWin and is part of
Winchester city council’s climate change programme. GreenWin is
essentially building a district-wide network of suppliers and
installers that are affiliated to it. The idea is to build a database
of local suppliers and installers street by street. As the hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion rightly said, that is exactly how we want the
green deal to work: street by street. That database will be created on
the basis of moderated customer feedback. GreenWin will then act as a
quality check on delivery, but that delivery will be majority community
based. It is about establishing a sustainable catalyst for the green
deal—a district-wide hub—that brings together suppliers,
consumers, residents and locally qualified and obviously approved
trades in a way that is independent and unbiased. In short, that
organisation provides a place for someone to take their green deal
assessor’s prescription.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000362">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is how I
see this working. The GDAs will write someone a prescription—in
the same way someone would get one from an optician, to use the
Minister’s term—and they will take that to their supplier
through organisations such as GreenWin in my area. I hope that will
become a blueprint that other parts of the country can copy. I have not
heard of any other organisations like it. People can take their
prescription to an organisation such as GreenWin, which has moderated
independent customer feedback, and they can use that to allow them to
make an informed choice as they pursue their green deal choices. That
is exactly what a strong community response is
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000363">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As we look back over the clause, on which
there has been an excellent debate from all parties, it is worth
considering what we are trying to do and what we are trying to avoid.
Just for a moment, I want to cite once again the Australian experience.
People talk about trying to avoid the Australian experience in the
abstract. Let me give one clear example. This is from a publication
called <em>The
Australian</em>:<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000364">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“When
it comes to safety, consumers and workers rightly expect their
governments to protect them. So when Peter Garrett rolled out a $2.5
billion scheme to insulate nearly 2 million homes in two years, it was
fair to assume the Environment Minister had done his homework. Instead,
despite repeated warnings from the electrical industry, he bulldozed
ahead with his pet green scheme without ensuring all the safeguards
were in place. A man was 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 89<a class="bkMark" name="Column89">&#160;</a>
                  </div>electrocuted before the Environment Department outlawed the use of metal
staples, which had been banned in New Zealand two years earlier. A
16-year-old boy was killed in a ‘live’ roof before the
department issued safety rules instructing installers to turn off the
power. It was not until last week’s electrocution of a third
worker—a year after the scheme started—that the
department removed foil insulation from its rebate scheme, and made
safety training mandatory. These rules ought to have been in place
before the government decided to heart-start a small industry with ad
hoc standards and little training. The scheme was a magnet for new
businesses to make a quick buck bulk-billing the federal
government.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000411">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
cite that quote in full because the debate has shown that the Minister
is committed to completely avoiding that example and to getting things
right. Subsequent to the Committee’s deliberations and the
primary legislation, if additional consultation is
required—perhaps we might revisit some of the issues we have
talked about in considering the amendments—that is the way to do
it. We must get things in place in the right way, so that we avoid such
a situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000365">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have a
good industry of various contractors in the UK across all sorts of
skills and disciplines. It is quite something, however, to pull them
all together into a green deal provider of various different skills
under one individual man or woman who goes into a house. We must get
that absolutely right and I know that the Minister is committed to
doing so. The Committee must be assured that by the end of our
deliberations and by the time the Bill is enacted, we have considered
the matter properly. That is why this afternoon’s debate, with
all its to-ing and fro-ing, has been good.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000366">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In relation
to the new clauses and amendments that are under discussion, and to
other parts of the clause that have not been dealt with, I put to the
Minister the questions that have been raised by Consumer Focus and
other organisations. On the trigger, where measures have already been
installed, how will the charge be communicated to prospective tenants
and property buyers? How will disclosure be proved? Who will carry the
risk of non-disclosure? I am sure that the Minister will provide a
straight response to that. On the advice, people have asked about the
relationship between the final quote by the green deal provider and the
charge placed on the bill when new costs arise as part of the
installation. The Minister will have a direct response on that matter.
On financing, what information will the consumer be given about finance
options and the cost of the green deal? How will options differ for
consumers in fuel poverty on pre-payment meters—the issue raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn—or in hard-to-treat
homes? On installation, how will the work be signed off as complete and
added to the consumer’s bill or pre-payment meter?<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000367">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We dealt with
some of those matters this morning, but the Minister will want to take
the opportunity to put his clarifications on the record. With those
comments, I thank Committee members for their contributions to an
excellent debate on clause 3.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000368">&#160;</a>

Government amendment 23 and new clause 5 amend clause 3, which gives
the Secretary of State powers to establish in regulations a scheme for
authorising persons to act as green deal assessors, providers and
installers, and for regulating their conduct and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 90<a class="bkMark" name="Column90">&#160;</a>
                  </div>redress. It also includes powers to require green deal providers to
enter into multi-party agreements with energy suppliers. That is
essential to prevent malpractice and mis-selling, to ensure that the
financing mechanism works and to ensure that consumers can have
confidence in the green deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000369">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I assure the
hon. Member for Ogmore that we have absolutely no intention of
repeating the Australian experience. The hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree was right to highlight the lack of assessor accreditation in
Australia, which was a key flaw in its programme. The Committee may be
interested to know that my officials recently met the lead reviewer of
the Australian programme, who reassured us that the provisions in the
Bill responded well to their experience in Australia. We are not,
therefore, going into the scheme blind; we are engaging with the
Australians to try to learn specifically from their unfortunate
experience.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000370">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the heart
of the clause is the power to issue a code of practice, with which
green deal participants must comply as a condition of their
authorisation. The clause sets out overarching provisions that may be
contained in that code, which will be in place to protect customers.
Those will include requirements covering qualifications and training,
insurance, customer information, marketing and redress. All
participants must meet those requirements as an absolute
minimum.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000371">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Customer
protection is at the heart of the measure, which provides further
powers should participants not comply. Subsection (8) specifies that
the provision entails powers to remove authorisation to act as a green
deal participant, as well as a number of other options, including
cancelling the liability of a bill payer and requiring a green deal
participant to pay compensation or a financial penalty.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000372">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 23
and new clause 5 also provide that the Secretary of State can incur
expenditure on preparing the green deal authorisation scheme before
secondary legislation is made. It is vital that we have the necessary
authority to undertake preparatory work, to ensure that services are in
place and to deliver best value for the taxpayer before the launch of
the green deal in autumn 2012. From the timetable, it is likely that we
will be engaging the stakeholders to develop secondary legislation in
late summer or early autumn, and in October we hope to launch the
formal consultation and draft statutory instruments. We will probably,
therefore, lay the secondary legislation before the House in March
2012, so it is important that we have those powers before the
launch.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000373">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To conclude,
the powers established by the clause, and the amendments to it, will
enable the Government to put in place the nuts and bolts of the
operation of the green deal and to ensure strong customer protection
through robust standards. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will
accept the clause, and I commend the amendment and new clause that are
grouped with it to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11060756000374">&#160;</a>
