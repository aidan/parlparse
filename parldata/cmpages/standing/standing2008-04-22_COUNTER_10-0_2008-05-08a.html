						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000309"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Welcome back to our deliberations, Mr.
Bercow. The start of my little speech states that we have grouped these
amendments together because they relate to the treatment of a single
offence. That is not meant to be a discourtesy to the House: we are
happy that the House has grouped these amendments together, with advice
or otherwise. Nevertheless, they relate to the treatment of a single
offence under section 113 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act
2001, as it appears in the various lists of offences in the Bill. That
section makes it an offence to use noxious substances or things to
cause serious violence or endanger human life or public safety, to
influence or intimidate the Government or the public. That is an
offence where the conduct takes place in the United Kingdom but also,
by virtue of section 113A and subject to some conditions,
overseas.</div>
					<a name="08050881000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 135 makes post-charge questioning for the section 113 offence
possible, irrespective of whether the conduct relating to the offence
took place in the UK or overseas. Under the previous version of the
clause&#151;that originally tabled by the Government&#151;a person
charged with an offence under section 113 could be questioned about
that offence post-charge if the criminal conduct took place overseas,
but not if the offence was committed in the UK. That clearly is not a
condition that we would want to prevail. Under the amendment,
post-charge questioning will be available when the conduct constituting
this offence took place in the UK as well as abroad.</div>
					<a name="08050881000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, in
relation to the list of offences triggering the notification
requirements in clause 39, under amendment No. 142 the notification
requirements will attach following a conviction and appropriate
sentence for the section 113 offence, whether it was committed overseas
or in the UK. Finally, Government amendment No. 137 removes the
reference to section 113 of the 2001 Act from schedule 2 to the Bill.
That schedule lists the offences 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>for which the court in England and Wales or Scotland must consider
whether there is a terrorist connection triggering aggravated
sentencing and the notification requirements, which is germane to the
next set of amendments.</div>
					<a name="08050881000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The section
113 offence is being removed from this clause because, by virtue of
amendment No. 142, the notification requirements will automatically
apply following a conviction for the offence, so no determination of
the terrorist connection is needed. Furthermore, as the section 113
offence is a terrorism offence, it will already be subject to a
sentence which recognises that fact, and thus will not need to be
considered for an aggravated sentence. In effect, amendment No. 137 is
a consequence of the other Government amendments. That is eminently
straightforward, and as clear as anything, and I commend the amendments
to the Committee.</div>

						<a name="08050881000310"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): The amendments do not
present huge difficulties. While we are about it, perhaps the Minister
would like to consider, and if necessary write to tell me, what a
noxious thing as opposed to a noxious substance is. It would be useful.
The very first Bill I ever considered in Committee was the Public
Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill and it contained a prohibition on
playing a musical or other instrument. We had a very interesting
discussion about what another instrument might be, without engaging in
prurient speculation. The wording was deleted from the Bill&#151;we
were left with musical instruments and not other
instruments&#151;which was the first time that I ever succeeded in
getting anything deleted. I should therefore be grateful if the
Minister could tell me what a noxious thing is and how it differs from
a noxious
substance.</div>
					<a name="08050881000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000311"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I can assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that
if it transpires that it is as irrelevant as the item in that Northern
Ireland Bill I shall happily&#151;I am in the mood, as the Committee
has already seen this morning&#151;accept an amendment from the
Opposition deleting the phrase &#147;noxious thing&#148;. The full
extent of what it adds to our knowledge and to the 2001 Act may well be
utterly redundant, but I suspect that that is not the case. I cannot
off the top of my head think of a noxious thing that is other than a
noxious substance. But these little tests are sent to try us. If I do
get inspiration&#151;if it is afforded during our
deliberations&#151;I will, of course, let the Committee know.
Otherwise, I shall welcome with open arms the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s amendment. For now, however, let us leave
&#147;noxious thing&#148; in the 2001 Act, and the references to
&#147;noxious thing&#148; in the Bill. I shall scurry away, do my
homework and inform the Committee in due course whether there are
noxious things that are other than noxious
substances.</div>

						<a name="08050881000312"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): I have a
suggestion: a pathogen would not be a noxious
substance.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000313"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Funnily enough, having recently dealt with a
couple of statutory instruments on pathogens, I am pretty sure that a
pathogen is not a substance, in law at least. I am therefore with the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, but if any Committee member can
correct me, I shall duly give way to them.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>
					<a name="08050881000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said earlier&#151;the
hon. Member for Newark was absent but he would have been delighted had
he been here&#151;given that we do not want undue specificity, the
assumption is that there are things that are noxious that are not
substances. I fear that I shall not go down the Lambeg drum route that
I am provoked into, but if all these things are covered by
&#147;substance&#148;, then I shall do the Committee&#146;s
bidding. However, I think that the pathogenic hon. Member for Somerton
and Frome is entirely right, and that there are things that are not
substances but are
noxious.</div>

						<a name="08050881000314"></a>
							<b class="B">Patrick
Mercer</b> (Newark) (Con): I wonder whether the Minister
thinks that this is a
canard.</div>
					<a name="08050881000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000315"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I am not sure whether a canard is substantial or
is simply a thing, but I did mention canard earlier, when I said that
the hon. Gentleman and I have long experience of considering Bills. I
am sure that he has his bingo card, and has duly ticked off
&#147;canard&#148;. Had he been here this morning&#151;I am sure
that he had his reasons for not being&#151;he would have ticked off
&#147;undue specificity&#148;. I have another little list, and I am
sure that towards the end of our deliberations he will be able to shout
&#147;Bingo!&#148; and wake the rest of the Committee up.</div>
					<a name="08050881000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a serious note, if
&#147;noxious thing&#148; adds to the coverage of that part of the
2001 Act, as I think it does, we should let it lie. However, I shall
consider the import of what the hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield suggests, and if the term does not add anything, I shall
come scurrying back to the Committee or the House with a suitable
amendment to expunge the irrelevancy from our legislation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000316"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 26,
page 19, line 11, at end
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(e) the common law offences
of murder, manslaughter, culpable homicide, kidnapping or abduction, in
relation to an offence listed in subsection (1)
above.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08050881000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to the specificity of clause 26, which lists an awful
lot of offences that have the meaning of a terrorism offence for the
purposes of certain sections of the Bill. However, the list does not
accord with the list of offences in schedule 2 for which a terrorist
connection is to be considered. I understand that the lists are for
different purposes, but this is a probing amendment to discover from
the Minister why the common law offences listed in my amendment are
omitted from the clause. Those offences can clearly be related to
terrorist offences, and we would expect post-charge questioning to be
pursued for such offences if they were relevant to the facts of a case.
I am sure that there is a good reason for that, but I should like to
know what it
is.</div>
					<a name="08050881000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000317"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is
entirely right that the clause does not include the definitive list
from the previous two Acts, but that is not for the reason suggested.
Most of the common law offences in his amendment are already covered,
because the court will dictate that they are terrorism-related, and
that is enough for them not to be on the list. Any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>common law offence that the court duly decides is terrorism-related will
be included, so we do not need the list that he proposes.</div>
					<a name="08050881000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is astute, and will know that there are some minor offences
in those previous Acts that we do not regard as appropriate for
post-charge questioning, such as refusal to leave a cordoned area on
the instruction of a police officer. The amendment is unnecessary,
because the Bill already allows for questions about other offences in
England, Wales and Scotland when a court confirms that they are
connected to terrorism.</div>
					<a name="08050881000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000318"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I entirely understand that point, but my difficulty
is that the court will not be able to provide such confirmation until
the person is put before it. Without judicial supervision of
post-charge questioning, the person will not be before a court when the
determination is made about whether post-charge questioning is
legal.</div>
					<a name="08050881000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000319"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Once charged, the individual is effectively under
the protection of the court, so those charges, duly laid, will reflect
the offence, and at that stage, if it is murder and connected with
terrorism, there is provision for it to be made clear on the charge
sheet. In England and Wales, if a judge made an order under section 29
of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 for a preparatory
hearing to be held on the basis that the offence was connected to
terrorism, post-charge questioning would be possible. Those hearings
automatically take place when an offence carries a maximum sentence of
more than 10 years, which is certainly true of murder. I am assured
that under the 1996 Act and provisions in the other Acts, common law
offences, when linked to terrorism, can and should be duly considered
under clause 26 of the Bill without there being a broad and extensive
list of any potential common law offence that might or might not be
attached to, or have, a terrorism dimension.</div>
					<a name="08050881000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are right to get rid of the
minor offences in the 2006 Acts, simply because to put them in the
context of post-charge questioning would not elicit much further
information. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about judicial
scrutiny, but we have let it lie and will return to it at a subsequent
date. I hope that that satisfies him and that he can withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08050881000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000320"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> Up to a point. I am grateful to the Minister for
his response. As he said, we have agreed to let lie for the moment the
question of judicial supervision, which made it all the more surprising
that he appeared to suggest that judicial supervision was the answer to
my conundrum about how we deal with post-charge questioning when the
court has not yet considered whether the offence has a terrorist
connection.</div>
					<a name="08050881000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000321"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I was referring to no such thing. That, in the
words of the hon. Member for Newark, is an utter canard. I did not give
way on judicial oversight at all in terms of post-charge questioning.
We will come back to the matter, as I have said, and I look forward to
it.</div>
					<a name="08050881000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000322"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I thought that I used exactly the expression that
the Minister used: that we had agreed to let the matter lie for the
moment. That is why it came as some surprise when he gave it as his
explanation&#151;it would appear to me&#151;as to how to define a
common 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>law offence with a terrorist connection: that it would be determined by
the court when the person involved had not been put before the court at
that stage, unless we were in the circumstances of judicial supervision
of post-charge questioning. I hope that we will return to that matter
and that he will accept that it has a place in the debate.</div>
					<a name="08050881000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The list of
common law offences is not long, and it would not be the end of the
world if that short list, which is the same as the list that uses up
only five lines in schedule 2, were in the clause. I accept what the
Minister says about the need to limit the provision in order to avoid
the minor offences that might otherwise be caught in the schedule. That
is common ground. There is no difference in what we expect to happen;
my concern is simply that not considering the matter at this stage
leaves a loophole&#151;yet again&#151;that we might need to fill. I
ask him to consider that last point again. On that basis, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

							<a name="08050881000330"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> These are probing amendments, so my right hon. and
learned Friend might find that they facilitate a more general debate on
the clause. The Committee will recollect that, in the course of our
preliminary deliberations, we received evidence from the Lord Advocate,
who provided a great deal of reassurance. She said that there was
little anxiety among the Scottish Government about the clause, which
was designed to facilitate trials taking place with maximum
flexibility in relation to the United Kingdom. In her judgment, it was
not intended to be used, and would not be used, to try to remove cases
from Scotland or, for that matter, vice
versa.</div>
					<a name="08050881000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
we cannot simply allow clause 27 to pass without taking a closer look.
When I look at the clause, two issues spring to mind, on which I would
like a response from the Government. First, the clause lists a number
of offences under the Terrorism Act 2000 that will be caught by the
provisions, which will enable a trial to take place anywhere in the
United Kingdom. For the most part, they did not cause a great deal of
trouble, although I must confess that I was struck by the reference
to</div>
					<a name="08050881000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;section 51 (parking
a vehicle in contravention of an authorisation or
restriction)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08050881000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that that might have an intimate terrorist connection, but I am not
sure that it is so serious&#151;unless accompanied by other
factors&#151;as to be an area in which I would wish to depart from
the ordinary rules on where a matter is tried. I flag that up with the
Minister, and it would be helpful if he could provide an explanation,
because the Government have been quite careful in selecting the
provisions covered by the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08050881000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it
is also provided that the Secretary of State may by order amend the
subsections to add to the list anything that he likes. I accept that
that must be done through the affirmative procedure, but, as the
Minister knows, I have a rather old-fashioned dislike of it partly
because individual offences tend not to be put to the House to be added
to a list. The chances are that we will get six or seven, one of which
we might dislike, while having no problem with the remainder. In such
circumstances, we can do nothing except vote against or in favour.
Given that I would have expected the Government to have covered in the
clause all existing terrorism legislation that they felt needed to be
subject to this unusual provision, in reality nothing else should need
to be added, except under subsequent legislation, which could be done
without any problem by virtue of tabling the suitable consequential
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08050881000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find
subsection (6) somewhat surprising, because it purports to have a
retrospective effect, and that might bother me more than any other part
of the clause. I do not want to make too big a fuss about it, and on
one level I can see that provisions already exist for offences to be
moved from Scotland to England for trial under certain set
circumstances, particularly in cases of conspiracy, for example.
Nevertheless, we have two distinct legal systems and it could be argued
properly that individuals are entitled to the protection of the legal
systems under which they live and certainly to certainty under the law.
That is different from the accused suddenly being told that even though
the law did not operate at the time the offence was committed, they
will be tried in a jurisdiction other than that in which the alleged
offence was committed. Although I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>derived a great deal of reassurance from the Lord Advocate&#146;s
evidence, which removed much of my anxiety over the clause, it still
seems to me that some issues need to be teased
out.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000331"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I have only two observations. First, may I say to my
hon. and learned Friend that although I recognise and share his dislike
for the process of amending statutes by order, I very much prefer the
affirmative to the negative procedure? He is entirely right that an
order made under either is unamendable, and that is the great vice of
using the procedure.</div>
					<a name="08050881000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
observation reinforced the point that my hon. and learned Friend made
with regard to subsection (6). There is actually quite a significant
point of principle here. He has mentioned retrospection, and of course
it is entirely right that persons should not be subject to different
sentences dependent on a law being applied retrospectively. That also
applies to jurisdiction, because it is rather hard to say that a person
can be tried in a jurisdiction that they could not be tried in unless
the law was made retrospective. That will probably not happen in
reality, because those classes of case will disappear with the passage
of time, but there is an issue of principle here, and I have a strong
degree of sympathy with my hon. and learned Friend&#146;s
point</div>

							<a name="08050881000332"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield for recognising that the Lord Advocate&#146;s evidence
was extremely useful for understanding these clauses. She gave a
formidable and informative performance, which was one of the few saving
graces of using the evidence sessions as a prelude to our
deliberations, as I thought that she was very good. She said not only
that the principal source of the amendment lies in concerns and
anxieties north of the border, but that it was absolutely
clear</div>
					<a name="08050881000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the real
priority here is the public interest, and terrorism in that context
demands that we act closely together to ensure both the public interest
and fairness for the accused.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official
Report, Counter-Terrorism Public Bill Committee, </i>22 April 2008; c.
91, Q249.]</div>
					<a name="08050881000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 27
gives UK-wide jurisdiction for specific terrorism offences so that they
can be tried in any part of the UK, as the Lord Advocate clearly
stated, irrespective of which jurisdiction they were committed in. Hon.
Members will know that London-Glasgow last summer was the source of
some of the concerns raised about the clause. The clause applies to
offences listed in subsections (2) and (3), which are offences under
the terrorism legislation and the ancillary offences associated with
those, such as conspiracy and incitement. The clause covers more minor
terrorist offences, so that in some cases a person can be tried
together with a linked defendant in another jurisdiction who might be
charged with a more serious offence. When considering the core element
of dual jurisdiction and where to try in the first place, those minor
offences might bring in other defendants from another jurisdiction to
the major offence and the major defendant in the principal
jurisdiction. That is why some of the more ancillary and lesser charges
are included.</div>
					<a name="08050881000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will
be possible to prosecute terrorism cases in any part of the United
Kingdom, irrespective of where they were committed. Rightly, however,
under the principles 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>of common law, a substantial measure of the criminal activity must have
taken place in the UK for a court to take jurisdiction over an offence.
The common law rule has been established for sensible reasons, and in
the vast majority of cases it results in the court that is best placed
to deal with the offence having jurisdiction. However, when
cross-border situations arise, the rule might result in linked offences
that happen in two different parts of the UK having to be tried in
separate trials in different parts of the UK with an ultimately
detrimental effect on bringing individuals to justice. That would be
inefficient in that it would involve duplication of witnesses and
evidence, a waste of resources and almost certainly less effectiveness
than if the cases could be joined and tried together in the one
jurisdiction.</div>
					<a name="08050881000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision in the clause will be extremely helpful when, for example, in
a single investigation there are linked defendants, one in Wales and
one in Scotland, both of whom are found to be in possession of
terrorist articles, which is an offence under section 57 of the 2000
Act. Each defendant could be tried only under separate jurisdictions as
the common law rule would prevent a joint trial, no acts of the Welsh
defendant having taken place in Scotland or vice versa. The provision
in clause 27 will allow such cases to be tried by the same
court.</div>

							<a name="08050881000333"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I may be expressing an anxiety that is ill founded,
but the right hon. Gentleman knows that in Northern Ireland there are
Diplock courts, or trial by a single judge. Is it possible under the
clause for people who are normally resident in Scotland or England and
Wales, where they would normally be subject to trial by jury, to be
transferred to Northern Ireland and face trial by a single judge for a
terrorist-related
offence?</div>
					<a name="08050881000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000334"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> That is an entirely fair point, but not so, as I
understand it&#151;if someone to the left of me falls off their chair
I will have misinformed the right hon. and learned Gentleman. The
provision covers principally England and Wales, and Scotland, but if I
am wrong, I will happily stand
corrected.</div>
					<a name="08050881000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
already examples of legislation that enables prosecutions to take place
in any part of the UK. The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and
the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 include such provisions.
Amendments Nos. 126 and 136 would clarify the scope of clause 27 by
limiting the purpose of UK-wide jurisdiction to dealing with
terrorism.</div>
					<a name="08050881000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 136 makes it explicit that an offence can be added to the
list only if the Secretary of State believes that it is necessary for
the purpose of dealing with terrorism. The order-making power could not
be used to create UK-wide jurisdiction for offences that are not
related to terrorism. Clearly&#151;this is almost a rerun of our
previous deliberations&#151;there can be and will be ancillary and
precursor activities and offences that seem not to have anything to do
with terrorism, but
do.</div>

							<a name="08050881000338"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> That may well be the case in terms of the
jurisdictional point. My concern and hesitation was on the point about
the juryless element and Diplock, and where we are in dismantling that
paraphernalia as well as the security and terrorism paraphernalia and
legislation in Northern Ireland consequent on the peace process. The
Committee will know that as part of the peace process and embedding
devolutions in Northern Ireland, we are seeking to unpick all of the
emergency legislation that prevailed regarding terrorism and security,
including using the Bill to do so. We are also, as we already have in
at least one regard, taking measures that were relevant only to
Northern Ireland and making them UK-wide provisions because they are
useful for the wider threat that we now face. If I have confused
people, I apologise, but it was on the point about juryless trials that
I was unclear; the broader issue of Northern Ireland&#146;s
jurisdiction being within the United Kingdom I happily accept as a
matter of fact.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000339"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> The right hon. Gentleman will remember that right at
the end of last year, there was the case of Hoey before Mr.
Justice Weir, which concerned the Enniskillen bombing. That makes the
point that the single judge is still operating without a jury in
Northern Ireland. Unless something has happened in the last three or
four months of which I am unaware, there are still judge alone
trials.</div>
					<a name="08050881000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000340"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> That is the point that I am not clear on. I am
not sure whether we have already started to disestablish, or whatever
the phrase should be, that particular paraphernalia. It might be that
precisely because the case involved Enniskillen, an horrendous atrocity
of so long ago, it still pertained to the old system, and a new system
has come in. The jurisdictional point is well made, but if the push
from hon. Members is that including Northern Ireland should not include
the juryless element&#151;whether or not a substantial part of the
offence took place in Northern Ireland&#151;I am happy to take that
back, and I think that I would absolutely
agree.</div>

							<a name="08050881000341"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I would be grateful if the Minister would do so
because an amendment needs to be inserted to say that the movement,
this UK-wide jurisdiction, shall not be used for the purposes of
depriving a person of the benefit of trial by jury. That would solve
the problem. Such an amendment need not exclude Northern Ireland
specifically because indeed, some Northern Ireland cases could be
transferred here, for example, but it is a very important
issue.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000342"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I would agree. Doubtless, if I do not say so
someone else will: given the concerns about the potential retrospective
nature of part 6 and the substantial offences and activities that have
been committed in Northern Ireland, that point becomes all the more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>important. It is certainly not the Government&#146;s intention, by
sleight of hand or otherwise, that any case under England and Wales or
Scottish jurisdiction that had a remote Northern Ireland connection
should be thrown over the Irish sea to be dealt with by Diplock courts.
I will get clarification on that and hopefully write to the Committee
before our proceedings end.</div>

							<a name="08050881000343"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> On a different and minor point, which I hope the
Minister will not feel is completely irrelevant, I wonder whether the
Government have had any discussions with the Governments of the Crown
territories within the British Isles regarding reciprocal arrangements
for jurisdiction in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. It seems
entirely possible that terrorism could be aimed at UK interests in the
Channel Islands, presenting a difficulty with jurisdiction that is not
entirely covered by the clause dealing with offences committed outside
the UK.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000344"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is entirely right and his
point is not completely irrelevant. It is a perfectly fair point and
one that I will explore, but I would think that in most instances,
without offending anybody in the Isle of Man or anywhere else, in a
dispute over jurisdiction between a Crown territory and any of the UK
jurisdictions, the dominant UK jurisdiction would prevail for legal,
practical and other reasons. I know that there has been discussion, but
I am not sure whether we have reciprocity to underpin what we are
trying to do here in cross-jurisdictional bases.</div>
					<a name="08050881000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point is fair and moot, albeit minor; I would not go so far as to call
it irrelevant, but if a significant element of a terrorist case in
Northern Ireland, Scotland or England and Wales was under Isle of Man
jurisdiction, which is perfectly feasible, I find it difficult to
believe that such a case would not be taken to trial by the senior
jurisdiction, especially if it was a serious case. I say that without
offending anyone in the Crown territories. However that is a fair point
and I will explore it and get back to the Committee.</div>
					<a name="08050881000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 126 and
Government amendment No. 136 seek to do the same thing, but on balance,
in limiting it to dealing with terrorism, the Government amendment does
that better. For that reason, and with all due humility, I cannot
accept the amendment tabled by the hon. and learned
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="08050881000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 166 and 168 would remove the ability of the Secretary of State to
amend the list of offences for which there will be UK-wide
jurisdiction. Unless the Committee tells me otherwise, I think that we
have covered that pretty
well.</div>
					<a name="08050881000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
take away the points that were made entirely fairly
about the retrospective nature of subsection (6). I think that the
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham&#151;not
for Sleakeham&#151;is entirely right when he suggests that such cases
will be very rare and that there may be no need for the provision at
all. It is put in there to cover all eventualities, given the serious
nature of these offences. I appreciate the point of principle involved
and the Government&#146;s intention was not to open up
retrospectivity as a more general point. If hon. Members have alighted
upon a more  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>sinister import, I will come back to them in all due humility. However,
I do not think that there is. I think that incorporating that is a belt
and braces element in trying to create cross-jurisdictional
clarity.</div>

on board the anxiety that has been expressed that we
should not facilitate trials without juries and for the assurance that
he will look at that. In conclusion, I slightly reserve my position on
subsection (6). I continue to have anxiety about the retrospectivity of
these provisions. It may, as my right hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham rightly said, prove to be
entirely academic because it is hoped that such a case will not arise.
However, I think that people are entitled to the benefit of the
jurisdiction in which they commit their offences. If Parliament is
going to remove that, to do so retrospectively is a slightly dubious
procedure. I shall reflect on that and I beg to ask leave to withdraw

I did. Would he agree with this proposition? It is certainly the case
that the Lord Advocate&#146;s evidence was extremely valuable. One of
the problems that affects Bills of this kind where we are dealing with
Northern Ireland and Scotland, is that often we do not have the opinion
of the relevant authorities within each part of the United Kingdom. It
would be a jolly good thing if as a general rule we could have advice,
for example, from the law enforcement agencies of Northern Ireland in
respect of that part of the Bill that touches on Northern Ireland when
there are no Unionist or Northern Ireland
representatives.</div>

						</b> As far as I am aware, because I take the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, through the usual channels and in the usual
fashion the Conservative party was asked if one of their Members would
stand down in lieu of a Democratic Unionist party representative. As we
see, that request was not greeted with any
equanimity.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000356"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I do not want to get into discussions between the
usual channels. I simply want to record my gratitude to the Lord
Advocate. I think it was my request initially for her to attend and
give evidence. I thought that she gave evidence extremely well. As I
said, she put to rest my concern that this was being done unilaterally
to the Scottish jurisdiction rather than at its instigation, which was
clearly the case. That was useful.</div>
					<a name="08050881000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taking forward the point made
by the right hon. and learned Gentleman, very often I am concerned when
we are dealing with criminal justice matters in this House affecting
Scotland that we do not have the benefit of colleagues from Scotland to
give their advice. I appreciate that we have one Member from a Scottish
constituency on the Committee, but he is the only one. There was a time
when it was normal to have a Scottish Office Minister present on a Bill
like this to deal with the issues relating to Scotland. I do not
criticise the Government for this because since devolution many of
these matters are dealt with by the Scottish Executive. I understand
that entirely, but it means that we have to take particular care when
we are dealing with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>Scottish or the Northern Irish jurisdictions to make sure that we
understand what the issues are and get them
right.</div>
					<a name="08050881000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although my
mind was put at rest as far as the general case that there was
agreement across both sides of the border that what is set out in this
clause was an advantage, my one remaining anxiety is about what might
happen if there were a disagreement. The Lord Advocate was very
generous in her comments about her relationship with the prosecution
authorities in England and Wales and said that she got on extremely
well with the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General and the Director
of Public Prosecutions and that they had no reason to find themselves
at odds. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that this Lord Advocate, or a
future Lord Advocate might have a difference of opinion with this
Attorney-General or a future Attorney-General as to whether these
powers should be invoked in a specific
case.</div>
					<a name="08050881000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
respect the separate jurisdiction in Scotland, which has managed to
maintain its differential over the long years of the Union of the
Crowns and the Union of Parliaments. Given the specific differences in
the system that exist, which I would defend under any circumstances,
just as I defend our right to have our common law system instead of any
form of merger with any European or continental model or jurisdiction,
we should have respect for the Scottish jurisdiction and be able to say
that this should be done with the consent of the Lord Advocate. In any
case, I do not think that that would not be forthcoming. Simply as a
courtesy&#151;a bow of the head to the Scottish
jurisdiction&#151;it is right that the Lord Advocate should be
consulted and that she should give
agreement.</div>
					<a name="08050881000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">That view
is strongly held by lawyers north of the border, as reflected in the
advice from the Law Society of Scotland, for instance. I cannot
remember whether I had a letter from the Faculty of Advocates on the
subject, but I suspect that that would be its view as well. It seems a
minor courtesy to write such a requirement into the Bill, and I hope
that the Minister will accept the amendment. It would not in any way
reduce the effectiveness of the Bill. It would simply provide a
safeguard so that if there were a dispute at some stage in the future,
at least there would be a way of resolving it or recognising that there
was a difference, rather than England and Wales simply bullying their
way forward at the expense of the Scottish
jurisdiction.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): I am not
unsympathetic to what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has done
in amendment No. 50, and if this debate had taken place without the
benefit of the Lord Advocate&#146;s evidence, I would have been
minded to support him if he had put his amendment to a vote. I also
accept that the amendment is relatively
innocuous.</div>
					<a name="08050881000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
what struck me so forcefully in the Lord Advocate&#146;s evidence to
the Committee was the extent to which she was entirely comfortable with
the conventions that operate currently. As a Conservative, I am a great
believer in conventions, which do not have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>to be written down. When I saw the extent of her sense of
comfort&#151;she is, after all, the Lord Advocate advising a
Government who now have a nationalist viewpoint&#151;I began to
conclude that I was worrying about
nothing.</div>
					<a name="08050881000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
working relationship that clearly exists between her office and that of
the DPP and the Attorney-General is as good as it appears to
be&#151;we heard nothing to suggest otherwise&#151;it seems that
this matter is capable of being resolved through those informal
relationships, which are, of course, the foundation of our
constitution.</div>
					<a name="08050881000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
on balance, although I fully understand why the hon. Gentleman tabled
the amendment, I think that if the Lord Advocate does not want
it&#151;she is the person best placed to decide whether it is
needed&#151;it probably is not needed.</div>

						</b> May I use this debate to raise a question with the
Minister as to what happens if there is a disagreement between law
enforcement agencies in different parts of the United Kingdom? Let me
postulate as an example a person held in Northern Ireland whom it is
desired should be tried in England&#151;the CPS or the DPP wants to
try them  in England&#151;but whom the law enforcement agency
in Northern Ireland does not want to transfer. The same thing could
apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland. Is there any procedure in place
or any laws that deal with that question? How does one resolve such a
disagreement when it arises, if it
arises?</div>

							<a name="08050881000359"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I do not think that I can usefully add much to
what the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield said. The current
Lord Advocate draws comfort from existing arrangements not because she
gets on famously with our current Attorney-General and
Solicitor-General, although they have a good relationship; the comfort
comes as much from the experience and conventions that the hon. and
learned Gentleman referred to and the fact that, as both chief
prosecutors act in the public interest, sufficient protection is
already provided. I am with the hon. and learned Gentleman: the
convention works not simply because a couple of pals get on together,
but because it has worked historically. She also made it clear that,
notwithstanding terrorism, cross-jurisdictional issues are not
new&#151;they had occurred and been dealt with under common law. She
quoted, I believe, an example of credit card fraud with roots in
Scotland and its link to a drugs ring in Liverpool. We are clear, not
least because of the heightened regard that both legal officers,
whoever they are, would afford to public interest and protection, that
things work very well as they are. On the principle&#151;it is
probably not a Conservative principle&#151;that if it ain&#146;t
broke, don&#146;t fix it, we are in a reasonable position
notwithstanding what clause 27 will add to the
relationship.</div>

resolution procedure other than broad protocols rooted in the sort of
conventions and experiences to which the hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield referred. That is not a namby-pamby answer. Rooted in
experience thus far, they will prevail. At its most mechanistic, one
could apportion the seriousness of what happened in what jurisdiction
and weigh accordingly which was the dominant. I do not think that
senior law officers in the UK act in that fashion. The protocols and
the experience thus far tell us that such problems will be overcome. I
accept that it is a perfectly genuine inquiry, but I do not think that
a procedure should be locked in&#151;not least for the same reasons
that I do not want the amendment&#151;some mechanistic, formal and
formulaic statutory requirement, given the flexibility and complexities
of such cases which, we should be clear, will be relatively few and far

Russell Brown</b> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab): I live close
to the border of England and Scotland and  I can assure the
Minister that, on the information that I have, there is a close working
relationship on both sides, and not only in the border locality. It
goes far wider: I am aware of many drugs-related activities over which
there has been excellent co-operation to ensure that those who are out
there contravening laws in this country are brought to book. The law
enforcement agencies appear to work well together; the judiciary may be
something different.</div>

McNulty:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. When the Lord
Advocate was before us, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome teased
out of her the fact that clause 27 emanated from the Scottish Law
Officers, and shot his own fox in the process. As the hon. and learned
Member for Beaconsfield said, the Law Officers are entirely comfortable
with the measure, not because of a personal relationship, but because
of the institutional relationship, to which my hon. Friend the Member
for Dumfries and Galloway referred, and the relationship between the
two offices over time. Therefore, the Liberal Democrats&#146;
amendment&#151;I do not say this terribly frequently&#151;is
entirely irrelevant. I would ask the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome&#151;I would ask his hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and
Wallington too, but he is not here&#151;to gracefully withdraw so
that we can move on.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000364"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> If I understand the Minister, the reasons why we
should not have a provision to require consultation and consent from
the Lord Advocate are that consultation always takes place with the
Lord Advocate and she gives her consent, and that the amendment would
therefore place an onerous duty on both officials to secure such
consultation and consent, irrespective of the fact that that already
happens. There is no prescription in the amendment for a checklist or
questionnaire or anything else; it is simply a statement of what the
Minister has assured me is already the case.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000365"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I have no wish to defend the Minister, but that is
not quite what he said. It was not that the Lord Advocate always gave
her consent. It was that she never had any difficulty reaching an
agreement with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>her counterparts in England. In some cases, it could even work the other
way, or it could be that consent is not given. I was very struck by the
fact that she indicated that it had never been a
problem.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000366"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> Which, I think, repeats my position. The fact that
it has never been a problem suggests that either consent is given, in
which case it happens, or consent is not given, in which case it does
not happen. That means that my amendment would make no difference to
the arrangements unless there was a difference of opinion, which none
of us foresee in the near future on the evidence of the Lord
Advocate&#151;certainly with the present incumbents and with the
present protocols in place. We must assume that the good relationships
will last, that the incumbent will stay in place with the new
administration in Scotland, that her successors will take exactly the
same view and will be as co-operative as she clearly is, and that for
the lifetime of this statute, there will not be a dispute. Therefore,
there is no need for any resolution to provide the consent. That is the
argument that I have heard against my eminently reasonable and modest
suggestion. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The Minister tells me that that is
not the
argument.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000367"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> As I made it very clear&#151;I do not wish to
prolong the point&#151;the Lord Advocate took comfort in the
prevailing position, not simply because of her relationship with the
individual who happened to hold the post of Attorney-General in England
and Wales, but because of the protocols that will be in place and
because of the experience and conventions that the hon. and learned
Member for Beaconsfield referred to earlier and how successfully they
had worked to mutual benefit. That is a bit more than saying that she
has either been steam-rollered or that consent has always been
forthcoming, so there is no harm in adding this amendment. This
amendment&#151;I am loth to say that it is vacuous&#151;adds
nothing to the prevailing relationship. The prevailing relationship is
so strong not because of the Baroness Scotland and Elish Angiolini, but
because of the posts that they occupy and the raison
d&#146;tre of those posts as chief legal prosecutors looking
after the public interest and public safety. That is where the comfort
comes from; all of that and not just the
relationship.</div>

							<a name="08050881000368"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000369"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> The other reason why I happen to think that the
amendment is unnecessary is because in reality, if there were a
conflict, I do not think that there is any way in which the Government
at Westminster could require the Scottish Executive and the Scottish
legal authorities to surrender an individual across the border for the
purpose of trial. Its separate legal system, which is enshrined in the
Act of Union and preserved in devolution, would not allow us to do it.
Also, if there were a breakdown in the relationship, which has
apparently been operating very well for a very long time, nobody could
impose their will on the Lord Advocate if she were to say, &#147;I am
terribly sorry, but this person is going to be tried in Edinburgh or
Glasgow.&#148;</div>

						</b> I do not like disagreeing with the hon. and learned
Gentleman, but if a prisoner were held in Glasgow or Edinburgh, that
clearly would be the case. There would be no question of surrendering a
prisoner to stand trial in Preston or Derby. However, if the person was
held in the English and Welsh jurisdiction and part of the case against
that person was that he had committed offences in Scotland, this
provision gives a jurisdiction to the English court to hear the cases
committed in Scotland under Scots law. That is what this provision
says. If, in future, the Lord Advocate felt that it was in the public
interest in Scotland for those cases to be heard under Scots law in
Scotland, there is nothing she could do about it other than to invoke
the protocols that are in place, which would have no statutory
basis.</div>

							<a name="08050881000371"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> It is at least possible, is it not, that the Lord
Advocate might conclude that the interests of justice, that is to say
the protection of the defendant, might require that defendant to be
tried in Scotland, not least because there is a not proven verdict in
Scotland? I can conceive of circumstances in which, trying to safeguard
the interests of the defendant, one would say that the defendant had a
better chance of a favourable outcome by being tried in Scotland than
being tried
elsewhere.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000372"></a>Mr.

						</b> That is indeed the case. There is the further
complication that it is quite clear that post-charge questioning will
not happen under a Scottish jurisdiction, whereas it will in England
and Wales. That was the clear evidence we were given. I think it is a
good thing that it should happen, but there is nevertheless that
difference between the systems. There might be a conclusion in the
interests of justice on that basis.</div>
					<a name="08050881000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish to prolong this
any further. I think we have explored the issue, but I find the
position adopted by the Minister&#151;and, it would seem, though I
regret it, by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield&#151;to be
a flawed position. I think that this is a minor safeguard for
circumstances that we cannot foresee, but which could cause
considerable difficulty between the two jurisdictions at some stage in
the future, unless it is resolved. I may come back to it on Report, but
for the moment I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

Hogg:
						</b> You have been good enough to allow a fairly broad
debate on the two groups of amendments, Mr. Bercow, so I can
be much more brief than I had planned. The issues here are of some
interest and, indeed, of some importance. I can summarise them very
briefly because they have been much canvassed in the recent
debate.</div>
					<a name="08050881000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful if the Minister could give a somewhat fuller statement of the
circumstances in which it is likely that somebody would be moved from
one jurisdiction to another for the purposes of trial. He has, quite
fairly, identified instances where there are linked offences, and I can
well understand that linked offences would justify an application for
transfer.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div>
					<a name="08050881000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other situations that I would like to explore with him. For example, is
it intended to use the transfer provisions for the convenience of
witnesses where all or most of the witnesses are in one part of the
United Kingdom? Is that a consideration that comes into play? There is
also, and differently, the possibility of prejudice. Let us, for
example, remember the Enniskillen bombing. I could conceive that
defendants might wish to be tried in England or Wales, or indeed
Scotland, rather than in Northern Ireland, after an offence of that
kind. Is it intended that these provisions shall be used in order to
make a transfer where it could be deemed that it would be difficult for
a defendant to get a fair trial?</div>
					<a name="08050881000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has, as I understand it, changed his position on the question of
Diplock courts. I understand him to say that he accepts that if there
is a possibility of a person being tried without a jury as a result of
the use of these provisions, steps will be taken, either by statutory
language or otherwise, to ensure that nobody is deprived of a jury
trial in a terrorist-related matter. I welcome that, and I hope that
the Minister will make that position quite
plain.</div>
					<a name="08050881000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
next point flows from what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was
saying about the value of the Lord Advocate&#146;s evidence. He is of
course entirely right. There may be very good reasons why it is not
possible on a Committee of this size to have a fuller representation
from the other parts of the United Kingdom. I understand that. It is a
big Committee, but it may not be big enough for that purpose. Might I,
however, suggest to the Minister, who has greater influence on these
matters than do I, that, as a matter of general principle, where one is
legislating in a way that affects the separate parts of the United
Kingdom, and where, as is inevitably the case, all of us&#151;on this
Committee or on a similar Committee&#151;have but limited experience,
we invite the law enforcement agencies, for example, to give their
opinion, in the first instance in writing, on relevant parts of the
Bill, so that we do at least know the preliminary views. It might be
proper to summon them to give evidence under Special Standing Committee
procedures. But that is perhaps a wider issue. Will the Minister give
that some
consideration?</div>
					<a name="08050881000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I welcome the Minister&#146;s willingness to move on retrospection.
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield was right about
subsection (6), but I have spoken about that already. There is an issue
of principle, because people could be subjected to a less favourable
trial than they might necessarily get in their country of usual
residence. I made this point in an intervention on the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome. I have in mind the not-proven verdict, which of
course is a more favourable position in Scotland than elsewhere in the
United Kingdom. A Scottish defendant might well think it unfair to be
transferred, by reason of retrospective legislation, to another country
within the United Kingdom, because they would be deprived of the
possibility of securing a not-proven verdict. If that was done
retrospectively, there would be an important issue of principle. If he
could give thought to that as well, I am sure that the Committee would
be
grateful.</div>
					<a name="08050881000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000374"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> All of those are perfectly reasonable points. I
think that I have said very clearly that it is not the intention of
clause 27 to get terrorist suspects to Diplock courts in Northern
Ireland. If the provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>need tidying up and strengthening to reflect that, notwithstanding what
I said about not knowing fully whether we have started to dismantle the
Diplock court arrangements in Northern Ireland, I shall come back to
the Committee. It is a perfectly fair
point.</div>
					<a name="08050881000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that people are being unduly, but necessarily suspicious about
the import and direction of subsection (6) on retrospectivity. I
listened to the points, and shall try to provide a further explanation
to allay the Committee&#146;s genuine fears. It is not about a
jurisdictional lotto&#151;if I may use that phrase&#151;or
prosecutors touting around different jurisdictions trying to get the
best case from their perspective, rather than that of the defendants.
It is about terrorist offences and plots occurring in two
jurisdictions. Clause 27 will be used only where a plot involves
suspects in different jurisdictions.</div>
					<a name="08050881000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">A point was made about
convenience for witnesses, but I do not think that that would prevail,
save for the point that if the dominant elements of a plot require so
many witnesses from a particular jurisdiction, it would probably imply
that that is where the trial should take place in the first instance.
However, there is a notion that a trial could take place in Glasgow,
rather than London, simply because most of the witnesses are from
Glasgow, even though at the time they were on a coach trip down to
London, where the principal or core events took place, which would mean
that the jurisdiction would rightly be London. Convenience in that
sense is not the import or thrust of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08050881000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point was made about the fairness of being tried in one jurisdiction
rather than another&#151;the example of Enniskillen was given. Again,
that was a perfectly fair point, but it has nothing to do with clause
27. The important points were those about jurisdiction raised by the
Lord Advocate in her evidence. I can provide a very clear and sharp
example, although I shall not go into too much detail, because I am not
sure whether it is still sub judice&#151;it might still be rattling
along somewhere down the line. The example is London-Glasgow&#151;to
use the common parlance&#151;by which I mean the events at Glasgow
airport. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will know that they
started in Haymarket with the two Mercedes-Benz cars filled with
assorted paraphernalia, which happily did not go off. That is a clear
case involving jurisdictional issues&#151;happily, they were
resolved. To be fair, that specific case, unusual though it was,
prompted the Scottish and UK legal offices to look at clause 27 as a
framework for dealing with such matters in the future. I
repeat&#151;I say this and something will happen in the next few
weeks, although clearly I hope not&#151;that it is very uncommon for
something to be so starkly in two jurisdictions as that particular case
was. That case prompted the activity. I think that I have clarified the
example that was the precursor to clause 27 in the first place. I
understand the points raised, although hopefully they are rather arcane
and, although perfectly valid, such concerns will not stand up to
further investigation in terms of retrospectivity. However, I will
certainly explore the point about juryless trials. Clause 27 is not
supposed to result in anyone faced with terrorist offences being put in
front of a juryless court.</div>

						</b> The amendment seeks to make it even clearer that
a court in England and Wales, when considering whether an offence
listed in schedule 2 is connected to terrorism, must do so only on the
basis of open evidence presented by the prosecution and defence. That
is the evidence that a court usually has before it for sentencing. The
defendant will be able to challenge any evidence on which a terrorist
determination is made, either during the trial or, if there is a guilty
plea and the judge holds a Newton hearing where the defence and
prosecution dispute facts of the case which would affect sentences, so
as to decide the matter at that hearing.</div>
					<a name="08050881000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was always
intended for that to be the case. There was never any suggestion in the
Government&#146;s proposal that a determination could be made on the
basis of intelligence, or evidence withheld from the defence due to PII
or other, lesser-status information, such as that contained in a
pre-sentence report. However, we felt that we should make a slight
amendment to the drafting so as to put the matter even more beyond
doubt than it already was. That is the substance behind the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08050881000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">For

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000379"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I thank the Minister for his introduction and for
his amendment, which was welcome. It did not cross my mind that it was
intended for a judge to be asked to make his decisions without having
any facts in front of him, but the amendment clarifies that point
beyond any doubt.</div>
					<a name="08050881000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are probing amendments
designed to look at the same issue, albeit in a slightly wider context.
The Government said that the judge would make a determination. That
determination may be made either in the course of the trial, because it
would be the basis of the conviction, or it may be made on the basis of
a guilty plea, in which case there may be the possibility
of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>a Newton hearing. That raises two issues. The first is what would happen
if, during the course of a hearing, the Crown&#146;s case alleges
that something is an aggravated offence because it is connected to
terrorism. If that issue is in contention, are we to assume that, in
certain circumstances, juries will be asked to return special verdicts
indicating whether or not they consider it to be terrorist
connected?</div>
					<a name="08050881000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, as the Minister will
be aware, currently, the judge on his own determines if there is to be
a Newton hearing. No jury is empanelled to decide whether there is a
terrorist connection; it follows very normally in a pattern of
determinations made by judges sitting on their own. I have participated
in many Newton hearings. The judge hears evidence and submissions such
as the prosecution and defence wish to put forward and makes up his
mind about the matter. Moreover, I recollect that he makes up his mind
effectively on the balance of probabilities and not beyond reasonable
doubt.</div>
					<a name="08050881000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the whole,
the Newton system has worked perfectly well. Equally, I have
participated in trials where a major issue of fact has been resolved by
the judge asking a special question of the jury when it comes to return
its verdict&#151;&#147;Is it on basis A or basis B?&#148; Judges,
on the whole, do not like doing it but if they are forced to do it,
they will do
it.</div>
					<a name="08050881000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the issues that we must consider here is that the introduction of a
terrorist element is making not some minor difference but a colossal
difference to sentencing. One only has to look at the sentences now
being imposed, very properly, on individuals who although they have not
killed anybody, have nevertheless been engaged in conspiracies with a
view to killing people&#151;although often conspiracies in a very
early stage&#151;to see that they have ended up with discretionary
life sentences and 40-year terms being prescribed. Therefore,
particularly with the way that the Government are widening the scope of
the aggravated offence, it is possible to envisage circumstances where
somebody coming before the court on the sort of offence that might
first appear to be very minor indeed&#151;the sort of thing that
might attract six months&#146; imprisonment&#151;might go to prison
for five, six or more years, once the terrorist connection is
established.</div>
					<a name="08050881000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee has to consider how we reach the decision in such cases and
whether the decision should be given to juries in the Newton hearing
and not to the judge on his own. Alternatively, how will juries be
asked to deal with these issues, if there is the possibility of them
returning a verdict that might be &#147;Yes, he is guilty of this but
it has no terrorist connection&#148; or &#147;He is guilty and
there is.&#148;</div>

							<a name="08050881000380"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am trying to identify my hon. and learned
Friend&#146;s position. Let us take a plea of guilty that is to be
dealt with by the single judge&#151;the jury not having been
empanelled. Is my hon. and learned Friend suggesting that in such a
case a jury should be empanelled, as it were, on a Newton hearing to
determine whether or not the offence is terrorist
related?</div>
					<a name="08050881000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000381"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> These are probing amendments, but yes. If we were
to have a jury on a Newton hearing, we would have to empanel the jury
in rather the same way 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>as one empanels a jury to decide if somebody is insane&#151;in order
to determine on the facts whether it was a terrorist-related matter.
That is one issue. I was raising another issue, which is about the
mechanism in a jury trial where an allegation is being made of a
terrorist connection. How does one go about dealing with that in terms
of the jury being able to indicate if it concludes, having heard all
the evidence, that there is no terrorist
connection?</div>
					<a name="08050881000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000382"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am listening carefully to the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s arguments, which, as he knows, are similar to the
ones that we had hoped to deploy in this group. In the circumstances
where he envisages a jury establishing whether there is a terrorism
connection, what standard of proof does he believe would be
appropriate? I notice that he has added his name to our amendment No.
27 but not to our amendment No. 28. Does that suggest that he is happy
with a balance-of-probability test on the part of the jury in that
instance?</div>
					<a name="08050881000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000383"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I am rather open-minded about it. This is a
Committee stage and I have some doubts in my mind as to the best way to
proceed. Being conservative with a small &#147;c&#148;, a strong
argument commends itself to me&#151;if the current system has worked
well dealing with such issues of fact in the past, should we be getting
too worried? There is a good argument for saying, &#147;Let us leave
the current situation as it is.&#148; Judges have always been able to
deal with the issue and ask the jury a supplementary question if a real
issue arises in a trial about the facts on which the ultimate
sentencing will take place. So far as a Newton hearing is concerned,
where there is a guilty plea, the judiciary in my experience have
managed fairly well to come to conclusions when the facts are placed in
front of them. They usually listen very carefully to the evidence put
before them.</div>
					<a name="08050881000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
one argument. The alternative argument is to say that that is all very
well in the context of the sort of decisions that used to have to be
taken. However, the anxiety is about the growing consequence of the
aggravated offence, which would start to create penalties that bear
little relation to what one would expect to be imposed if the offence
was not aggravated. That is what I would ask the Committee to consider.
I await the Minister&#146;s response with interest&#151;but before
I hear from the Minister, I give
way.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000384"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am sorry on the whole to be sounding a note of
caution when I hear my hon. and learned Friend speaking on the matter.
He will remember and keep well in mind the provisions of the Criminal
Justice Act 2003, where we have tariffs for murder. It is for the judge
to determine where within the tariff the appropriate sentence lies.
However, I have never heard it suggested&#151;I have certainly never
seen it done&#151;that the jury should determine the class of
homicide as prescribed in the schedule to the Act. I would be very
cautious about giving juries a role in sentencing, which is what my
hon. and learned Friend is in reality
about.</div>
					<a name="08050881000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000385"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I am cautious. If we were dealing only with
homicide, I do not think that I would be particularly bothered.
However, the issue is that we  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>now have aggravated terrorist offences that can be almost anything.
Using a credit card to carry out some fraudulent activity with a
terrorist connection may attract a sentence much higher up the scale
than one would normally expect from the sums involved. I thought that
the issue ought to be brought before the Committee, although I share my
right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s caution. That is why my
amendments are probing. I do not have a concluding viewpoint. I am
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s view and what degree of
consultation has taken place. Based on what the Minister tells me, I am
minded to go away and reflect on whether I want to do anything else
about
it.</div>

							<a name="08050881000386"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I am listening with great care to the debate and
understand both sides of the argument, but I want to throw one thing
in: the Homicide Act 1957. On a plea of diminished responsibility that
is not accepted by the Crown, the decision then goes to the jury. That
supports the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s contention, I think. I
also throw in the point that, for many years, lay magistrates have been
very comfortable with their role in determining facts in Newton
hearings in magistrates
courts.</div>

I cannot amplify my views further, because they have not crystallised.
I make no apology for that. I am open to persuasion either way, but I
would be interested to know the Government&#146;s position and the
views of any member of the Committee who might have
them.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): I thank the
Minister, for clarifying the purpose of the Government&#146;s
amendment, and the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield, for
speaking to the grouped amendments. The first amendment in the string
was our amendment, which I am pleased that the Conservatives put their
name to, as did the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. I thank the
hon. and learned Gentleman for opening the debate and for being able to
set out, perhaps slightly more convincingly than I might have been able
to do, the strengths and merits of our amendments Nos. 27 and
28.</div>
					<a name="08050881000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, we
are talking about the need for greater safeguards, because the
terrorist component of an offence is making that offence so much more
aggravated. Hence the need for a jury and hence, possibly, the need for
a criminal standard of proof. Again, I follow the lead of the hon. and
learned Member for Beaconsfield in saying that these are probing
amendments, so that we can hear what the Government have to say about
this matter, given that we are talking about perhaps much more
substantial and lengthy sentences, and so a need for greater
safeguards, as well as a jury or a criminal standard of
proof.</div>
					<a name="08050881000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would not
seek to press the amendments but wish to listen to what the Minister
has to say in response, before perhaps formulating further views later
on.</div>
					<a name="08050881000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000389"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> My hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield invited members of the Committee to express a view; mind
you, we could not stop them doing so. None the less, it was very
gracious of him.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>
					<a name="08050881000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am bound to say that I
approach this issue with considerable caution. I myself have always
taken the view that sentence was very much a matter for the trial
judge. I have always resisted suggestions that the jury should be
involved in the sentencing process. In reality, that is what the
suggestion by my hon. and learned Friend would amount to.</div>
					<a name="08050881000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is logic in what my hon.
and learned Friend says, but I can anticipate quite a lot of other
circumstances where the same sort of case arises. Where, for example,
there is a racially aggravated assault, is the sentence for that crime
to be put to the jury by way of a special verdict? Alternatively, take
the point that I adverted to in the intervention, where one is dealing
with a homicide case. We all know that there is a range of starting
points for the tariff: the starting point is 15 years but it can go to
whole life in certain circumstances and it can fall to about 12 years
in others. It depends on the balance of the mitigating and aggravating
factors, which are specified in the schedule. I would be sorry to see
juries being asked to state, by way of special verdict or otherwise,
where within the schedule the person convicted of murder stood. Once we
go down the road that my hon. and learned Friend outlined, we will get
into precisely this sort of world. I am against it, I
think.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000390"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am, of course, listening very carefully to what
the right hon. and learned Gentleman has to say and I understand the
point that he is making. However, does he accept that there is a bigger
difference in consequence in this? There is a very much bigger
difference between the consequence on what can be a relatively minor
offence carrying a very small tariff and the consequence of a terrorist
offence with a heavy sentence tariff, forfeiture orders and
notification procedures consequent on that. That is what gives some of
us cause for concern.</div>
					<a name="08050881000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000391"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Yes, I understand the logic in that, and the hon.
Gentleman and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield
have a point. However, we must ask where the principle is. I take the
fact that there is a distinction; within homicide, the range is from
whole life to 12 years, which is a big gap. That is also a huge
difference. At the end of it, however, I think that I want to leave
sentence to judges; I do not think that I want to involve
juries.</div>
					<a name="08050881000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
reasons that I do not want to involve juries is that one would get
oneself into the world of unintended consequences. For example, juries
are reluctant to convict in certain classes of offence because of the
consequences to the defendant that they can envisage. Furthermore, if
juries found it difficult to answer the question in the
negative&#151;is this a terrorist offence?&#151;they might very
well acquit in circumstances where they should not acquit.</div>
					<a name="08050881000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that this matter is
best left to judges. If there is to be further consultation, I am sure
that members of this Committee would wish to reflect further on it, but
I am very cautious about
it.</div>

							<a name="08050881000392"></a>Mr.

						</b> We have had a very interesting debate. For once, I
disagree with the right hon. and learned Member and my reason for that
is, first, I do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>believe that what is being proposed brings the jury into sentencing.
Clearly, the jury should have no role in sentencing; we all agree on
that, I am sure.</div>
					<a name="08050881000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned the Homicide Act 1957 in passing. We entrust the jury, albeit
with specialist medical evidence and so on, as well as requiring them
to look at the circumstances of the offence, with deciding, &#147;Is
this a case of murder, or do we accept this person&#146;s plea of
manslaughter based on diminished responsibility?&#148; That we
do.</div>
					<a name="08050881000279"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08050881000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us say, for
example, that the jury come back&#151;I, and other people, have seen
it in court&#151;and say, &#147;We accept the plea of diminished
responsibility, therefore we find that he is guilty of
manslaughter.&#148; If we follow the argument of the right hon. and
learned Member, the jury take part in sentencing, because what is open
to the judge is severely limited, compared with what was open to the
judge when the offence was murder.</div>
					<a name="08050881000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000393"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is entirely
right, because he will keep in mind that for manslaughter, which is
what the verdict would be if there was diminished responsibility, there
is a penalty that ranges from life to a non-custodial sentence. The
sentence is at large; it is for the judge to impose any sentence within
that bracket.</div>
					<a name="08050881000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000394"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I understand that point, but does not my point
undermine the idea that in terrorist offences, juries might find it
easier to go for the softer option and so on? I fully accept what the
right hon. and learned Gentleman says: we need to keep juries away from
sentencing. I have no doubt about that. But there is a huge difference
between an offence involving terrorism and an offence presumably not
involving terrorism, and on that basis alone, the jury should have a
say in that determination. Then, of course, it will be entirely open to
the judge to decide, if one can imagine, and I use the phrase
advisedly, a minor terrorist offence: one on that side of the scale, as
opposed to one at the very top. There is good sense in the amendment
and it is worth having the debate, but I must confess that, as the
right hon. and learned Gentleman said, we need to be cautious with it.
It should not, however, be dismissed out of
hand.</div>
					<a name="08050881000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000395"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> We are in danger of confusing what clause 29 is
about with the previous debate about clause 27 and
jurisdictional issues. Clause 29 relates directly to a specific set of
serious offences and no others. We shall come on to discuss schedule 2,
but the offences are outlined in it. In substance, clause 29 merely
formalises the current situation. I shall pursue the example from the
hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, whereby the jury says,
&#147;manslaughter&#148;, rather than &#147;homicide&#148;,
which is perfectly reasonable. I am no lawyer and I do not want to jump
into a catfight between three significant lawyers, but it is perfectly
wrong to say that the jury are influencing a sentence. They are not;
they have determined the offence. As the right hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham says, it is then entirely up to the
judge, having got a manslaughter result, to decide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>the mitigating and other circumstances and whether the sentence should
be non-custodial or life&#151;as manslaughter rather than as
homicide. That is rightly and properly the purview of the judge, not of
the jury. To pursue the analogy, no one in that case would think it
right or proper for the judge then to say to the jury,
&#147;You&#146;ve said manslaughter. Where do you think the
sentence should lie in this whole range from non-custodial to
life?&#148; When, perfectly properly, the prosecution authorities
say, as they have done, &#147;This is a terrorist offence,&#148; it
will be perfectly in order for the judge to take it&#151;once the
outcome has been determined&#151;as a mitigating circumstance prior
to sentencing, as he would any other. That is all the provision will
do.</div>
					<a name="08050881000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be perfectly
fair, I think&#151;again, I am no lawyer&#151;that if we were to
accept the amendment, we would drive Herbert Morrison&#146;s
proverbial &#147;coach and &#145;orses&#148; all the way through
the principle that it is for the judge to determine a sentence, not for
the jury. Let us look at schedule 2. I do not think that the judge
would give, in every circumstance, the impression of a huge, whopping,
decade-related sentence because the offence happened to have
&#147;terrorist&#148; connected to it. The minor offences are not
in schedule 2. We have moved on from the jurisdiction; we are now on to
those schedule 2 offences that are appropriate for enhanced sentencing.
We must regard the matter in that context, and again, as a non-lawyer,
I should say that, in those circumstances, to ask the jury to play a
role would be perverse in our current system.</div>
					<a name="08050881000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
and learned Member for Beaconsfield asked a perfectly fair question
about consultation. He will know that we have had five months&#146;
consultation on this, including discussions with prosecutors and the
judiciary, who did not think the measure was necessary at all&#151;he
is free to come back to that with a Mandy Rice-Davies comment and say,
&#147;Well, they would, wouldn&#146;t they?&#148; Some legal
organisations did think it appropriate for the jury to make the
decisions&#151;principally, Liberty and Justice. He will know that
there is a summation of views. Opinion was

judiciary did not think that this section of the Bill was required.
That point of view commends itself to me because the judiciary would
simply say that the provision is just not necessary because it can take
account of the facts in relation to aggravating circumstances without
it having to be spelt out in statute. So why have the Government put
the provision in the
Bill?</div>

						</b> Purely to formalise that which has prevailed thus
far, and because it is right and appropriate to do so. First, doing so
will formalise the range of offences for which it is appropriate; those
offences are outlined in schedule 2. Secondly, as I have said, the
provision will formalise the position that has prevailed in some
terrorist cases up to now. It is perfectly proper for the judge to
determine whether it is a terrorist offence or otherwise where the
principal charge was clearly a non-terrorist offence. It is also
perfectly proper for the judge to reflect that in the enhanced
sentencing.</div>

these being serious offences, I agree that the vast majority are.
However, I dare say it will come as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>salutary shock to the average yob who has caused a disturbance on the
aeroplane while flying back from Ayia Napa to the United Kingdom to
find that the judge sentencing him must consider whether he has a

McNulty:
						</b> I have never been to Ayia Napa, so I shall let
that lie. I recently went to Cyprus for the first time, but happily I
was nowhere near Ayia Napa. I stayed at a lovely little hotel called
the Anassa&#151;the surrounding countryside was miserable as sin, but
the hotel was lovely. However, that is by the bye. It is clear that
these are, in principle, serious offences and will be taken as serious
in a case with a terrorist overlay to it. The hon. and learned
Gentleman knows that entirely. I am minded to remind
him&#151;although I do not want to go there&#151;that,
among other things, noxious substances and noxious things are included.
During our deliberations, he reminded me, or informed me rather, that
Mosquitoes&#151;not the nasty little bug, but the antisocial
behaviour devices that emit UHF sounds to put off teenagers&#151;are
also a noxious thing. So far, we have two noxious things: pathogens and
potentially Mosquitoes.</div>
					<a name="08050881000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
formalisation of what has already prevailed is appropriate. The
explanation of what schedule 2 offences should be&#151;and we will
come on to schedule 2&#151;is equally appropriate. Notwithstanding
our amendment, we have set out the appropriate way to go forward.
Before enhancing sentences, the judge rather than the jury should
properly consider what is essentially on one level, as I have
suggested, a mitigating circumstance. I just do not think doing
otherwise is reasonable.</div>
					<a name="08050881000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am told reliably that the
point made about beyond reasonable doubt in amendment No. 28 is
principally already the case&#151;certainly in terms of including the
aggravation in sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
that covers race, religion, disability and sexual orientation
aggravation. There is no provision in that Act to spell out that the
standard is beyond reasonable doubt and similarly it is not necessary
to spell it out in the Bill because it is already the case that the
court will apply the criminal standard and there is no suggestion that
it would do otherwise. In that context, clause 29&#151;suitably
amended by me&#151;should stand and the other amendment should be
withdrawn.</div>

						</b> The clause deals with the forfeiture of terrorist

objection in principle to the idea that terrorist property should be
forfeited. However, we perceive that a problem arises about whether the
wording of the clause is too wide. It
states:</div>

a person is convicted of an offence under section 15(1) or (2) or 16,

or under their control and
which&#151;</div>

					<a name="08050881000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, a large number of
organisations in this country, some of which are registered charities,
raise money for the relief of destitution, poverty and misery in the
middle east, particularly the occupied west bank. From time to time,
there are reports in national newspapers that one or other of those
organisations is not fulfilling its charitable purposes, and that it is
possible that money given by donors in this country is ending up in the
hands of those who are promoting violence, and that they are using it
to fund that violence. Seeing the generic nature of the anxiety that
had been expressed, it must at least be the case that, if confronted
with an organisation that seems to be a registered charity in this
country and that otherwise has bona fides, I might have to say to
myself, &#147;I cannot say that I don&#146;t have cause to suspect
that it might be used, even though I have no evidence that it will be
used as such at all.&#148; I put it to the Minister that that
illustrates my point better than any more of my speech making would do.

a car that is owned by a third party. The third party is entirely

in a terrorist offence. The property owned by the innocent third party
is subject to forfeiture. If the Minister would be good enough to look
at clause 34, he will see that, although there is a right for the
innocent third party to make representations, there is no clear

							<a name="08050881000410"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> May I reinforce the point that I have just made by
way of an intervention because it does raise rather an important issue.
We could often have a situation in which the convicted person is
essentially a bailee, if I can use that technical word. He is a
custodian. Let us suppose that the convicted person is in the business
of repairing a car. That is the best possible example because cars can
readily be used in terrorist attacks, either as the vehicle for the
bomb, for transport or whatever. He has the property of another in his
possession and under his control. We could think of almost any property
that would fall into that
category.</div>
					<a name="08050881000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
person&#146;s conviction, the property belonging to the third party
is subject to forfeiture. I acknowledge at once that a provision under
clause 34&#151;proposed new section 23B&#151;enables a person,
other than the convicted person who claims to be the owner or otherwise
interested, to make representations, but nothing in that proposed new
section sets out the rights of that innocent third party, if I may
characterise  the person as such. All he can do is to make
representations. The provision does not explain the person&#146;s
rights if the court was satisfied that he was wholly
innocent&#151;&#147;What is the standard of proof&#148;, I say in
parenthesis. What are his rights? They seem to be at large, and I find
it difficult to believe that that can  be right.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>
					<a name="08050881000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be truthful, I have not had
time to table amendments to clause 34. I make no complaint about that.
It is my responsibility to do so. However, we must address such an
issue because innocent third parties should not have their property
forfeited because the bailee is guilty of an offence. I hope that the
right hon. Gentleman will reflect on the provision because, as I
suggest to my hon. and learned Friend, we shall need to return to it on
Report as it concerns a serious issue of third party
rights.</div>

							<a name="08050881000411"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I am following on precisely from that point. I am
sure that the Minister will help us in a minute. What has been foreseen
under clause 34 is a similar or more robust procedure that applied
under the Police (Property) Act 1997&#151;that both sides would be
heard properly and a decision arrived at. I agree that the procedure
must be robust, open and easily accessible to an innocent party who may
lay claim to the
property.</div>
					<a name="08050881000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Member for Beaconsfield said that we must be careful not to
cast the net too widely. No one in the Committee or elsewhere would say
that it is wrong in principle to forfeit money or property that might
have been involved in terrorist activity. I can advise the Committee of
a case&#151;I shall not name it because it is current and was decided
in the last few days&#151;of someone who has been convicted of theft
of property worth less than &#163;4,000. All the property was
recovered, and he was sent down for a matter of weeks. He came out of
prison to face one of these procedures. He had &#163;7,000 in the
bank and could prove precisely where the money had come from, but the
judge was helpless and had to take the money from the offender. The net
is already too wide, and we should apply care. I have no regard for any
terrorist, and we must ensure that anything that is used in terrorism
is properly taken away. There is no doubt about that, but we must be
careful in this part of the
Bill.</div>

							<b class="B">David
T.C. Davies</b> (Monmouth) (Con): This will be a short speech,
because it is completely unprepared. I strongly disagree with the last
point, because it is not just about money that might be used for
terrorism. It is about removing from people who have been convicted of
terrorist acts the means to perpetrate further acts of terrorism,
regardless of whether the money used for doing so was gained lawfully
or not. Frankly, I have no sympathy whatever for terrorists, burglars
or anyone else who is convicted of an offence. Once that conviction has
been made, the gloves should come
off.</div>

					<a name="08050881000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I freely accept
that the thrust of the amendments is not to wreck or
undermine what we seek to do&#151;they are perfectly valid.
Strangely, however, the hon. Member for Monmouth had half a point,
because the mens rea for the measures is &#147;had reasonable cause
to suspect&#148;. Notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
about third parties and the ownership of property, or the points about
the European convention on human rights&#151;about article 8, on the
right to respect for private and family life, and article 1 of the
first protocol, about the right to peaceful enjoyment of one&#146;s
possessions&#151;there is, incumbent on every individual, a notion
that they are responsible for their actions.</div>
					<a name="08050881000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle applies even in
the examples that the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield quoted,
as there might be a reasonable suspicion that some of the bona fide
charities working in the west bank, or anywhere else, have clear
terrorist intent. Indeed, Members present could name such
organisations. If one makes a donation to such an
organisation&#151;if one&#146;s assets are aligned with them or are
utilised by them in any way&#151;and one does not fulfil one&#146;s
responsibility to put oneself in a position in which that is not the
case, it is appropriate that the forfeiture regime should apply. It has
to be applied carefully and there must be all sorts of safeguards, but
the Bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>provides greater safeguards than are provided in the 2000 Act, not least
new section 23B, to which I think the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham referred. New section 23B(2) provides that
the court must have regard to the &#147;value of the property&#148;
and to the</div>
					<a name="08050881000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;financial
and other effects on the convicted person of making the
order&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08050881000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reiterate that we start from the premise that no one thinks that what
the measure does is other than a good thing. The concern is about
whether it has been drawn too wide, but there are appropriate
safeguards. The amendments would lessen the import and strength of the
measures, which is why I shall ultimately ask the Committee to resist
them if they are not
withdrawn.</div>

						</b> I have a feeling that the right hon. Gentleman is
misreading the Bill. I understand that the phrase &#147;reasonable
cause to suspect&#148; would apply to the garage proprietor, not to
the fictional Mr. McNulty, who gives his car in good faith
to the garage proprietor, who happens to be a terrorist. Where in the

						</b> There is no cause to protect the fictional
Mr. McNulty in the Bill because he is not the focus. In the
example, the right hon. and learned Gentleman was querying the rights
of the third party, the fictional Mr. McNulty, over his car.
These clauses would have no impact on Mr. McNulty. To the
extent that he needs to be covered, that will be done elsewhere, not
just by the ECHR, but under other
legislation.</div>

Grieve:
						</b> My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham has a perfectly valid point. The
architecture, as set out in proposed new section 23B on forfeiture,
clearly envisages the forfeiture of property in the possession or
control of the individual at the time of conviction. The individual is
the person who has committed the offence. That does not provide for an
individual to make representations to the court that the property that
has been used in the course of terrorism is his and has been used in
circumstances about which he had no idea or reasonable call to suspect
were happening. It may be that the Minister can provide reassurance
that a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>safeguard exists elsewhere in the Bill, in statute or in court rules. I
think that my right hon. and learned Friend makes a perfectly good
point.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000426"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I do not agree, not least because section 6 of
the Human Rights Act 1998 says that everything we do should be ECHR
compatible. Someone cannot forfeit wholly innocent property and remain
within the context of the ECHR. If there are any disputes, the
provisions in the Bill offer greater safeguards than in the original
Bill. As was indicated, the Police (Property) Act 1997 also covers this
point.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000427"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> It is not an adequate safeguard to say that a
person who finds that their property has been confiscated by the court
because it happens to have been under the control of a terrorist on the
date of conviction should have to rely on article 6 of the ECHR to
assert their right to recover it. They might well be able to do so, but
in legislation of this kind, I would ordinarily expect the Government
to make provision for that individual to make representations. I was
heavily involved, sitting in this room at one stage, with scrutinising
the Proceeds of Crime Bill, which made exactly that sort of provision.
I wonder if this is not simply an omission that can be corrected by the
Government before Report
stage.</div>
					<a name="08050881000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000428"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> No, I did not say article 6, but section 6 of the
Human Rights Act 1998, which says that everything that we do must be
ECHR compliant and therefore compliant with the key provisions of
article 1 and the right to property in article 8. I alluded to that as
the background architecture. As the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham has already mentioned, clause 34, which will
insert section 23B in the Terrorism Act 2000, says very
clearly:</div>
					<a name="08050881000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
making an order under section 23 or 23A, a court must give an
opportunity to be heard to any person, other than the convicted person,
who claims to be the owner or otherwise interested in anything which
can be forfeited under that
section.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050881000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
belt and braces and the right hon. and learned Gentleman has referred
to it already. That is entirely proper. As I have said, the way we are
amending the architecture of the 2000 Act and all that it says on
forfeiture will make the safeguards stronger. The points that have been
made are covered in the
Bill.</div>

						</b> I am sorry to press this matter, but I think that it
is important. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the
hon. Member for Gedling, may remember that when we were scrutinising a
different Bill last year, I raised the confiscation powers in the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and we debated this subject. I think that
the Minister is uncharacteristically misunderstanding the
case.</div>

							<a name="08050881000430"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
fictional Mr. McNulty is covered by the amendments to the
2000 Act contained in clause 34. Any other individual who, for whatever
reason, has their property captured under a forfeiture order, but who
has due rights and legal ownership and can  justify that, can
get due process from the courts. Your 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>Mr. McNulty can waddle up to the court&#151;if he is
anything like me&#151;present himself and the documents that say that
it is his car that has been captured by the garage owner who happens to
be a terrorist and, under the amendments in new section 23B to the
Terrorism Act 2000, can also get due process from the
courts.</div>

							<a name="08050881000431"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Although I would like to think that the Minister is
right in his interpretation of statutory language, I fear that he is
not. Let us go back to the starting point. We are dealing with a
fictional Mr. McNulty who gives his car to a garage. The
garage proprietor uses or intends to use the car for terrorist purposes
and is convicted. At that point, Mr. McNulty&#146;s car is
forfeited. What are Mr. McNulty&#146;s rights? They are
set out in clause 34, particularly in new section 23B. Mr.
McNulty has a right to go to the court that made the confiscation
order, claiming to be the owner or to be otherwise interested in
anything that was forfeited. He has a right to go to the court, but
what is the court to do? Subsection (2) of new section 23B
states:</div>
					<a name="08050881000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
considering whether to make an order under section 23 or 23A in respect
of any property, a court shall have regard to&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08050881000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">only two
criteria&#151;</div>
					<a name="08050881000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
value of the
property&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08050881000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is
Mr. McNulty&#146;s car, and</div>
					<a name="08050881000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the likely financial and other
effects on the convicted
person&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08050881000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">who is the
garage proprietor,</div>
					<a name="08050881000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of
the making of the
order&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08050881000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">taken together
with any other order that the court contemplates making. There is
absolutely nothing in the clause that gives the court a duty to
consider  the interests of the fictional Mr.
McNulty&#151;nothing whatever. That is the
objection.</div>
					<a name="08050881000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000432"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> That is because the duty is afforded under new
section 23B(1). New section 23B(2) relates to the remaining property
where it has already been determined that it belongs to the defendant
and is about to be forfeited. It has nothing to do with claims by
third-party owners who are only interested in whether their property is
being swept up in the forfeiture order. I think that that is very
clear.</div>

							<a name="08050881000433"></a>The

intervention.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000434"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I was giving way. Even if the Minister is correct in
his interpretation of subsection (2), he is not right in his
interpretation of subsection (1). All that subsection (1) does is
enable Mr. McNulty to claim to be the owner. It says nothing
about the burden of proof or what the court has to determine before
deciding whether or not the car should be forfeited. I am saying that
there is insufficient protection built into that provision for the
Mr. McNultys of the world. If the Minister thinks about the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 or the point made by the hon. Member for
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy about the Police (Property) Act 1997, he will
know that there are criteria in other legislation that touch precisely
on that matter.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div>
					<a name="08050881000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am perfectly willing to accept
that the Minister, at this stage, is not in a position to say,
&#147;All right, the right hon. and learned Member is of course
right&#148;, but he is in a position to say that he will think
seriously about the matter. I will be entirely reassured, because he is
a perfectly sensible chap, if he will say that he will give the matter
serious thought before Report, because I can tell him that we
will.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000435"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> In that spirit, I shall happily look at it, but I
am pretty clear that I am right, without pre-empting my dispassionate
reflection on how the two clauses interact.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000436"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I simply canvas this as a possibility: it is quite
clear from the amendments that will be made to section 23 of the
Terrorism Act 2000 that it is envisaged that forfeiture will extend to
property that is more than just owned by an individual. That is why
clause 34 states that at the time of the offence the property
was</div>
					<a name="08050881000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in their possession
or under their control&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08050881000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also agree with the Minster that in
clause 34, there is a clear provision for a person to make
representations to the court that they are in fact the owner or
otherwise have an interest in anything that is going to be forfeited.
What is not expressly spelled out is how the court is to reconcile
those two matters. If, for example, a person can establish ownership,
but it is quite clear that the articles were not under the possession
and control of the person at the time that they were used for
terrorism, are they to be confiscated? What is the situation in terms
of forfeiture where it is quite clear that the property does not belong
to the individual, but nobody has ever come forward to say it is
theirs? Is such property automatically confiscated? If the owner hears
about it six months later, is it too late to come along and reclaim it?
Or does it remain their
property?</div>
					<a name="08050881000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will forgive me. I suspect that these are matters which
can be cleared up quite easily, but I think there is, in the drafting
of these two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div>new sections, a degree of incompatibility or, at least, a lack of
clarity which it might be useful to
resolve.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050881000437"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> If, after the reflection that I have promised,
that is the case, we will have a look. Many of these provisions,
however, simply replicate, in the same language, the core of what has
already been in force since 2000 and which has not, in its language at
least, been problematic. The hon. and learned Gentleman will know that
issues around asset seizures have been reported in the press in very
recent times, but they are more to do with asset freezing than with
seizures.</div>
					<a name="08050881000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
happy, in the spirit that the hon. and learned Gentleman offered his
point, to take it away and look at the interaction between the
amendments to the 2000 Act. If there are concerns that have been around
since 2000 that we have not alighted upon, then I will have a look. I
am being very, very clear, as the hon. and learned Gentleman said at
the start, that this is not about trying to block, impinge or do
anything other than have the most efficacious set of principles to do
what we all, collectively, want to do, which is to make sure that the
assets of individuals involved in terrorism are duly
forfeited.</div>

							<a name="08050881000438"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
explanations. I hope that he will take what has been said in good part.
It may well be, as so often happens when we consider Bills, that those
tabling amendments have got it wrong. I do, however, think there is an
issue here, and the fact that the provisions date from 2000 does not
necessarily mean that the issue was resolved at that time. It would be
very useful if the Minister could provide some clarification before
Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
