Amendment moved [this day]: No. 86, in page 4, line 10, after `proved', insert `to the criminal standard'.--[Mr. Malins.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): Amendment No. 86 relates to a matter to which the Committee should return. I appreciate that we have had this argument once on an earlier clause and it is not right to detain the Committee for too long on it. I remain concerned because the proceedings we are discussing are quasi-criminal. It is perfectly right that an order is made in a civil case on the balance of probabilities, and if it is breached there is still imprisonment. Prison is prison. Whether a person goes to prison at the end of injunction proceedings, contempt of court, or at the end of criminal proceedings, it is all effectively the same. However, there is a fundamental difference for the person who is going to prison.
<P>
Under the Bill, proceedings begin as civil matters but turn into criminal proceedings. Anyone who goes to prison for breaching one of the orders that we are considering will have committed a criminal offence. That is very different from going to prison for breaking an injunction. In my career practising matrimonial law I have come across husbands who have been sent to prison for the breach of an injunction in matrimonial proceedings. There is no criminal record. That is a critical difference. The presence of the criminal record is a powerful argument to distinguish betweeen the two sets of circumstances and for introducing a standard of proof as high as the criminal standard.
<P>
When we discussed the matter earlier we were talking about the procedures in magistrates courts on the hearing of complaints. I took the opportunity of reading the House of Lords debates to see what would happen in proceedings in the magistrates court in terms of evidential matters. My understanding of what was said in the other place was confirmed by reading the speech by Lord Williams of Mostyn in Committee, when he dealt with the question of the standard of proof being beyond reasonable doubt on the very point that we are discussing this afternoon.
<P>
Other noble Lords had asked him about the procedural details that would take place on a complaint. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is the specific question as to whether or not complainants have to attend. The complainants would not have to attend. Evidence can be given by the local authority witness or by the police witness . . . The Order stage is genuinely a civil process. There may well have been no actual offence.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 3 February 1998; Vol. 585, c.560.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Williams of Mostyn was talking more in relation to the anti-social behaviour orders. But the point remains. If it is correct that evidence is given in hearsay form and accepted and if none of the normal rules of evidence in a criminal trial is to be followed, and translating that to what can happen in relation to a sex offender order, the following scenario is entirely possible: a sex offender who fulfils all the criteria, comes out of prison and is seen in a locality, acting not in a criminal way--that is very important--but hanging around in a park near where children play. That causes the parents of those children great anxiety. It is entirely possible that they could lodge a complaint with their councillor, who takes it up with the local authority, which says, ``Better to be safe than sorry; we shall seek a sex offender order, because we believe that it is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from this man.'' It is a belt-and-braces operation; the authority takes out the order; the complainant does not have to turn up, there do not have to be any witnesses other than members of the local authority and there is no cross-examination. The defendant may or may not have to be there, yet an order can be so framed as to prevent that man going into the park again.
<P>
I have given an extreme example, but it illustrates the fact that in the wrong hands--that is the point--these orders--this one as much as those we discussed earlier--can be rather sinister and over-used, especially in cases where much injustice could result. The Minister may say, ``Well, this will never happen,'' but who knows? At the end of the day, the policy decision to use these orders will be made by elected local politicians, and elected local politicians, whatever their political colour, although they must consult the police, are not required to take their advice. The local authority can act of its own volition and, at the end of the day, while we have elected local politicians, it is possible for these orders to be abused.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): I thought that clause 3 could be initiated only by the chief officer of police, although I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right; I apologise to the Committee and to the Minister for that slip. I should have addressed my remarks to the earlier clause. I am sorry that I made that mistake. It is, of course, an important protection. It weakens my argument considerably, but it remains to the extent that these are sensitive measures, not to be used in belt-and-braces cases when one is trying to play safe. There must be a temptation, on occasions, to do that.
<P>
The thrust of my argument is that it would be fairer to have a high standard; the court should not make an order unless it were sure that the person had acted in a certain way, rather than on the balance of probabilities. That would require the testing of evidence, the normal rules of criminal procedure and a strict court process. That would be very much in the interests of justice; it would mean that no orders would be made unless the court was sure. Because the breaches are so heavily punished and because the wording is fairly wide, I would be much happier with that standard of proof.
<P>
I shall leave it there as we have heard the arguments before. The Minister will disagree with me; I apologise for having transferred some of the arguments that related to an earlier clause to this one, which I should not have done.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The amendment is designed to press the Government to establish exactly how people will end up with these orders against their name. Perhaps the Minister will clarify what is in the guidelines. It would seem that anyone with an order against him will be in the public domain as having been considered by the courts as a risk that requires an order to be made against him. It will be difficult for people to protect their name by saying that an order was issued on the balance of probability. That might be lost in any media coverage. In concluding, I would like the Minister to clarify whether the orders will be public and whether the people concerned and their addresses will be identified. Recently, we have seen the consequences of information being in the public domain.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for recognising that it is the chief officer of police who has to take a decision. I am convinced that these are not decisions that will be taken lightly. As I indicated earlier, I have been impressed by the way in which the police and probation officers--particularly the police, in reference to such powers--are taking their responsibilities seriously in protecting both the public and the civil liberties of the individual who is subject to the order. That is a difficult balance to achieve.
<P>
The problem with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) is the same problem connected with his suggestions to change the anti-social behaviour orders. I shall not re-rehearse the arguments, but we think that it would be wrong to specify the criminal standard to apply. These are civil orders, which do not carry any of the risks to the defendant of criminal proceedings. There is no possibility of imprisonment. Therefore, they do not merit the imposition of a disproportionate burden of proof.
<P>
It is right to suggest that great care needs to be taken by the police in using the orders only in the way in which Parliament intended, with proper account taken of the guidance. It would be wrong for the orders to be applied to individuals who pose no danger to anyone. The problem is creating obstacles in the way of hitting the right target. I do not think that there is a way to guarantee that that does not happen, but there are appeals, which we shall discuss at a later stage. There are protections and the guidance is available.
<P>
Paedophiles are the true targets, and they can be extremely devious in their behaviour. They can be difficult to detect--it is of the nature of the difficulty of prosecuting--and are of such a significant threat to children. Therefore, we need to provide protection. We must get the balance right, on which our discussion this morning focused. We must ensure that the right target is hit, without creating a monster in the process. I must tell the hon. Member for Woking that his asking for the imposition of a civil order of the criminal standard of proof would place a serious obstacle. Therefore, I urge him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The Minister has answered with great courtesy. He knows that we disagree on the point. I have highlighted the issue and I understand that my views are in a minority on the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move Amendment No. 20, in page 4, line 12, leave out from `which' to end of line 13 and insert--

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) prohibits the defendant from doing anything described in the order; and<P>

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following:
<P>
Amendment No. 89, in page 4, line 13, leave out `described in the order' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which might cause serious harm to the public or any individual'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 21, in page 4, line 16, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) The requirements that may be specified by a sex offender order are those necessary for the purpose of protecting the public from serious harm from the defendant and may include--
<P>
(a) requirements for the defendant to remain, for periods for the time being specified in the order, at a place for the time being so specified (which may be an approved probation hostel); and
<P>
(b) requirements for securing the electronic monitoring of his whereabouts during the period for the time being so specified.
<P>
 (4B) The requirements made under sub-paragraphs (4A)(a) and (b) above may specify different places or different periods for different days, but shall not specify periods which amount to less than 9 hours in any one day (excluding for this purpose the first and last days of the period for which the conditions is in force).
<P>
 (4C) The requirements under subsections (4A) and (4B) above shall include provision for making a person responsible for monitoring the defendant's whereabouts during the periods for the time being specified in the requirements; and a person who is made so responsible shall be of a description specified in an order made by the Secretary of State.
<P>
 (4D) The power conferred by subsection (4C) above--
<P>
(a) shall be exercisable by statutory instrument; and
<P>
(b) shall include power to make different provision for different cases or classes of case or for different areas.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments are designed to find other ways of protecting the public from the serious offenders. There is common ground in the Committee: we all want to do the best that we can to give the public the protection for which they are clearly asking us. I agree with the Minister's remarks about the devious nature of sex offenders. We would do well to keep in mind that we are dealing with people who are devious and who pose a danger for a long time. Many do not grow out of it and they are capable of continuing to be sex offenders to an advanced age.
<P>
	We understand that the sex offender order would prevent the offender from doing certain things. We heard this morning about the prohibitions that are possible. The amendments are intended to allow exploration of the scope for going a step further. We want to discover whether, besides telling defendants, ``Don't do this or go there,'' we could also require them to comply with requirements that would help to reduce the risk of their reoffending. Amendment No. 20 deals with that point.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 21 would go still further and allow the defendant to be subject to an electronic curfew in an appropriate case. We think that as a general proposition tagging has value and can be a safeguard, and I make no political point by saying that that is now common ground between the parties. The Home Secretary, for example, has been impressed recently by tagging technology. He told the House in November--and we agree with his comments--that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the equipment has proved absolutely reliable. When an offender is tagged, it really is possible to tell, second by second, whether he or she is complying with the curfew. Not only are absences instantly noted, but any attempt to tamper with the equipment is detected immediately.''--[Official Report, 20 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 454.] <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to explore the scope for harnessing that technology, to provide extra protection from the threat of sex offenders, in appropriate cases.
<P>
I apprehend that the Minister will ask me whether it would be right or appropriate to use the technology in that way and go from a prohibitive order to one imposing requirements on the offender, which might extend to the use of electronic tagging. However, I invite him to consider that the prohibitions themselves could be of some magnitude. The consultation paper issued by the Government stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``we propose . . . that courts should have the freedom to impose such conditions as are necessary, in the light of the evidence brought before them to protect the community from serious harm caused by the defendant's sexual behaviour.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Without wanting to make too much of the phrase ``serious harm'', given that the Committee considered that this morning, I think it is relevant to the amendments to bear in mind that the Government are setting a fairly high threshold for the setting of such an order. Where ``serious harm'' to the public is a possibility, we would do well to do all in our power to prevent such serious harm. Therefore, why not give the courts the freedom to impose tagging, and other requirements, in appropriate cases? Clearly, it should be for the courts to decide, and to assess cases on their merits, but they should have the flexibility to deal with potentially serious cases involving defendants who, besides meeting the conditions for imposing an order, might represent a significant threat to the public and children.
<P>
Why would a prohibition, but not a positive requirement, be possible under an order, particularly given that the latter might improve his or her behaviour? Will the Minister give the Committee a full exposition of the Government's case on that? The public will want that too. We are arguing our case as helpfully and constructively as we can in an attempt to obtain for the public the protection that they seek.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My amendment, No. 89, is also a probing amendment. It is intended to obtain constructive guidance from the Government about the proposals. The clause refers to the possibility of prohibiting the defendant from doing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``anything described in the order''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a very wide provision. Will the Minister give the Committee a full explanation of the types of wording that are likely to be in the orders? We need to strike a balance that protects the public, or individual members of the public, but which does not allow the courts to make orders with such wide phraseology that defendants would be prohibited from living a normal life.
<P>
It might be possible, for example, for a court to prohibit a defendant from leaving his residence, apart from one hour per day. Is that the kind of order that is envisaged? Might the terms of an order be so wide that they would prevent the defendant from attending job interviews, or from going to work? Alternatively, should courts make orders that are limited to the particular complaint that has been made against a defendant? We need to examine these matters to determine what kind of orders it would be appropriate for the courts to make.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) referred to tagging. That is an interesting concept. The Minister will be aware that the Select Committee on Home Affairs recently visited Manchester, where we met those involved in tagging, at the sharp end in the courts, and those who administer the system. I think that tagging, or electronic curfews, applies in only certain areas of the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> There are three areas in which the courts are piloting the scheme: Norwich, Reading and Manchester. However, those are not the only areas in which tagging would be technically possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I was about to say that I thought that the scheme was operating in those areas.
<P>
The administrators of the scheme in Manchester are pleased with it, by and large. The stipendiary magistrate of the Manchester court uses tagging a great deal. It is extremely effective. In Manchester, the scheme is administered by Securicor. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said, it is virtually foolproof.
<P>
I asked Securicor in Manchester if there was any way a defendant could cheat the system. A couple of months ago there was one way only that had been used, and at that time there was no means to prevent it. For example, a court might sentence John Smith of No. 1 Smith street to be put under an electronic curfew, but John Smith absents himself, and his brother, who is a good chap, takes the medicine on John's behalf. The Securicor personnel turn up at the house and say, ``Good afternoon sir. Are you John Smith?'' He replies ``Yes, I am, and here is my driving licence''. They say, ``Very well sir. You are to be tagged from now on''. Meanwhile the person who should have been tagged is having a nice holiday in Bermuda. That has actually happened. It is not always 100 per cent. certain that the person who is tagged is the person that the court intended should be tagged.
<P>
However, those problems can be solved. It is a good system and I am sure that the Minister will want to use it in the implementation of the orders. Will the Minister tell the Committee more about the nature of the orders that can be made by the courts? What will be the scope of the orders, and how can modern technology help to enforce the sensible sentiments behind the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): We all know that sex offenders pose a serious risk and that the imposition of orders might be necessary. However, the wording of the clause is unsatisfactory. Subsection (3) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the magistrates' court may make an order under this section (a `sex offender order') which prohibits the defendant from doing anything described in the order.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That basically means that a magistrates court may make any sort of order prohibiting any person, as long as he is a sex offender, from doing anything.
<P>
In my experience I am not sure that such widely drafted legislation is appropriate. I thought that I might get further assistance from the notes on clauses, helpfully provided by the Minister. I may have missed something but they are not a great deal of help: I am looking particularly at section 4.4, but no doubt the Minister will be able to enlighten me on this matter. But that he must do. It is essential that we do not just have another elephant-on-the-doorstep debate and that he tells us in clear terms what sort of orders and what sort of behaviour he envisages.
<P>
We tried to press the Minister briefly on this matter this morning. All we got out of him was that it might be hanging around outside schools or carrying bags of sweets. However serious these offences are, I find it hard to believe that any court would impose an order on a person because he was carrying bags of sweets. There must be more to this than is currently being divulged to the Committee and that information must have been shared with the Minister. He must now share that information with us.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is a rather curious debate to respond to as the Opposition are pulling in two diametrically opposed directions. On the one hand, the Opposition Front Bench wishes to ascertain whether we can go further in the protection we provide for children and vulnerable adults, and yet there is an outbreak of liberalism on the Opposition Back Benches, recognised with pride by one hon. Member but with embarrassment by the other. I shall try to deal seriously with both issues.
<P>
It is important to understand what we are trying to achieve in this instance. We certainly are moving forward as quickly as we can in terms of finding ways of dealing with an extremely difficult issue. There is a fortunately small number of sex offenders who pose a threat to children but there is a danger in trying to rush quickly, which is why we are considering carefully options such as indeterminate sentences. We may come to the House of Commons with suggestions along those lines. We are looking at ways of making sure that there are lifelong controls, where appropriate and where there is a risk.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Is my hon. Friend aware that Jason Swift's family lived in my constituency? When one of the Sidney Cooke gang, a man by the name of Barrell, was released, he came and lived close to the family. I am sure that they will appreciate these orders. Could he say a bit more about the ways of moving forward? He will be aware that Jason Swift's family were extremely concerned about the type of penalties that were open to deal with sex offenders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> My hon. Friend is right to express the concern that any family that has had an experience of that sort feel about anyone who has been involved in the offending. We have to deal with the situation in which the courts have dealt with individuals in accordance with the law and the evidence that they have heard. Courts take different decisions and in the case to which my hon. Friend referred there was a reduction in sentence by the Court of Appeal. Without knowing everything about it, it is difficult to judge. It causes surprise among the families of those directly involved but it is right that the Court of Appeal should make that judgment with the evidence before it.
<P>
We want to deal with serious issues, but not by finding or inventing a magic wand. There is not a simple solution. The issues are difficult and a variety of instruments are needed to deal with a variety of offenders who pose different risks.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) asked about the definition of ``behaviour''. We want the widest possible definition to ensure that the courts are able to use the powers to make an order and to impose such conditions as are necessary to make it work. That is difficult, as is changing the law on indeterminate sentences.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The breadth of the expression ``anything'' is certainly wide, but the qualification on it appears in clause 3(4), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The prohibitions . . . are those necessary for the purpose of protecting the public from serious harm from the defendant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must strike a balance between allowing a court discretion and making it clear what it must bear in mind so that it prevents the commissioning of serious offences or reoffending of the type feared by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble).
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister deal with a concern that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough have expressed? The Minister said that anything could be prohibited if that would protect the public. Would such a provision go so far as to impose a curfew on a defendant by preventing him from going out of doors at certain times?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The idea of a curfew is a difficult one. The court would have to be satisfied that it met the requirements of the clause.
<P>
I shall reply to amendments Nos. 20 and 21 together and explain some of the problems that may arise. The amendments aim to place requirements rather than prohibitions in sex offender orders, and the hon. Member for Woking and even that well-known liberal the hon. Member for Gainsborough might challenge the hon. Member for Hertsmere because of the problems with that.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the principle behind the proposals, but not to their detail. A sex offender order is a civil order, and that is its great strength. It will allow the police to intervene before a further offence is committed by someone who has committed a sex offence in the past. The idea is to stop him in his tracks when such behaviour by another person may be considered innocent. When the police have reasonable cause for concern that the public are at risk of serious harm from the defendant, they will be able to take preventive action. That is the trigger for the police to become involved.
<P>
The strength of the order carries with it limitations. It is one thing to stop someone from doing something--that is serious enough in itself, and is how a civil injuction usually works--but it is another matter to compel someone to do something, however desirable we may feel that to be. The police will not have to prove that an offence has been committed--the aim is to prevent offences from being committed--and they will not even have to prove criminal intent, so the proper response cannot be a penalty as such. However, that is what the amendments propose. I make it clear again that the order will not be a sentence or a penalty because it will not be imposed as the result of a conviction.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the approach outlined in the amendments. Such action may be a positive help in preventing a sex offender from reoffending, and we want to make that help available wherever possible. Before Easter, members of the Committee may have become aware of a case of voluntary electronic tagging. It is the second or third case of which I am aware. The detailed guidance to accompany the orders that is being worked out with practitioners will deal with questions of how such work can be undertaken and its answers will be made clear.
<P>
I, too, have visited the security centre in Manchester, and had quite a long discussion with the people who run it. We spoke about its present operation and about its potential for dealing with problems such as we are discussing. At that time, one voluntary tagging arrangement had been made, and I was interested to discover how the centre dealt with it.
<P>
Tagging arrangements have value, but they are not foolproof. They can only do so much, although future technology may open up new possibilities. The first experiments in tagging showed that the electronics were not up to the job, but developments in industry make it clear that the systems will soon be greatly improved.
<P>
The sex offenders order is near the limit of what is possible. If we were to go any further we would jeopardise the proposal and run the risk of being struck down in the European Court. The hon. Member for Hertsmere heard the comments of other Conservative Members. He will know that there is a tension between ensuring that the order is effective--it must target the right people and prevent them from reoffending--and creating an order than can be abused or misused to the detriment of ordinary members of the public.
<P>
The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Woking may have an effect different from what was intended. It may go wider than is tenable in allowing general prohibitions, and it may be too narrow in prohibiting only future sexual offences and not behaviour that is potentially dangerous but not illegal. Subsection (4) provides that the prohibitions are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``those necessary for the purpose of protecting the public''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, to prevent any doubt, that provision also covers individuals--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``from serious harm from the defendant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the essential ingredient in the orders. It is not clear that the amendment would cover such prohibitions, where the behaviour in itself does not amount to a sexual offence. That would make nonsense of the way in which the clause is intended to work in the prevention of offending. The risk is that the amendment could suggest a general prohibition on the acceptability of anything that might cause serious harm to the public or individual people. That could not be right.
<P>
I hope that those explanations will cause the Committee to agree that the Bill has got it right. It provides protection but does not go too far in the inhibitions that it puts in place and the justifications for an order that must be placed before a court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> At least the Minister's speech provoked a response from Labour Members. I do not know whether it is in order for dead people to serve on a Committee, but since 10.30 this morning there has been not a twitch, not a comment and not a speech from any Labour Member. At last we have confirmed that one of them is alive, for which we must give thanks.
<P>
The Minister did not respond to the points that I raised. There is something Kafkaesque about our proceedings. Whenever I ask a question I am referred back to the Bill, which basically tells me that the Government can do anything that they like. I then seek more information in the guidance notes, as I did while the Minister was speaking. However, section 6 in the annexe to the guidance notes is equally unhelpful. It states that a magistrate.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must be satisfied that police have proved that it is more probable than not that the defendant has acted since the relevant date in such a way as to give reasonable cause to believe that an order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from him.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That adds nothing to what is in the Bill. Normally, notes are supposed to amplify and explain matters; they should not merely repeat what is inadequately explained in the Bill.
<P>
I turned to the examples for help. Section 10 has the heading ``How Could This Work?'' It gives a helpful example, in which a person, Mr. X, is cautioned for the offence of indecent conduct. In October 1998 he begins to hang around outside the gates of a primary school at the end of the school day. He approaches passing children, offers them sweets and talks to them. That happens several times.
<P>
I agree that such behaviour should be covered by the order. However, it is just one example. It is the one to which I alluded in my comments, and to which the Minister has also alluded. What other examples can he provide of behaviour that the order should cover?
<P>
The Minister cannot pretend that we disagree about the desirability of the orders; Conservative Members agree that they may well be necessary. We realise that such people are dangerous and that they may need to be controlled. However, we are entitled to ask what further examples the Minister can foresee that would result in the making of an order. The Minister has yet to give an answer to that. He has provided us with just one example, to which I have already alluded.

<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am still quite unhappy with the Minister's description of me as a bit of a liberal. I am not sure whether to take it as a compliment. I have been scratching my head for half an hour about the matter. Some Committee members are Liberal Democrats--for example the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan).
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It was meant as a compliment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Thank you.
<P>
I cannot put my feelings into words that would appeal to everyone. However, there is something sinister about the clause that I do not like. In a sensible and well-ordered society, such orders are fine. The Minister may say that a good, sensible court will act only when it is obvious that it should act. However, the Minister says that the courts can impose an order on a person who has committed no criminal offence and who may not have any criminal intent. That troubles me.
<P>
When confronted with an application for a sex offender order, a court may face a difficult problem. I shall give a hypothetical example. Three magistrates are sitting in a small country town. A well-known previous sex offender moves to the area. The press become aware of the fact, and a raging mob forms. The chief police officer decides that he must seek an order under the relevant section, otherwise his job may be at risk.
<P>
The Minister will see the way that my mind is working. I worry that, from the civil liberties point of view, the law may eventually be used in an oppressive way. The Minister, who is a reasonable man, has said that a balance must be struck. He is right. It is vital that the law is never exercised in too oppressive a manner. However, as they stand, clauses 2 and 3 will enable courts, police and local authorities to do just that.
<P>
One hopes that the courts will interpret the legislation sensibly, and that they will build up case law that is wise and effective, and which above all recognises the needs of the individual. Nevertheless, the matter continues to trouble me.
<P>
<b>Mr. Clappison:</b> I listened carefully to the Minister's full response, and there is common ground between us. I agree with his general approach. No foolproof solution exists for dealing with these very dangerous people. We must progress stage by stage, and ensure that the law gives the public as much protection as possible. We must deal with the matter incrementally, by building on existing legislation.
<P>
However, one or two questions remain in my mind. Reference was made to the tagging of offenders in Manchester. I too shall take up that example. I hope that the people in Norfolk and Reading do not feel left out. I went to Manchester and inspected the scheme. I was impressed with what I saw and thought that it was very well run. The weather that day was so bad I could not imagine that anyone would want to go outside, but I am sure that that was an exception in Manchester.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> When I last went to Manchester the sun was shining and the weather was wonderful. However, although Norwich is separate, such are the wonders of modern electroncis that I believe that the Manchester control centre also covers the Thames Valley area.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am sure that that is right. I was not trying to tempt the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) into the debate. I am sure that, as a native Mancunian, he will spring to Manchester's defence, even at this sad time for some people in that city.
<P>
	The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) mentioned the terrible case of Jason Swift. In response, the Minister said that there might be an opportunity in the future to vote for indeterminate sentences. I hope that I will not be out of order if I say that that opportunity may come sooner than anticipated. Some of the new clauses that the Opposition have tabled will offer an opportunity to vote for indeteminate sentences in certain cases. I look forward to hearing what the hon. Lady has to say then.
<P>
The Minister raised the question of the distinction between prohibitions and requirements. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough rightly chastised me for drawing that distinction. When I first thought about the matter, I could define a curfew only as a prohibition on going outside. I framed the amendments to follow the Government's legislative scheme for the tagging of people released early from prison. I therefore described curfew as a requirement because I did not want to be told that my amendment was legally defective. However, can a prohibition imposed on a defendant under the Bill prevent the defendant from going outside during certain hours, thus in effect amounting to a curfew? The Minister's response did not make it entirely clear whether a prohibition could go that far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I think that there are extreme circumstances in which that might be possible, but only if the requirements of the Bill were met. That means that it would be necessary to prohibit a defendant from going outside during certain hours, as distinct from preventing him from going to certain places, or whatever the other requirements might be. However, such prohibitions could be granted only in extreme circumstances, and would be a matter for the court to decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I think that the Minister is right: the courts must have the freedom to deal with cases. The Bill must cater for the extreme cases as well as the run-of-the-mill ones. I can conceive of circumstances in which a court might decide that a curfew would be a useful way of restraining somebody with a conviction for a sexual offence whose behaviour was causing anxiety.
<P>
For example, such an order might cover men with convictions for rape, which would be a qualifying offence. If a man with a conviction for raping a woman at a railway station were seen following women around stations late at night, it might be useful if a prohibition preventing him from going outside at certain times could be put in place. The police would find it easier to enforce the prohibition if they had to keep an eye on that man at home than if they had to monitor all the railway stations at which he might be lurking. That is one example of where such an order might be needed.
<P>
The distinction between prohibitions and requirements is slightly artificial. The Minister has just said that the prohibition could go as far as a curfew, but that might undermine his case for a rigid distinction between prohibitions and requirements. When does a prohibition become a requirement? Is a prohibition preventing a person from going outside the same as a requirement that he stay at home?
<P>
We are not sure how much sense there is in a distinction on which the Government rest so much credibility and which they claim is all important when it comes to possible challenges in the European Court. Why should the distinction between prohibitions and requirements make any difference? Prohibitions can go very wide and prevent people from going into certain areas, and a court might view that as a considerable restriction on a person's liberty. Our intention in tabling the amendments was to seek to ensure that the public are given the best possible protection. I am pleased to hear that it will be possible to establish a curfew under the orders. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 4, line 30, leave out from beginning to `liable' in line 31 and insert--
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`subsection (1)(a) (absolute discharge) or an order under'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<b>Mr. Clappison:</b> The amendments relate to issues arising from the defence of ``reasonable excuse'', which the Bill defines as an excuse that may be used by somebody who is alleged to be in breach of a prohibition order. If a person does something that is in breach of an order, he will be guilty of an offence unless he has a reasonable excuse of the kind that is enshrined as a defence in the Bill. If the court finds that he has a reasonable excuse, he will be acquitted. One would be tempted to ask in such circumstances, given that an order has been made to prevent the defendant from doing certain things, what could be a reasonable excuse for breaching such an order? Will the Minister tell us more about that?
<P>
	The amendments deal with the way in which the defence of a reasonable excuse will operate in the courts. As the Bill stands, will it be necessary, when a case comes before the criminal court, for the prosecution to prove to a criminal standard of proof that the defendant did not have a reasonable excuse? In other words, is the burden of proof on the prosecution? Our reading of the Bill is that that does not appear to be the case. Will the Minister tell us if we are labouring under a misapprehension?
<P>
	The amendments would shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defendant. It would be for the defendant to prove that he had a reasonable excuse, and the burden of proof would be on him. According to our amendments, the burden of proof would be on the balance of probabilities. Will the Minister confirm that that would be the effect of the amendments, as we believe to be the case? The defendant will know full well what the terms of the order are and that he has carried out some action that has breached those terms.Given the great importance of protecting the public in such circumstances, we believe that the burden of proof should be on the defendant--he should show that he had a reasonable excuse for breaching the order. It should not be for the prosecution to prove that he did not have a reasonable excuse.
<P>
We were strengthened in that view by the fact that the order is intended to protect the public from serious harm. I remind the Committee that such harm may take the form of death or serious injury, whether physical or psychological. If a defendant was in breach of an order that was designed to protect the public from serious harm, it should be for him to show that he has a reasonable excuse.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall deal first with amendment No. 23. I believe it to be misconceived, although I can understand the point that the hon. Member for Hertsmere is trying to make. The defence of reasonable excuse is well established. The onus is already on the defendant to offer his excuse and to show that it is reasonable. That is inherent in the nature of the provision, so it is unnecessary to make separate provision in the Bill that the burden of proof should lie upon him. I accept that he does not have to prove reasonableness as a specific issue, but he must establish his excuse as reasonable or by its very nature the defence fails. Alive as they are to the risk imposed by sex offenders and their devious natures, our courts will not easily be gulled. Such a defence is well-established; the amendment could call its wider status into doubt and that would not be right.
<P>
Amendment No. 22 is consequential to amendments Nos. 20 and 21, and the same arguments apply. Indeed, without those amendments this one would have no effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I must press the Minister on this matter; I may be wrong, and I will eat humble pie if I am, but is the Minister aware that elsewhere in the criminal law where the term is used in the same way, the effect is that the burden of proof--the criminal standard of proof--is on the prosecution to show that the defendant did not have a reasonable excuse? The specific reason for tabling the amendment is to adopt the approach used in other legislation, where it is the definite intention of Parliament to shift the burden of proof to the defendant, as is the case with the possession of offensive weapons. In the legislation that applies in those cases it is for the defendant to show that he had a reasonable excuse. I will wait for the Minister's advisers to assist him if necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I believe that I am right in saying that the prosecution has to show what the clause requires: first, that a person is a sex offender, therefore he comes under the provisions of the order; secondly, that his behaviour has caused concern. If the individual shows that it is reasonable for him to behave in a particular way, or, in respect of a breach, shows that it was reasonable for him to have acted in a particular way, that gives the courts the capacity to decide that there has not been a breach. It is clearly for the defendant to show that that is reasonable. If the hon. Gentleman is convinced that there is a conflict, I am happy to examine his arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to speak at cross purposes and I certainly do not want to put the Minister on the spot, so I suggest that he carefully considers what I have said and the effect of the amendments. If he thinks that there is something in what I say, perhaps he will amend the Bill on Report to give it the effect that he apparently intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> There is no doubt in the matter; I always listen carefully to the hon. Gentleman and it is possible that something that neither my advisers nor I have seen has not been taken into account. It is always sensible to listen to debates in case something fresh is mentioned, but nothing has been. It is for the prosecution to prove every element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, as I said a few moments ago.
<P>
However, the defendant may be able to show, on the balance of probabilities, that he has a reasonable excuse for specific behaviour. Unless the defendant raises such a defence he is not able to establish that it applies. The onus is clearly on the defendant. There can be no doubt about that; that is our intention and that is my understanding of the effects of the clause.
<P>
Amendments similar to amendment No. 92 were discussed in clause 2. We cannot accept this amendment either because, if anything, stronger measures are needed for sex offenders. Let us take the case of someone who has given the police cause for concern that the public are at risk of serious harm from him. The magistrates court has upheld that concern and he has now breached the order with no reasonable excuse. That suggests that the individual concerned either cannot, or will not, control his behaviour, and there is no room for complacency; we are dealing with serious issues. A case may not go to be tried on indictment, and even if it is a court need not award the higher penalties available. But it must be right that those penalties are available, if a five-year maximum prison sentence could be justified.
<P>
Amendment No. 24 relates to absolute discharge. The provisions for breach of a sex offender order mirror those of the anti-social order which we have already discussed. I explained why conditional discharges were an appropriate response to breach. In contrast, as absolute discharge would be used in completely different circumstances from a conditional discharge, there could be occasions when it would be appropriate.
<P>
From my own experience in court, there are occasions when the court studies the facts with all the explanations and in the full context of the case. That is not always available to the police or the Crown Prosecution Service when they decide to pursue the case. If it is clear to the court that the case is inappropriate, the absolute discharge gives the opportunity to signal that fact, even although the specific facts may have been proved to the satisfaction of the courts.
<P>
With those remarks, I urge the hon. Member for Hertsmere to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am sorry that I was out of the Room a moment ago.
<P>
I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 92, which stands in my name. I shall deploy the same argument that I deployed with reference to the previous clause: I do not believe that a breach should attract five years on indictment. The Minister was clear when he said that the type of behaviour that would result in an anti-social behaviour would have to be criminal or--in that phrase that will come to haunt the Minister over the years ahead and which has yet to be defined--sub-criminal. If one accepts that point, one accepts that an order would be made under the earlier clause and a breach would result in a custodial sentence.
<P>
Earlier, the Minister confirmed that, under this clause, the defendant to the complaint does not have to have committed a criminal offence at any stage whatever during the course of the proceedings, nor does he have to have intended to commit one. Nevertheless, an order can be made and he can breach it, even though his conduct does not amount either to criminal behaviour or to sub-criminal behaviour, and he has no intent to commit a crime. If that is right, it seems wrong in principle that a five-year sentence on indictment would be available to the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman came into the Room in the middle of the debate. We are discussing the need to prevent the perceived dangers. The court needs to be satisfied that there are dangers, and a breach would have to be serious for the court to be able to use the more serious punishment available to it. It is of considerable importance that there should be strong punishment available to make it clear exactly how seriously a breach will be regarded. That is for the purpose not only of punishment, but of making the order an effective means of prevention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Whatever the Minister says, the breach will not necessarily be a criminal offence. A breach may involve entirely lawful behaviour. It may be disapproved of and one may say, ``We don't like the look of this. It may be nasty'', but that does not make it a criminal offence--yet it could result in a maximum five-year sentence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I just ask the hon. Gentleman to think carefully about the reason for having such a serious penalty available: it is to prevent the type of events about which we were talking earlier. Serious sexual offences can be devastating, if not terminal. That is the seriousness of the civil requirements that are agreed by the court, and that is the reason for treating the tariff level as being that serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> We are going full circle again. The Minister has been drawn into the question of whether a crime has been committed. If so, we have a remedy available: it is called the criminal law. It says to somebody, ``if you behave like this, you will get charged with a criminal offence and put in prison.'' That is no different from the scenario about which we are talking at the moment.
<P>
I have made my arguments, and the Minister knows them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Is it not the case that a person could conceivably be put in prison for committing an act that, had it been committed by soomeone else, who was not a convicted sex offender--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Or who was not subject to the order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Or who was not subject to the order, would be entirely legitimate and innocent? Is that not a worrying departure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend is right. In those circumstances, the behaviour of a person who was not a previous sex offender and not subject to an order would be perfectly lawful and would not be a problem. Yet a previous sex offender, or someone who was subject to an order, could be sent to prison for five years. That is a difficult idea to accept.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> In my constituency, a former sex offender, who had served his sentence some time previously, proposed to live within a stone's throw of a primary school, a mothers and toddlers playgroup, a youth club in a secluded, wooded area and a bail hostel, to which local residents had also objected. It was not claimed that he had done anything, but would the hon. Gentleman accept that people might feel strongly that it was not desirable that he should live in that area?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The hon. Lady sincerely raises an issue that is of great relevance in her constituency. I understand that, as I understand the concerns of mothers or teachers. However, how far should society go to stop such a thing happening? There will be a primary school around the corner from almost anywhere that a person might want to live. There will probably be a youth club within 50 yards, or a church choir 150 yards away.Unless a blanket order is issued that a certain person should not live anywhere near certain organisations, there is no true protection. There is no perfect answer to the problem.
<P>
The hon. Lady's concern is genuine, and well expressed, if I may say so. However, she will recognise that we must stand apart from particular communities and look at such matters through different eyes to ensure that we do not introduce laws that are oppressive. We must not restrict people's liberties too much. There is a balance to be struck.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paul Stinchcombe </B>(Wellingborough): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am most grateful for that intervention. It is marvellous to see Government Back Benchers taking an active part in the debate. I welcome that and I am sure that all my hon. Friends agree, not least because it removes the burden from us for a moment. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear''.] More important, we know that Labour Members can make useful contributions to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stinchcombe:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere spoke of his concern that the definition of serious harm was prohibitive and that the threshold was far too high. Does the hon. Member for Woking recognise that we want to introduce the orders to prevent such serious harm? Under those circumstances, is it not right that the courts should be able to impose serious penalties if orders are breached?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman. We have gone back to the beginning, in the sense that we are asking whether the criminal law enables us to cope with such matters adequately through the use if anti-social behaviour orders or these orders. Is the criminal law--or other available sanctions--an effective remedy?
<P>
In relation to the previous clause, some of us pointed out that it was so similar to the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986 that it was unnecessary. Proper funding and deployment of police forces would obviate the need for the clause. That would also apply to clause 3.
<P>
What should be done? A sex offender who is released from prison has paid his or her debt to society and should, as far as reasonably possible, be given a fresh start and begin with a clean sheet--subject to the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Northampton, North about the importance of protecting society from a repetition. How far should we go? Should we argue that this person must carry on an ordinary, free life, but, once a further offence is committed, we should arrest and charge him or her, and, on conviction, impose a prison sentence? That is a tolerable argument, but the problem with it is that people--and the press--would say that the offence should have been prevented. That idea has been running through our debate today. Can such an offence be prevented?
<P>
Some would say that in a free society such risks must be taken; that an individual's liberty to live where he likes or wander through parks provided that he does not commit a criminal offence is the more important consideration. The tenor of clause 3 and those which follow is that the relevant behaviour should be prevented. Those promoting this approach want, without being sure whether any offending behaviour has started, to stop it. They feel that the safest approach is to whip a lot of people into court to make orders against them. The balance between the two approaches is what troubles me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): The hon. Gentleman is hitting the nail on the head. Just as with the anti-social behaviour orders, the crucial matter here is the application, which should be drawn fairly tightly. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that orders should not prohibit a person from living anywhere near any school or similar institution, but instead should be specific and apply to someone who has, for example, been hanging around a playground or woods. Blanket provisions referring to the areas around any school or youth club would cover virtually anywhere in the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> That is why it is so important to achieve the right balance, and why I feel exceedingly unhappy about the five-year prison terms, on indictment, under the clause. I should be interested to know what criteria the magistrates will have before them when deciding whether a breach is indictable or more suitable for summary trial. Will the defendant have a right to choose a Crown court trial? [Interruption.] I see that the Minister is not certain about that. Perhaps he will be able to take advice.
<P>
Someone who is charged with theft from Marks and Spencer has the right to opt for a Crown court trial, and the Crown can do nothing about that, though it is a minor offence. Other offences, as the Minister will know, must go to the Crown court. There is a fine middle band of offences that are triable either way, such as burglary or actual bodily harm. In those cases the magistrates court makes a decision based on well-established criteria. Will those criteria be before the court in a case brought under the clause? To what extent will they vary?
<P>
A problem remains with respect to conditional discharge and deferment of sentence. I conclude by asking the Minister whether he thinks that conditional discharge is a lesser or greater penalty than a &#163;25 fine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Once again, we had a full response from the Minister. I listened carefully, and was pleased because there was some common ground between us. I think that that extended as far as sharing an objective--certainly with respect to the defence of reasonable excuse. If I heard the Minister correctly--and I hope that I am not engaging in unbecoming or undignified critical exegesis by putting it this way--he told the Committee that his interpretation of the Bill's effect was that the burden of proof would be on the defendant to show that he had a reasonable excuse and that he would have to do so on the balance of probabilities. I accept that. I am sure that the Minister is entirely confident about that but we are concerned that that is not the effect of the Bill. Our first interpretation of the Bill was that once someone had raised a defence of reasonable excuse, it would be for the prosecution to show beyond reasonable doubt--the normal standard.
<P>
The Minister believed that the Bill did not have that effect and we accept his assurance on that. I am quite prepared to admit when I am wrong but, notwithstanding what the Minister said, I have a lurking doubt that I may not be wrong. If so and if the Minister gets more information about that, perhaps he will tell us if the effect of the Bill is as we interpreted it and that the burden is on the prosecution to show that the defendant did not have a reasonable excuse.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> As long as the hon. Gentleman does not seize my arm up for the offering of a hand, I am perfectly happy to consider points that he makes or concerns that he raises in Committee or outside to make sure that we get this right. I do not think that there is the problem that he describes, but I would not want him to continue worrying so I shall certainly look at the point he has made. I think I can give him the assurance he seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful. I will certainly not bite off the Minister's hand now that he has made that helpful suggestion. We await further particulars but, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 4, line 40, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(9A) The Secretary of State shall within two years of this section coming into effect make a report to Parliament on the working of sex offender orders.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider clause stand part and new clause 1--Sex offender supervision orders--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `.--(1) Where a court makes a sex offender order in respect of a defendant over 16 years of age and is of the opinion that the supervision of the defendant by a probation officer is desirable in the interests of protecting the public from serious harm, the court may make a sex offender supervision order, that is to say, an order requiring him to be under the supervision of a probation officer for the duration of the sex offender order.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	(2) A sex offender supervision order shall specify the petty sessions area in which the defendant resides or will reside; and the defendant shall, subject to paragraph 12 of Schedule 2 to the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (offenders who change their residence) be required to be under the supervision of a probation officer appointed for or assigned to that area.
<P>
	(3) The requirements which shall be made of the defendant subject to a sex offender supervision order are those which are made of an offender subject to a probation order under the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 and any requirements which may be made of an offender subject to a probation order under the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 may also be made of a defendant under a sex offender supervision order.
<P>
	(4) A defendant who fails to comply with any of the requirements of a sex offender supervision order shall be dealt with as though he was an offender who has failed to comply with the requirements of a probation order, save that if the court decides to revoke the sex offender supervision order the defendant shall be dealt with as though he was in breach of a sex offender order under section 3 (8) above.'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to the final group of amendments on sex offender orders. I shall dispose first with amendment No. 28 and the clause stand part debate. Amendment No. 28 is the normal reporting back device which we seek to insert at a number of points in the Bill. We want to be assured that the provisions we are creating are working properly and not having unintended effects.
<P>
Our main concern about sex offender orders is whether the courts would be able to give the public the degree of protection that they seek and whether there might be circumstances in which sex offender orders are not made because of legal difficulties. That brings me to the point about serious harm. The Minister was kind enough in the earlier debates on that subject to say that he was prepared to consider it. Without wanting to bite his hand off again, perhaps I could press him a little further on that. We would be most grateful if he could write to the Committee when he has been able to digest the fruits of his reconsideration of the issue.
<P>
On a somewhat happier point, we welcome the provisions for dealing with people who have committed sex offences abroad as sex offenders in this country and making them subject to a sex offender order. That is a useful step forward and among the organisations that have lobbied me for this debate is the End Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking organisation which is keen to see the introduction of further protection which it would regard as a significant step forward. Its wish, which is certainly ours too, is that the communication between international police forces be as efficient as possible in communicating details of people who commit sex offences in one country to another country. We would like to hear how that would work in the context of the Bill.
<P>
That brings me to new clause 1 which concerns the important subject of supervision for sex offenders subject to a sex offender order. We feel that supervision could be of valuable assistance, and the new clause fills a gap in what is proposed. We feel strongly about this and are listening carefully to what the Minister has to say before we decide on whether to press the matter to a vote.
<P>
Two points have struck me about sex offenders. The first is the number of such offenders. Recent Home Office research suggests that a minimum of 260,000 men aged over 20 have been convicted of a sexual offence, and that at least 110,000 men had a conviction for an offence against a child. It is a worrying statistic that a city the size of York could be made up of men who are interested in children in that unhealthy way.
<P>
I have already mentioned my second point, namely the length of time that sex offenders continue to be a risk. Unlike other offenders, many sex offenders do not grow out of their offending. They continue to be a risk, even at a relatively advanced age. A recent report from the inspectorate of probation draws attention to that matter. Some adolescent offenders grow out of their offending, but, in some cases, sex offenders have a tendency to grow into their offending and to become more confirmed in their behaviour.
<P>
Supervision could be important in guarding the public against sex offenders. New clause 1 would allow a court to impose a supervision order on a person subject to a sex offender order, if that was thought to be appropriate. That person would be under the supervision of a probation officer. Probation officers could do valuable work with such offenders, and I would like to pay tribute to them. They already do important work in that area, as disclosed in the report to which I have referred.
<P>
The report noted that the supervision of sex offenders by probation officers can be highly effective. The inspectors who compiled the report found that there was a high level of vigilance and that the treatment programmes were designed to protect the public. The report stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``protection of the public was unambiguously identified as the central purpose of the work of the probation service with such offenders.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are advantages in bringing the expertise and experience of the probation service to bear on those who have been made the subject of a sex offender order. That is especially true if the order was applied for when the person was going off the rails and his behaviour was causing concern. Conservative Members realise that the Government might argue that this is too much like a punishment. However, as we pointed out in our earlier debates, we are not convinced by that argument. As matters stand, the order could contain sweeping prohibitions that amounted to requirements.
<P>
Furthermore, supervision does not involve only telling people not to do something, as is the case with prohibitions. Supervision might help some sex offenders to address their offending and to turn away from such behaviour. That would be a positive good and is an important factor in its favour. We are not convinced by the Government's arguments that it is not possible to impose either requirements or supervision on sex offenders. We shall listen to the Minister's comments on that matter with interest. Within the constraints, we want to do all that we possibly can to protect the public from the risk represented by sex offenders. There is compelling evidence that the probation service can offer a great deal in the matter of supervision. We hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to making sex offenders subject to that sort of supervision to give the public extra protection.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall speak to the amendment, the new clause and clause stand part.
<P>
In general, the provision of such an order is welcome. My daughter recently returned from school, saying that the children had been warned about a man in a white car, who was hanging around outside the school. However, no further action could be taken. The police knew that the person had a record and they had issued the warning. An additional provision of the sort proposed would have had a helpful impact in those circumstances.
<P>
We strongly support new clause 1, tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. Members of the Select Committee on Home Affairs have recently visited probation services in different parts of the country, and we have been tremendously impressed by their work. I join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to probation officers, especially those who supervise sex offenders. They take their responsibilities extremely seriously and have developed some fascinating programmes which will benefit a significant number of offenders. If we are not simply to give up on the huge numbers of people involved, we must come forward with ideas for improving their behaviour. We are anxious that a sex offender order may be handed out under the Bill and that that will be the end of it because there will be no further intimate contact between an offender and people in authority who may help him to cope with his behaviour.
<P>
	We support amendment No. 28, under which there would be a report to Parliament. In the light of our debate, when sweeping powers with possibly punitive sanctions are introduced, it is important that we should know the result of giving those orders to local authorities and the police. I hope that the Minister will respond as he did to the previous debate by saying that the Government intend to monitor the use of these new orders carefully and to report back in detail.
<P>
	Finally, we must ensure that we do not oversell the orders. They will catch only those who have already been caught so, by definition, a potentially large group of devious offenders who have yet to be caught may still be out there and not within the ambit of a sexual offender order. The proposal would be a useful weapon against those who have already come to the attention of the authorities, but we would not want the public to think that because sexual offender orders exist, there is no longer any danger from strange individuals who hang about in public places.
<P>
When we debate the next clause, we shall discuss the range of offenders against whom an order can be brought. In general, we welcome the clause as drafted in that it fills an important gap. It will be welcomed, especially by people who are concerned about children, because paedophiles who commit serious offences are a genuine cause for concern to any parent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> I want to contribute briefly to the debate and to endorse what the hon. Member for Hallam and my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said about the new clause, which is essential. It will be difficult for the Government to resist the extra protection that the proposal would provide. I shall be fascinated to hear whether the Minister will undertake to reconsider the matter and table an amendment on Report. I hope that he does so, because the proposal is intended to help the Bill to work better, and has the full support of Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members. I hope that the Minister will recognise that the new clause was tabled in the spirit of trying to improve the Bill.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, I looked very carefully at what the ECPPAT--End Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking--organisation said. We all want better protection, especially for children, and probation service support is enormously beneficial. During my years of practice at the Bar, I had a high regard for the best of probation officers. I know that the Minister worked not as a probation officer but as a youth worker before coming to the House. He has extensive experience which we have discussed in debates on Bills in the previous Parliament and in Committees on which both the Minister--then an Opposition spokesman--and I sat.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will recognise that the Opposition Members' wish to involve the probation service more is a valuable one. I endorse the Liberal Democrat spokesman's comments about the good work that memebrs of the Select Committee on Home Affairs have recently seen. I have recently joined that Committee and have only been able to go on one visit. On that occasion, those of us from the Select Committee who went to a project in south London were enormously impressed by the dedication of the probation officers. I have no doubt that similar dedication was in evidence in the other places that the hon. Member for Hallam has had the opportunity to visit.
<P>
It is important to give probation officers the extra role to which the hon. Member for Hallam referred. Like him, I have received a worrying note from the head teacher of one of my children's schools, saying that the police had issued a warning that a suspicious-looking person was hanging around. Such a warning letter puts the fear of God into all parents. Fortunately, the school concerned has a tough policy of ensuring that all children are met by people whom the school already knows. It will not allow children to leave the school precincts unless they are in the custody of somebody who the school knows is either one of the parents or is somebody authorised by the parents. It is a worrying matter for all parents especially those with small children, when such letters are sent home by the head teacher.
<P>
I am glad that schools take such matters seriously, but it would be an extra safeguard for everyone if the probation service were given the proposed extra role. Even if he cannot accept the amendment and the new clause today, it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us that he will study the matter carefully and return to it on Report. These are important matters, and I am glad that we have had a good debate. Clause stand part is a good opportunity to sum up that debate. I thank the Minister for the constructive approach that he has taken to these matters in debates on earlier amendments.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere gave us some statistics, but it might be helpful if the Minister gave some reassurance to the wider public. The fear of crime is useful in the sense that it prepares people to try to avoid the consequences of crime but, sadly, many of the offences that make up those statistics are not those which make the headlines, but those involving family or people who know each other, which, in itself, is extremely disturbing. The statistics might not necessarily be aimed at generating the wider panic that is behind some of the more recent publicity. Perhaps the Minister could reassure us about those statistics and the kinds of crimes being considered.
<P>
Perhaps I am exaggerating, but at times during this debate, I had flashbacks to my studying at school of ``The Crucible'' by Arthur Miller. Somehow, because of the heinous nature of the crime, there is a danger of dismissing concerns about the processes to be undertaken. It is extremely important to give reassurance that genuine steps will be taken. If an order is taken out against the wrong person, police time will be wasted in enforcing that order. The public's time will also be wasted because, if it is against the wrong person, the community will not be protected and the right person may still be out there without an order against him.
<P>
I should like the Minister to explain how the clause will work in terms of the community. The police will decide that somebody is a threat and take them to court. All the details involved in the case will then be in the public domain, which might affect the way in which the community will cope with the person concerned. How will the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 apply? Offences that lead the police to be concerned will be brought out in open court. Therefore, any protection afforded under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act would be removed, as those offences would then be in the public domain. The police might then face all sorts of further problems. They would be dealing as a public matter with something that in the past they might have hoped to deal with privately.
<P>
The question asked by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, about why the tough sentences for crimes of the kind we are concerned with would not act as a deterrent in the way that tough sentences for breach of an order are supposed to, deserves to be answered. That question hits upon an important role that the order could play. Deterrence is very much to do with a person's sense of being likely to be caught. Many offenders do not think that they will be caught in the commission of their crime, but if they knew about an order, and its potential sanctions, they would be far more wary of taking the first steps towards committing a crime. They would be much more aware of the chance of being caught for breach of the order. I understand the Government's reasoning in that context.
<P>
New clause 1 seems to offer hope rather than just deterrence, in that it aims at providing support. The Government should consider it carefully.
<P>
The tensions that emerged in the debate, which were the subject of some jokes from the Labour Benches about Hertsmere v. Woking and civil liberties v. tougher sentences, show how important it is that the clauses should be examined carefully. There are two sides to the matter, and the measure will not bring about entirely the tough approach that the community wants. At the same time, a start has been made on a different way of thinking about civil liberties. A balance must be struck.
<P>
I cannot help feeling that the Government need to approach much of the topic that we are concerned with by reviewing entirely the way we deal with sexual offences. I think that that is planned, and perhaps there will be relevant new clauses. Perhaps also we are shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, because nowadays the sort of sentence and post-release supervision that would apply to a new offender would deal with many of the concerns that have been raised. The Government are trying to revisit old offences that are technically out of the way, and find a way of protecting the community that was not thought of when the original sentences were imposed.
<P>
On balance, I see the need for the new clause. I hope for reassurance from the Government about how the provisions will operate. By Report I hope that they will have dealt with all the worries that have been raised.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to several hon. Members for their approach to the clause and their amendments. Extremely serious issues have been involved. I take the point made by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith). There is a balance to be struck between the important questions of civil liberties and of preventing serious offenders from repeating their offences. I do not think that it is unreasonable of me to tease occasionally if some Opposition Members suggest that matters can be dealt with easily, when it is clear that the strains between those two priorities are being explored by their hon. Friends--which is an entirely healthy process.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine also asked about a review, and whether different conclusions might be reached after examining the whole system of dealing with sex offenders. I should love the luxury of spending two years on such a comprehensive review. However, we are doing our best to follow the principle that the hon. Gentleman has put forward, by way of, for instance, the sex offender order provisions in the Bill, which build on the experiences of the past few months under the Sex Offenders Act 1997; the extension of supervision, which we shall consider later in the Bill; and the group that has been working on the interests of vulnerable witnesses. The latter project is extremely important, because of the difficulty in obtaining convictions in the relevant cases.
<P>
Those matters are all related and we shall continue to review them. We are also considering such topics in the light of the Utting report on children in care. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the issue is at the top of our agenda.
<P>
The hon. Members for Hallam and Hertsmere have made constructive remarks. I can assure them that the making of an order is not the end, but the start of it. This will often be one instrument within a series of events in the management of an individual who is seen to pose a threat. We are in new territory--that of preventing offending and reoffending and managing risk rather than simply saying that we cannot do anything until an offence has been committed.
<P>
I understand the problems that that raises, particularly when viewed with the perspective that the hon. Member for Woking rightly brought to bear a little earlier: is there a danger that we tilt too far in the other direction? These are dangerous areas but we need to work into them to make sure that we get the protections right on both sides of the equation. I reinforce the point that these orders are one more instalment in trying to get the whole picture right.
<P>
A number of hon. Members have referred to ECPPAT. I have had a good deal of contact with its representatives. I met them in Opposition and raised concerns and pressed the then Government about offences overseas on a number of occasions. They would recognise that we have made some progress, and applying the sex offender order to those convicted overseas goes some way to meet their concerns.
<P>
There are doubtless further improvements that could be made in the course of time. Although no formal arrangements exist for managing sex offenders who travel from country to country, informal means are in place through Interpol and the contact between its 177 members. The establishment of the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the National Crime Squad in recent weeks has added to the sharp focus that the Association of Chief Police Officers now has on these issues, as is demonstrated by the co-operation that it has given over recent months.
<P>
A number of things have been said positively about the work of the probation service. I entirely agree with what hon. Members have said. The report of the chief inspector of probation is an impressive piece of work and it shows the way that the probation service has been moving, working with the police service to prevent offending. As with the Sex Offenders Act 1997, I can also assure hon. Members that it will not be a question of getting this provision through and then forgetting about it. We will be looking at this closely at official level and involving Ministers to make sure that the implementation works well.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine was right to refer to statistics. We need to get these matters in perspective. Many people commit offences. By making the range wide to make sure that we do not miss people whose first offences may be less severe than those committed by others but who may pose a considerable danger brings in large numbers of offenders statistically. But it is a small number of very dangerous people that we want to target. The hon. Gentleman is right to alert us to the problem of bringing these issues out into the open in a court situation. We are trying to address the fact that the Sex Offenders Act left those who had offended previously entirely outside the reporting requirements that can be useful in combating offending.
<P>
That is why we have brought forward not a perfect vehicle, but a further instrument in the fight against offending and for the protection of children. We will review the orders and report our findings to Parliament. For the same reason that I gave on previous clauses, it is not necessary to put that process on the face of the Bill. It is likely to be earlier rather than later that a report is made.
<P>
Hon. Members will know from earlier discussions that I have some sympathy with what they are trying to achieve in new clause 1. While there was a considerable debate under clause 2 to the effect that an anti-social behaviour order was so draconian as to be treated as criminal for the purposes of the European dimension, it is now suggested that sex offender orders should effectively include probation orders, which are clearly criminal punishments.
<P>
Sex offender orders will not go so far as to require probation or supervision, but that does not mean that probation help will not be available. The voluntary involvement of the probation service has been there from day one in the cases of which I am aware. The police and the probation service co-operate, work to clear protocols and use their skills in the way that hon. Members have suggested.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Would the Minister go so far as to say that the Government will give every encouragement to the probation service to work with sex offenders on a voluntary basis?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for responding constructively. Yes, we shall encourage that. I have seen such work in practice, and it has taken place in some of the high profile cases to which reference has been made. For example, I have witnessed the work in risk management that the probation service is developing in Gloucestershire. I am happy for such work to be carried out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I also appreciate the Minister's remarks, and understand why he does not want sex offender orders to be equivalent to probation or supervision orders. Although the voluntary support of the probation service is helpful, will he consider before Report the point that the public will be reassured only by the automatic involvement of the probation service? I would be much reassured by the Minister's saying that he would consider that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman has not quite understood my point. A probation order is a punishment by the court. As was said in relation to anti-social behaviour orders, it would be inappropriate to introduce a criminal punishment into civil orders. I do not think that probation will be involved in all cases, but it is already involved in many cases, for historic reasons. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept what I said and the spirit in which it is intended.
<P>
Close working between the probation service and the police to ensure that the public are reassured that things are being done to protect children is at the top of our agenda. It will be possible to say more about that in future, but in the meantime, I commend to the hon. Gentleman a reading of the report by the chief inspector of the probation service, which was published last week. It is a useful document that gives an idea of some of the excellent work that is being carried out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> May I reassure the Minister that I did not entirely understand what he said about probation orders. Although I do not ask him to attach a probation or supervision order to a sex offender order--I understand why he said that it should not be made a criminal punishment--will he consider telling the public that the probation service will always be involved? That would reassure them.
<P>
I looked at the annual report on the probation service when it arrived in my post, and I accept what the Minister says about it. However, the public would be additionally reassured if they knew that a sex offender order would automatically involve the probation service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I was referring not to the chief inspector's annual report, but to the thematic on sex offenders, which is very specific. I commend that to hon. Gentleman, and I think that he will understand why it answers many of his questions. I do not see how I can promise that the probation service will be involved in every case, without making that a requirement. So I cannot give way to the hon. Gentleman on wording. Co-operation and proper protocols between the probation service and the police will enable them to pool their skills and target the protection of children in a way that will reassure the public. I pay tribute to the way in which those services operate in difficult areas.
<P>
I have said enough to indicate why new clause 1 should be rejected. I have said in debate that the sex offender order is an additional power that should be agreed by the Committee and stand part of the Bill. It will not be a magic wand, as a number of hon. Members have said, but it will be a step forward in the protection of children and vulnerable adults.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. I am not entirely convinced that it is possible or desirable to make a supervision order part of the sex offender order. I was pleased to hear what the Minister said about encouraging and supporting the probation service in their volunary work with sex offenders. I shall therefore be seeking leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
	I will raise another matter with regard to clause stand part. Will the Minister write to me about the defence of reasonable excuse? The burden is on the prosecution to prove that the elements of the offence are set out and that the offender does not have a reasonable excuse. Of course, that is a criminal matter. The only exceptions in criminal law to the prosecution's having to bear the burden of proof are in cases of insanity, express statutory acceptance and implied statutory exceptions. I invite the Minister to write and tell me in which category the clause comes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I believe that the hon. Gentleman is wrong, but I am happy to set the matter out in writing, and I will draw on available advice in answering his questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On the general proposition, I was quoting the words of the learned editor of ``Blackstone''. However, I may be wrong on the substantive point. To allow the Committee to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
(b) if later, the date of the commencement of that section.
<P>
 (13) In subesection (11) and (12) above, any reference to a person having been cautioned shall be construed as including a reference to his having been reprimanded or warned (under section 61 of this Act) as a child or young person.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 293 paves the way for new clause 3, which sets out our proposal for a drug supply protection order. We recognise the anxiety about the use of controlled drugs.
<P>
It is widely felt in communities, schools and families throughout the country. We are keenly aware of the mounting evidence of the ever stronger link between drugs and crime, even though fewer crimes are being committed. Recent Home Office research found a growth in drug-related crime. Especially worrying is the trend, acknowledged in a number of expert reports, towards a greater use of class A drugs.
<P>
In a recent written answer, I was told that urine tests showed high levels of recent drug consumption among arrestees, and that 61 per cent. of all those arrested had taken at least one illegal drug. I was also told that a study by the university of Cambridge, of drug use by samples of people arrested by the police in various English cities, found that a comparatively high proportion--18 per cent.--of arrestees in all sample areas tested positive for heroin or opiates, and that 10 per cent. tested positive for cocaine or crack. The answer also stated that those are costly drugs,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``often thought to be funded by acquisitive crime.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Nearly half the arrestees who reported taking drugs within the last year said their drug use was connected with their offending. Among various factors, they emphasised the need for money to buy drugs.''--[Official Report, 29 April 1998; Vol. 311, c. 136.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That information is very worrying. We need to use every legislative opportunity to do all that we can to tackle the growing link between drugs and crime. That is the background to the new clause.
<P>
The drug treatment and testing order provided for in clause 57 is the Bill's only other measure relating to drug abuse. I shall not stray out of order by dealing with that, save to say that it will not be available for another two years. In the meantime, we must do all that we can to tackle the link between drugs and crime.
<P>
We accept that treatment is important, but we believe too that we must deal effectively with the drug pushers. They spread the use of drugs and fuel the growth of drug-related crime. Sometimes, those people use drugs themselves and aim to finance their habits. Sometimes, however, they are very evil people who do not use drugs but prosper from the misery of drug use and from the problems caused to drug users, to their families and to innocent and law-abiding members of the public.
<P>
We are under no illusions about the scale of some drug pushers' activities. The public must be protected, as far as possible, from the activities of all the pushers. New clause 3 would enable the police to apply to the court for a drug supply offender protection order to curb a drug pusher's activities. It would enable the court to impose the same prohibitions as are available for dealing with people whose behaviour is anti-social and with sex offenders. The problems posed by drug pushers rank alongside those posed by anti-social people and sex offenders and could be dealt with similarly.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will say whether the new clause has any legal or technical shortcomings, as it is modelled closely on the Government's proposals for the sex offender order that the Committee has recently considered. A person would qualify for a drug supply offender protection order if he had a conviction for an offence of supplying drugs--those offences are set out in new schedule 1--and if he has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``acted . . . in such a way as to give reasonable cause to believe that an order . . . is necessary to protect the public from harm''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee will note that the new clause uses the word ``harm'' rather than the phrase ``serious harm''. I do not want to go over that ground, but the rest of the wording will have a familiar ring. It is very much on all fours with the Government's proposals for sex offender orders.
<P>
As with sex offender orders, we foresee that each drug supply offender protection order will protect the public. Such an order could serve a particularly valuable function where a drug pusher is coming into contact with young people.
<P>
The definition of a drug supply offender contained in subsection (11) of new clause 3 includes someone who is cautioned or convicted of a drug supply offence. As I have indicated, new schedule 1 defines those drug supply offences. The schedule covers offences related to the supply of drugs, which include those of supply and possession with intent to supply.
<P>
The new clause and the new schedule are legally sound. Should there be any problems in the detail, we hope that the Government will tell us what they are. Such problems would not be insurmountable. We hope that the Government will therefore accept our ideas, notwithstanding any technical difficulties that they may discover. A perfected model of a drug supply offender protection order might thus be proposed on Report.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We hope that the Minister is with us in principle, and that the Government will join us in sending the clear signal that tough action must be taken to curb the activities of drug pushers. The Government must recognise that schools, communities and families throughout the country look to Parliament to take action against the evil people who push drugs. The order would bring many benefits in that respect, and we can see no reason to oppose it.
<P>
The drug problem is alarming and growing very rapidly. It is fuelling crime, and the House must take action. The order is one way of doing so.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I shall speak to new clause 3 because, in the contemporary world of crime, only one word is important, and that word is ``drugs''.
<P>
If the Committee, which comprises 22 members, sits for 10 hours a week for eight weeks, we will have expended the better part of 2,000 man hours discussing crime. However, if we spent the whole time discussing drugs in a constructive manner, and ignored every other form of crime, we would still be doing our duty.
<P>
I can provide the Committee with evidence of the scale of the drugs problem that, although anecdotal, is none-the-less true. Perhaps 50 per cent. of all crimes committed are drug related. The burglars who appear before the Crown court in Camberwell for sentencing are frequently domestic burglars aged between 17 and 25. They would not normally thieve, but they got into the drug culture in their early teens, and are now dependent on heroin. They burgle three or four times a week not because they are interested in the goods that they steal, but because they need to sell them to feed the heroin habit. They must spend between &#163;400 and &#163;800 every week of the year in order to live. They make a pitiful sight.
<P>
Huge numbers of our young people face problems that I never faced. Many other Committee members--not you, Mrs. Michie, but those of a certain generation--never had to confront the problems associated with heroin. Heroin simply was not there. Heroin is the absolute killer blow. That is why, when the Committee is further down the road on the Bill, I shall introduce a new clause that sets out the appropriate way of dealing with those who commit drug offences and are dependent on drugs. Suffice it to say, for the moment, that the problem of drug abuse is acute.
<P>
I should like to flag up one other issue before I sit down. There are at any one time around 63,000 people in our prisons. In 1997, there were more than 20,000 random, positive drug tests on prisoners. Drugs are circulating freely in our prisons. ``Drugs equals crime equals prison equals more drugs equals release into society equals more drugs equals more crime'' is a vicious circle of which Committee members should be aware. It is the most critical issue of the decade for the future of this country. Forget everything else--look at class A drugs.
<P>
	In proposing the drug supply offender order, my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is doing no more than his duty in flagging up a very serious issue. The new clause would have a beneficial impact on the situation. Further down the road, Committee members should turn their attention to other aspects of the drugs problem, and I hope that we shall have the opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I endorse everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Woking has said. He has extensive experience of practice at the Bar and of sitting as a recorder.
<P>
	I hope that the Minister will reflect on new clause 3 and will present the Government's version of it on Report. If the Committee will forgive the pun, this is the acid test of one of the Labour party's main soundbites before the general election. All hon. Members will remember it: ``Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.'' As my hon. Friends the Members for Hertsmere and for Woking have said, drugs are the greatest cause of crime. The Government will be refusing a major opportunity to deal with that if they do not pick up the baton of new clause 3. If they duck this one, they will have to answer to their electorate--the people who supported them in May 1997--and to the entire British people.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Woking said, the Bill should concentrate first and foremost on drugs. That is in addition to the crucial issues that we have already discussed, such as sex offenders and anti-social behaviour. Important as those are, they pale into insignificance in comparison with the scourge of drugs. All hon. Members, regardless of party affiliation, know that that is the case: we see evidence of it in our constituencies every day. The point is reinforced again and again in our conversations with police officers, probation officers, magistrates and others in the legal profession.
<P>
If the Minister does not respond positively, he must explain what the Government are going to do. I know that the Government share our concerns about drugs. The Minister may say that new clause 3 does not represent the right way of dealing with the problem. In fact, it is a very good new clause, and those of us who have had practical experience of dealing with drug-related matters in the courts recognise that. We will not accept the usual excuses. If the Government do not accept the new clause, we must have a reasoned argument about it--if not in Committee, then on Report. I hope, however, that the Government will accept the new clause, which would strengthen the powers of the courts. As my hon. Friend the Member for Woking said, it would make a huge difference. If the Government miss this opportunity in their major crime Bill for this Session, they will have much to answer for.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office deserves a few minutes off, so I shall reply to this debate.
<P>
The Government have already set out in their White Paper on drugs the 10-year programme for dealing with the problem. We recognise the enormous seriousness of the drugs issue and the causative effect that they have on crime. Our White Paper ``Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain'' has been widely welcomed by professionals, such as those in the police, the probation service and elsewhere, involved in tackling the problem. They see it as an effective way of moving forward and as a genuine way of dealing with the serious problems that drugs pose to our society.
<P>
Let no one say that the Government have taken the issue of drugs lightly. They have set forward their strategy in a way that is not only regarded as effective, but have done so with widespread support and a consensus among those tackling the problem.
<P>
We are a little concerned by the way that the Opposition have put forward their amendment. They have done so in a general way and made broad and sweeping statements about the dangers that drugs pose to our society. We can endorse that. However, they have not sought to defend the new clause, and I shall be interested to see how they do so. We believe that drug dealing must be tackled effectively, but we must ask whether the Opposition's proposals are likely to be effective.
<P>
The police and other organisations, such as social services, deal directly with offenders and with the problems of drugs on a day-to-day basis. They also try to bring people off drugs. Therefore, it is a pity that they have not been consulted about the effect that the Opposition's proposals are likely to have in combating drugs. I accept that Opposition Members are serious in their concerns about drugs, but I wonder why they did not put their proposals forward for discussion with the police and the organisations that might have to implement them. That is the serious way forward, and that is how we went forward with the sex offender order. For more than a year, we discussed how it might be implemented. There was widespread consultation, and that is the proper way to introduce serious proposals.
<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) spoke of acid tests, so let us apply an acid test to the Opposition. If they are serious about their proposals, why do they not obtain the views of those directly involved on whether they will work? It is wrong to ask the Government to accept proposals without, first, having had proper discussion with those involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a moment. The sex offender order, which the Opposition's proposal mirrors, is an innovative approach to safeguarding the public from a group of people whose compulsive pattern of behaviour requires special responses to protect the public. Drug suppliers, contemptible as they are, are not compulsive offenders in quite the same way. The sex offender order is exceptional because, as the hon. Member for Woking repeatedly pointed out, it is an onerous interference in the civil liberties of the citizen. It will order the citizen not to do things that are not of themselves offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a moment. We need to exercise a degree of caution in deciding whether we extend the order to other offences, and there must be widespread consultation before we do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I will give way in a moment. However, I said that I would give way to the hon. Member for Gainsborough first.
<P>
There is an argument for saying that we should wait to see how the sex offender order works in practice before we extend it to other types of offender. Why should we stop at drug dealers if such orders are to be extended? One can argue that the compulsive behaviour of sex offenders is the type of behaviour that the orders should restrict, but serious questions about their effectiveness will be raised if they are extended to broader criminal offences. Effectiveness is the measure by which they must be judged.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We cannot accept the Opposition's proposals until we have the views of the police, Customs and Excise and others on the value of adopting the approach suggested. I would want to speak to Keith Hellawell, the United Kingdom's anti-drug co-ordinator. In due course, we may be able to look at the proposal more seriously. However, because it has not had that level of consultation and investigation, it has not been presented in the serious way that drugs policy merits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister took my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere to task for not indulging in the type of widespread consultation that only the Government have the resources to undertake. It is a novel constitutional notion to suggest that the Opposition should table amendments only after they have engaged in such consultation. However, an obvious question arises. Have the Government consulted Mr. Hellawell, the police or anyone else about the effectiveness of such orders? Has any effort been made to consult such bodies? The Government have the resources to do so; we do not.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is perfectly entitled to put forward a proposal in Committee to test the view of the Government and to set out the policy of his party. That is not in dispute. Nor do I expect the Opposition to put out each of their proposals to widespread consultation.
<P>
However, when the Labour party was in opposition, we set out a series of policies in policy documents and we sought to consult widely on them. That consultation produced many responses and the police and others were made aware of the provisions that are in the Bill. We sought to consult widely, but the hon. Member for Gainsborough has not suggested that the Conservative party has made any attempt to do that.
<P>
I do not question the right of Opposition Members to put forward proposals, but I want to apply to them the acid test that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath wanted to apply to us. I have an acid test of seriousness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> As I said, I will give way in a moment.
<P>
As I was saying to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, it is fine for the Opposition to introduce a proposal and bring it forward for discussion in a broader framework. We have done that in the past, and I would not criticise the Opposition for approaching an issue in that manner.
<P>
My criticism relates to what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath described as an acid test. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Minister talks of the consultation that took place before the election. However, does he not accept that the Labour party inherited the whole Bill from us when they came into government? It began as a Conservative Bill on which we consulted widely. It is a bit rich for him to say that the Labour party consulted widely when it inherited the Bill from the previous Conservative Administration. Therefore, it is appropriate for our proposals to mirror the sex offenders order and extend the provision to drugs.
<P>
It was somewhat cheeky of the Minister to say that he was not prepared to accept an acid test. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said, the Government should examine Opposition proposals to see whether they will work and strengthen the Bill. If they do, the Government should accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being cheeky in asserting that the Bill is somehow the product of the previous Conservative Government, who somewhat belatedly had begun consulting about some proposals contained in a Labour party consultation paper.
<P>
We can argue about the genesis of the Bill at length, but the key question is whether the new clause will take us much further. It is not clear--
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a moment. It is not clear what activities of drugs suppliers and dealers the proposed order would usefully deal with if those activities are not criminal offences under existing legislation. Anyone carrying, offering or inciting people to obtain drugs could be breaking the law. No convincing argument has been offered to explain why the new clause would go further than the existing law.
<P>
I listened with care to what Conservative Members said, but much of it was very general. The hon. Member for Woking was right to say that the problem of dealing with drugs was very important, but that does not justify the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The Minister may not be happy with the way that the debate could go. It would be very easy for us to send 10 or a dozen faxes of the new clause to people such as the chief metropolitan stipendiary magistrate, the chief of the Magistrates Association, the presiding judge at Isleworth Crown court, the head of the Criminal Bar Association, the head of the criminal department at the Law Society of England and Wales, the chief probation officer and so on. We could get answers from all those gentlemen by tomorrow night, with the result that the Government's view might change as the debate develops on Thursday and next week.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is really suggesting that that is proper consultation on a proposal of this magnitude, I find it difficult to take him seriously.
<P>
I cannot recommend the new clause to the Committee. I do not close my mind to the idea, which may be viable at some time in the future.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a moment. I am reluctant to do anything now that might cause difficulties for the police or damage the effectiveness of drugs policy. On that basis, I am not prepared to ask the Committee to endorse the new clause.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> On the Minister's point about the current provisions in law, could not an order be placed against drugs supply offenders to prevent them from being near schools? That would offer some reassurance to communities that children could not be tempted by drug dealers at the school gates.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There are other ways to deal with that problem. Such people could be dealt with as part of the mormal criminal process. The question is whether we need an order that would prohibit people from doing what otherwise would be lawful when they are not indulging in behaviour that we would regard as compulsive. The justification for the onerous steps that we accept are provided for in the sexual offences orders is that the behaviour involved is compulsive, unpredictable and of a type that needs to be constrained. Exceptional measures are therefore justified.
<P>
Are exceptional measures justified in dealing with drugs offences, burglaries or robberies? Where does one stop with such proposals? Conservative Members have offered no answers to that question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am very disappointed with the Minister's response. For him to close his mind to the proposal--
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I specifically said that I did not close my mind to the idea of the order proposed in new clause 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is a bit of an improvement. I do not want to be unnecessarily confrontational, but the people whose views need to be considered most of all are those members of the public who suffer from the drugs problem. We think that they will be in favour of this order. The answers that the Minister has given us are insufficient. In view of the lateness of the hour and the need to make progress, we will not press the amendment to a vote. However, we will think carefully about what the Minister has said and we may return to the issue in future. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 308, in page 5, line 36, after second `order', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or, in the case of a sex offender order, against the refusal of a magistrates' court to make such an order.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the Bill stands, clause 5 gives the sex offender the right of appeal against the decision by the magistrates court to make an order. However, it does not give the police an appeal against a refusal by the magistrates court to make an order. We think that such a right should be given to the police.
<P>
There may be cases in which magistrates--who may be doing their best--get it wrong. Given the importance of what is at stake, the police should have the right of appeal. The prosecution can appeal against the magistrate's decision to grant bail. We cannot see why the police should not have a similar right of appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The amendment would allow the police to appeal against the decision of a magistrates court not to make a sex offender order. That is attractive, but we think that it is wrong. The decision to grant a sex offender order rightly belongs to the magistrates court. In considering whether the order is justified the magistrates court uses the test that a reasonable man or the man on the Clapham omnibus would use. We are confident that magistrates will take this duty extremely seriously.
<P>
If magistrates err in law, the prosecution may go by way of case stated to the divisional court, or, if there is a procedural irregularity, it may go by way of judicial review. Where the police have been unable to make out a case on the facts to the satisfaction of the magistrates court, they should not be able to circumvent the court's decision.
<P>
In such circumstances, there is no reason why the police should not make a further application. These are not criminal proceedings--there is no double jeopardy. The police might be able to overcome deficiencies the first time their case was made by reapplying and putting the case differently. The right of appeal is properly limited to an appeal against an order made. For this reason I cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am disappointed once again by the Minister's response. He seems to have said a firm no and closed his mind to this. We hope that the Government will not live to regret that they have not given the police the opportunity to appeal against the refusal to grant a sex offender order.
<P>
We think that it is possible that judges and recorders in the Crown court might struggle to apply their minds to the balance of probabilities test. We do not think that is an insurmountable problem for them. We think that a right of appeal to the higher court is fit and proper.
<P>
	We have in mind the Government's own admission in their consultation paper that difficult legal issues will confront magistrates. In the course of our debates we have discovered further difficult legal issues.
<P>
We think that magistrates have been left in a problematic position. We recognise that they are dedicated people doing their best, but that they sometimes get it wrong. In those exceptional cases we think that a right of appeal by the police against refusal would be very useful. I do not seek to denigrate magistrates, or fail to pay them the respect that they deserve, when I say that I think that there could be a use for such a right of appeal.
<P>
Bearing in mind the lateness of the hour and the need to make progress, I seek leave to withdraw the amendment. That is no reflection on my disappointment at the Minister's response to what I consider to be a reasonable, if abbreviated, way of bringing the amendment before the Committee.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
