<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000252"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> How good it is, Mrs. Humble, to see

you back in your regulatory function.</div>

<a name="06071344000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">How topical can we be? I

struggled last week to find a newspaper story relevant to our

deliberations, but we are now discussing fundraising and the newspapers

have pages on the subject. I am sure that it would be a good idea for

political parties to follow the rules and self-regulation that we are

discussing today in the context of charities.</div>

<a name="06071344000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment Nos. 146 and 147,

which are similar, relate to the way in which the Charity Commission

may apply additional regulations and conditions relating to the issuing

of public collections certificates. We completely support the process

of issuing national certificates; it seems a good and sensible way to

tackle the broader spread of public collections that the Bill 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 262</div>puts under the commission&#146;s remit. However, I am concerned that

the commission should not get carried away when imposing those

regulations or conditions.</div>

<a name="06071344000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have discussed a number of

times the risk that regulations and other provisions might be rather

onerous for some charities. In my experience, large organisations would

not have much of a problem with the presumably well-intentioned

conditions and regulations that might relate to public collection

certificates, because they tend to have professional fundraising teams

with the time and expertise to look into such matters; indeed, if they

are wise&#151;or unwise&#151;the charities might even employ

fundraising consultants. The risk is that smaller or middle-sized

charities might find it a little difficult; when presented with the

regulations, they may begin to think that the exercise is not worth

while.</div>

<a name="06071344000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071344000253"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): The hon. Gentleman

said that they might employ professional consultants to look into the

regulations if they were &#147;wise or unwise.&#148; Does he think

it would be wise, or

unwise?</div><a name="06071344000030"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000254"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> It depends on the consultant.</div>

<a name="06071344000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The risk is to the middling or

smaller charities. Reports by the National Council for Voluntary

Organisations and the Charities Aid Foundation regularly identify the

trend for increasing amounts of income in some sectors to go to the

largest charities. There is a distinct squeeze on the middling and

smaller organisations which affects their income and their ability to

run things like national flag days or national collections. The

amendments are designed to counter that squeeze a little and avoid the

risk of our adding inadvertently to the pressure on those middling and

smaller sized

charities.</div><a name="06071344000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 148 is similar in intent to amendment No. 139 tabled by the hon.

Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman). Her proposal would delete

subsection (1)(e) from clause 53, which gives grounds to the commission

to refuse a certificate if

it</div><a name="06071344000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appears to the

Commission that the amount likely to be applied for charitable,

benevolent or philanthropic purposes in consequence of the proposed

collections would be

inadequate&#148;.</div><a name="06071344000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to

delete from the subsection the

words</div><a name="06071344000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having regard to

the likely amount of the proceeds of the

collection&#148;</div><a name="06071344000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">and

substitute them

with</div><a name="06071344000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having regard to

all the

circumstances&#148;</div><a name="06071344000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">from

the following subsection that refers to remuneration. We tabled the

amendment because there were several doubts about whether the Charity

Commission could properly judge the likely proceeds of the

collections.</div><a name="06071344000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland is braver than

our amendment and would remove the provision entirely. On reflection,

perhaps that is the simpler and more direct approach. It has a lot to

commend it. I would be content if either amendment were accepted. If

the hon. Lady wishes to press her amendment to a Division, I might

withdraw my amendment.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 263</div><a name="06071344000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"></i>The problem with the

challenge the issuing of a certificate for a public collection?

[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>]</div>

<a name="06071344000038"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000255"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman and, indeed,

all members of the Committee that they should switch off electronic

devices before they come into

Committee.</div><a name="06071344000039"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000256"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> That was an extremely timely

reminder.</div><a name="06071344000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first

problem with the clause is the worry that the idea of refusing a

certificate on the grounds of the likely proceeds is legitimate. There

is no suggestion in the following subsection that fees would outweigh

the benefits of the proceeds. It is simply that the charity would not

raise as much money as it thought it would. That is the only issue that

is relevant to subsection (e). If the charity was employing paid

fundraisers it might lose money from the collection and presumably

would not want to do it again in those circumstances or at least be

disappointed and not want to proceed. It is difficult to see what else

the consequences of being allowed to proceed with a collection in such

circumstances would be. The Minister is frowning. Perhaps he has an

idea of the

circumstances.</div><a name="06071344000041"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000257"></a>The

Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Edward Miliband):</b>

The circumstances might be when the proportion raised for the charity

is an extremely small amount of the total proportion raised and most of

it ends up going to the fundraiser. Subsection (1)(e) is making that

judgment.</div><a name="06071344000042"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000258"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, but I do not think

that he is right. That situation is addressed by subsection (1)(f),

which refers to the</div>

<a name="06071344000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;amount by way of

remuneration&#148;</div><a name="06071344000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">that</div><a name="06071344000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would

be excessive, having regard to all the

circumstances&#148;.</div><a name="06071344000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other

words, it would include the likely proceeds of the collection. The

Minister is nodding. Perhaps he would like to

intervene.</div><a name="06071344000045"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000259"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I am actually shaking my head. For the benefit

of the Committee, I shall read out the provision. It

states:</div><a name="06071344000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that it appears

to the Commission that the amount likely to be applied for charitable,

benevolent or philanthropic purposes in consequence of the proposed

collections would be inadequate, having regard to the likely amount of

the proceeds of the

collections&#148;.</div><a name="06071344000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

about the proportion being applied for charitable, benevolent or

philanthropic purposes relative to the amount not being applied for

those

purposes.</div><a name="06071344000047"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000260"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I still think that the Minister is wrong; the

proceeds, not the proportion, are referred to. In such circumstances,

surely the only possible significant cost not being applied for

benevolent or charitable purposes&#151;apart from having particularly

extravagant collecting tins&#151;would be the remuneration paid to

the fundraisers. However, that issue is tackled 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 264</div>by 53(1)(f), which talks about balancing remuneration against all the

circumstances. That is precisely my point: there are very few

circumstances in which one can imagine anything detracting from the

donation concerned.</div>

<a name="06071344000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under either existing charity

law or the Bill, any significant proportion being given to some other

place would have to be declared at the point of solicitation in any

case. As I said, other than the charity simply not raising as much

money as it thought it would, it is difficult to see the consequence of

issuing a certificate in such circumstances. In most reasonable

organisations, the budget heads would be separate in any case; in most

cases, 100 per cent. of the money from all public collections would be

applied to charitable purposes because it would go into the

charity&#146;s accounts. It is very rare indeed for any kind of

commission to be taken out en route. Commission is dealt with in

paragraph (f); what other costs might there be against the charitable

proceeds? Will the Parliamentary Secretary enlighten

us?</div><a name="06071344000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second problem

with the clause is the word &#147;inadequate&#148;. How will the

Charity Commission be able to judge what amount would be inadequate for

charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes? Payroll-giving

collections are often done in workplaces. I am not certain about

whether they would be covered, but the point is relevant. In payroll

giving, the cost is paid relatively up front and the proceeds only come

in on a monthly basis over a long period. In the short term, the costs

will almost certainly outweigh the proceeds.</div>

<a name="06071344000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those circumstances, would

the Charity Commission think the proceeds inadequate? Perhaps it might,

but in my experience, payroll giving, over time, is one of the most

cost-effective forms of fundraising, in common with other forms of

fundraising that encourage regular donations over a long time. Henley

management centre, which did a calculation of lifetime value, said that

if we imagine that the average lifetime value of standing orders

generated by face-to-face fundraising was something like &#163;350 to

the charity, the overall payback ratio generally achieved was something

like 5:1, an extraordinarily good return on the charity&#146;s

investment in that fundraising. However, at the moment of solicitation,

the fees or remuneration paid might outweigh the immediate proceeds.

Indeed, that is quite plausible, as some donors might cancel or not

pursue the standing order for very long.</div>

<a name="06071344000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such issues are difficult. As I

know to my cost, it is difficult enough for fundraisers to judge when

the proceeds are adequate; it is even more difficult for charity

trustees and generalists within the charity to judge, and impossible

for the commission to judge in any reasonable way whether the proceeds

would be adequate.</div>

<a name="06071344000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last problem is even more

basic: how on earth is the commission to judge the likely amount of the

proceeds before the collection happens? If the certificate is being

issued for the first time, there is no rational basis on which that

could be judged. A lot of fundraising is based on sucking it and

seeing&#151;on testing out a particular approach, creative line,

presentation of the charity&#146;s case or appeal topic. Until such

things were tested, we would not know what the proceeds were likely to

be.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 265</div><a name="06071344000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a multitude of problems

with the clause. As I said, I would be content for the amendment tabled

by the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland to pass; if it did not, I should

want my amendment No. 148 to be

passed.</div><a name="06071344000225"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

am</div> <a name="06071344000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

149 is a probing amendment that would remove clause 57(4). That

provision gives the Attorney-General the right to interfere in the

deliberations of the tribunal on public collections, but I do not

understand why there should be such a right. We have discussed the

Attorney-General&#146;s role in other circumstances as being in the

interests of beneficiaries, but I am not sure in whose interests it

would be were he to interfere in the decision to issue a certificate on

a public fundraising collection. The beneficiaries&#146; interests

would not be directly relevant at that point. Perhaps the Minister can

give an example.</div><a name="06071344000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

group also includes two further proposals from the hon. Member for

Bishop Auckland&#151;she has been an active and worthwhile member of

the Committee and has produced some excellent amendments. Amendment No.

138 is particularly excellent&#151;I wish that we had thought of it.

It applies to clause 51 and takes a fundamentally deregulatory

approach. The hon. Lady seeks to combine the process by which people

register for the commission and apply for a public collection

certificate. Clearly, not everyone would want to do that. There are

some trusts that would never contemplate a public collection because

they are funded by endowment, and there are charities that would only

ever wish to undertake small-scale or local

collections&#151;charities which would be exempt from these clauses.

For charities that are big enough to aspire to a national certificate,

however, the amendment seems extremely

sensible.</div><a name="06071344000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Lady has also tabled amendments Nos. 142 and 141. One is very

important; the other seems to me to be quite unwise, although the hon.

Lady may instruct me otherwise. Amendment No. 142 refers to what I

believe is quite a serious mistake in the Bill&#146;s phraseology,

though perhaps it is a drafting error. The relevant

provision concerns the right of the commission to refuse a public

certificate on the grounds that there have been breaches of conditions

on previous

certificates.</div><a name="06071344000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">At

present, clause 53(1)(i) refers not only to circumstances in

which</div><a name="06071344000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it appears to the

Commission that the

applicant&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071344000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">the

charity or the person

applying&#151;</div><a name="06071344000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has

breached any conditions attached to a previous public collections

certificate&#148;.</div><a name="06071344000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also

refers to circumstances in

which</div><a name="06071344000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any person

authorised by him&#148;</div><a name="06071344000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">has

ever done that.</div><a name="06071344000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us

take the case of a legitimate national charity such as Christian Aid,

which has a huge collection that involves many thousands of collectors.

It may inadvertently take on a local fundraiser&#151;let&#146;s

call him Michael&#151;whose ideas for collecting were not very

legitimate. Perhaps he offered rewards for donations, or suggested that

donations be converted into loans, or something like that. That would

clearly not be within 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 266</div>the rules of Christian Aid collections, and quite possibly it would have

be a breach of the certificate. It would be quite right for Christian

Aid not to employ that person as a fundraiser again, nor use his

services as a volunteer. However, the clause would allow the Charity

Commission to use that person&#146;s conduct as a basis on which to

refuse Christian Aid a public collection certificate for Christian Aid

week.</div> <a name="06071344000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,

Christian Aid would never be denied a certificate on such grounds,

because it is one of those big, well-resourced national charities that

would be able to argue its case effectively and would never really be

at risk. However, the provision presents much more risk to a smaller

and less sophisticated charity which might not be able to argue its

case so well and in which an individual collector would be more

significant.</div><a name="06071344000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not

sure that deleting the provision is quite the right approach. The

clause appears to have a legitimate intent&#151;to extend the

commission&#146;s power to refuse a certificate not just to a charity

as a whole but to someone continually employed by the charity who

breaches the certificate&#146;s terms with the charity&#146;s

knowledge. It is legitimate for the Bill to address that, but the

clause as drafted does not do it well. It opens up the possibility of

serious abuse.</div><a name="06071344000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move

to Amendment No. 141, tabled by the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland.

Currently, the commission may withhold a certificate if it is not

satisfied that the charity has acted with due diligence</div>

<a name="06071344000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to secure that persons authorised

persons&#148;.</div><a name="06071344000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a

sensible and important power for the commission to have. I am puzzled

by the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment, and seek her

clarification.</div><a name="06071344000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071344000261"></a><b class="B">Helen

Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): May I say what a pleasure

it is to see you in the Chair again, Mrs. Humble?</div>

<a name="06071344000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The section on public

collection certificates is obviously designed to even out

administration throughout the country of collections by charities. I

understand the problems that it is intended to address. However, its

drafting risks making the process extremely bureaucratic and

inefficient, and my amendments drive at that possibility. It must be

efficient and impose a minimal burden on both charities, so that they

need not spend a lot of time on it, and the Charity Commission, which

as we have learned will not receive a vast injection of resources to

perform its new

functions.</div><a name="06071344000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 138 suggests that we pull together the two processes. I checked

with the Charity Commission yesterday to find out the situation on

annual returns. It told me that every year, it writes to all charities

with an income under &#163;10,000 to check that they still exist.

Then it has different forms depending on whether a charity&#146;s

income is between &#163;10,000 and &#163;250,000, between

&#163;250,000 and &#163;1 million or more than &#163;1 million.

The forms are quite long&#151;between 12 and 22 pages, although most

of that concerns the information that the commission is seeking about

trustees.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 267</div><a name="06071344000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am making two simple

suggestions: the request for a public collection certificate should be

added at the back of the form, so that nobody has to get involved in

two processes that they could easily forget, and the information on

both processes should be kept together.

</div><a name="06071344000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment No. 140

to delete clause 55 is not on the order paper, but I would like to

explain here and now why I proposed it, in order to save time. Clause

55 is designed to provide a separate process if a charity&#146;s

trustees change. Although the public collection certificate lasts for

five years, a charity will need a new certificate if its trustees

change.</div> <a name="06071344000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we all

know, the trustees of medium and large charities do change. They are

regularly turned over. Every year, there probably someone new involved

in a large charity. Rather than having another process which will mean

that the public collection certificates do not last for five years but

in practice for only one year, we can cut out an entire clause and an

administrative process&#151;given that charities do say who their new

trustees are in the annual return&#151;by wrapping up the two

processes

together.</div><a name="06071344000073"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000262"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> That sounds an enticing prospect. However, would

the hon. Lady tell me if the form on which one notifies changes of

trustees is retrospective or is one required to notify a change of

trustees at the time it takes place? If so, would the public collection

certificate have expired by virtue of the change of trusteeship before

the notification was received by the

commission?</div><a name="06071344000074"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000263"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> As drafted here, the public collection

certificate would be invalid if the trustees had changed. As the hon.

Member said, the annual return is one in which what has happened in the

previous year is reported. That degree of propriety is not one that we

could operate in practice. Therefore I am suggesting that it is run in

a different way and that a subsequent change would be reported and

regarded by the Charity Commission as adequate.</div>

<a name="06071344000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned that the

administration of that must be smooth and up to snuff from the

beginning. It would be helpful if the Minister would say, for example,

how many charities he thinks will use that and what the capacity of the

Charity Commission will

be.</div><a name="06071344000076"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000264"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her remarks on

clause 55. I guess that we might be able to discuss that as a stand

part amendment and therefore we may return to it. In the meantime, it

would be useful to distinguish between the holders of the certificate

and all the trustees of the charity. I am not sure that the two are

necessarily the same and that every change of trustee would have to be

notified in those circumstances. Would she, as I would, welcome the

Minister clarifying that when he comes to make his

remarks?</div><a name="06071344000077"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000265"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> Yes. My understanding is that they were one and

the same. I am sure that the Minister will be able to explain if that

is not correct.</div><a name="06071344000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

other point that we need some clarity on is the speed of

turnaround on those public collection certificates. It is important

that that is a speedy process. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 268</div>The reason that this needs to be effective and not to have teething

troubles from the beginning is that, as all hon. Members will be aware,

many voluntary organisations run on tight margins. If, due to this

system not working, their fundraising is messed up for three or six

months, some of them could go under. That would be unfortunate and not

at all our intention in passing the

legislation.</div><a name="06071344000079"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000266"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. May I point out to the hon. Lady that she

is discussing matters that could properly be debated under a stand part

debate under clause 55? By debating those matters now, she may be

denying herself&#151;and other hon. Members who may wish to

comment&#151;the opportunity to do that in a stand part debate on

that particular aspect of the

matter.</div><a name="06071344000080"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000267"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> Thank you, Mrs. Humble. I will not say

anything about my amendment No.139 because the hon. Member for

Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) has more than adequately exposed all the

matters on that. However, I look forward to hearing from the Minister

on that point.</div><a name="06071344000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning

to amendments Nos. 142 and 141, I had in mind the same situation

described by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. As well as Christian Aid,

I am aware that Amnesty International follows a similar process. They

send out packs to their supporters and give them rules as to the way in

which the collection should be conducted. The supporter then collects

the money and sends it

back.</div><a name="06071344000226"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

am</div><a name="06071344000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is

concern about clause 53(1)(h)(i) and (2)(b)(i). We should put

obligations on voluntary sector organisations only if they can carry

them out, and it is unrealistic to think that a large organisation can

check all the people who support it. Clause 53(1)(h)(i) is backward

looking, so the commission might be able to prevent somebody who had

caused a problem in the past from collecting again. Paragraph (b)(i),

however, is forward looking, and that is totally unrealistic. No

organisation can simply rely on its existing supporters and collectors,

and it must always be looking for new ones. That is why I am also

concerned about the forward-looking due diligence

provision.</div>

<a name="06071344000083"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000268"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> We have not heard from the hon. Member for Isle

of Wight, who is normally a voice of reason on such matters. However,

the amendments are important, although I shall try to deal with them

briefly because we have already been discussing them for half an

hour.</div> <a name="06071344000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The overall

point that I should make relates to public confidence. We are

attempting to strike the right balance by ensuring that there is

sufficient regulation of public collections&#151;so that there is

public confidence in the fact that charities are raising money in a

legitimate way for legitimate purposes&#151;but that such regulation

does not, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham and my hon. Friend the

Member for Bishop Auckland said, place undue burdens on

charities.</div> <a name="06071344000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 146 and 147, which stand in the name of the hon. Member for

Cheltenham, meet the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 269</div>criteria of the aforementioned Cheltenham principle and are unnecessary.

Amendment No. 146 would add the

words</div><a name="06071344000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;although not in a

form that might reasonably discourage legitimate

applications&#148;</div><a name="06071344000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">and, to be

honest, it is not one of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s best efforts. The

commission clearly will not want to discourage legitimate applications.

It is committed to making the application process as straightforward

and as easy to use as possible. It intends to publish accessible and

readily understandable guidance to explain its approach to issuing

certificates. That is clearly a new responsibility for the commission

and it will be a big test for it as a modern regulator. The commission

will want to carry out that responsibility in a way that helps

charities to go about their purposes. The amendment is therefore

unnecessary.</div>

<a name="06071344000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 147 makes a more

important point, which it is worth explaining. The part of clause 52 to

which the amendment relates allows the commission to attach conditions

to any public collection certificate that it issues. That might sound

as if it will be onerous for the charity and to the detriment of

collection, but it might in fact facilitate the making of collections.

The ability to attach conditions will enable the commission to issue a

certificate where it might otherwise have to refuse one&#151;for

example, if applicants have been unable to supply all the information

required. The commission might issue a collection certificate, but with

the requirement that the information that has not been provided is

quickly forthcoming. If that part of the clause did not exist, the

commission might need to refuse a

certificate.</div><a name="06071344000088"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000269"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> The Minister may be misunderstanding my

amendment. There is no intention to delete the clause, and I am quite

content for the kind of conditions that he is describing to apply. I

simply want to add to the Bill so that it states that conditions should

not be in a form that might reasonably discourage legitimate

applications, even inadvertently. I want that clear direction to be

given to the

commission.</div><a name="06071344000089"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000270"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but I am

trying to explain the purpose of issuing conditions in order to correct

the impression that this is about a horrible beastly commission

imposing lots of horrible beastly conditions on nice saintly charities.

That is the impression that he has given. Having said that, if the

charity was under investigation, the commission might need to ask for a

certificate of accounts in relation to the collection in order to

understand the nature of the collection that took place. The amendment

is unnecessary. The commission will not want to attach conditions in a

form that might reasonably discourage applications. I hope that the

hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06071344000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 139 and 148, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop

Auckland and by the hon. Member for Cheltenham respectively, concern

the power of the commission in clause 53(1)(e) to make a judgment about

the amount likely to be applied for charitable purposes. Again, we are

talking about public confidence. It might interest the Committee to

know 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 270</div>that this power already exists under the House to House Collections Act

1939 and lies with local authorities, which have to make a judgment

about whether the amount likely to be applied will be adequate or

inadequate. We believe that it is not correct for local authorities to

have that in their powers; it is not a matter for

them.</div><a name="06071344000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is this

provision necessary? Let me give an example that might help the

Committee. It relates to an investigation conducted by the commission

in 2001 concerning the Renal Care and Research Association Ltd. It was

found that although that organisation had raised more than &#163;1

million, only &#163;74,000 was paid in the form of grants to kidney

research bodies&#151;only 7 per cent. of the total funds

raised. If the commission encountered an organisation with such a track

record, it would be advisable for it to be able to think about refusing

a certificate, on the grounds either of excessive remuneration or of

insufficient return to the charity. Obviously, the provision has to be

applied with a light touch and I am pretty confident that it will be,

but not to have this function, which already exists, would take away

from the commission the power to uphold public confidence. The amount

of money that is used for charitable purposes relative to the amount

that comes in from fundraising is an issue, so it is right to have the

function.</div><a name="06071344000092"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000271"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> There are a number of problems with what the

Minister is describing. First, it is difficult to discuss the renal

charity, as we are not really aware of the facts of the case, but if I

am right it applies to much more than public charitable collections. It

seems to refer to the proportion of its funds that it applied to the

specific function of renal research or whatever it was, whereas the

clause refers

to</div><a name="06071344000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;charitable,

benevolent or philanthropic

purposes&#148;.</div><a name="06071344000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">That can

include non-research. Virtually all the activities of a charity, apart

from occasional trading activities, must be charitable by law. Any

money that goes to the charity is, almost by definition,

&#147;charitable, benevolent or philanthropic&#148;.</div>

<a name="06071344000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only circumstance when the

clause might apply is when some moneys are taken out of the process of

collection and given to some other purpose, not to the charity itself.

The obvious one is remuneration but, as I keep saying and the Minister

mentioned it again, that is dealt with in the subsequent subsection. So

what is the mystery cost that is being taken out in the clause? What

are the circumstances in which moneys might be mysteriously extracted

from the collection and given to a non-charitable

purpose?</div><a name="06071344000095"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000272"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I think the hon. Gentleman is slightly confused

because the

phrase,</div><a name="06071344000216"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;charitable,

philanthropic or benevolent purposes&#148;,</div>

<a name="06071344000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">is not about a charity itself. It is

about charities and non-charities&#151;that is, those with

&#147;philanthropic and benevolent purposes&#148; will be able to

apply for a public collections certificate. That is the marginal point

and I want to address the substantive point.</div>

<a name="06071344000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are other costs as

opposed to the costs of paying a fundraiser. For example, expenses

might be payable to volunteer fundraisers, for fundraising materials,

or for transport costs associated with the process of fundraising.

Other costs might apply outside the specific issue of the costs of the

fundraiser.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 271</div><a name="06071344000098"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000273"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> One reason I did not speak earlier was that I

wanted to hear the Minister&#146;s explanation and, frankly, I do not

think it was very good. Money that is spent on flags, collecting tins,

transport or expenses for volunteers is just as much charitable as

money spent on fundraisers. That is what the NSPCC told me when I asked

how much it spends on fundraising. If it were not charitable, it would

unlawful to collect at all because all the proceeds of a charitable

collection, by its nature, must be given to the charity or the charity

is barred from undertaking the collection by virtue of its

objectives.</div><a name="06071344000099"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000274"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I do not think the hon. Gentleman is right. My

understanding of</div> <a name="06071344000217"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it

appears to the Commission that the amount likely to be applied for

charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes in consequence of the

proposed collections&#148;</div><a name="06071344000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">is

that it does not apply to the costs of fundraising materials,

fundraisers, expenses payable to volunteer fundraisers, transport costs

and so

on.</div><a name="06071344000101"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000275"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am certain that the Minister is wrong. I have

been a director of fundraising and I believe that all my activities

were charitable because I could not have been employed by a charity to

carry out those activities otherwise. The payment of expenses to

volunteers and all the costs he regards as legitimate if they are paid

by the charity are bound to be charitable. Again, I ask him: what are

the mystery costs, apart from remuneration which is dealt with in the

next clause, that would be taken out of the charitable collection

itself? That is the only circumstance in which the provision could

possibly

apply.</div><a name="06071344000102"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000276"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> There are two possible reasons for objecting to

this paragraph. One is that the costs that I described could properly

be regarded as charitable, which is the point made by the hon. Member

for Isle of Wight and half of the point made by the hon. Member for

Cheltenham. The other is that the costs are somehow described fully in

paragraph (f).</div> <a name="06071344000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

convinced that I am right about this and that the costs that I

described do not fall under the provision in paragraph (e) which refers

to</div> <a name="06071344000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;charitable,

benevolent or philanthropic purposes in consequence of the proposed

collection&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071344000104"></a>

Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but I think

he is wrong. If I am right&#151;I think the Committee will have to

take my word on this&#151;is there an issue here?</div>

<a name="06071344000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us suppose that there was a

collection for an earthquake in Iran, and &#163;100 was raised, of

which &#163;10 went to help with the earthquake victims and

&#163;90 went to the charity for its expenses and associated costs;

are we really saying that in such a scenario &#163;100 would be

considered to have been applied for charitable, benevolent or

philanthropic purposes in consequence of the proposed collections, and

that this part of the clause is therefore unnecessary? I contend that

that would be the wrong position to

take.</div><a name="06071344000107"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000279"></a>Martin

the &#163;100 is received, it is not then 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 272</div>divided between expenses and charitable purposes. Even if his narrow

interpretation of charitable purpose is correct, the money is

inevitably given to the whole charity. It is never divided in the way

that he describes, but becomes part of the whole charitable income of

the charity, which is then divided between fundraising expenses and

direct charitable purposes according to the SORP

regulations.</div>

<a name="06071344000108"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000280"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000281"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am corrected by the hon. Gentleman. The

expenses and expenditure of a charity is then divided. At no stage

would the pennies given into a collecting tin or the income from a

standing order be divided in the way that the Minister describes. That

simply does not happen. All the proceeds from such collections go to

the whole

charity.</div><a name="06071344000110"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000282"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000283"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I am sorry that we did not get to hear the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s second point. We will have to agree to disagree on

this. However, unusually for him, he is not living in the real world on

this point. The real world concern is that if money is raised for a

particular appeal, a significant proportion of that money should go

towards&#151;</div><a name="06071344000112"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000284"></a>Martin

<a name="06071344000113"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000285"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> If the hon. Gentleman listens for a minute, he

can then intervene. He should have a bit of patience. People think that

we should be assured that a significant proportion of money raised will

go to the relevant appeal. That is the long and short of this part of

the clause. The hon. Gentleman may claim and believe, with his wisdom

and expertise as a former &#147;Ã1/4berchugger&#148;, that his

understanding of the clause is far better than that of the

Government&#146;s whole legal team, but we believe that he is wrong

on this. However, I give way to him

again.</div><a name="06071344000114"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000286"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I shall attempt to be brief. For the record, I

have never done chugging, and I have lived in precisely that real world

for 20 years, and venture to suggest that I may well know more about it

than the Government&#146;s legal team.</div>

<a name="06071344000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second point that I was

going to make is relevant. Even with the ratios that the Minister

describes being applied to the direct charitable purpose, it still

might be worth the charity recruiting that donor, because, over time,

as the Henley Centre figures suggest, that donor might be worth

hundreds of pounds more. They might ultimately leave a legacy and be

worth thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of pounds to that

charity. That brings me to a point that I made earlier about the

Charity Commission&#146;s inability to judge what is adequate and

what is likely

income.</div><a name="06071344000116"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000287"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman has moved partially back to

the real world with that intervention. He asks how the Charity

Commission will judge what is inadequate. Obviously, it would consult

fundraisers and charities to establish a benchmark, but it is important

to note&#151;this might reassure the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 273</div>Committee&#151;that the commission would not refuse a certificate for

a first collection where the applicant has no track record. The point

of the measure is precisely to ensure that, in cases in which there is

a track record of large sums being raised but not being put to the

specific purposes for which they were raised, the Charity Commission

should be able to make a judgment. The power exists in legislation; it

is a power of local authorities. It is rarely used in the particular

ways that I have talked about and I suspect that it will be rarely used

in the future, but it is an important power for the commission to

have.</div> <a name="06071344000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings me

to amendment No. 142, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop

Auckland, concerning the question of a fit and proper person

and</div><a name="06071344000219"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any person

authorised by him&#148;.</div><a name="06071344000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Her

concern is about the possible constraints that could be placed on

legitimate fundraising. I want to offer her some reassurance, because

it is necessary that a fit-and-proper-person test exists. This next

point might be of interest to the Committee. The need for there to be

due diligence to ensure that the fit-and-proper-person test is passed

already exists in legislation&#151;in the House to House

CollectionsAct

1939.</div><a name="06071344000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I think

that there is a public confidence issue. I do not think anyone is

saying that Christian Aid, with its 250,000 collectors, must undertake

high-level scrutiny of every collector, but there may be some basic

requirements that it is worth ensuring are made. One such example might

be that a collector signs an undertaking that they have no unspent

conviction; it might be something very basic. I need to reassure the

Committee that I do not think that this will be an onerous or arduous

set of requirements, but it is important to have them in

place.</div><a name="06071344000120"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000288"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> Is the Minister suggesting that, as part of the

due diligence test, all collectors should sign a form saying that they

do not have any kind of unspent conviction? I thought that one thing we

were trying to do was to rehabilitate offenders and help people who

have had difficult lives, and that one of the routes for doing that was

through the voluntary sector. I hope that he is not, inadvertently,

imposing a new

condition.</div><a name="06071344000121"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000289"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I definitely do not want to impose conditions

and it would not be for me to do so. The Institute of Fundraising has

guidelines on what a test of being fit and proper should be for

collectors, and we can rely on it to offer us a way forward on this. I

do not think that there is an issue in this regard.</div>

<a name="06071344000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">That takes me on to my hon.

Friend&#146;s worry about clause 53(2)(b)(i), which relates to the

due diligence test overall. I may have not completely understood what

she was concerned about, but her amendment would remove the

fit-and-proper-person test completely. I am happy to give way to her if

she would like to be more specific.</div>

<a name="06071344000123"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000290"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> What would an organisation such as Christian Aid,

which as the Minister says has 250,000 collectors, have to do? When he

has explained 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 274</div>that, we may be in a better position to judge the reasonableness of what

it has to

do.</div><a name="06071344000124"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000291"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> As I say, the judgment will have to be made in

consultation with the Institute of Fundraising and others. The issue is

not about imposing large obligations on lots of different collectors. I

want to reassure my hon. Friend about that. The risk is not necessarily

associated with the largest organisations, but if there is not a

fit-and-proper-person test in the Bill, we will be left open to the

charge of undermining public confidence in charitable collections. I

shall be happy to have the Charity Commission circulate to Committee

members before Report a sense of how it intends to apply the test. I

hope that that reassures Committee members.</div>

<a name="06071344000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 138, tabled by

my hon. Friend, I am sympathetic to the idea that we must find a way to

ensure that the process of applying for the public collection

certificate&#151;I said it was a test of the commission&#151;is

non-bureaucratic. The problem with the amendment is that registration

happens only at the point of formation of the charity. She suggests

combining registration and application, but I am not sure that

registration is the answer.</div>

<a name="06071344000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other point to my hon.

Friend, which answers a question that she posed to me, is that in the

regulatory impact assessment, 8 to 10 per cent. of charities were

estimated as likely to apply for public collection certificates. The

problem with combining an annual process with registration for a public

collection certificate is twofold: first, only a small proportion of

charities may want to apply for them, so the danger is that we will

lengthen the form for all charities, even though only a minority will

apply for the certificate; and secondly, the certificate is issued for

five years rather than one. My hon. Friend shakes her head, and I am

happy to give way to her.</div>

<a name="06071344000127"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000292"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> I know that that is the formal position, but is

the public collection certificate held by the organisation or by the

trustees? Although the Bill says that the certificate should last for

five years, the Minister will find that if the certificate is held by

the trustees, they will have to go through the whole process set out in

clause 55.</div>

<a name="06071344000128"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000293"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> In the case of an incorporated charity, the

certificate is held by the charity as a corporate body; in the case of

unincorporated charities, it is held by an individual trustee, a number

of trustees, or, if there is a fundraising director, by the fundraising

director. Clause 55, which we may come to, exists precisely to provide

an easier method of transferring the certificate. We must face up to

the fact that there is an issue with unincorporated charities. The fact

that they have to re-register their trustees each year if their

trustees change is precisely a facet of the constitutional nature of

unincorporated charities.</div>

<a name="06071344000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend has raised an

important issue, but it is not one of deep principle. I undertake to

talk to the Charity Commission about how best it can come up with a

non-bureaucratic process. If it can be combined with an annual process,

it should be, although I have raised some doubts about why that may not

be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 275</div>possible. I understand that the form will be downloadable from the

commission&#146;s website. The general issues that my hon. Friend has

raised are completely

right.</div>

<a name="06071344000228"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

am</div><a name="06071344000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I want

to go back to the hon. Member for Cheltenham and his concerns about the

Attorney-General. Amendment No. 149 would affect a traditional and

rather underused role&#151;I do not think it should worry the

Committee&#151;of the Attorney-General as friend of the court and

protector under the Crown of charities. It would be possible to remove

that right from the Attorney-General, but I do not think that it would

be desirable. The power will be used extremely rarely, but it is

sensible to leave it in the

legislation.</div><a name="06071344000131"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000294"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> As regards a number of the amendments, the

Minister has made reassuring statements about the intent of the Charity

Commission and of the Bill. I suppose we will have to trust his good

and generous soul and the practice of the Charity Commission. I hope

that the practice follows the theory that he has set out. The proof of

the pudding will be in the eating, and we shall have to review that in

due course. On those grounds, I might seek leave to withdraw amendment

No. 146 and I would be content to see others not pressed.</div>

<a name="06071344000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 38, tabled by the

hon. Member for Bishop Auckland, sets out a legitimate, and cost and

regulation-saving,

process.</div><a name="06071344000133"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000295"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> I am grateful for the kind words from the hon.

Gentleman. I think that the Minister was saying that the amendment was

technically defective because I had confused the registration process

with the annual return process. Had I written in the annual return

process, I think that it would have been a better

amendment.</div>

<a name="06071344000134"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000296"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am sure that the hon. Lady is absolutely

correct, and so I am reassured on that front, too. It would be the wish

of the whole Committee to see the Minister address the issue of

combining the annual return with the application for a certificate. The

fact that the time scales might be slightly different does not rule out

the possibility of combining the two on one form. It simply would not

be necessary for people to fill in both parts on every

occasion.</div> <a name="06071344000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 148, which is similar to amendment No. 139, my concerns

are still there and nothing that the Minister has said has reassured me

that he is being advised about the real world. The impossibility of the

commission being able to judge what is adequate has been almost

underlined by the fact that he made comments about a ratio of income to

expenditure that would be perfectly legitimate if it was justified by

the future income.</div>

<a name="06071344000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is looking

disparagingly at his notes, but public collection certificates will

apply to standing orders. The standing order might be for as little as

two or three pounds a month. At the point of solicitation, it is quite

clear that if a paid fundraiser was involved, the costs would vastly

outweigh the income or the amount 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 276</div>being applied to the charitable purposes of the charity. Over time, that

amount would build up, which is why standing orders are a popular form

of fundraising, and would give the donor the opportunity to give more

and to give to emergency appeals. The Minister shakes his head, but I

invite him to tell me where I am going wrong with that

scenario.</div> <a name="06071344000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have had

responsibility for tens of millions of pounds of charity income that

was derived from precisely that source. Those regular standing orders

build up over time and form an enormously valuable and cost-effective

source of income for major and smaller charities. Sometimes they can

lead to legacies worth hundreds of thousands of pounds&#151;and

occasionally millions of pounds&#151;that can make the recruitment of

a donor to a good cause an extremely worthwhile process, even if at the

very moment of solicitation the ratio does not appear to be very

beneficial for the charitable purpose. That is a difficult judgment

call for even professional fundraisers to make. One must take into

account all sorts of aspects, such as what used to be called in the

jargon the attrition rate&#151;that is, the likelihood of donors

falling out of the standing order relationship at a future date. Those

rates and ratios change from year to year, as the nature of fundraising

and the popularity of different fundraising methods change.</div>

<a name="06071344000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is incredibly difficult to

see how the commission could ever have the expertise to judge what an

adequate application of the funds to a charitable purpose was or what

the likely amount of the proceeds from a collection would be, because

those are difficult enough for the fundraisers to judge themselves. For

the commission to have the right to refuse an organisation a

certificate on that basis seems a dangerous step. I support amendment

No. 139, which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Bishop

Auckland and I should like to press amendment No. 148 to a Division

should the opportunity arise.</div>

<a name="06071344000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 149, which

stands in my name, the Minister has explained that the Attorney-General

will be acting in the traditional role of protector of charities. All I

can say is that charities are lucky to have so many protectors in the

Bill. It seems a strange argument to say that we should support the

clause on the grounds that it will almost never be used; nevertheless,

I bow to the Minister&#146;s greater legal expertise. I shall not

press amendment No. 149 to a Division but, bearing in mind my remarks

about amendment No. 148, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06071344000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

would be possible for a local authority to restrict fundraising to two

do not seek to delete the paragraph&#151;it is an important part of

the structure of the clause as a whole&#151;but we seek to remove the

reference in subsection (4) to its generality not being restricted by

anything else in the clause. In effect, the amendment would restrict

the power of the Secretary of State to make regulations willy-nilly in

whatever way he chose.</div>

<a name="06071344000229"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

am</div><a name="06071344000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although

we trust that the Secretary of State and his parliamentary colleagues

are generous souls, it seems that subsections (2) and (3) set out a

comprehensive and legitimate list of the matters that may be prescribed

by regulation, and the provisions that may be made. They refer to such

sensible things as the areas in which the appeal can be conducted, the

keeping of accounts and the prevention of annoyance to the public. I

question whether the Secretary of State needs much wider powers, as

granting them makes almost superfluous the powers granted in

subsections (2) and (3).</div>

<a name="06071344000176"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000317"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> Believe it or not, Donald Rumsfeld is able to

help us. He talked a few years ago about known unknowns. He said that

we know that there are some things that we do not know. The hon. Member

for Cheltenham asks a legitimate question. He wants to know what it is

that might not be contained in subsections (2) or (3) for which the

Secretary of State would want to prescribe regulations. The truth is

that we do not know. If we knew, it would be included. The question is

therefore why we need the power.</div>

<a name="06071344000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman was formerly

involved in the process of public fundraising, if not as an

&#147;Ã1/4berchugger&#148; as I alleged earlier. He will know

that we need the power because the way in which public fundraising

takes place is rapidly changing. For instance, direct debit fundraising

essentially did not exist 10 years ago. The only reason for these

provisions is that they provide for flexibility in the prescribed

regulations, so that if the process of public fundraising changes and

it is thought to be necessary to take action in order to preserve

public confidence on matters that fall outside subsections (2) and (3),

we will have the flexibility to do so without recourse to primary

legislation.</div> <a name="06071344000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I

say, I cannot describe the ways in which public fundraising might

evolve, or what regulations might be necessary; if I could, they would

be defined in subsections (2) and (3). I know that that makes life

rather difficult, but even if my observations included mention of

Donald Rumsfeld, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000318"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I cannot help thinking that hon. Members and

those in another place may have enormous fun reconstructing the

Minister&#146;s suggestion that known unknowns should be the proper

basis for legislation, and citing Donald Rumsfeld as an authority. He

might find that lawyers will challenge the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 279</div>idea that it is a proper basis for legislation. I certainly would.

However, I am somewhat reassured that his intent is benign.</div>

<a name="06071344000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the Minister&#146;s

reference to fundraising being a fast-moving discipline is right,

public charitable collections are probably the least fast moving of

all. The way in which fundraising is done&#151;whether with cash,

direct debits or standing orders&#151;may have evolved over the past

10 or 15 years, but the nature of public collection itself has hardly

changed in 100 years. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071344000322"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> When we arrived this morning, it was fair to say

that the sun had got his hat on and we all hoped that later on we could

come out to play. The sun has, I am afraid, taken his hat off and

hidden behind a cloud. Let us hope that he comes out again later. It is



<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 280</div>pleasing to see you, Mrs. Humble, once more in your place, if

only for a few more

minutes.</div><a name="06071344000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful

that the two clauses have been brought together because that will make

for a shorter debate. I give notice that I might wish to press

amendment No. 131 to a Division.</div>

<a name="06071344000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 128 gives the

Charity Commission the power to initiate criminal proceedings in

respect of offences under subsection (9). The reason for that is that

in the past&#151;there are a number of specialised offences

here&#151;the Charity Commission has had the power to take action

against charities. However, it was not necessarily the charities who

were offending. Sometimes an organisation that is not a charity

purports to be one. The provision would give the Charity Commission the

power to enforce criminal sanctions in respect of clause 60 of the

Bill. That may not be the most appropriate body for the task; it might

be appropriate for sanctions to be enforced by trading standards or a

similar organisation. That is by nature of a probing amendment and I

will welcome the Minister&#146;s view on

that.</div><a name="06071344000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 131 is a requirement for information to be given, when goods or

services are offered for sale purportedly for the benefit of a charity,

about the amount of money that is going to that charity. It adds a new

section 60C to the 1993 Act. It exempts small outlets. I can see the

hon. Member for Bishop Auckland shaking her head. I am sure that we

will have an interesting debate on that.</div>

<a name="06071344000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Christmas cards are one example

of goods that are quite frequently offered for sale, supposedly for the

benefit of charity. I refer to a 5 November report from <i class="I">The

Guardian</i>. It is relevant that it is Guy Fawkes night on this day of

all days. Hon. Members might wish to consult the Guido Fawkes blog to

find out more about why I have said that. However, <i class="I">The Guardian</i>

said:</div><a name="06071344000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Britain&#146;s

high street retailers are selling charity Christmas cards which give as

little as 4p in every &#163;1 to good causes. A survey by Guardian

Money reveals that John Lewis Partnership and Fenwick as the stores

which give least, with one card on sale in Fenwick&#146;s swanky Bond

Street store&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071344000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">it

&#145;Scrooge of the year&#146;. Clinton Cards topped the survey by

promising to pass on 25 per cent. of the (pre-VAT) price on its charity

cards.&#148;</div><a name="06071344000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a matter

of some concern. How much money from a service or a good that is

offered for sale by a high street outlet&#151;although not only a

high street outlet and I have specifically exempted small

outlets&#151;goes to

charity?</div><a name="06071344000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2004, the

average charity Christmas card sold for 64p of which only 5p went to

charity. Boots have a standard flat rate of
