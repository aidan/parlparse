					<a name="07011843000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am delighted to sit under
your chairmanship this morning, Mrs. Anderson, as we resume
this interesting Committee on the Justice and Security (Northern
Ireland) Bill. Clause 9 deals with restrictions on disclosure of juror
information. It adds an important restriction to the Juries (Northern
Ireland) Order 1996 on the disclosure of juror information that has
come into the possession of various people through, for example, the
electoral office and their work.</div>
					<a name="07011843000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Committee members will have
noticed the significant penalty. Proposed new article 26A(8)
says:</div>
					<a name="07011843000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person who contravenes paragraph (1) shall be guilty of an offence and
shall be liable&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011843000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">to a
hefty fine or six months&#146; imprisonment, or indeed to both. The
penalty for any criminal offence committed in contravention of proposed
new paragraph (1) is severe.</div>
					<a name="07011843000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment relates to some
rather curious wording. It pertains to</div>
					<a name="07011843000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person who is or has been an
electoral officer or a court
official&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011843000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
paragraph (2)(b) means that an offence is committed only if the person
who is or has been an electoral officer or a court official obtained
the juror information</div>
					<a name="07011843000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the course of his functions as
an electoral officer or court official.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011843000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I dislike that wording because it is
ambiguous. It implies that the person was acting appropriately when
they obtained the information.</div>
					<a name="07011843000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment represents no
slight on, or criticism of, the staff of either the courts or the
electoral office. It attacks the Bill&#146;s wording, because it
implies that a person in either the electoral office or the court
obtained the information relating to juries in the course of his
functions. It implies that they have obtained it
appropriately.</div>
					<a name="07011843000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible for an electoral officer or a court official to obtain juror
information inadvertently, or of course deliberately, not in the course
of his functions, but in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 88</div>walking past a desk and appropriating it. I have tabled the amendment to
tease out the Minister&#146;s explanation about why</div>

functions&#148;</div>

						is
set out only in proposed new paragraph (2)(b), and not elsewhere when
it qualifies the other people and the work that they do in obtaining
juror information.</div>
					
					<a name="07011843000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000272"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
(Bridget Prentice):
						</b> It is a delight to serve under your
chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. You are always firm and fair,
although I suspect that the former will be unnecessary because the
Committee has made good progress in a co-operative fashion.</div>
					<a name="07011843000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have thought deeply about the
amendment, and I would very much like to grant the hon. Lady the
opportunity to amend the Bill. I have asked detailed questions about it
because she has scrutinised the legislation assiduously. It would have
been a pleasure to tell her that the amendment was satisfactory. Sadly,
that will not be the case, but I hope that what I say will reassure her
about why the wording is as it
is.</div>
					<a name="07011843000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
article 26A makes it an offence for certain officials who obtain
information in the course of their employment to disclose any of it
without lawful authority. The amendment would shorten the wording so
that instead of specifically referring to obtaining information by the
electoral officer or court official in the course of their duties, it
would refer to their obtaining it while the person in question was an
electoral officer or court official.</div>
					<a name="07011843000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for the restriction
on disclosure of jury information is that we want to give greater
reassurance to people who are called on to serve in the criminal
justice system, and, in turn, to promote greater confidence in it. That
is why we want to make the arrangements as robust and precise as
possible. The provisions have been crafted deliberately to ensure that
the restrictions apply to officials who come into possession of the
information in the course of their duties. That, of course, would be
while they were in their official posts, but the wording in the
amendment is less precise.</div>
					<a name="07011843000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can give an example.
An electoral officer who was in court as a defendant would not be there
in the course of his or her duties. Often in England and Wales,
electoral officers have other duties besides their electoral
officer&#146;s duties. It is important to define the provision so
that it relates to what is done in the relevant post, while performing
the relevant duty. Having considered the matter for some time, I think
that the clause gets the right balance and the amendment would not add
anything to the proposed arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07011843000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a final point, the
inadvertent obtaining of information would be specifically dealt with
under data protection legislation; there is already legislation to
cover people who either inadvertently or deliberately obtain the
relevant information by the wrong
means.</div>
					
					<a name="07011843000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000273"></a>
								Lady
Hermon:
						</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s presence this
morning. She has been in attendance before, but did not have the
opportunity to speak. Will she confirm that the punishment under the
data protection legislation would be equivalent to that set out in the
Bill&#151;that is, a hefty fine, six months&#146; imprisonment, or
both?</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 89</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000274"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I cannot give the hon. Lady the exact sentencing
guidelines for the data protection legislation, but six months, a fine
or both on summary conviction is a pretty standard form of sentencing.
I should be surprised if the sentences available under the data
protection legislation were anything less. However, I shall write to
her if there are significant differences in the sentencing
procedures.</div>

							<a name="07011843000275"></a>
								Lady
Hermon:
						</b> I am grateful for that explanation, but I am
slightly at sea in responding. I think that I took down the
Minister&#146;s words exactly and that she said that the provisions
had been crafted deliberately and were &#147;as robust as
possible.&#148; My concern is that the wording</div>
					<a name="07011843000217"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the course of his
functions&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011843000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">pertains only,
in clause 9, to an electoral officer or a court official. When the
provisions of proposed new article 26A(4), for example, were crafted
deliberately, and as robustly as possible, in relation
to</div>
					<a name="07011843000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person...who
is...a member of the police
service&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07011843000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">the drafting
was altogether different. The provision applies to a member of the
police service,</div>
					<a name="07011843000219"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who
obtained the juror information for or in connection with the making of
checks, in accordance with jury check
guidelines&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011843000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
similar to the drafting with respect to electoral or court officials,
with its reference to information
obtained</div>
					<a name="07011843000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the course
of his functions&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011843000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
somewhat bemused by the differences in the carefully crafted drafting
of the Bill. The Minister indicated that it is to be &#147;as robust
as possible,&#148; but one would have thought that consistency of
language between the lines of one clause would have helped to make it
more robust and give the appearance that it had been deliberately
crafted to be robust.</div>
					
					<a name="07011843000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000276"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> Let me clarify matters. Other officials are also
included for specific purposes in relation to jury checks. All those
officials are dealt with in specific ways relating to their duties in
respect of checks on juries, so there is
consistency.</div>

it on the record. I appreciate the Minister&#146;s point, which
supports the conclusion that I had already reached, which is that I
shall seek the Committee&#146;s permission to withdraw the amendment.
The discussion on the clause has been helpful, and I beg to ask leave

							<a name="07011843000278"></a>Lady
Hermon:
						</b> I want to make a few comments on the clause before
we nod it through. We have moved on to an interesting chapter on the
Northern Ireland 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 90</div>Human Rights Commission, and perhaps I can set out some of the
background for the benefit of those Committee members who may not be so
familiar with the various and numerous commissions in Northern Ireland,
whose numbers are growing&#151;we may be a small jurisdiction of 1.7
million people, but we have commissions second to none.</div>
					<a name="07011843000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Human
Rights Commission was one of the early commissions. One of the many
outstanding achievements of the Belfast agreement signed on Good Friday
was that it set in train the establishment of two statutory
bodies&#151;the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the
Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. That would remain an
outstanding achievement even if the agreement were to fall tomorrow,
which it certainly will not; now that the Democratic Unionist party is
prepared to operate the agreement, it has a long and bright future. The
Northern Ireland Act 1998 gave the Human Rights Commission specific
powers and put the provisions of the Belfast agreement&#151;the
international agreement between the Irish and British
Governments&#151;on a statutory
footing.</div>
				
					<a name="07011843000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we agree to it, clause 13
will significantly extend the powers of the Human Rights Commission,
which is why I should like to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to
it for a few minutes. The present wording allows the commission to
institute or intervene in human rights proceedings where it is not a
victim or a potential victim of an unlawful act and where no award of
damages can be made to it.</div>
					<a name="07011843000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry to be a pedant, but
will the Minister clarify the use of the word &#147;and&#148; in
subsection (2), where we again have a curious construction? Four
conditions must be met:</div>
					<a name="07011843000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) the Commission need not be a
victim or potential victim...(b) section 7(3) and (4) of the Human
Rights Act...shall not apply...(c) the Commission may act
only if there is or would be one or more victims of the unlawful act,
and&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011843000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
conjunction &#147;and&#148; appears only there, at the end of
subsection
(2)(c)&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011843000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no award
of damages may be made to the Commission&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011843000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister confirm that human
rights proceedings must be ongoing in Northern Ireland and that the
commission will not be given a free rein? That is not to criticise the
commission&#151;some parties are extremely critical of it, but I am
not. However, clause 49&#151;we will come to it in due
course, but presumably not this morning&#151;extends the powers of
the commission in clauses 13 to 19, beyond Northern Ireland, to
England, Wales and Scotland. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury and other
Members should consider clause 13 and the extent of the powers that the
commission will have in their
constituencies.</div>

appreciate clarification on clause 13 and the intended remit of the
commission, which is regional, unlike the Paris principles of 1991,
which are often quoted in support of extending the commission&#146;s
powers. The principles pertain to national human rights organisations
such as the Irish Human Rights Commission, not to the Northern Ireland
Human Rights Commission, which is regional. So will the Minister
explain the extent of its powers in clause

							<b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): I welcome you to
the Chair, Mrs. Anderson. I had not intended to speak to
clause 13 because I have two amendments to clause 14, although those
could have been tabled under this clause. I am concerned about clause
13(2)(c), which says
that</div>
					<a name="07011843000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Commission may
act only if there is or would be one or more victims of the unlawful
act&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011843000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">To save time in our
discussions on the next clause, I would like the Minister to answer one
brief question: is an unlawful act not better investigated by other
authorities? That is the motivation behind my amendments to the next
clause, but it might be more convenient for him to answer that question
now.</div>

							<a name="07011843000280"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Paul
Goggins):
						</b> I, too, welcome you to the Chair,
Mrs. Anderson. I shall respond briefly to the questions put
by the hon. Members for North Down and for Tewkesbury. We are now at an
important stage of the Bill dealing with the Northern Ireland Human
Rights Commission. As always, I applaud the work of the hon. Lady in
looking at the detail of the clauses. I shall look carefully at the
wording, to which she drew the Committee&#146;s attention, to ensure
that it is
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07011843000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady is right that clause 13 gives power to the commission to institute
legal proceedings provided that there is a victim, even if that is not
the commission itself. Rather than a whole host of individuals pursuing
legal proceedings, the commission could instigate a test case in order
to clarify a point of law instead of relying on individuals to do so.
That mirrors the provisions granted to the Commission for Equality and
Human Rights in Great Britain through the Equality Act 2006. She drew
attention to provisions elsewhere that will bring legislation on the
Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in line with legislation in
Great Britain. As long as there is a victim, the provisions enable the
commission to take on a test
case.</div>

will consider whether it would be helpful&#151;I believe it
would&#151;to include the word &#147;and&#148; between paragraphs
(a), (b) and (c). At the moment, the provision is not clear, and
implies that</div>
					<a name="07011843000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Commission need not be a victim or potential victim of the unlawful
act&#148;.</div>

test case under its own volition without there being a
victim.</div>

already has powers&#151;this is where we must be careful&#151;under
the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to assist a victim of alleged
human rights abuse to take legal proceedings and to support them
financially. It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate whether
a budgetary commitment will be given to the commission to institute
proceedings and test cases when it is not the
victim.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 92</div>the Committee stage of any Bill usually reveals an &#147;and&#148;

states:</div>

							<a name="07011843000291"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I suspect that there is little difference on this
issue between ourselves and those on the Opposition Front Bench. The
hon. Gentleman is right that, in practice, the commission should work
with other appropriate bodies to determine the appropriate body to
pursue a particular investigation. Working arrangements are already in
place between the commission and similar investigatory bodies. That
matter is best dealt with by memorandums of understanding rather than
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07011843000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment takes us a shade too far. These investigations and the kinds
of issue that the commission will examine are necessarily complex.
While we would expect agreement between the relevant bodies as to which
was the appropriate one to pursue a particular case, the commission
might believe that another body has failed in its duties by not
pursuing a particular inquiry. We want to leave in place the power for
the commission to pursue such an investigation if it so decides. The
normal procedure that we would expect is that when a complaint is made,
consideration would be given as to the appropriate body. Sometimes
investigations would be carried out jointly between two or more bodies.
The commission might make a considered judgment that another
investigatory body ought to have conducted an investigation and has not
done so, and therefore we wish to leave the power in the Bill for the
commission to follow that through.</div>

							<a name="07011843000292"></a>Lady
Hermon:
						</b> I am enormously concerned about what the Minister
has just said. There are other investigatory bodies in Northern
Ireland, such as the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Police
Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. Is the Minister telling the Committee
that if the Human Rights Commission, under clause 14(4), which is being
called into question by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, takes into its
head that the PSNI and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland have
not investigated a matter sufficiently, it can have a second bite of
the cherry? Police officers on the ground would not be amused or
entertained by that idea.</div>

							<a name="07011843000293"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> The powers in the Bill would allow that to
happen. The hon. Lady is assiduous, so she will have looked elsewhere
in the Bill and seen that terms of reference have to be given for an
investigation. There is also an opportunity for the subject of the
investigation to appeal against the decision to the county court.
Safeguards are in place for the person who is to be investigated. For
example, if the Human Rights Commission wishes to enter a place of
detention, there can be an appeal. The commission could not act
recklessly, but we want to leave in place the power for it to conduct
an investigation if it believes that other investigatory bodies have
not carried out what it regards as their
duty.</div>

Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mrs Anderson. Will
the Minister clarify a point? If the police had investigated and had

investigated or would that decision be
final?</div>

							<a name="07011843000295"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> If a complaint is made and the commission judges
that another body ought to have conducted an investigation and has not
done so, it can carry out that investigation. The Bill empowers it to
do so. The hon. Lady praised the commission for some of the work that
it has done in recent years and, on Second Reading, she made some
powerful arguments in that regard. The commission is a responsible body
that behaves responsibly, and it is given these powers so that it can
carry out its
work.</div>

							<a name="07011843000296"></a>Lady
Hermon:
						</b> The Minister has taken the wind out of my sails by
confirming my worst fears about what we are doing. He knows perfectly
well that the historical inquiries team was set up at great
expense&#151;it cost millions of pounds&#151;to investigate the
3,000 unsolved murders in Northern Ireland. There is also a commission
looking into the disappeared&#151;those ghastly, grisly murders by
the IRA in which the bodies were not returned to the families. Is he
confirming that if the Human Rights Commission decides that
anyone&#151;the police ombudsman, the historical inquiries team or
the PSNI&#151;has not investigated a matter sufficiently, it can
reopen the inquiry, so that we end up with a truth commission by
another name? Is that really what we will get from this
provision?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000297"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I honestly believe that the hon. Lady is
unnecessarily concerned. There are, as she says, many other oversight
bodies in Northern Ireland, such as the police ombudsman&#146;s
office and the historical inquiries team within the PSNI. If one of
those bodies undertook an extensive investigation into a complaint and
formed a conclusion, that investigation would have been carried out. If
the investigation has been carried out, then it has been done. It is
only if the investigation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 95</div>has not been carried out and the Human Rights Commission believes that
it should have been that it has the power to do so.</div>
					<a name="07011843000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that clarifies the
matter and addresses her concerns. There is no opportunity for the
commission endlessly to reopen investigations that have been carried
out. If other oversight bodies have conducted investigations, they have
fulfilled their obligations. It is only if they have not carried out an
investigation that the commission may
act.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000298"></a>Sammy
Wilson:
						</b> The Minister says that the measure applies only if
an investigation has not already been carried out, but that is not
indicated in the clause. We know from experience in Northern Ireland
that even when there have been extensive police investigations into a
case&#151;sometimes two or three&#151;the police ombudsman&#146;s
office will, for particular reasons, decide to rake over those coals
again. What in the clause prevents the Human Rights Commission, which
is trying to establish some credibility after a stormy period, from
doing the same
thing?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000299"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I draw to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention,
as I did the hon. Member for North Down, the other provisions. It is
only if the Human Rights Commission believes that a complaint has been
insufficiently investigated that it can carry out its own inquiry. It
is required to place on record the terms of reference for that
investigation, and has to give them to the person or persons who are
being investigated. Also, there is a right of appeal against the
investigation being carried out. While the clause extends powers, we
have safeguards in place to ensure that no frivolous investigations can
be carried
out.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000300"></a>Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> When I met the Human Rights Commission some
months ago, I asked what number of cases it deals with. I cannot
remember the exact number, but it passes on to the relevant agencies
something like 90 per cent. of the cases that are referred to it. If
the relevant agency does not then carry out an investigation to the
commission&#146;s satisfaction, is the commission able to take it up
again? That seems a ridiculous
duplication.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000301"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> Let us be clear about this, and I am grateful to
the hon. Gentleman for pointing out that the agreements between the
various oversight bodies work in practice. The Human Rights Commission
does not seek to investigate everything. If it believes that a
complaint is better suited to another oversight body it passes it on.
The fact that the Human Rights Commission might suspect that it would
come to a different conclusion would not be grounds to carry out its
own investigation. Only if the commission believed that the other body
concerned did not carry out an investigation that should have been
carried out, or if it believed that the other body had investigated
insufficiently, would it have the power to carry out its own
investigation, subject to all the safeguards that I have
described&#151;the need to present terms of reference and the
opportunity for challenge and appeal.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 96</div>
					<a name="07011843000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no doubt that in practice
a very sensible approach will be adopted to the arrangements, that the
agreements between oversight bodies will continue to work as
effectively as they do, and that no frivolous investigations will be
carried out, because of the safeguards in the
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000302"></a>Sammy
Wilson:
						</b> The Minister has indicated that he believes the
Human Rights Commission has not sought to overstep its powers; indeed,
he cited evidence given by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury. Does he
accept that in many ways the Human Rights Commission has already
overstepped its remit by commenting on the war in Iraq, education
matters, such as the ending of the 11-plus, and numerous other things?
That trend within the Human Rights Commission is already evident. Does
he accept that the clause provides an opportunity for it to overstep
its remit
further?</div>

Goggins:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman himself&#151;I give him
credit for it&#151;previously highlighted the Human Rights
Commission&#146;s commitment to being seen as a credible body in
Northern Ireland. I think he acknowledged that in his terms there had
been positive movement in that direction. We are considering powers to
carry out investigations, rather than to pass comment on matters that
may or may not be of interest to the general public. I ask him to focus
on the powers that are being given in the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07011843000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think
that the hon. Member for Tewkesbury referred&#151;not in great
detail, anyway&#151;to amendment No. 16, which would require the
commission to provide a reason for issuing a notice for evidence at the
point of its issue. I agree with the sentiment, although as the hon.
Gentleman will have noted and as I have mentioned, clause 16 would
require the provision of terms of reference, including the specifying
of a period in which the investigation must be concluded. That
requirement will be sufficient and I hope that he will be satisfied
with that.</div>
					<a name="07011843000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

								Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
explanation of the way in which the clause is worded. I remain
concerned, however, for the reasons that I and other Opposition Members
have given. As I mentioned, the commission often in practice passes a
complaint on to a body that it presumably thinks might more
appropriately, at that point, investigate the unlawful acts or the
other issues in question. The power then to pass judgment on whether
the matter has been sufficiently investigated by the other body puts it
in a very powerful position&#151;almost more powerful, in some ways,
than the police, for example. Will the commission have available to it
all the facts that would be available to the police, because it is to
be able to judge whether the police, for example, have sufficiently
investigated the unlawful act? I am very uncomfortable with
that.</div>
					<a name="07011843000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, and
having listened to the Minister&#146;s explanation, perhaps my
amendments do not fully address my concerns. I do not know whether you
are minded to allow a stand part debate on the clause, Mrs.
Anderson.</div>

						</b> Let me repeat that this is not an unbridled power
to examine and investigate willy-nilly anything and everything that may
be of concern to the commission, and the hon. Gentleman should bear
that in mind when he considers whether to support the clause. The
commission must provide terms of reference and there is an opportunity
to appeal against the decision to carry out an investigation&#151;in
other words, there is judicial oversight of the commission&#146;s
power to carry out investigations. Indeed, if there were any serious
question that the commission was being frivolous or attempting to
duplicate an investigation that had been thoroughly carried out

have a lot of concerns about the general drift and about the way in

it had considerable powers, and it could be argued that they are quite
sufficient. I am uncomfortable about giving the commission further
powers, including the power to consider whether</div>

Hermon:
						</b> In fairness to the hon. Member for Foyle, who is
not here to move his amendments, let me say that he diligently attends
to all his parliamentary duties in the House, but that he had to fly to
Dublin yesterday&#151;I know that that is no excuse&#151;and had a
commitment in Belfast this morning. I am sure that no offence is
intended to you, Mrs. Anderson, or to colleagues on the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07011843000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I oppose
the clause because I am deeply concerned about the ramifications of
what we have just discussed. We have had a useful debate so far about
what appeared to be a quite innocuous extension of the powers of the
Human Rights Commission. I am not a great critic of the commission, as
the Minister said, but I want us to be consistent and get things right,
and we have the opportunity to do so while the Bill is before us.

					<a name="07011843000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister tried to
assuage the fears of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury by responding with
what it is quite right to call the facts. The facts are that an appeal
could be taken to the county court where the commission has served a
notice on an individual and drawn up terms of reference under later
clauses. That is all well and good if a person can afford to take an
appeal to the county court, but let us think of the many police
officers who retired under the Patten package.</div>
					<a name="07011843000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">After the Belfast agreement, we
had the Patten report, and many police officers left what was the Royal
Ulster Constabulary&#151;I am, of course, married to a former chief
constable of the RUC, although that is not relevant; I merely draw it
to the Committee&#146;s attention to it. I am extremely concerned
about the situation in respect of the police ombudsman investigating
complaints of alleged police misconduct by serving or past officers.
Many past officers receive no financial assistance in making a court
challenge to a decision of the
ombudsman.</div>

dint of the clause, we will again give powers to the Human Rights
Commission that mean that the person at the other end&#151;the one
who is receiving the notice of an investigation&#151;is seriously
disadvantaged in terms of financial support should they apply to the
county court to get rid of the wretched notice.</div>
					<a name="07011843000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister is intent on
driving forward with the clause, I should remind him of the suggestion
that I made on Second Reading. We have a chief inspector of criminal
justice, a post established by the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002,
who can examine the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the police
service reserve, the state pathologist and the Office of the Police
Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. The clause gives extensive powers to
the Human Rights Commission, which is not accountable to, or reviewable
by, any other body, but it should be&#151;it ought, at least, to be
inspected. I urge the Minister not to tell the Committee that the
commission is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 99</div>independent and therefore cannot be open to review by the chief
inspector of criminal justice, because he knows full well that the
Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is also a statutory
independent body and that it is reviewable and can be inspected by the
chief inspector of criminal justice.</div>
					<a name="07011843000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The precedent has been set, so
when Minister defends the clause, as he will do, I urge him to assure
the Committee that he will seriously examine extending the powers of
the chief inspector of criminal justice, so that people can have
confidence that the Human Rights Commission is not off on a frolic of
its own trailing through past cases that have already been investigated
by the police ombudsman, the PSNI and various other bodies. I am
horrified at the manner in which the clause stands at present, and I
shall certainly vote against it.</div>

					<a name="07011843000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely that is a
Catch-22 situation. The commission has to investigate initially to find
out whether there has been a sufficient investigation. The drafting is
so woolly. The Minister is allowing the commission to investigate on
any grounds at any time. Is that not really the
case?</div>

Wilson:
						</b> My view of the Human Rights Commission is slightly
more jaundiced than that of the hon. Member for North Down, in the same
way that my view of the Belfast agreement is much more so than that of
the hon. Member for Foyle. The hon. Lady made the scurrilous allegation
that my party has accepted that agreement. She need only listen to the
hon. Member for Foyle and his party to know that they believe that we
are practically rewriting it. But I shall leave that to one
side&#151;I just felt that I had to rise to the bait that she threw
out.</div>
					<a name="07011843000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Human Rights
Commission has been in turmoil. It is a newly formed body with a very
turbulent first few years, in which it has shown no ability even to
operate its current powers. The commissioner left under a cloud and the
institution is still finding its feet. Under those circumstances, to
give it more powers is inappropriate and premature. As with all groups,
it is trying to establish itself and prove its worth, so the tendency
will be to push the boundaries as far as possible. Clause 14 almost
encourages it to do that. There is no restriction on the investigations
that it could undertake. The commission will conclude whether a matter
has been investigated sufficiently by another person. That is totally
subjective. There is no objectivity in it at all. It will be totally
dependent on the view of the
commission.</div>
					<a name="07011843000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
commission might see value to itself in certain cases. For instance,
some might raise its profile positively, whereas others might be
pursued owing to political push, or vociferous groups or
individuals&#151;that will be the tendency. The Minister said that if
anyone feels aggrieved that the commission has overstepped itself and
that a full investigation has been conducted already&#151; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 100</div>the hon. Member for North Down pointed this out&#151;the onus will be
on them to challenge the commission&#146;s decision, but without its
resources. Do not forget that the commission is backed up by huge
public resources whereas a private individual might not have any at
all. Police officers in my constituency&#151;it might not be just
police officers&#151;have found themselves in that position with the
police ombudsman. There is the same potential with the
commission.</div>
					<a name="07011843000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
believe that the commission has made the case for an extension of its
powers. The Minister knows that it wants to push the boundaries of its
powers as much as possible&#151;so much so, in fact, that he had to
accept in the consultation document that much of what it asked to be
included in the Bill could not be accepted because it went beyond what
the Government see as its remit. I suspect that having turned down some
of its milder requests for the extension of its powers, the Government
have thrown the provisions before us as a sop to the commission. The
decision to include them in the Bill should not have been made on that
basis and, therefore, we will join the hon. Member for North Down in
opposing clause
14.</div>

unlimited funds, which few people have. I remain concerned about the
extent of the powers that commission has, and indeed seeks.</div>
					<a name="07011843000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the documents that the
commission sent presumably to all hon. Members on the Committee, it
complains that clause 14 also severely limits the capacity of the
commission to investigate anything connected with national security. My
goodness, should a human rights commission be investigating matters of
national security? It should not, but that is its drive. The Minister
does not want it to happen, but the commission certainly
does.</div>

Human Rights Commission had issued a notice about an investigation to
an individual, they would be entitled to legal aid, subject to the
usual merits and means test that would apply to any legal aid
application in any proceedings. However, it is important to remember
that in most cases, the commission will investigate not individuals but
organisations. That will be the normal type of investigation. The idea
of the commission harassing and haranguing the penniless person is
inaccurate.</div>

they as an individual would be able to apply for legal aid and they
would have the wherewithal to counter the commission&#146;s notice. I
shall confirm that point to my satisfaction, and if turns out to be
untrue I shall write to hon. Members to make them aware. For the most
part, however, the commission will investigate organisations and the
issue will not arise.</div>

extensive Bill stating that the commission will mostly investigate
organisations? Is there anything in the Bill to support the claim?
Without repeating what I have just pointed out to the Minister, the
vast majority of retired police officers on their pensions will not
qualify for legal aid. That was the problem when we discussed
investigations by the police ombudsman. Such an investigation is an
enormous ordeal, and to come through it and have it reopened without
the assistance of legal aid&#151;despite reassurances to the
Committee&#151;by an unaccountable Northern Ireland Human Rights
Commission is unacceptable and
unreasonable.</div>

						</b> It is unusual for the hon. Lady to paint an
exaggerated picture, but with that argument I fear that she has. I have
already assured the Committee, and I shall offer the following
reassurance to her: an individual or organisation that has been through
the investigation she describes would have undergone a thorough
investigation, so in practice the commission would have no ground on
which to conduct its inquiry and investigation. The investigation would
already have been carried out thoroughly. If someone has been subjected
to a thorough and long-running investigation, it is highly unlikely
that the Human Rights Commission would reopen it. That would just not
occur in real life, and I suggest that the hon. Lady is painting a
slightly exaggerated
picture.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman made that point earlier.
Clearly, the commission must have grounds for believing that an
investigation was insufficient. I have said that that is subject to
terms of reference being drawn up, and to appeal. A safeguard is in
place to ensure that frivolous inquiry does not take
place.</div>
					<a name="07011843000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman brings us to the nub of the issue. The Human Rights
Commission is independent, so there must be a point at which it is free
to make its own judgment and decisions, and to carry out its own
investigations. If it is not truly independent, it cannot be trusted
absolutely to do the job that we expect it to do. Of course, there are
restrictions in place&#151;for example, in relation to national
security&#151;and there are safeguards in the terms of reference and
appeals.</div>
					<a name="07011843000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">There must be
an element of independence. We may not always like the investigations
that are carried out or the conclusions that are reached, but the
commission must have that so that it has credibility for the public
generally. Being able to make a judgment on whether there has been
sufficient investigation is a firm guarantee of an overall system of
scrutiny in Northern Ireland that is fit for purpose and does the
job.</div>

cases, the conclusion when an investigation had already been carried
out would be that a sufficient investigation had been carried out, thus

the ombudsman and so on. The provision is a guarantee that the
oversight system works in
practice.</div>
					<a name="07011843000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that hon. Members in Northern Ireland and others will be assiduous in
asking questions about how many investigations are carried out and so
on, and the commission will publish its own reports so we will be able
to see how the system works in practice. I believe that it will be
independent, albeit with greater powers that will occasionally enable
it to carry out an investigation, but for the most part it will offer a
guarantee that the overall system works
effectively.</div>

commission by someone in prison about something that had happened
there, it would immediately refer the matter to the prisoner ombudsman.
That would be the appropriate oversight person to carry out the
investigation. If subsequently&#151;perhaps six months
later&#151;the prisoner contacted the commission saying, &#147;I
was in touch with you. You recommended that the prisoner ombudsman
carry out the investigation, but he has never been in touch with
me,&#148; the commission would first inquire of the ombudsman why the
investigation was not carried out. If the ombudsman said, &#147;Well,
I had a look at it and decided not to do so,&#148; and the commission
felt that there were grounds for an investigation, it could
investigate.</div>

a little progress. I reassure the hon. Member for North Down, who at
least once&#151;twice, I think&#151;mentioned the prospect of
retired police officers being investigating by the Human Rights
Commission when they had already been the subject of other
investigations. The Bill includes a start date of January 2008, so the
prospect of such retired officers being subjected to investigation by
the commission does not arise. The commission is not part of the
criminal justice system and therefore it is not appropriate that it
should be under the scrutiny of an inspectorate. That is a simple
matter of fact.</div>
					<a name="07011843000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
briefly to allude to one or possible arguments in relation to other
propositions that might have been made. It is very important&#151;we
have included a relevant provision in the Bill&#151;that the Human
Rights Commission cannot force people to produce information that other
legislation prevents them from providing. For example, if someone is
prevented under data protection legislation from providing information,
the Human Rights Commission cannot compel that person to provide it.
The Bill makes that
clear.</div>
					<a name="07011843000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">We spent
considerable time explaining to the hon. Member for Foyle why we wanted
to retain limited rights of appeal, whereas he encouraged the Committee
to press for broader rights of appeal, and I am intrigued to note that
some of his amendments would have removed rights of appeal altogether.
I have made clear to the Committee the importance of a right of appeal
against the issue of a notice, to preserve the right balance.</div>
					<a name="07011843000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is of course important that
the Human Rights Commission cannot be in a position to compel the
prosecution services, for example, to provide information. The
prosecution service must make a judgment and it would be wrong for it
to be forced to bring information about the decision in question before
the Human Rights
Commission.</div>

the Human Rights Commission&#151;that it is seen as a fairly partisan
body with which those on the nationalist side would have more sympathy
and which they would regard as more sympathetic to their point of view
than to others. I suspect that that is why the hon. Member for Foyle,

						</b> We can only speculate about arguments that might
have been put to the Committee. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 104</div>However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that we need to
arrive at a point in Northern Ireland at which all the relevant
bodies&#151;whether the Human Rights Commission or the Police Service
of Northern Ireland&#151;serve the interest of all communities there,
and are perceived to be doing so.</div>
					<a name="07011843000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, the fines in the
clause are appropriate. Furthermore, it is important that we have an
exclusion for matters of national security intelligence because it
would be quite wrong if the commission were in a position to force
intelligence to be passed into its hands and into the public domain. It
is therefore important that we have the relevant restriction in
place.</div>

							<a name="07011843000347"></a>Mr.
Reid:
						</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
this morning, Mrs. Anderson.</div>
					<a name="07011843000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would allow the
commission to start investigations when the Bill comes into effect,
rather than on 1 January 2008, as laid down in the clause. On Second
Reading, we raised concerns about the clause preventing the commission
from using its new power to compel evidence retrospectively, except in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 105</div>situations existing on, or arising after, 1 January 2008. The commission
will be prevented from investigating anything that has already happened
or which may happen in the rest of the current year.</div>
					<a name="07011843000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause will prevent the
commission from compelling evidence or accessing a place of detention
for the purpose of investigating any matter relating to the period
before 1 January 2008. The commission could not, for example, require
the production of any document created before that date, even if it was
directly relevant to a human rights violation that existed on or after
1 January 2008. That is an unnecessary restriction.</div>
					<a name="07011843000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of the time limit is
particularly severe in relation to gathering evidence. It is difficult
to imagine how any alleged human rights violation could effectively be
investigated without looking to events and information in the time
leading up to it. In practice, it could be a considerable time after 1
January 2008 before the commission could effectively use its
powers.</div>
				
					<a name="07011843000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause creates a notable
anomaly in relation to the protection of human rights in Northern
Ireland, as opposed to other jurisdictions in the UK. In Great Britain,
the existing equality bodies already have powers to compel evidence,
and the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights acquired similar
powers under the Equality Act 2006.</div>
					<a name="07011843000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Scottish Commission for
Human Rights Act 2006 contains not only evidence powers, but a
right of entry to places of detention without any time restrictions.
Thus in England, Scotland and Wales, the equivalent bodies of the
Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission have and will have powers with
no arbitrary time limit. The same is also the case in the Republic of
Ireland, where the Irish Human Rights Commission, which was established
in parallel with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission as a
result of the Belfast agreement, has extensive powers to compel
evidence with no such time limit. The agreement, and the corresponding
treaty, committed the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland to
maintaining an equivalent level of protection of human rights in
Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic.</div>
					<a name="07011843000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
regard to the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, the
Committee will want to consider whether, in the interests of
normalisation, confidence building and conflict resolution are served
better by enabling or blocking the investigation of past human rights
violations. The commission&#146;s primary focus should always be on
preventing such abuses, but its effectiveness in that regard,
particularly in relation to its credibility with public authorities, is
hardly enhanced by fettering its discretion as to what it may or may
not investigate.</div>
					<a name="07011843000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
have said before, the treatment of other oversight bodies is
illuminating. The Commission for Equality and Human Rights, established
under the Equality Act 2006, has powers to investigate with no
limitations on timing. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland has
numerous powers of investigation that are not subject to limitation
based on the time at which the matter being investigated arose. The
Commissioner for Children and Young People (Northern Ireland) Order
2003 specifically applies, in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 106</div>article 27, to matters that come before it. We should also consider the
RUC (Complaints, etc.) Regulations 2001. However, under regulation 6,
in cases where a police officer may have committed an offence or may be
subject to disciplinary proceedings, the ombudsman has discretion if
she believes that the matter should be investigated because of the
gravity of the matter or the exceptional circumstances. In suitably
grave matters, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland investigates
matters stretching back to the
1970s.</div>
					<a name="07011843000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 19
serves no useful purpose in terms of the protection of human rights and
should either be left out or amended. Our amendment would mean that the
powers under clause 19 would come into effect with the passing of the
Bill. I see no reason for the delay until January 2008. It is not just
investigations after 1 January 2008 that would be hindered.
Investigations after that date would be hindered by the clause, because
the commission would not be able to acquire documents created before
that date.</div>
					<a name="07011843000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
reservations about the clause as a whole, but it could be improved by
bringing forward the implementation date from 1 January 2008 to the
date when the Bill comes into
effect.</div>
					
					<a name="07011843000193"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000348"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I will not detain the Committee long on this
issue. The Committee will be aware of the bodies and public inquiries
in existence in Northern Ireland, which look back into history and try
to deal with matters. There is the historical inquiries team within the
PSNI, the police ombudsman and so on. My right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State is clear that the new powers that we are giving to
the Human Rights Commission should be forward looking. That is why we
set the start date of 1 January 2008.</div>
					<a name="07011843000194"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">There is a
technical flaw with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal. He seeks to
delete the date of 1 January 2008 in one part of the clause but leaves
it in subsection (3)<i class="I">. </i>He might want to reflect on that when
deciding whether to withdraw his amendment.</div>
					<a name="07011843000195"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">Since Second
Reading there has been some discussion between my right hon. Friend and
the Human Rights Commission, not with a view to opening up endless
investigations into the past, but about some concerns of the commission
about conducting its present business because of the implementation
date that we have set. We are giving that matter some
consideration.</div>
					<a name="07011843000196"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">I have listened
to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s arguments and if we decide to make any

&#147;necessary&#148; used rather than &#147;reasonable&#148;,

Goggins:
						</b> It is always an interesting stage in Committee
when we start debating the difference between words like
&#147;reasonable&#148; and &#147;necessary&#148;. However, the
hon. Gentleman makes an important point. For the understanding of the
court, &#147;necessary&#148; has a better and clearer meaning than
&#147;reasonable&#148;. &#147;Reasonable&#148; would cast the
mind over a wider range of circumstances, and the important point is
that the provision takes into account the mind of the officer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 108</div>when they make their decision to carry out their actions. Their mind
cannot lack certainty or clarity when they make that decision. If they
were to make a decision that turns out to have been unnecessary, it
would be discovered in due course and they would have to face up to the
consequences. &#147;Necessary&#148; is clearer in law than
&#147;reasonable&#148;, and we want to provide for certainty in
such circumstances.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011843000354"></a>Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> The Minister knows that
&#147;reasonable&#148; is the most important word in the legal
system, because, as we discussed in a previous sitting, the man on the
Clapham omnibus uses it to determine what is reasonable. We cannot
discard the word; it is in almost if not every Bill that we pass. Why
is &#147;necessary&#148; used here? If we consider the matter in
terms of the person being stopped, &#147;necessary&#148; means
potentially forever.</div>

							<a name="07011843000355"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about
&#147;reasonable&#148; and its significance, but he must consider a
situation in which an officer has to make a decision about whether to
stop and question an individual. The certainty provided by
&#147;necessary&#148; enables the officer to make a quick decision,
which they will need to make in the circumstances.
&#147;Reasonable&#148; would cause them to reflect longer in order
to satisfy themselves that their actions were reasonable. In that
period something may happen: the person may disappear or an event may
take place. We seek to provide for certainty in the mind of the officer
when they make that decision. &#147;Necessary&#148; does so;
&#147;reasonable&#148; would make for wider
consideration.</div>
