<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock.-[Mr. Morley.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Sayeed. I was much surprised when I walked in this morning to see my tennis partner of last week in the Chair. I hope that that fact will not lend any bias to those of us in Opposition; I am sure that it will not. You played extremely well last week and I look forward to playing with you in future.

<P>
It has come to my knowledge that, because the Government did not move a motion on the Floor of the House, they are not allowed to propose a sittings motion that involves us sitting this afternoon. Could we have a ruling on that, Mr. Sayeed?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is correct. We shall not sit this afternoon.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> But the motion says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>at half past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why has that not been changed?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Standing Orders prohibit sitting twice on the first day. After the recess, we shall sit twice on Tuesdays and have a single meeting at 9 o'clock on Thursdays.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful for the clarification. The Minister is proposing that we meet this morning until
 1 o'clock, and that, if we do not complete our business today, we reconvene at 9 o'clock on Thursday morning.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley):</B> Not this Thursday; the next sitting will be on the Tuesday following the recess.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am puzzled.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can help. The motion is for the general process of the Bill in Committee, but the sitting for today is carried under the Standing Orders, which permit only one sitting today. I am not clear whether a sitting is proposed for this Thursday.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I understand from consultation with the usual channels that it has been agreed that we will not sit this Thursday.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The discussions between the usual channels have left those of us in Opposition somewhat perplexed. That may be because we were not listening carefully enough, but if the sittings motion is that we sit until 1 o'clock today, and, if the business is not completed, reconvene next Thursday-not this Thursday, but the following Thursday-

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Tuesday.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Tuesday?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can help. The proposal is that the Committee meets now for a single sitting until
 1 o'clock, and then meets again at 10.30 on the Tuesday after the recess. That is what we are debating.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> On that basis, we welcome the proposal and will fit in with it. I am simply confused as to why the motion is completely different. The idea of sitting at
 9 o'clock on Thursdays threw me slightly as well.

<P>
We want this contentious Bill to be given proper and adequate parliamentary scrutiny. We will totally oppose any unseemly haste in moving it through Committee, as it raises some fundamental issues that have not been discussed before in relation to farming or animal husbandry.

<P>
I have no interest to declare; I have no contact with the fur trade or fur farmers, I have never purchased fur for myself or for anyone else and I have never been inclined, or moved, to do so. My hon. Friends and I strongly deprecate any form of cruelty to any animal, wild or domesticated. We support bans on the trapping of animals in the wild and would support tougher measures for those convicted of cruelty to animals in any situation. However, we recognise the right of individuals to choose whether to buy and wear fur.

<P>
The moral case advanced by the Government and the supporters of the Bill is weak. The Bill will not stop the sale of fur in shops not 100 yards from the Chamber; it will not stop fur being worn, nor prevent the importation of fur; it will not reduce the production of fur at farms in other European Union states.

<P>
There is a lack of consistency in the Government position's on European legislation, as they state repeatedly that they are a major player in the European scene. The legal case that will be advanced today is wafer thin; we argue that the Bill runs counter to much European Union legislation, especially on animal welfare and animal husbandry. The Government have tried to circumvent it by choosing a spurious case under article 30. It is inconsistent for a Government pledged to run with the European legislative pack and uphold EU laws and legislation to sail across the tide of that legislation and ignore most of it, and certainly that which applies to animal welfare and animal husbandry.

<P>
We expect the Government to make a strong case in Committee to justify introducing the Bill in the context of serious opposition from other members of the European Union and of counsel's opinion, sought by farmers and others in the fur trade, that the Bill is counter to European legislation that we, as a member of the European Union, have signed.

<P>
A ban on existing, legitimate farming activity that is governed by national and EU law on the grounds of an unsubstantiated public morality argument will create a dangerous precedent. It will eliminate-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I remind him that the debate is on the sittings motion. Will he please ensure that his remarks are in order?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I take your strictures on board, Mr. Sayeed.

<P>
We are trying to establish that the Bill requires time and scrutiny because it attempts to drive a unique wedge between itself and much existing legislation governing the activity. Until this morning, the Government's approach has been that the Bill can be cleared in one sitting. We expect them to argue that it was previously a private Member's Bill, which went through a Committee stage, and that there is nothing new to say because the arguments have been rehearsed. However, the official Opposition were not involved in that private Member's Bill at Committee stage or on Report. We therefore need more time to investigate and scrutinise the detail.

<P>
Eliminating the usual and accepted practice of basing laws on scientific evidence and clear criteria that are applied across the board would allow other bans to be introduced, based on similarly weak arguments. Furthermore, apart from the direct ban on animal husbandry, a public morality argument could also be used to justify bans on farming practices, and, ultimately, on the products of such practices. We also feel that the implications of accepting an unjustified ban on the grounds of public morality, which was the case that the Minister made on Second Reading, extend well beyond agriculture and EU animal welfare legislation. If we accept unsubstantiated public morality arguments in support of a ban on UK fur farming, the use of such arguments by member states introducing measures that could not normally be introduced under EU law and treaty is likely to increase.

<P>
This is, therefore, not just a matter of legislation to ban or curtail a specific farming activity. It raises much wider issues, particularly in terms of public morality, the basis on which the Minister put his case. When the private Member's Bill was before the House, its whole thrust was animal welfare. However, I suspect that because the Government have met legal opposition in Europe and opposition from other member states, there has, in the interim, been a dramatic switch from basing the legislation on arguments of animal welfare to ones of public morality. Much of that basis for the Bill is contained in clause 1, which is at its heart. We demand that the Minister fully justifies the moral and legal grounds on which he bases his case for the legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Sayeed. I look forward to making progress in the Committee. I also welcome hon. Members, particularly those on my own side. I am pleased that we have so many with experience in the area of animal welfare, not least my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), who moved her own private Member's Bill on the prohibition of fur farming, which enabled us to discuss the issues in considerable detail. While it is right and appropriate that, as Opposition Members have said, we should have proper scrutiny of the Bill, there has already been a great deal of debate of the issues. Nevertheless, we do not intend to curtail debate. I understand that the sittings motion was agreed at the request of the Conservative Whips Office. I have no complaints about the amendments that have been tabled, which are relevant and raise important issues. I intend to give a full response to them, and I hope that I shall deal with the points that have been made.

<P>
We are debating a sittings motion. I shall deal with some of the wider points that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) made when we debate the Bill.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Sayeed, and I hope that you will enjoy your time. We shall try to abide by your rules, and I shall try to restrict my comments to the sittings motion.

<P>
I am pleased that we are allowing considerable time to discuss the Bill, because it will set the most extraordinary precedent. I served on the Committee that considered the private Member's Bill last year, in which the drive of the comments of the hon. Member for Garston related to animal welfare. That argument has been dropped, and we are now discussing public morality.

<P>
We shall be heading for a headlong, cataclysmic legal battle in Europe if the Bill is passed as drafted. I have no doubt about that. Some serious issues are involved. I shall not repeat the Second Reading debate, but a raft of European and United Kingdom legislation governs the regulation of fur farming and looking after animals on farms. If animals are suffering, it is down to the Minister to sort out his Ministry and its vets. It is he who is to blame. No one else is responsible.

<P>
I shall not go into detail, but we have the Mink Keeping Order 1997, the Mink Keeping Regulations 1975, the Mink Keeping (Amendment) Regulations 1997, the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968, the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 and the Council of Europe convention on the protection of animals kept for farming. The Minister mutters. He is responsible for ensuring that his Ministry enforces that regulation. [
Interruption.] The hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) laughs.

<P>

<B>Mr. Morley:</B> This is not relevant.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> It is relevant in that we are discussing the parliamentary time to be devoted to an issue that it is in the hands of the Minister to sort out through his own Ministry this afternoon. He would be better off bringing together his officials at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and its vets and straightening the matter out. He has the weapons.

<P>
There is no need for cruelty to take place on any UK fur farm, because we have a ruck of European and British legislation. That view is confirmed by the European experience. The Dutch have already experienced these circumstances. In the mid 1990s, they conducted a big review to investigate cruelty and conditions. We must explore these matters, which is why we need time and why I welcome the sittings motion. The Dutch investigated the matter and invested substantial sums in their industry. As a result, they have a thriving industry. The same is true of the Danes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> As a result of Dutch investment in the industry, Dutch farmers voted to end fur farming in Holland.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That is not the information that I have from Mr. Wim Verhagen, head of the Dutch fur farmers, who intends to take the matter to the European courts. It is not the information that I have from Mr. Nielsen, head of the Danish fur farmers, either. The industry accounts for 4 per cent. of Danish GDP.

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle </B>(Liverpool, Garston): The hon. Gentleman mentions fur farmers in other countries. Does he accept that the Fur Breeders Association, which represents every remaining fur farmer in this country, favours the Bill?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating the sittings motion. Hon. members must stick to that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Yes, Mr. Sayeed. We are discussing the time available, and it is relevant that we have time to explore those issues.

<P>
The hon. Member for Garston raises a critical issue. The 11 fur farmers left have been placed in an impossible position, which brings me to my next point about compensation. As the Government have been pusillanimous in defending them, fur farmers have had terrorists with iron bars and balaclavas entering their gardens and behaving abominably. The Government have done nothing about it. It is a matter of great concern, which we must discuss at great length. British citizens carrying out legitimate business under European law are being terrorised. That is why they want to get out. They have been prevented from investing because they know that they will not be compensated. I discussed the issue with Mr. Cobbledick, a fur farmer in Devon, who told me that he had not invested in his business because he knows that any further investment-

<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Caton </B>(Gower): Is there anything in the sittings motion that will prevent us from debating all those issues in the time ahead?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> No, I am speaking in favour of the sittings motion. It is excellent because we have so many important issues to explore. I am simply outlining what they are and responding to the intervention of the hon. Member for Garston.

<P>
There are delicate issues about compensation. We could be setting a precedent for urban Governments to take substantial funds from pressure groups at a whim. Public morality is relevant when a legitimate European business can be closed down, and it is therefore vital that we have enough time to discuss compensation thoroughly. A unique precedent is being set, and in telephone conversations with me, Europeans have made it clear that they intend to fight all the way.

<P>
The Minister's attitude is probably that he has to pass some form of animal welfare measure. He will take it through Parliament and then say to hell with it-and the British taxpayer will pick up the tab in the courts. European fur farmers are much more numerous. There are only 11 left here, and the Government want to wash them away. There are 8,000 fur farmers in Europe, who are not going to take this lying down. As I said, they will fight it all the way. We must have adequate time to debate these issues.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee who he is representing-the people and constituents of this country, or European countries?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am speaking about general principles.

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a tanner.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That is a relevant point. I was a tanner and I was remunerated as such until last year. I am no longer remunerated.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Poor value for money, probably.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> It may well have been. I am an unremunerated member of the British Leather Confederation Council and I am standing for re-election this month. I may not be re-elected, but the post is not remunerated in any case. I have cleared it with the appropriate authorities and have established that it is not necessary for me to declare it. I received many abusive letters after taking part in a previous debate on this subject, so I had better point out that there is no connection whatever between the fur industry and the leather industry, which processes a by-product of the meat industry.

<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): Not relevant.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> It is relevant and I repeat that there is no connection between an industry that processes the by-products of the meat industry and an industry that expressly breeds animals for their fur.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): On a point of order, Mr. Sayeed, I seek your guidance. Is the question before us about the time that we sit and the number of sittings, or is it more simply that when we sit, we do so on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as read out in the sittings motion? If it is the latter, I fail to understand how the comments of the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) can be relevant.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are debating the sittings motion, which I read out so that all hon. Members would be aware of it. I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for North Shropshire and he has-though only just-kept in order. I, and no one else, can decide whether a member of the Committee is in order.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Sayeed. Let me make you job a little easier, by bringing my comments to an end. It is an admirable sittings motion. Important issues are at stake because a dangerous precedent-closing down a legitimate industry-is being set. There are many problems surrounding compensation for people who have been driven out of business by terrorists. Finally, there is a huge implication for forthcoming legal battles in the European courts. I support the sittings motion.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution, copies of which are available in the Room. Adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any such amendments reached during afternoon sittings.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Offences relating to fur farming</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 17, leave out ``£20,000'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`level 5 on the standard scale or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 17, leave out ``£20,000'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`level 5 on the standard scale'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> One of the amendments would remove the specified fine from the Bill and replace it with a level on the standard scale. The other would necessarily lower the maximum level of fine from £20,000 to £5,000, which is level 5 on the standard scale and provide the court with the option of imposing a custodial sentence as well as, or instead of, a fine.

<P>
It is unusual for a specific fine to be built into a Bill. More commonly, fines are prescribed with regard to the level on the standard scale, which avoids the need for changes to primary legislation when the scale is revised. We submit that £20,000 is a hefty fine. That amount is typically imposed on corporate bodies-not on individuals-for perpetrating offences. Corporate manslaughter, video piracy, environmental offences such as pollution-particularly river pollution-and so forth are examples. It is for such offences that a fine-only punishment, rather than a combination of fine and/or imprisonment, is usually available.

<P>
Most fur farmers are, of course, individuals, rather than corporate entities. The punishment in the Bill is therefore unsuitable. By comparison, the maximum punishment provided in the Breeding of Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act 1999 is three months imprisonment and/or a fine of up to £2,500.

<P>
The offences in the Bill are summary offences, which are triable only in a magistrates court. The maximum penalty is again severe when the defendant has no right to a trial by jury. In some circumstances, a term of imprisonment would be a more suitable than a fine. The court should have the discretion to impose a sentence that it deems appropriate in the light of the individual circumstances of the offence. The amendments would therefore change the scale and nature of the fine and would allow the courts the flexibility to impose a prison sentence, if appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument about fines. We carefully considered the appropriate fine to deter people from breaking the law when the Bill has received Royal Assent. The feeling in the Ministry is that £5,000 may not be sufficient to deter potential fur farmers who want to defy the law. The irony is that if the farming were on a large scale, farmers could absorb the £5,000 and still be in profit. A fine of £20,000 is more appropriate to ensure adequate deterrence.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> If the Bill is enacted and resists the challenge that will undoubtedly come from the European court, and even if compensation is adequate, all fur farmers who are in business will close down. Therefore, we are talking about the fur-farming start-ups of the future, for which farmers would need to make considerable capital investment. They will not do that if they will clearly be flouting a law. We feel that the fine is too large in that regard.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right that, generally speaking, it would take a fair degree of capital input to restart a fur farm. However, he is referring to mink farms, in which issues such as security must be taken into account. In a Bill of this type we must plan for all eventualities. The Bill will ban not only mink farming but fur farming of all species. Someone might be encouraged to break the law and make a profit by breeding a small species that can be bred in huts indoors and is potentially of a high value. For example, someone had the idea of producing a hamster fur coat. I have no idea who would buy such a thing, but if a black market in hamster skins and fur coats ever became the vogue-that seems unlikely to happen either in this country or internationally-illegal hamster farms might start up. That is an extreme example, but the Bill covers such eventualities, and a large fine ensures a complete disincentive.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those helpful comments. However, he has not explained why the unusual step has been taken of putting a figure in the Bill. It would be more appropriate to have a standard scale, so that we do not have to revisit the Bill and make new primary legislation when that changes. Why put a specific figure? Will the Minister tell us who decided on that figure and why it is deemed more appropriate than, for example, £15,000 or £30,000?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The figure was chosen simply on the basis that it was an adequate deterrent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is an arbitrary figure that was plucked out of the air by someone who thought that it might do the job. Why do we not introduce a standard scale and make it as high as the Minister feels is appropriate? That would prevent him from having to revisit the primary legislation on another occasion to change it if it is not working.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The view is that standard scales are inappropriate for the offence. Such a figure makes it clear that the fine will be substantial and is designed to act as a significant deterrent. No matter what are the differing views on the Bill, we can agree that a measure that becomes law should be an adequate deterrent so that people do not abuse it. The view is that the level of deterrent is adequate and justified.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I accept that the Minister is right and that the information that he has received is correct in that £20,000 will be an effective deterrent. What, then, has he against the second part of amendment No. 1, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman considers that an adequate deterrent must be in place to prevent any type of fur farming from starting up in the future. If that is such a crime, why should there not be a term of imprisonment if the sole object of the Bill is to deter people in future?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I am not against the particular suggestion of a prison sentence. As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, when Bills are drafted, the Home Office is consulted about what is considered appropriate in terms of fines and punishment. It advised that the offence was not sufficiently serious to justify a custodial sentence. However, I give an undertaking to the hon. Gentleman that I am willing to consult again with the Home Office about a custodial sentence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that undertaking.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> What does level 5 on the standard scale mean?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is £5,000. The Minister said he will seek further clarification from the Home Office, and I am sure that such information can be made available through the usual channels or when we discuss the Bill on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The amendment touches on one of the basic flaws in the Bill. The Government want to close down the remaining fur farmers, who have been put in an impossible position and want to get out. We understand why, and we hope to goodness that we enable them to receive proper compensation. As the Minister said, we should now look away from mink farming towards animals that are kept for meat. Under the Bill, it will be legal to keep, say, a rabbit. There are certain types of rabbit that one can keep for two purposes. I shall not list all the types of rabbit, as that was done when we discussed the private Member's Bill. It will be legal to keep one rabbit in one cage, which will be looked after subject to the raft of regulations, and it will be legal to kill it for meat. There will be no problem at all. Such arrangements will be monitored by the Minister's vets.

<P>
The same type of rabbit could be kept in an adjacent cage, subject to the same conditions and the same veterinary monitoring as the other rabbit. However, if it were killed for its fur, the farmer could be swept in and clobbered for a £20,000. fine. The Government have completely failed to address that flaw. We have mentioned it at every possible opportunity. It shows the utter absurdity of the Bill. Innocent people could be caught under the Bill, and I support the proposal of
 my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire to reduce the fine.

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> The amendment might reduce the fine, but it would put people in prison.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Let us stick to the fine for now. Under the Bill, the fine will be £20,000 for a man who might have a marginal business. There is no doubt that certain species could go for meat or for fur. The clause sets a dangerous precedent. We have not received any response from Labour Members about ethics or morality. What is immoral about keeping bunny A in one cage for meat, which is legal, and bunny B in another cage, which apparently is neither legal nor moral? I do not understand it, but the clause will sweep those people out, so I support the reduced fine proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We have had a reasonable debate and, as the Minister is prepared to return with some advice from the Home Office, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 17, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) In this Act except where the context otherwise requires, any reference to ``animals'' shall be a reference to any of the species of animal specified in the Schedule to this Act.'<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The amendment provides for a list of animals that cannot be farmed for their fur to be contained in a schedule to which additions or deletions can be made at any time in the future. A few moments ago, the Minister referred to a species that is not on my list. He may have been speaking with tongue in cheek, but it could be added to the list if that was deemed appropriate.

<P>
The schedule listing the animals will make it clear which of those animals are covered by the Bill. That will remove any potential for uncertainty or ambiguity and will introduce greater flexibility into the Bill. During discussion of the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill that was introduced during the previous session by the hon. Member for Garston, the promoter stressed on Second Reading and in Committee that the purpose of the Bill was not solely to prohibit the farming of mink. That was reiterated by the Minister this morning. The intention is that it will apply to all those animals that are or might be farmed primarily or solely for their fur.

<P>
The amendment would provide the legislative flexibility to support that intention by allowing animals to be added to or deleted from the schedule as circumstances require. The schedule list the animals by their common names as well as their Latin names and includes Arctic fox, chinchilla, fitch, which is polecat, mink, which is at the heart of our proceedings today, raccoon dog and rabbit, which was introduced into the equation by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire. There is no discrepancy between what he said and what I am saying. His point relates to the word ``primarily'' and we shall come to that on clause stand part. It is not the level of fine that is critical, but a species that is reared for both fur and meat can cause difficulties in drafting. The amendment would list the species to which the Bill refers and would allow it to be amended as need be with some flexibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but listing the animals is unnecessary and would be inadequate. The intention is to prohibit all fur farming in England and Wales and it is better for the Bill to be drafted to cover all animals that could be farmed for fur. That is a more direct, certain and effective way of meeting our objective. Red fox and silver fox have not been included on the list but are farmed for fur and other species that are not commonly farmed, but could be, such as wolverine, have also been omitted. The schedule would have to be amended repeatedly with the risk that species might be introduced during the time that it takes to make amendents, risking the escape of non-native animals into the countryside as has already happened from fur farms. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire will know from Second Reading that millions of pounds of taxpayers' money have been spent on trying to eradicate those species and resolve those problems. It is more logical to include all species in the Bill, rather than to make a list of the species, which might need to be amended later.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Bill could catch some innocent farmers of other animals. I raised that issue in
earlier debates. The European customs definition headed 4301 30 00 refers to different breeds of lamb and sheep, including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Astrakhan, Broadtail, Caracul, Persian and other similar lamb, Indian, Chinese, Mongolian or Tibetan lambs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those sheep could be bred for meat or fur, although the meat is hopeless and the value is in the wool and the fur. They could be covered by the Bill.

<P>
We should consider hair-on hides, which are fairly unusual. Designers use them in fancy apartments and in some furniture. Belted Galloways are popular for that, because of the big contrast between the wide stripe and the black forequarters and hindquarters. The numbers may be small, and the demand may be limited, but those animals could be swept up in the Bill. We know that the Minister wants mink farms to go. We accept that, but I am worried that the Bill could include a few other animals.

<P>
The issue of slinks must be considered, although the Minister may find that abstruse. They have virtually no value other than that of their skins. I am genuinely worried that the Bill could catch innocent people. I would like to hear the Minister's suggestions on how the Bill could be improved. How will people be exempted?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Morley:</B> In every case that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, the skins are the by-products of a trade that primarily provides food. The fact that the skin may be sold for more than the meat, depending on the market, does not bring its producers within the Bill's scope. The test of whether someone is farming for fur rests on determining that person's principal objective. The courts will do that. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the sheep and cattle sectors do not fall within the Bill's scope. I cannot envisage that the Bill would cover the normal manner of rearing or traditional husbandry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Clause 1 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person is guilty of an offence if he keeps animals solely or primarily<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for the specified purposes. On occasions such as those that I cited, the value of the fur or the skin will greatly exceed the value of the meat.

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman will remember that we debated that issue in detail on Report last year. I promoted the Bill then, and said that deciding the primary purpose of a business was a matter for the courts, which make sensible decisions about such issues. Their sole consideration will not be whether the meat or the fur was more valuable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> It is terribly dangerous to pass laws that are slightly woolly in the hope that the courts will show common sense. Surely we should deliberate on the matter in great detail and enact a Bill that is clear? Magistrates in Market Drayton should know exactly what the law is and what was intended. With all due respect to Committee members, our deliberations will soon be forgotten, as will the hon. Lady's and the Minister's genuinely good intentions. Magistrates will be faced by an Act of Parliament and their job will be to enforce it-[
Interruption.] I think that the hon. Lady said something about common sense and the need to make legislation sensible.

<P>
It is not right for us, as legislators, to put the onus on magistrates to be sensible. It is we who should be sensible. We should enact a Bill that is clear, transparent and easy to enforce and understand. The clearer it is, the easier it will be for citizens not to infringe it. No one will want to break the law-the sort of people whom I am considering are thoroughly respectable people. However, the drafting of the provisions displays a certain wooliness.

<P>
The value of an animal's meat will in some cases be virtually nil, and obtaining anything for the skin will be a bonus.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> We should apply common sense in this context. Calves can be of little value-their price goes up and down. The price of cull calves, for instance, is rising, although their hide may be worth more than their meat in some circumstances. Such calves are a by-product of, and ancillary to, the dairy industry-they are not reared as part of a fur-farming or skin business.

<P>
There will always be grey areas in legislation, and the courts are the final arbiters. The situation in this regard is no different. The hon. Gentleman exaggerated the problem. People and, I am sure, the courts will know what is meant when one raises animals
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>solely or primarily  for  fur.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> In the light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I return to a matter that I raised during our consideration of the sittings motion. The Bill involves more than an attempt to ban a particular farming activity. It also sets an unwelcome precedent, and it might open the door to many other challenges in United Kingdom and European courts. The Government do not appear to have anticipated that.

<P>
I am sure that most Committee members agree with me that clause 1 lies at the heart of the Bill. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person is guilty of an offence if he keeps animals solely or primarily  for slaughter  for the value of their fur.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill will ban what has hitherto been a legal activity in this country and will remain so in Europe and elsewhere for the foreseeable future.

<P>
As it is at the heart of the Bill, the clause must be strongly challenged. All the other clauses follow on from it, and we can discuss them sensibly when we have established the basic principles about the decision to impose a ban.

<P>
On Second Reading, we referred to the uneasy feeling, despite the Minister's assurances, of there being a smell of legislation for cash. We maintain that the Government are fearful of the backlash from the countryside, as, despite the Labour party's commitment, fox hunting has not yet been banned. The Government have initiated an investigation, to delay matters, and it is unlikely that legislation on fox hunting will be introduced during this Parliament. As all hon. Members know, the animal lobby has given more than £1 million to the Labour party. It has done so not out of the kindness of its heart but because it wants animal welfare issues to be high on the Government's list of priorities.

<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman know how much money the animal lobby has given to the Conservative party?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am not aware of our receiving any.

<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> It has received about £400,000.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That does not undermine my point-people expect something for £1 million. That does not mean that the Government have to cast around for something to do, and take off the shelf the only animal welfare Bill to hand. The Government should decide what are the crucial animal welfare issues, and do something to address them. We have an uneasy feeling that fur farming is the only animal welfare issue in town at the moment. The Bill is not just a sop to the animal lobby-I know that the Minister cares deeply about animal welfare issues, and that this has become as much a personal campaign for him as it was for the hon. Member for Garston.

<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister claimed that the Bill has the support of the National Farmers Union and the fur breeders. At best, that is a simplification.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I never claimed that either organisation supported the Bill, although I certainly said that neither has opposed it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I should have thought that the National Farmers Union and the fur breeders would have clear views on whether they support the Bill. If they have not officially opposed it, that cannot be read as tacit support.

<P>
Fur farmers have been harrassed for a long time by those whom Opposition Members would describe as animal terrorists-people who use violent means to achieve their ends. This morning, I had a brief conversation in Westminster with fur farmers who, because of the intimidation and violence that they have had to face, want to get out of the business. That is not support in any shape or form; it is coercion in tooth and claw. They now feel threatened by a Government with a huge majority, who, in effect, can carry any legislation that they choose through this House. Many fur farmers are in despair-the market for fur has declined, they feel that there is no future and they have stopped investing. For some of them, the end cannot come quickly enough, provided that there is adequate compensation, which is covered by a later clause. Opposition Members believe, as does the National Farmers Union, that regulation rather than criminalisation is the appropriate approach. If the Bill is enacted, however, we shall support the National Farmers Union in its insistence that those of its members who are affected, such as those who were here this morning, receive fair and adequate compensation.

<P>
The European directive on farm welfare, adopted by the Council of Ministers last year, identified fur animals, along with cows, pigs and sheep, as part of the established farming industry. Would the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers have supported the measures if mink farming-the only form of fur farming in the UK-were seen as cruel and unnecessary?

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The British Government voted in favour of that directive, although I do not know whether the Minister did so in person. The proposed ban on fur farming will eliminate a centre of agriculture that is regulated by several EU directives: 827/68, 98/58 and 93/119. Various scientific reports prove that there are fur farms that do not compromise welfare.

<P>
We question why the Government are pressing ahead with the legislation, in the light of the weight of the EU legislation before them. Their justification for the ban is excessively weak. The Government's position has shifted dramatically from that of the hon. Member for Garston in her private Member's Bill, which the Government supported, which was to ban fur farming primarily, if not solely, on welfare grounds. Animal welfare is still part of the argument and we have no quarrel with legislation and controls to ensure that fur farming is conducted properly, but the main justification for the ban has now shifted to that of public morality, which is supposedly threatened by animals being kept and slaughtered for their fur.

<P>
The issue of public morality is a difficult one. I suspect that the Government decided to switch the basis of their argument because officials advised that the Government could not possibly hope to get the Bill enacted, against the weight of European legislative opinion, if they pursued it on the grounds of animal welfare. Therefore, they cast around for some mechanism or vehicle and found article 30-it was previously article 36-which deals with the issue of public morality. I know of only one other instance of it being used before: in the case of newly joined members. The Republic of Ireland restricted the circulation of sexually explicit printed material on that ground for some years after joining the European Union.

<P>
If using the argument of public morality becomes a legally acceptable method of banning anything of which a Government disapprove, the French could exclude British beef for ever and a day. French public opinion supported the French Government's stand on importing British beef.

<P>
On a note of caution, article 30 warns against attempted abuse on the grounds of exception. If the Bill is enacted, it will be tested in the courts to establish whether it conforms to article 30 and to other articles of European Union law on animal welfare.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's argument in support of his case. Is he saying that morality and the public's view of the way in which animals are treated and reared should not be taken into account?

<P>
I give the hon. Gentleman another example: the force feeding of geese, which is not allowed in this country. If there were an attempt to produce pâté de foie gras by that method in the United Kingdom, there would be a public outcry. Those who produce pâté de foie gras argue that there is not a welfare problem, although I would dispute that on moral and welfare grounds. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that force feeding geese for food production in this country would be acceptable if the only grounds against it were moral?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister's point is not so much about force feeding geese as about whether public morality in connection with article 30 and the use to which, historically, it has been put gives the Government sufficient grounds to carry the day and enact the Bill and to respond to the inevitable challenges in the European court.

<P>
I do not dispute that animal welfare is a public, moral issue. We all have a moral view about the welfare of animals, whether they are mink or other fur animals or domestic cats and dogs. As I said earlier, we deprecate cruelty in any shape or form to any wild or domesticated animal, but that is not the issue. The Government are not presenting the Bill as an animal welfare issue per se, although that is how the private Member's Bill was presented. The Government's problem is to convince their European friends and neighbours that on the public morality, article 30 issue alone the Minister has grounds for doing what he is trying to do. I wish him luck; he is an amenable Minister who does a good job and is successful in post. He obviously feels strongly about the issue and cares about it deeply; it is his big issue and he wants the Bill to be successful, but our reading of the problems and the cases concerned is that he will have difficulties. No doubt he has had advice from his officials on that issue.

<P>
The Government are extremely active and lenient on other public morality issues, but fur farming is deemed to be publicly immoral so they say that it must be banned. To substantiate and justify their argument on fur farming, the Government referred to their pre-election promises and to public opinion polls. The result of the public opinion poll conducted under the auspices of the RSPCA has been given to us on many occasions; the research was done before the private Member's Bill. Opinion polls give the answers that one wants if the questions are framed in the right way; I understand that, at MORI's insistence, the RSPCA had to withdraw misleading information about fur farming, although I do not know why. MORI was obviously concerned that the figures did not support the conclusion reached by the RSPCA's poll, which was used by those in favour of banning fur farming at the time.

<P>
Surely, we have not reached the stage where legislation will be based and settled on the result of public opinion polls. In the light of the RSPCA's use of the poll, such a policy would be open to question. The Daily Telegraph leader of 26 February is still relevant; it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Does this mean that the Government considers itself licensed to shut down any law-abiding business that falls foul of the polls? It is nothing less than the abuse of democratic power.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Other polls have been conducted; a recent poll undertaken on behalf of the British Fur Trade Association by Taylor, Nelson Sofres plc showed that 81 per cent. of the British people support the farming of animals for any purpose provided that there is good animal welfare; 41 per cent. either support fur farming, are ambivalent about it or have not formed a view; and 62 per cent. feel that it is environmentally sound to use natural fibre such as raw silk, fur and leather.

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> The British Fur Trade Association poll did not mention fur farming. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that every remaining fur farmer in Britain has resigned from the British Fur Trade Association because it does not represent their views?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is a matter for the fur farmers to decide whether the association is working for them or not. I suspect that it is a matter of economics, and that the farmers cannot afford to pay their dues. For whatever reason, they take the decision.

<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the precarious financial situation of some fur farmers, but how does he square that with his objective that fur farmers should be forced to upgrade their animal welfare standards? Is not that a back-door way of banning fur farming without compensation?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> If criteria are set that no one can meet, it is a way of getting rid of fur farmers, but no one argues such a case. Forgive me, but I do not remember arguing that the new regulations should be so draconian that they put people out of business. I said on the animal welfare issue that we would respond to moves to improve the welfare of mink kept for fur farming. I hope that the Minister will make the animal welfare case when he responds to the debate, as he has not done so yet.

<P>
If some fur farmers are in a precarious position, it is no good the Government holding up their hands and saying, ``It's nothing to do with us,'' because it is to do with them. The private Member's Bill and the animal lobby show that people believe that the Government, with their huge majority, could push the measure through.

<P>
There has been no investment for at least three years in the fur farming business, but that is not the point. The point is one of principle: either it is right to allow something to take place that is within the law and which looks after the welfare of animals that are being husbanded, or it is not. The only grounds for banning such farming are the specious grounds of public morality, however that is defined. But the animal welfare issue has not been used as the Bill's primary purpose, although it may be one of the ingredients in the argument.

<P>
The Labour party made a pre-election commitment to animal welfare, but not a manifesto commitment. The justification in the new labour document, ``New Life for Animals'' was clearly one of animal welfare, not public morality.

<P>
It is important to note that public opinion polls and pre-election commitments are far from being the exclusive places for the Government's farm animal welfare policy. Public opinion has been acknowleged by the Government to be against the live export of animals. However, we know that such exports are not banned. Instead, the approach taken has been to improve standards of transport.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Similarly, public concerns about the possible implications of cloning for the welfare of farmed livestock have not resulted-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but this is a stand part debate on clause 1, which is about offences. Will he ensure that his remarks are fully in order?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I take your stricture again, Mr. Sayeed, and I will attempt to refocus my points on clause 1. The Government are creating an offence to ban a certain type of farming activity. Clause 1 is at the heart of the Bill; without it, the rest is meaningless. The Government must give the Committee full and ample justification for introducing the offence.

<P>
There is inconsistency in the Government's argument. Public opinion polls say that live transport of animals is wrong, yet the Government find a middle way. On the cloning of farm animals, they again find a middle way. We can put to one side as irrelevant the argument that public opinion has to be listened to and is the key element in decision making. The fact that the majority of people want to see fur farming banned per se is not a reason for introducing an offence to ban it. I am attempting to develop those themes and to expose the inconsistency in the Government's position.

<P>
We believe that the offence is unjustified and disproportionate. Numerous independent scientific reports show that fur animals can and are being farmed without their welfare being compromised. I know that the view of the Government and certain individuals who support the Bill is that it is impossible to farm mink or other fur-growing animals properly when their welfare is paramount. Other evidence suggests that it is not. We are in the realm of opinion, not fact.

<P>
The Government's advisory body, the Farm Animal Welfare Council, examined mink-breeding practices in the United Kingdom 10 years ago. It rightly concluded that conditions should be improved, but it did not recommend a ban on the activity. Instead, it advocated further research and improvement of housing. That is still an option for the Government. The Minister will say that the Dutch have started to do something about the matter, but UK Governments, even under my party, have not undertaken proper research to ascertain scientifically and practically what is not appropriate in terms of the welfare and conditions of mink.

<P>
We also believe that the offence is inconsistent with the Government's animal welfare policy. National rules on the treatment of farm animals in the UK are based on the implementation and enforcement of European Union law and recommendations from the Council of Europe, scientific advice, and consultation with interested parties. To my knowledge, there is no other farmed species for which perceived public morality concerns have been the one and only factor used to determine the future regulatory status of animal husbandry. That change in policy is coupled with wider serious implications, which demand that the Government's case for a ban based on public morality should be substantiated. Hopefully, when the Minister responds, he will explain why the Government believe that the public morality issue will carry the day.

<P>
At the least, the Government should be required to explain the criteria that they used to determine the unacceptability of fur farming and to show that the same criteria are used systematically to regulate other areas in the animal husbandry industry. Simply to select some criteria and apply them to only one aspect of animal husbandry and not to others is not only wrong, but illegal. The priority of the United Kingdom Government when it assumed the presidency of the European Union was the adoption of directive 98/58 on the welfare of farm animals. It lays down minimum rules for keeping fur animals. However, the Government did not say at the time to their EU partners that they planned to prohibit the keeping of fur animals, even if the rules of the directive were being complied with. The directive, with which the Government were heavily involved, laid down specific conditions for the welfare and rearing of animals, including those that were kept for fur, yet here we are today with something that is completely outside that to which the Government signed up.

<P>
In June 1999, the United Kingdom was an active participant in the adoption of the Council of Europe's recommendation on fur animals. Again, the Government failed to notify other contracting parties that their intention was to prohibit fur farming on the grounds of public morality. The Labour party's pre-election document in 1997, ``A New Life for Animals'' provided ample evidence that the treatment of fur farming was not consistent with how the Government were handling other animal-related issues of public concern. It is excessively harsh in that context. The document cites the genetic engineering of animals as an area of public anxiety, yet the suggested way in which to deal with that was to establish a royal commission. The document stated the higher standards should apply to circus animals. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If circuses cannot comply with such welfare standards, they should not be allowed to keep caged animals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Fur farmers are not being given the option of complying with higher welfare standards.

<P>
I reiterate that article 30 is the Government's way of trying to avoid their obligations. Given what the Minister said on Second Reading and what he has said today, it is clear that the animal welfare issue is very strong. There is assent about that from across the Room. Welfare considerations are behind the Bill even though they are not placed at the top of the pyramid. A ban on fur farming on the grounds of welfare alone would cause problems with the treaty and law of the EU and could be convincingly contested on the basis that such welfare concerns could alternatively be satisfied by a commitment on the part of the United Kingdom finally to implement EU directive 98/58, the Council of Europe's recommendations on fur animals and the planned EU directive on the welfare of animals that the Commission will bring forward subsequent to the report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Welfare.

<P>
We sought legal advice on the offence of keeping animals primarily for their fur-which is the whole thrust of clause 1-and a powerful case was made that the Bill, if enacted, will be contrary to EU law. First, it will be contrary to Council directive 98/58 which relates to the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. The United Kingdom has apparently argued that the directive is irrelevant, as its decision to ban fur farming is based on public morality grounds, not animal welfare grounds. We believe that that argument fails to take account of the proper scope of the directive.

<P>
The directive lays down minimum standards for the protection of animals bred or kept for farming purposes. Point 21 of the annexe states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No animal shall be kept for farming purposes unless it can reasonably be expected, on the basis of its genotype or phenotype, that it can be kept without detrimental effect on its health or welfare.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the directive expressly deals with the question of which animals can or cannot be kept for farming purposes. There is nothing that says that animals bred and kept for their fur cannot be kept appropriately, in terms of their welfare, for farming purposes. Furthermore, article 10(2) provides that member states may maintain or apply within their territories stricter provisions than those laid down in the directive. Therefore this country can decide to go beyond what the directive lays down on the welfare of calves or, in the case of our pig industry, sows. Such provisions may be adopted for the protection of animals but not for the protection of public morality.

<P>
Clause 1 bans fur farming in this country, and to all intents and purposes that means mink farming. We are dealing with an EC directive which the Government were heavily involved in drawing up and implementing, even though it stands firmly against what they are trying to do. That is quite an undertaking for the Minister and his Government. They are taking on, in isolation, the burden of changing the law specifically to deal with species raised primarily for their fur and going against everything that they signed up to legally under EU directives in which they were deeply involved.

<P>
A further point relating to EU law is that, if the Bill were enacted, it would be contrary to the rules of free movement in articles 28 and 29 of the EC treaty-formerly articles 30 and 34. The Bill would restrict trade in live animals and would also have the practical effect of eliminating the current trade in exports from the United Kingdom of skins obtained from animals reared here. Although article 30 provides that restrictions on free movement may be justified on grounds of public morality, it is clear that the proposed ban in clause 1 is disproportionate. The UK has apparently not even considered whether any less restrictive means might be available to fulfil its objective-to raise welfare standards. Under European Union law, the Government's proposals are disproportionate to their objective.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is important to consider how other countries that are, perfectly legally, involved in fur farming-even if the Bill is enacted, fur farming will remain perfectly legal in other countries in the EU-and our European neighbours feel about the proposed ban. As we heard, the Government received submissions from four states, including a detailed opinion from France, to which they must respond by a certain date. The Minister nods in assent; he has that in hand. Perhaps in his response he will enlighten the Committee about that detailed opinion and the timetable involved, so that we know when he needs to respond, whether he will do so in the time scale specified, and what he will say.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the Minister will not take up that suggestion unless his response relates strictly to offences. I ask the hon. member for North-East Cambridgeshire to bring his remarks into line with the debate that we are supposed to be having.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am coming to the end of my comments, Mr. Sayeed.

<P>
To return to a point that I made earlier, clause 1 goes to the heart of the Bill. It provides for an offence of keeping animals solely or primarily for their fur; all the other clauses follow on from it. In considering the philosophy behind the Bill and the Government's reasons and motives for introducing it, they must consider the fundamental question of why they want to introduce the ban. In the face of considerable opposition, they will have difficulties in future with EU law. We are told time and again that EU law is the governing law: every case that goes to the European Court of Justice seems to go against us, and EU law is superior to our own. However, Government who have signed up to European laws and boast continually about being at the heart of Europe and a senior player are prepared to dismiss the considerable weight of European law in introducing the offence.

<P>
The Government's motives in introducing the ban are excessively weak. The ban has not yet been justified by the Minister, and it is a disproportionate measure. It is inconsistent with the Government's own animal welfare policy. The justification offered so far, on public morality grounds, is an attempt to evade EU treaty obligations, of which I am sure the Government will fall foul. The ban is strongly opposed by key EU member states that are involved in fur farming; they have made submissions and said that they are prepared to take the Government to the highest European court over the matter.

<P>
The Bill will constitute a precedent in banning and criminalising an activity that has hitherto been legal and will continue to be legal in the rest of Europe. Given the opposition from EU countries, the inevitable challenge that will follow and the Government's weak legal position, why, oh why, are the Government pressing ahead with the Bill? Ultimately, it will cost a lot of money. We have not discussed compensation, but considerable sums will be involved-or so I hope. Costs will also be involved in preparing the legal case to fight our European neighbours on the issue. I realise that the Minister has a genuine personal interest in the matter, as he has in all animal welfare issues, but he is taking an enormous gamble, which could backfire. He needs to deal with the issues that I have put to him, and I look forward to hearing him justify why, against all the opposition and the problems, he is pressing ahead with the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I shall be relatively brief, because my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has covered the salient points in our objections to clause 1. One can quarrel with the principle and the detail of the clause. First, I want to deal with the detail. The clause creates an ambiguity, which featured in our debate last year on the private Member's Bill. The ambiguity was mentioned on Second Reading, but it is not covered by any of the amendments. Therefore, I want to bring it to the Minister's attention and invite comment.

<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, clause 1 is the heart of the Bill. It establishes the offence and an ambiguity is created by the way in which that offence is worded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person is guilty of an offence if he keeps animals solely or primarily-

<P>
(a) for slaughter  for the value of their fur, or

<P>
(b) for breeding progeny for such slaughter.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word ``primarily'' creates an ambiguity that will, over time, cause grave problems. Someone who keeps animals partly for slaughter for the value of their fur and partly for another purpose will be guilty of an offence only if the primary purpose is slaughter. From last year's debate, I understood that the intention was to ensure that people such as rabbit farmers who produce and market meat and fur would be guilty of the offence if the value of the fur that they produced was greater than the value of the rabbit's meat.

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman cannot have understood that from last year's debate, because that point was made by the hon. Member for North Shropshire, who was not the promoter of the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman reads last year's Hansard, he will recall that I said that value was not the issue. The court will take a common-sense approach in every case, and it is probable that no cases will come before court.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> If the hon. Lady bears with me, I will develop the argument.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The hon. Lady made a remarkable comment: there will probably be no cases anyway. Is that not the most extraordinary attitude to our deliberations? We are creating laws that could send people to jail or allow them to be heavily fined, but the suggestion is that we should just toss the Bill through on the grounds that there might be no cases.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I confess that I did not hear the hon. Lady's comments. However, I agree with my hon. Friend: that is an extraordinary confession from the Government Benches. The weakness in her point is that the use of the word ``primarily'' extends the interpretation of the Bill to include value. The hon. Lady cannot get away from the fact that, as the Bill stands, value is a factor that the courts will be obliged to take into consideration when deciding whether someone is guilty of the offence. The Bill as drafted is bound to lead to legal uncertainty: it oversimplifies, in that it does not do justice to the variations and complexities of rabbit farming, and so will present lawyers with a wonderful opportunity to practise their skills.

<P>
Rabbit farming is relevant to the offence because it is free from price support and market controls and is exposed to the vagaries of the market. The value of rabbit meat and fur varies from time to time in both absolute and relative terms. The value of rabbit meat and fur produce rises and falls through the combined operations of supply and demand, and the prices of both are often affected by the same market forces operating overseas on other producers. It follows that it will be difficult to determine whether the value of rabbit fur exceeds or is less than the value of rabbit meat. The argument is not abstract or academic; it approaches the heart of the reality of the rabbit farming business. How will a court reach a conclusion about whether an offence has been committed when the markets for fur and meat are so volatile, and especially when the value of meat and fur is broadly approximate for much of the time?


<P>
There is another dimension that confuses the concept expressed in the word ``primarily''. To make a definition of primary purpose that includes value, not only the bottom line of profitability, but the investment capital side of the business must be considered. By bringing in that dimension, the whole question of whether a producer is primarily farming animals
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for slaughter  for the value of their fur<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
becomes immensely complicated. The essential point is that the Bill will be extremely difficult to implement because the word ``primarily'' is included. That word opens up an enormous grey area and the Bill would be better without it. We may need to return to that point in connection with a later amendment.

<P>
I quarrel with the offence as created in the clause both in detail and principle. I have referred to the detail; as for the principle, I made my position clear on Second Reading and when the private Member's Bill was considered last year. I do not propose to go over the ground that has been covered by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, save to say that it is wholly unacceptable to criminalise an activity that is not only legal, but highly regulated, within the European Union. Such a position would be untenable for the Government. As my hon. Friend said, it is through regulation that the Opposition believe that animal welfare standards should be promoted and safeguarded. We see no reason why the Government should not take that approach.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The public morality argument is wholly unacceptable. One should be slow to impose one's moral rules on the community as a whole, especially through legislation. To criminalise that of which one does not approve is a dangerous practice. On Second Reading, we heard that a factor contributing to the Government's rationale is that fur is inessential: it is dangerous to justify criminalisation on the grounds that a practice is inessential. It is a tragedy that the Government are not prepared to move forward through regulation. As my hon. Friend pointed out, one can envisage all sorts of difficulties and problems in store for the Government in the courts if the Bill becomes law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Clause 1 goes to the heart of the Bill. I was not on the Committee that considered the private Member's Bill, but I have attended some of the debates on the subject and cannot understand how the Government can justify their bizarre thinking. The industry in this country is tiny-only 11 fur farmers and 13 fur farms are left, whereas on the continent, there are 6,000 fur farmers and 8,000 fur farms; we produce 160,000 mink a year out of 25 million worldwide. Yet we are devoting excessive parliamentary time to that industry, for no animal welfare gain.

<P>
The sum happiness of the mink will not increase if the Bill goes through. We know that all but one of the farmers will close their businesses completely, and the other will move his stock to his farm in Denmark. He will be welcomed there, as the trade represents 4 per cent. of Danish gross domestic product: the trade is highly regulated there and is thriving and increasing. Instead of being under the custody of a caring Minister who takes the issues incredibly seriously, those mink will be under the jurisdiction of another Government.

<P>
In Austria, it became an offence in Carinthia to keep animals solely or primarily for their fur-similar grounds to those in clause 1. A farm was closed down and the farmer received about £400 compensation a beast. However, he did not simply move the existing facility to the Czech Republic; he doubled their size. The mink were moved from what I suspect was a reasonably well regulated regime in Austria, which is a tightly regulated European Union country, to what was probably a less regulated regime in an eastern Europe country. Some such countries are catching up fast and making dramatic progress, but the chances are that those mink were moved to worse conditions.

<P>
There is a basic flaw. Why are we spending our time discussing such a tiny industry?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Does my hon. Friend share my bewilderment? If, as the Government accept, it is not wrong to wear fur, how can it be wrong in principle to produce it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out. It is another extraordinary flaw that I cannot get my mind around. I totally respect the fact that Labour Members hold such views deeply and passionately-but I cannot understand them. In Russia, for example, it is compulsory to wear fur at certain times of year. It is not a luxury product. [Laughter.] It is interesting that the Government Whip is laughing. If she bothered to go to Novobirsk in the middle of winter, when it is about -40 degrees, she would realise that she needed to wear something to save her life in the conditions outside her hotel. That shows the basic ignorance of many hon. Members. Fur is not a luxury or a fancy product in Russia; it is a means of staying alive.

<P>
<B>Mrs Anne McGuire </B>(Stirling): That does not make it compulsory.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> In certain parts of Russia, one is not allowed to go outside in winter without a fur hat. That is the law. Fur is a basic commodity there. Visitors to Russia, Northern China, Mongolia or such countries see everybody wearing fur hats. Someone will supply that demand. It is not going to go away.

<P>
<B>Mr. Caton:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman follow the logic of his argument that we should not stop something that we believe to be immoral because it will happen somewhere else to the point of advocating that we should allow the production of pâté de foie gras and of white veal in this country, when we know that that involves cruelty?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That goes to the nub of the matter. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read the letter from the NFU. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no question that an outright ban on a particular type of farming goes well beyond the traditional approach adopted by successive governments of regulating and enforcing-but not dictating-what enterprises farmers can or cannot pursue in a free society.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The debate has broad implications. We have seen the devastation done to our pig industry by setting welfare standards-they had all-party support-that were well above those in the rest of Europe. The result has not been an increase in pig happiness, if I can put it that way. Pig farms have closed and pigs are being kept under far less happy regimes on the continent.

<P>
Animal welfare is a fundamental question that I discussed recently when I went to America with the Agriculture Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Caton:</B> Sadly, the hon. Gentleman has not answered my question. I would like a straight answer to it: would he support the introduction into this country of the force-feeding of geese and the keeping of calves permanently in the dark with an inadequate diet? Is that what he wants?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The debate is about offences. We should not widen it further.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Sayeed. I will not be tempted to discuss geese. If I can make my voice heard above the chatter on the Labour Benches, I will get back to the issue in hand.

<P>
The clause makes it an offence to keep an animal solely or primarily to slaughter for its fur. I do not want to repeat arguments that we had in earlier debates, but there is a raft of European and British legislation on the matter, which we have listed and gone through in some detail. If Labour Members are concerned about those problems, surely the answer is to ensure that the trade in this country is properly regulated. That is my direct answer to the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) in regard to fur farms.

<P>
I do not think that it is right to ban things. There is overwhelming evidence from the continent, where the trade is much bigger and where there are huge fur farms, which are well regulated. The health of an animal is manifested in its skin. If one's cat, dog or horse is not well, the first thing that one notices is that the coat becomes stary, coarse and dry. Fur farmers make money only if they sell the highest quality skins. The definition of a successful fur farm is therefore one with healthy animals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Caton indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The hon. Member for Gower shakes his head, but that is a fact. He has a healthy head of hair and a fine hirsute face, which shows that he is well. When a vet examines an animal, the first things that he looks at are the eyes and coat.

<P>
<B>Mr. Caton:</B> In 1989, the Farm Animal Welfare Council examined profitable fur farming in this country, found that such furs were being sold, and concluded that it was unacceptable. It is wrong to say that everything in the fur farming industry is wonderful, in this country or elsewhere.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> No, I did not say that. One can always improve regulation and conditions in cages, but a tiny number of people have been terrorised and have been told that there is no point in investing in improving their facilities because they will not be compensated. It is an appalling situation: a small number of people, who are not making money, are having their civil liberties abused on a weekly and almost daily basis and have no prospect of getting out.

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the Bill provides a way out through compensation? His proposal to increase welfare standards beyond what fur farmers can afford would drive them out of business with no compensation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that comment, which is completely wrong. It is defied by the experience of the Dutch and the Danes, who have studied their industries and invested heavily. That is the answer. We should ensure that the current regulations are properly policed. I hold the Minister to blame in that regard. He is in charge of vets and the inspection regimes and has an enormous armoury of regulation, which he should be using. If he is still not happy, he should engage with the Europeans-a study in Europe is taking place at the moment-to find out how welfare regimes can be improved. [
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> If the hon. Member for Ipswich wishes to intervene-

<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): Ipswich?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Somewhere in East Anglia. We have served on a Committee together before and he made many contributions. I am happy to hear Labour Members' contributions, as this debate is fundamental to the whole Bill. If one finds something distasteful, the answer is to push for better regulation and policing and higher standards. Banning it would set a dangerous precedent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Member for Garston is saying that it is acceptable to ban an activity if people are offered compensation. I admit that compensation helps, but surely there is a point of principle at stake. Would fur farmers not prefer to stay in business without harassment from animal rights activists, in a fair and legal system, on a par with their European Union counterparts? Would they not prefer to look after their animals' welfare within the legal framework? The alternative is being forced out of business by harassment, even though compensation is at hand.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That is a pertinent point. Those fur farmers to whom I have spoken are sick to death of the uncertainty and difficulty of their existence-they cannot invest or improve the conditions of their cages and, therefore, have been condemned. They are in a Catch-22 situation. The only solution, which the hon. Member for Garston always cites, is to get out at the expense of the British taxpayer, which is wrong. It is a dangerous precedent to allow people's civil liberties to be abused and to use that as an excuse to go to the British taxpayer for a solution. British taxpayers' money would be far better employed to ensure that the police in such areas kept the farmers from being trespassed upon and harassed. The clause will set an extraordinarily dangerous precedent and there are no grounds for it.

<P>
The Minister referred to Holland where there was an investigation in the mid-1990s at a time of heavy investment in such farms. It was not right to say that legislation is going through to ban fur farming. An investigation took place into a ban, which is different from proposing legislation to ban it. Last year, a Mr. J. van Noord, a member of the lower House, investigated the matter and considered that there were no grounds for banning mink farming under existing laws. It was found that, after the huge expenditure of the mid-1990s, animal welfare improvements had been achieved and scientists found that the welfare conditions for mink were as high as for other farmed animals.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The report went on at some length about the economic and social consequences of such a ban and what would happen if it went through. The Dutch Parliament then considered the possible moral and ethical side of the issue. The Minister was not quite right, however, when he said that a measure is going through the Dutch Parliament to ban mink farming.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The Dutch Parliament has voted to ban mink farming. Such a measure is not in place, but it is considering ways in which to implement it. The Dutch Parliament is implementing a ban on the farming of foxes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister and I agree. There is no actual ban, but there was a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> The Dutch Parliament voted to ban farming.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I shall have to refer to the Hansard report of our proceedings, but I think that the Minister gave the impression earlier that there was a vote to ban the trade. There has been a vote to order an investigation to see whether it is possible to ban it and consider the consequences of such a ban.

<P>
We are in a different position. We are discussing clause 1 which, if the Bill is enacted, will ban fur farming. It will be an offence. It will be illegal, which is not the position in Holland.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> It is.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister and I nearly reached agreement earlier. There is no measure going through the Dutch Parliament to ban fur farming.

<P>
Clause 1 of the Bill will ban fur farming. If enacted, it will be an offence under British law, which, if contravened, will attract a fine of £20,000. That is not so in the Dutch Parliament where an investigation is taking place. The Dutch had a stab at it on animal welfare grounds, but failed. Now they are considering the matter on moral grounds, but have rumbled the social and economic consequences of such a ban and seen the consequences of the precedent that it could set for other trades.

<P>
Other countries in Europe have responded to such matters in a robust way. The French consider that the United Kingdom ban will not be proportionate and that it will not improve animal welfare. They have referred the provision under directive 98/58, which requires the Commission to prepare proposals for EU laws based on the Council of Europe's recommendations. Given that a recommendation on fur animals exists and that the EU's Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Welfare has examined the welfare of fur animals, France considers that the United Kingdom's initiative has prejudged that work and is likely to upset the process of EU harmonisation in farm animal protection. I sympathise with the French. It is a shame that we are not participating in the new European research into such matters. From the comments that I have received from some Scandinavians-

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Here we are again. I remind hon. Members that we are discussing clause 1 stand part, which is concerned only with offences. Can hon. Members stick to that, please?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Certainly, Mr. Sayeed.

<P>
People in other European countries believe that, if the clause goes through as it stands, Britain will have acted in direct contravention of European law and against its own policies on animal welfare. That is why it is being resisted, and why we should discuss the clause in great depth; it is the nub of the Bill. Britain will be on its own if the measure goes through, because the countries that have the preponderance of fur farms, such as Denmark and Holland, will be strongly opposed to it. Countries such as France regard it as grossly out of proportion and will also oppose it. The substantial European opposition that we are likely to run into, purely on the grounds of animal welfare measures and regulation, comes within the remit of a debate on the clause.

<P>
I am worried that the Government are introducing the Bill as a one-shot measure to satisfy their animal welfare lobby, and that they are basically going to say, ``Hang the consequences in the European courts''. There is ample legal evidence for the Europeans to take Britain to the highest courts in Europe for breaches of basic European treaties. Legal advice suggests that it is in breach of regulation 827/68 on the common organisation of the market in certain products listed in annexe II of the treaty, and of European Council directive 98/58, which relates to the protection of animals kept for fur farming. It also breaches the general community law principles of the right to property and the freedom to pursue a trade or business and, most importantly, articles 28 and 29 of the European convention.

<P>
Before the debate on 15 May, I spoke to Torben Neilsen from Denmark, who assured me that the Bill cannot go through as it stands.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> What?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Other European countries cannot let the Bill go through in Britain without opposing it in the European courts. It is riveting to discover that the Minister has not taken advice on the matter. It is an interesting revelation, and shows how worthwhile it is to have such detailed debates.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I must repeat to the hon. Gentleman that my responsibility is to this country, to the people who elected us and whom we as a Government represent. We take decisions about our national interests and are not beholden to what other countries think about those decisions. I wonder whom the hon. Gentleman represents-his constituency or Denmark.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I have absolutely no constituency interest whatever in the matter. There is not one fur farm in my constituency. I represent the interests of people who find it difficult under the Government to make a living in the countryside from legitimate activities that are allowed in other European countries. That is the broad principle on which I act. I am merely reporting a telephone conversation with a very senior Dane in the fur business, who said that if the Bill goes through-

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I am really scared.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister should be. I find it regrettable that he has not done his research and does not realise how important the trade is to Denmark. It represents 4 per cent. of Danish GDP. [
Interruption.] There is a lot of chuntering in the background, but that feature of the legislation is important to the British taxpayer.

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> Not to clause 1.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> It is very relevant to clause 1, because that clause is at the heart of the Bill. We, alone of the European countries, are banning the activity. Having failed to find animal welfare arguments to ban it, we will ban it on moral grounds. That is a precedent that the Danes have said that they will not tolerate. I find it amazing that the Minister, having tried to get the measure through by the private Member's Bill route, which was frustrated, is using Government time to push-

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman withdraw that comment that the Minister tried through the private Member's Bill route? The Bill last year was mine.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I believe that it was a Government Bill, which used-

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> Although the Government supported the Bill, it was not theirs. I would prefer it if the hon. Gentleman would withdraw his suggestion that it was the Minister who promoted that Bill last year-it was me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> If my comments have upset the hon. Member for Garston, I am happy to withdraw them. However, I strongly suspect that an enormous amount of MAFF input went into drafting that Bill and that MAFF advice was involved as it proceeded. We know that the Minister has a strong interest in the matter.

<P>
It is interesting that Labour Members, whose strong views and depth of feeling I respect, have not investigated the consequences of enacting the Bill. If clause 1 is passed, we shall be setting ourselves apart, entirely independently, from other European nations for which this trade is most important.

<P>
I am merely reporting a telephone conversation; I may be proved wrong, but it is worth the Minister listening. He is about to engage the British taxpayer in an extremely costly legal battle that, according to the legal advice that I have received, he is likely to lose. The Minister shakes his head. What legal advice has he taken on the issue?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I shall deal with that when I reply to the debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us in detail about the legal advice that he has taken and how he intends to present the case in the European courts. He is right to say that he will stand up in the British Parliament, but he must realise that we have signed up to various European measures, and he is no longer the sole adjudicator in the matter. The Bill, and especially clause 1, will contravene important elements of European law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> My hon. Friend is making a strong case that follows on from the arguments that I advanced. European opposition will result. Where does my hon. Friend believe fur farmers who want to get out of the business and receive compensation will go? If the matter goes to a higher court in Europe, no one will pay a bean until it has been sorted out at the highest level. If the Minister has been advised that the provision is likely to lead to a protracted case in the European court, the Treasury will not hand over a penny until the matter has been resolved.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I ask the hon. Member for North Shropshire not to respond to that intervention. We shall discuss compensation when we reach clause 5. Hon. Members must stick to offences.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I was very mindful, and I expected you to leap to your feet on that point, Mr. Sayeed, as you duly did. I shall not be tempted by my hon. Friend, although he made a pertinent point, which I look forward to discussing. I feel extremely sorry for those fur farmers who remain in this country, who are left in an impossible position. We know that one has an exit route: he has an establishment in Denmark and will probably move his stock there. He can get out. However, those who are left are experiencing under-investment and are being persecuted. They are in an impossible position. I hope that we shall discuss the issue at some length, because it is also the nub of the NFU letter that compensation must be built into the Bill. However, we are not discussing compensation now.

<P>
I shall give the Minister time to respond. I have yet to read about any animal welfare grounds for banning the activity in this country or to read any report that the activity is cruel or could not be improved by further regulation. An enormous amount of regulation is available that should probably be implemented better, which is the Minister's responsibility. If the Minister has found evidence of cruelty, we would all want to stamp it out as quickly as possible. It would be much better if the Minister were engaged with European powers that know an awful lot more about the trade and to whom the trade is enormously important and worked with them in researching the matter. I should like to know whether evidence of cruelty has been found and why he does not use the improved regulation route. He has all the tools in his Ministry; he is the man charge.

<P>
I believe that we shall receive unsatisfactory answers to those questions. The Bill sets a most dangerous precedent. I have absolutely no constituency interest, but I represent a rural area, and people in rural areas should be allowed to make money from activities that are legal in the European Union. It is unnecessary for us to eat meat. We could all survive on cereals, and we would have a surplus, because the conversion rate is about 7 kg of grain to 1 kg of beef. None of us has to eat eggs. We could manage on vegetables and cereals, so other items are a luxury.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I like eating eggs, and I like backing beef farmers and consuming dairy products. That means that I must make an animal welfare judgment, because it is not kind to take a calf away from its mother in its first week. I am sure that Labour Members make similar judgments. If one wants to wear fur, for example, in Russia where it is a necessity, one makes an animal welfare judgment. It should be left to personal liberty. We have not debated that issue. Instead, we have been offered a vague notion of morality, which we have not explored either. The grounds for the Bill are dubious and have not been explained in detail. We know that the hon. Member for Garston is not fussed about the Bill's detail because no one will infringe it, and because she trusts the magistrate's common sense. That is a thoroughly incorrect basis on which to pass legislation.

<P>
We are heading for a huge, unnecessary, expensive and acrimonious legal battle with our European partners. Their big industries will not allow the Bill to become an Act, because it will set a precedent that will endanger many jobs and businesses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Morley:</B> We have had an interesting and wide-ranging debate on the clause, although some of the Opposition's arguments were incredible. Some Opposition Members seemed to say that we should stop what we are doing if some European countries do not like it, and that we cannot take action against the European mainstream if we are not in it. I will remember that when we debate the euro. I will tell the Opposition that we are isolated, so we will have to join the euro in the interests of other countries. What a load of nonsense.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Is the Minister referring to any of my comments? I did not make such remarks. The nub of my argument was that the Minister should work to improve the large volume of United Kingdom regulation and of European regulation. He should have consulted the Europeans first, because they will challenge us in the European courts and involve British taxpayers in a huge legal battle.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I will deal with that issue shortly, but the logic of what the hon. Gentleman says is that if other European countries do not like something, we cannot do it. I appreciate the fact that logic and the hon. Member for North Shropshire do not always go together, but he made a poor argument, which I do not accept.

<P>
The Bill has a moral justification. We must reach conclusions on a range of issues that have an ethical dimension, and we have done that on fur farming. It is not just a question of opinion polls. We consider them, and they reflect responses on an issue, but we take a broad view, based on the formal consultation on our proposals and the representations that we have received from the public, who have pressed for the Bill to be introduced.

<P>
Welfare, the environment and other issues must be considered, but we want fur farming to be banned because it is unethical. I repeat what I said on Second Reading; it is wrong to keep animals for slaughter, solely or primarly to exploit the value of their fur. Fur farming is not consistent with a proper value and respect for animal life. Animal life should not be destroyed in the absence of sufficient justification in terms of public benefit. Nor should animals be bred for destruction without such justification. I cannot be clearer than that.

<P>
None of the cage sizes and designs used in fur farms in this country meets satisfactory standards. However, our decision to ban fur farming is taken on moral grounds, so it would be wrong to introduce standards when the object is to phase out the entire industry. The majority of fur farms could probably not afford to introduce the standards-including security standards-that we would regard as acceptable. It would not be viable in this sort of business. I emphasise, however, that our position goes beyond the welfare issue. Welfare is part of it, but it is an ethical issue. We base our case on public morality and we are convinced that it is right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister has confirmed our view that a welfare issue is at stake. He argued that none of the fur farmers currently operating in this country meets the high standards that the Government deem necessary. Will he enlighten the Committee about those higher welfare standards? Why opt for a total ban if higher welfare standards will meet the Government's requirements?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I have already answered that. We are banning the practice on ethical grounds. As I said, arguing purely on welfare grounds is irrelevant and, in any case, it goes beyond the clause stand part debate.

<P>
I was asked about donations to the Labour party from the Political Animal Lobby. We are pleased to receive its financial support and we made it public at a time when other political parties did not make public declarations of their funds. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire does not seem to realise that the Political Animal Lobby also donated significant sums to the Conservative party, which was glad to receive them. It is true that it donated larger amounts to the Labour party. That is obviously because it judged the Labour party to be by far the best on animal welfare issues. Furthermore, our decision to ban fur farming was taken before we received the donation. Donations were given by the Political Animal Lobby to encourage political parties to take animal welfare seriously. It examined what each party said in its manifesto and gave donations accordingly.

<P>
I was asked about cage sizes, security and the Council of Europe. We have rightly participated in the Council: we have considerable expertise and excellent professional vets and scientists who are experts in animal welfare. I make no apology for that. When the Council of Europe issued new cage standards, we made it clear that they did not go far enough for the UK. They are minimum standards. Applying those European standards to fur farms in this country would not meet our welfare criteria. I repeat, they do not go far enough.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I have only five minutes left and I want to continue.

<P>
Another issue that touches on similar moral and ethical arguments is commercial whaling, which we do not support. Indeed, Conservative Members did not support it when they were in government. The principal reason is, simply, ethical. We do not believe that there is a need to harpoon whales for food and chemicals when we can secure them in alternative ways. We participate in the International Whaling Commission and provide it with expertise through scientific working parties, even though we are against commercial whaling. If Conservative Members are against applying ethics to animal welfare, the logic of their argument is to support commercial whaling and the force-feeding of geese, which we do not support.

<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire mentioned legal advice. I have a choice. To whom do I listen, my legal advisers with all their expertise and knowledge or the hon. Gentleman? With the greatest respect to him, it is not much of a competition. Our legal advisers have made it clear that the Bill complies with European law; it is our responsibility as a Government to make sure that it does. We are convinced that we have done everything to make it compatible. We are responding to the wishes of the people of our country, and we are determined to proceed in the knowledge that what we are doing is perfectly legal. We will defend that position.

<P>
