<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the remainder of the Bill be considered in the following order: Clause 32, Clauses 35 to 38, Clauses 40 to 42, Clauses 33 and 34, Clause 39, Clauses 43 to 53, New Clauses, Schedules 1 to 3, New Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The motion primarily concerns the handling of Clause 34, which could significantly affect the debate on that clause and clauses 33 and 39, which refer to clause 34.
<P>
Clause 33 applies the Bill's provisions to those in Crown employment. Clause 34 qualifies that application with regard to members of the armed forces and provides flexible provisions that are designed to reflect the unique status of service men and women. Those provisions include the potential to set a longer pay reference period for armed forces personnel; the facility to pay the hourly rate by reference to notional or average hours worked in that period; the flexibility to include or exclude particular benefits from the calculation and the freedom for the armed forces to keep their own record-keeping procedures and to use their internal service procedures for redress.
<P>
Unlimited liability for duty is essential to the operational effectiveness of the armed forces. All service personnel accept the need to be available for duty when required and recognise that duties will vary according to the needs of the service and that pay is not adapted to reflect work rates. The current operational circumstances facing our service men in a wide range of locations--Northern Ireland, Bosnia and the Gulf--underline the fundamental importance of maintaining that ethos and commitment.
<P>
In acknowledgement of that, service men and women bind themselves to a particular form of service that accepts that the requirements of the service are paramount. In return, it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that service pay is determined in a way that is fair and recognises those unique circumstances.
<P>
As the notes on clauses makes clear, in putting forward clause 34 the Government have sought to ensure consistency and universality in the application of the minimum wage. The flexibility built into the clause aims to include the armed forces in the ambit of the Bill without damaging their capabilities or undermining their operational and military effectiveness. We have been considering carefully the practicalities of applying the national minimum wage in the diverse circumstances in which the armed forces operate.
<P>
I ask therefore that the discussion of clauses 33, 34 and 39 be deferred as set out in the order of consideration. That will ensure that the Committee has the opportunity fully to debate and scrutinise the clauses and the Government amendments to exempt the armed forces, rather than having to wait for the Committee to report the Bill to the House, for Third Reading or for the Bill's consideration in another place.
<P>
The Government's view is that service men and women should not be disadvantaged by being exempt from direct coverage of the Bill. We have therefore examined the current arrangements provided by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. That body offers a well-established system that has gained the widespread confidence of individuals in the service, who have no collective or individual bargaining rights, and who think the system fair. The body's annual review takes into account a broad range of factors, including comparability with civilian pay and the overall balance of advantages and disadvantages in service life.
<P>
The effects of implementing the national minimum wage will, therefore, feed through to service pay in comparisons with civilian sector jobs undertaken by the review body in formulating its recommendations to the Government. It is open to the Government to include in its economic and other evidence to the review body any factor such as the relationship of service pay to the national minimum wage or the situation of the lowest paid service men and women. The current review body arrangements are flexible and robust enough to provide a fair level of remuneration for the armed forces and ensure that service pay does not fall below the national minimum wage. By utilising the existing mechanisms for determining armed forces pay, we will be able to complement the arrangements in the Bill for applying the national minimum wage to other sectors without disturbing the armed forces' unique position.
<P>
The initial inclusion of the current clause 34 and the decision that I have announced today simply acknowledge the unique position of the armed forces, which has been recognised by all parties over the years. It should not be seen by Opposition Members or anyone else as a precedent for the treatment of any other groups. I should add for the avoidance of doubt that we intend that civilian employees of the Ministry of Defence will continue to be covered by the Bill.
<P>
I ask the Committee to support the new order of consideration.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. In error, a number of amendments to clauses 30 and 31 appear on the amendment paper. We have passed that point in the Bill. Therefore, I ask the Committee to note that we shall commence our discussion at amendments Nos. 197 and 232 to clause 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I do not need to detain the Committee at length on the new order of consideration motion because we shall have a substantive debate on the armed forces later. We must take into account what the Minister of State has said.
<P>
Before discussing the new order of consideration, I should say personally that I have been somewhat distracted over the weekend by other preoccupations. I am very grateful for the best wishes and support that I have received from all quarters of the House which have been of great help in the circumstances.
<P>
I am minded to comment briefly on the way in which our consideration is proceeding. I do not say that in any flippant sense. I have the impression that, even though we will consider the armed forces in due course, hostilities in Committee, metaphorically, have ceased, but our vigilance remains. To pursue the military metaphor, the fact that the new order of consideration had not appeared even last night reminds me of the old joke about military orders--an order is followed by a counter-order which is followed by disorder. We shall not rub that in, but will give a fair wind to the motion.
<P>
The problem is that we have undertaken a heavy period of consideration. I am painfully conscious of that, and the minor and uncharacteristic slip on the amendment paper reveals the pressure under which all hon. Members and the staff who support the Committee have been working. Depending on what one counts as on duty and off, we put in about 50 hours of unpaid service last week. To borrow and slightly modify the Minister's phrase, we were constantly available for duty, permanently at risk and utterly unpaid for the task. We make no complaint about that--we do not have to undertake that task.
<P>
There is a problem with the consideration of the armed forces clauses and a parallel difficulty with the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission, which, amazingly, has now been tabled. For many hours we have hoped for a sighting of that rare bird. Now it has come along; we all look like twitchers--we have sighted it in our telescopes and are analysing it in detail. Given the difficulties in getting our wise Chairmen to haul us back to issues already dealt with by the Committee--those under new clause 7, for example--we will do our best to raise those substantive matters.
<P>
My regret about the Minister's reordering motion is that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), who may wish to speak to the motion, has done a great deal of work on the amendment that he has tabled. I think that the Minister could have debated clause 33 through my hon. Friend's amendment. I am not sure whether that is possible in technical terms--I have not had enough notice to consider the matter. The Committee could have listened to the exchanges, and if the Minister were so minded, he could magnanimously have said that my hon. Friend is right, as he is.
<P>
Instead, the Minister has--if one likes to speak in bridge terms--launched a shut-out bid to consideration of my hon. Friend's amendment. That should make the Committee as anxious as it makes Opposition Members, and my hon. Friend is entitled to be sad about it. To revert to the military metaphor, it seems that Government Members have finally walked out with their hands up, before hostilities have really begun.
<P>
The Minister has lost the mother of all battles with the Ministry of Defence. The Ministry has destroyed the universality of his Bill's application to adults. The announcement that the Minister has made this morning means that some adults, who are British citizens and employees, will not now be entitled to receive the minimum wage. There are probably good military reasons for that and the Committee will debate them in relation to the relevant clauses.
<P>
It is interesting and revealing, however, that that exception is made in the public sector. The circumstances of an employee in the private sector could raise similar considerations to those involved in the exception. There could be a good reason for temporary derogation from the provisions of the national minimum wage, as the Committee has debated at some length. There would be no means of recourse in such circumstances. The clause has opened up a further anomaly in the Bill.
<P>
In giving a fair wind and good will to the Minister concerning his new ordering of the Bill, I conclude simply that the ordering is a defeat for old Labour at the hands of new Labour. It is a triumph of the expedient over the principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I apologise to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for arriving a moment or two late. I think that I was able to understand the drift of the Minister's comments.
<P>
I rise to briefly express my support for the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). In the Chairman's provisional selection of amendments, there are a series of amendments tabled to clause 34 which would have allowed the Committee to debate the very issues that the Minister has raised.
<P>
While I defer to the superior knowledge of more senior colleagues, and indeed to the Chairman, to find the proper procedures for such matters, there seems to be no reason why the debate could not have been held this morning, within the scope of the proposed amendments to clause 34. In speaking to the amendments that I have tabled, I should have put forward much the same arguments as the Minister.
<P>
It is with great difficulty that I try to understand the Minister's purpose in wishing to reorder the debate to take clauses 33 and 34 out of consideration this morning. Hon. Members must wonder whether some more political purpose exists for doing that, as it does not seem to in any way facilitate the debate

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I should first make clear that the proposal, if agree to, will not undermine the capacity of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge to move his amendments. They are safe--they are in the bag until the Committee may decide otherwise.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry came to the Committee with a blunderbuss. The only battle in which the Government are involved, and that they are interested in waging and winning is the battle against low pay. So far, we are winning hands down against the hon. Gentleman. He has surrendered somewhat and has agreed to have reasonable discussions between now and the end of the Committee's consideration of the Bill.
<P>
I should make it clear that we are talking about a group of personnel who are in a unique position because of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. I made it clear at the outset that the arrangements I have set out apply the national minimum wage to other sectors without disturbing the unique position of the armed forces. I also made it clear that the Government expect the services' pay not to fall below the national minimum wage because of the way in which the armed services review board operates. Because of those commitments and understandings, the Government propose to deal with the matter in the way that is set out in the motion. I ask my colleagues to support the motion, which is not a defeat for the Government, but a way of promoting good, orderly business and of getting through a complex and detailed Bill. As a result, when we reach the end of the Bill, every worker will have the opportunity to have a minimum wage through the Bill or through the Armed Forces Pay Review Body.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the remainder of the Bill be considered in the following order: Clause 32, Clauses 35 to 38, Clauses 40 to 42, Clauses 33 and 34, Clause 39, Clauses 43 to 53, New Clauses, Schedules 1 to 3, New Schedules.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 197, in page 21, line 37, leave out from `done' to end of line and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at the worker's place of residence or at another place under the control of the worker.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 232, in page 21, line 37, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or other persons not being the employer of that individual'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The provisions of clause 32 define the term ``home worker'' by reference to where work is carried out. For a person to be a home worker, the work that he is contracted to do is required to be carried out in a place that is not under the control of management of the employer. The amendment would replace that definition. For a person to be defined as a home worker, the work must be carried out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at the worker's place of residence or at another place under the control of the worker.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The definition of a home worker in the clause is too broad and is counter-intuitive. Most people would understand the term ``home worker'' to mean a person who works at home. As I understand the clause, it could cover a maintenance engineer who carries out his daily work on the premises of a third party. That is manifestly a place that is not under the control or management of the employer; equally, however, the engineer is not doing home work in the usual definition or understanding of the term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way at an early stage in his consideration. Does he agree that a person such as a maintenance engineer might work in several properties in the course of a working day? There would, therefore, be a further complication as regards the overlapping nature of that employment, as we have discussed in other contexts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right and draws attention to a further result of the way in which subsection (2) is drafted. We need, however, go no further than to draw the Committee's attention to the obviously unsatisfactory definition of a home worker as a person who works in a place outside the control or management of his employer.
<P>
In drafting the amendment, I have sought to allow for reality; I have have not sought to limit the amendment to a person who works in his own place of residence, which would be too narrow. I have included the worker's residence or another place that is under his control in the definition of the term ``home worker''. That will satisfactorily bring the term into line with what the plain-speaking man--if I may put it like that--would understand by it.
<P>
The significance of the term ``home worker'' is that subsection (1) modifies the effect of clause 51 in respect of home workers. Thus, who is and is not covered by the definition of a home worker becomes a matter of importance. I am concerned that the current broad definition and the exclusion in subsection (1) of the requirement that the work be done personally could result in anomalous outcomes for those who work as agents, for example. Subsection (1) and the broad definition in subsection (2) extend the clause's remit and thus its scope for damage.
<P>
My argument is simple. The definition of a home worker is well understood and the Bill should be amended to reflect in plain English what is understood by that term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Huw Edwards </B>(Monmouth): I can assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody that I am awake this morning. I have had a refreshing weekend afte last week's marathon sessions, which I enjoyed so much. In the past few days many people have congratulated me and my hon. Friends on persisting with the Bill against continual opposition to almost every clause by the official Opposition. Labour Members have hastened the introduction of the national minimum wage in the past seven days.
<P>
I want to oppose the amendment of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. Clause 32 will close a loophole. Home workers are generally covered by clause 1, but clause 32 provides that a home worker
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``means an individual who contracts with a person, for the purposes of that person's business, for the execution of work to be done in a place not under the control or management of that person.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly excludes the self-employed. A maintenance engineer, which was the example given by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, would surely be covered by the Bill as either an employee or a self-employed worker. I suspect that many maintenance engineers are self-employed, in which case they are excluded from the legislation.
<P>
It is important to close the loophole through which certain home workers have fallen in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have been following the hon. Gentleman's argument and I understand what he is saying, but will he give us examples of home workers who would be benefited by the provision? He said that my example would be excluded for other reasons, but will he give an example of someone whom the clause will include?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> The clause will include all home workers who are deemed to be home workers under the Bill.
<P>
Certain people were excluded from previous employment legislation because they were not deemed to perform the work personally--they may have delegated or had the assistance of others. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996 certain workers were deemed not to perform work personally because they were assisted by others--family members, for example. The Wages Act 1986 provided that an individual who made use of the services of two or more people was not carrying out the contract as a home worker. It excluded such workers from its provisions and they were therefore excluded from wages council coverage, whether they knew about wages councils or not. We have established that many home workers were blissfully unaware that they were covered by the wage council's remit and that they were subject to very low rates of remuneration.
<P>
We must remind ourselves of the profile, circumstances and characteristics of home workers. A very good study was done a few years ago which showed that the majority of home workers worked such long hours for such little reward only because they had no choice. Most were trapped in the home by the need to care for young children or by their own disablement or age or, as we know now, by the need to care for others as well. I refer to that vast army of carers which provides so much important social care provision.
<P>
Most home workers are women, usually with children; one in two comes from an ethnic minority. They invariably earn exceedingly low rates of remuneration for long hours and often have to work to intolerable deadlines. Let us consider two or three examples of people who might now be covered in the Bill. There is the mother facing an intolerable deadline who may ask her children to assist in perfectly safe packing or assembly work to meet that deadline. There is the woman from an ethnic minority living in an extended family who may have the assistance of other family members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On the very example that the hon. Gentleman has just quoted, he is positing a situation in which a person who is entitled to the minimum wage would subcontract the work to persons who might not be entitled to it by virtue of their age. Is he proposing that the minimum wage should be payable for all the work if the lead worker comes within the scope of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> I did not use the word ``subcontract''; there is no contract. There might be informal assistance. One must accept the reality: people who live with other people may wish for assistance to ensure that a deadline is met.
<P>
I was talking about the person from an ethnic minority, perhaps a woman, living in an extended family who may get assistance.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> No, not now. I have just answered that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> This is on another point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> Perhaps later.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is not giving way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
In this example, the person may receive assistance from others or may go to another place to do the work, which may not be that person's home. There is also the carer, looking after a disabled person who may be elderly, or even younger, than the carer, who might get some assistance. That person may be caring for two people and would thereby have been excluded from legislation in the past.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to remove the loophole which existed under previous employment legislation. It is to the Government's credit that home workers are covered in the Bill. They will not be treated as second-class workers. They will have adequate protection under the law. Clause 32 closes a loophole and ensures that all home workers are covered, even if they get assistance from others. Amendments Nos. 197 and 232 would keep the loophole open, and I ask the Committee to resist them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I support amendment No. 197 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I, as well as amendment No. 232 in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Solihull (Mr. Taylor). I confess that I was surprised at the tone of the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards). The amendments are both intended to be helpful to the argument and to the home workers who will be affected by the provisions.
<P>
Amendment No. 197 seeks to alter clause 32(2), as the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not under the control or management of that person''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
creates a certain problem, not least for home workers. I imagine that other members of the Committee have received representations from the National Group on Homeworking. That wording as it stands creates the possible interpretation that the premisses are not the responsibility of the person who is contracting with the home worker for the production of work in their home or other place. Amendment No. 197 would turn things round: it presents the legislation in the form of the control vested in the home worker, either at their place of residence or elsewhere. It does not have the original wordings's negative connotation that the definition is that the person contracting for the outwork to be done is not responsible for, or has no control over, that place of residence.
<P>
Material provided by the National Group on Homeworking says that it is concerned that the interpretation of the law subsequent to the passing of the Bill would suggest that employers have no control over the workplace and are not legally responsible for the volume of material supplied, the hours worked at piece rates or hazards in the home-workplace. I freely acknowledge that we are speculating on the future interpretation of the Bill, but accepting amendment No. 197 would minimise the chance of misinterpretation and produce a more robust definition.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps my intervention on the hon. Member for Monmouth was badly framed, but I cannot think of a home worker as defined by the Bill who would not be defined as a home worker under the amendment. Can my hon. Friend think of an example which would give ground for opposing the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I do not think that my hon. Friend's intervention was unclear; it was entirely appropriate and I share his view that the amendment would not restrict the definition of home workers or limit their inclusion within the definition of worker in clause 51. That is not the amendment's purpose. It would put a better construction on the definition of the place of work of a home worker and remove the risk of misinterpretation.
<P>
I have to confess that amendment No. 232 leaves me with some uncertainty, but no doubt that is caused by my ignorance. I look forward to hearing from my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. There is a degree of difficulty with the current construction. It is intended to close a loophole; otherwise, home workers working with family or friends would be excluded from the definition of home workers under clause 51. It is desirable to include them, but the way in which that has been done is less than straightforward. The amendment is more straightforward: home workers or outworkers may supply work to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other persons not being the employer''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would stop clause 51 biting on them and removing them from the definition of worker. The amendments are helpful to home workers and deal with their position in a more straightforward manner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and for Runnymede and Weybridge for moving the amendments. I shall speak, first, about the relative narrow compass of the amendments and, secondly, more generally about home working.
<P>
The amendments probe some of the uncertainties that were well exposed by my hon. Friend. Although the clause and its accompanying explanations appear seductively straightforward, when one analyses the text, it is difficult to see what will happen in practice. I can readily confirm that the amendments are designed not to wreck the Government's intention that the Bill should embrace home workers, but to try to examine the practical implications of situations that may arise.
<P>
Legally, we are all up to our eyebrows, but the notes on clauses state as clearly as possible that for the purposes of the Bill most home workers are employees because they work at home under specific instructions, although those instructions refer to the number of items to be prepared rather than the number of hours to be worked or the nature of the work. The National Group on Homeworking is concerned about whether employers and quasi-employers treat their home workers fairly.
<P>
My concern when I tabled my amendment related to the possibility of overlapping employments. A person working at home for one employer could enlist the services of other family members who could simultaneously be working for other employers. The individual home worker might not be in an employment relationship with any one person.
<P>
That situation will probably not arise--I hope that it will not. From the discussions that have taken place so far--I look forward to the Minister's response--I understand that if there were a one-to-one relationship, other family members working for someone else would be excluded from the calculation. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify that point. We share his objective to ensure that, if there is a move towards home working, home workers should be treated on an all-fours basis, whatever arrangements are made within the family and however many family members or other people in the house are involved. Similarly, every employment or quasi-employment involving the individual or group should be covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will my hon. Friend address himself to the issue that I mentioned earlier? If a person can establish that he is a home worker within the terms of the clause, anybody who shares in that work, regardless of age or other status defined in the Bill, will be remunerated at the level of the national minimum wage. If people are brought within the scope of the Bill who would not otherwise be included, will that not encourage employers to try to avoid having a lead worker who passes out work to others?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I was coming to the general implications of the clause, which have been mentioned in the debate. The issue is complicated. There will be overlapping employments and individuals who may be working at different times for different people within a single household, not, by definition, at the place of employment. It is important to get the clause right.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is right to stress the dynamic issues of the clause. Inevitably, in cases where the employer or commissioner of the work is less scrupulous than the Minister or I would wish, there will be attempts to frustrate the operation of the clause by devising new arrangements. I do not think that I would win the jackpot if I were to suggest that the most likely one is reformulating the work as self-employment, with a contract to supply a certain number of goods rather than an employment contract. That would clearly be a matter of law with regard to the Bill and the Inland Revenue, among others.
<P>
I want to confirm that, within the context of the Bill, which we do not like, we are prepared to accept the Government's intention to include home workers and thus to treat them fairly. We, too, are concerned about the position of home workers because, clearly, some do not get an appropriate return for the work that they do. If one is in the business of providing for a national minimum wage, it might seem appropriate for it to bite on them.
<P>
The submission of the National Group on Homeworking details concern about how existing legislation operates on various matters. The Government should consider their response, bearing in mind--as they will--the need not to have unnecessary regulation, and the cost. No one wants to see a huge group of inspectors, although concern has been expressed about that.
<P>
To pick up the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, there is a question about the overall dynamic effects of the measure. It seems that if the Low Pay Commission is to continue in business by considering matters relating to Bill's operation, it should have regard to what happens in practice with home working--whether the legislation eliminates any undesirable practices or whether, sadly, it triggers off a further clutch of undesirable situations or even has perverse effects.
<P>
The amendments are not wrecking amendments. They are designed to probe what is to happen. We are anxious that the provision works in a practical way, despite its complex definitions, and we look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I should like to support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for South Cambridgeshire and for Runnymede and Weybridge. The clause shows some tortuousness in the Government's attempt to close a loophole. It will not work satisfactorily, but the amendment would enable it to work rather more satisfactorily.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that tortuousness is the enemy of easily enforced or implemented legislation? There is always a danger that if it is difficult for even the Committee to understand the exact implications of the clause, unscrupulous employers will work out arrangements designed to frustrate its intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. One of my reasons for supporting the amendment is precisely because it would make the clause more comprehensible while being no less comprehensive. I therefore hope that the Government will welcome it. If we are to have a national minimum wage, one does not want genuine home workers to be excluded. If that is the Bill's purpose, one does not want to create loopholes for unscrupulous employers.
<P>
The clause would be improved by the amendments. One unsatisfactory aspect of it is the creation of a special definition of worker specifically for home workers. The Government have gone to great trouble to create a definition of workers that does not encompass only employees. They got that far, but they have now discovered that they need to add a few twists and turns to try to cover home workers. That leads to unsatisfactory drafting.
<P>
The notes on clauses reveals more discomfort on the Government's part as a result of the clause. It states, as Ministers have done frequently, that the clause derives from the Wages Act 1986, which was passed by the previous Government. They admit, however, that that Government subsequently repealed large parts of it. They go on to admit that, although the clause derives from that Act, it completely changes it because the comprehensive definition of what constitutes a home worker in the 1986 Act is unsatisfactory for the Government's purposes. The Government are having to jump through all these hoops because they are trying to achieve something that is impractical. The amendments would, however, make their aims more practical.
<P>
The Government are clearly right to be concerned about the fact that home workers may be affected by low pay. We have all seen the figures, some of which the hon. Member for Monmouth quoted. I welcome that hon. Gentleman's return in an active sense to our deliberations. It is good to see that daylight causes speech on the Government Benches; that is tremendously refreshing for Conservative Members. The silent night is now over.
<P>
If the Government are genuinely keen on home workers and on giving them extra protection, I would commend some of the recommendations of the National Group on Homeworking to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend touches on why the Government's amended definition from the Wages Act 1986 achieves the intention that they have specified. It excludes the genuinely self-employed and includes everybody else, but the definition in clause 32 does not seem to bear on that. The point about the residence being under the control of the person who does the work may be true for both the genuinely self-employed and for home workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Absolutely. The clause misses its target, and the Government are discovering that it is extremely difficult to draw a hard and fast line between those who are genuinely self-employed and those who are not. The amendments draw that line better than the Government's own efforts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Has my hon. Friend also considered that the place of work might be somewhere other than the home? On one occasion, I was due to conduct a surgery, but the town hall was locked and I conducted most of my surgery in my car.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is a fascinating point. I am not clear whether my hon. Friend is claiming that, in the days before the vote on Members' pay in the previous Parliament, he was working at a level of pay that would have made him subject to minimum wage legislation. There are few harder-working Members in the House, and my hon. Friend is available to his constituents 168 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. Nevertheless, I am surprised that he should regard himself as potentially subject to minimum wage legislation as a Member of the House. I shall, however, bear that in mind.
<P>
The point that I was going to make about home workers was that the National Group on Homeworking has made concrete recommendations. Those would be available to the Government if they wanted to give home workers added protection, but they have neglected to consider them. The group has, for example, recommended that home workers should earn a premium of 10 per cent. above the national minimum wage to compensate for overheads. That bears directly on whether we regard a home worker as someone who, by definition, works in his own home.
<P>
The clause does not deal with such complications around the edges of what constitutes a home worker. It neglects some of the practical considerations that those who campaign on behalf of home workers are--so far unsuccessfully--urging on the Government. I hope that the Minister will explain why he has not followed the advice of the National Group on Homeworking; if he did so, he might earn more credit from those working in that field.
<P>
The danger of the tortuous definition of home working is that it assumes that home working will be the same in the future as it was in the past. I suspect that we shall find that increasing amounts of traditional home working go to high value-added industries and will, therefore, be less likely to suffer low pay. Home working should be tied up in unnecessary red tape only with extreme reluctance. Home working may not be what the Government and some evidence present it as. It is presented as a last resort for people who cannot do any other type of work and who are forced to take low-paid work. It may become a desirable activity for all sorts of people--obviously most of them parents with young children--and it can involve high-value added work. It should therefore be left alone to some extent, to be a flexible and growing sector of the economy.
<P>
The amendments would improve the clause. I hope that the Minister and the Government will look on them favourably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I must say to the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) right away that the National Group on Homeworking will choke on the thought that he and the Opposition have spoken in the Committee using an extensive knowledge of and brief on the effects of poverty pay on home workers as a shield for their continual opposition to the effective inclusion of such workers in the legislation. That is a calumny. The hon. Gentleman even had the audacity to quote the National Group on Homeworking in defence of the Conservatives' position. The amendment would exclude a significant number of home workers from the Bill. The Opposition are then pleased with themselves for having produced a measure to assist home workers.
<P>
It beggars belief to suggest that such a proposal would be seen by homeworkers as anything other than a smokescreen for Conservative Members' continual opposition to home workers receiving the minimum wage, and for their support of the Arthur Daleys of this world who want to continue to pay home workers as little as 30p an hour or less. The Committee has seen increasingly that if Opposition Members can get their boot into home workers, they will. In the Committee's consideration of every clause so far, if the Opposition have been able to table amendments that effects home workers, they have not passed up the opportunity.
<P>
Home workers are watching the Committee's deliberations. Some of them are in the National Group on Homeworking, but many of them are in isolation, without people representing them, and relying on the press to report the proceedings. They and Labour Members see Opposition Members for what they really are--apologists for low pay and for the exploitation of home workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I appreciate that the Minister has already had a severe disappointment this morning. Does he accept at face value my suggestion, which was meant in good faith, that the Low Pay Commission should examine the operation of the Bill with regard to home workers? That suggestion is not designed to be subversive, but to establish what will happen and whether the Bill will achieve the objectives the Government say it should.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is not getting off the hook in that way. He did not stand up to make a speech about the Low Pay Commission but to support two amendments, including one that he has tabled, that seek to restrict the capacity of home workers to establish their right to a minimum wage. The hon. Gentleman has opposed the Low Pay Commission since the moment it was set up, and Conservative Members have not uttered a single word in support of it. It is a bit rich for the hon. Gentleman to say now that the Low Pay Commission should examine some issues that concern low-paid workers, as a cover up for the Conservatives' continued opposition to the inclusion of home workers in the Bill.
<P>
The Low Pay Commission has been considering issues that relate to home working. It has met home workers and taken evidence from them. One of its most poignant sessions related to home workers and what they are having put up with after 18 years of Tory Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, I shall not give way for the moment.
<P>
Opposition Members have spoken about a number of problems that they believe will arise from the clause. I make no apology for the fact that the clause is one of a family of measures in the Bill that will secure across the board the right of home workers and other vulnerable workers to receive a minimum wage. The Government are all too aware that employers exist, whether or not they are a minority, who will be quite prepared to find a means of re-establishing or rearranging their employment relations with home workers to ensure that they are not covered by the minimum wage. We are not prepared to allow that to happen or for the Bill to be defective so that after its enactment the Arthur Daleys of this world can get around their obligation to pay the national minimum wage. We make no excuses for trying to pin down as best we can bad practices in the labour market which will be used as they have been over time and throughout the period that the previous Government were in office, when nothing was done about it, to prevent home workers from getting their basic minimum entitlements, including wages.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised a point about self-employed maintenance engineers. If they are genuinely self-employed, they are not covered by the Bill. If they are employed by an employer, their relationship is with that employer and they will be entitled to the national minimum wage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman in a minute. He raised a number of points and when he has heard my answers he may not wish to rise again.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about some people caught by the clause who do not work at home. He gave again the example of the maintenance engineer and about overlapping. So what? Overlapping does not matter. Whether someone is a home worker or a general worker, he should be covered by the legislation in any event and entitled to the minimum wage. The Government provided the broader definition of ``worker'' in the Bill to ensure that people do not slip through the net and not receive their entitlements.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will not give way now. The hon. Gentleman also asked about young family members who might otherwise be excluded under clause 3 being covered by the Bill because they are home workers. The answer to that is no. If there is an exemption or a different rate for young workers, it will apply to young workers. That is the purpose of the Low Pay Commission's making recommendations and the Government's considering them under clause 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I want to make two points on the issues raised by the Minister. First, I do not understand how it will be possible to ensure that persons who are excluded by virtue of their age are not entitled to the minimum wage if the employer is blind as to who is doing the work. Secondly, the Minister has resisted the temptation to give a single example of someone who would be excluded from the scope of the clause if the amendment were adopted and has thus failed to show that it would have a detrimental effect. I cannot envisage a single such example.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is not the case; I have given some examples. We can include those working in the homes of friends or family. That is a common practice among home workers. A group of home workers might get together in a single household, but under the hon. Gentleman's proposals, the other workers would be excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will give way in a moment. The hon. Gentleman also asked about other workers. When premises are rented by one worker for home working, by virtue of that rental arrangement, under the hon. Gentleman's proposal, other home workers working in that enterprise would be excluded from receiving the national minimum wage. We are not prepared to allow such loopholes. It would be quite easy to drag a coach and horses through the arrangements for a massive number of home workers to be excluded from the right to earn the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> I have just thought of an example, and wish that I had remembered it a few minutes ago. Let us take the example of someone whose job is assembling giant teddy bears. There may not be enough room in their front room to assemble these bears, so they have an informal arrangement with the local village hall or Sunday school hall to assemble them there. Under the hon. Gentleman's amendment, such people would be excluded from receiving the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is interesting; it goes to the heart of what I said about rented premises when occasionally premises other than the home are rented or used. Such premises can be attached to or away from the home but they are used for the purposes of doing the work for which home workers have a contract. That arrangement should not be used to exclude home workers from their right to a minimum wage. That is why the clause is so important.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised the issue of overlapping employment--of one home worker assisted by family members who are working for someone else. There is a one-to-one relationship between the home worker and the employer, who must pay the home worker the minimum wage. There is no overlapping relationship between the employer and any family member who is assisting the home worker, except in one circumstance, namely where the home worker is a lead worker who supervises other home workers.
<P>
That is no different to the situation in factories where a supervisor manages the delivery, execution, standard and collection of work. In the home, a lead worker or those who work with him should not be excluded from the national minimum wage; a normal work practice which occurs throughout industry can take place at home just as it does in the workplace. There is no difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire wondered whether people who supply work to the home of a home worker could be interpreted as controlling his home. That is incorrect. The supplier controls the goods, their delivery and the contractual arrangement between them, but he has no responsibility for what happens in the home.
<P>
What the supplier should do is implement a good employment practice. For example, the previous Government deregulated health and safety issues such as protection for home workers who use dangerous materials. Those regulations were supposedly outdated. Instead of republishing the regulations, the previous Government got rid of them--in total. Materials used by home workers should be delivered and used safely, but that should not be interpreted as controlling the home worker's home. That is a responsibility for the home worker.
<P>
None of the issues raised by Conservative Members were points of substance. They do not undermine or damage the Government's capacity to make the clause effective. Home workers demand that the Bill be effective. For far too long they have put up with being isolated and excluded from the employment rights enjoyed by every other worker. In the main, they are women who have been excluded from other aspects of society because of their caring responsiblities in the home. They are particularly vulnerable to exploitation.
<P>
The vulnerability of such people is all the worse when those who exploit them are, for example, selling a jersey for &#163;65 in a local shop when they pay 20 pence for putting it together. Not only are such workers being exploited over pay, but they have to walk by the shop and cannot afford to buy the very jumper that they have made. That rubs salt into the wound in a big way. I urge my hon. Friends to resist the amendments and support the retention of the clause as it stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am disappointed with the Minister's tone. I shall not press my amendment to a vote, but my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge may have his own views on amendment No. 197 in view of the storm of abuse and execration with which it was received.
<P>
Embedded in my amendment is the concern which arose from the Government's clarification that two employments conducted simultaneously should attract the national minimum wage. There are a huge variety of informal and family arrangements. An individual could be deemed to be employed by one person and further employed by a second even if only one lot of home work--one set of pieces--was being turned out at any one time. Such a person could have built up an entitlement to a double national minimum wage or even multiple national minimum wages.
<P>
The amendment has nothing to do with an alleged attack on home workers' inclusion within the national minimum wage. I hope, but fear not, that the Minister will accept our assurances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I, too, am disappointed with the Minister's response. If this is peacetime, I dread to think what wartime was like. I ask the Minister to accept my assurance that the amendment was not intended to wreck the clause and was not, as he suggested, an attempt to exclude great armies of deserving and worthy people from the Bill's protection. I rather resent the Minister's implied slur on the motives of Opposition Members. I merely sought to tidy up the definition, which simply does not accord with people's everyday understanding of the term home worker.
<P>
The Minister gave no effective reason why the amendment could not be accepted and he did not show that it would cause any damage. In view of the inadequacy of the response and the particularly aggressive tone in which it was couched, I want to press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall address myself primarily to amendment Nos. 239 and 240. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire may want to address amendment No. 237, which is, coincidentally, identical to Government amendment No. 159.
<P>
I tabled the amendments to clauses 35 and 36 in order to obtain an assurance from the Minister that the Government intend to apply the legislation to staff of the House of Lords and the House of Commons in exactly the same way as to the staff of any private-sector business. It appears that the reference to employment in these clauses is more limited than in the remainder of the Bill as it applies to other businesses.
<P>
I seek only to be reassured that the clause will operate in exactly the same way in the House of Commons and the House of Lords as in the rest of the world. We have recounted certain difficulties that we anticipate business will face as a result of the Bill. When legislation is imposed which affects business, it is important that the Government, the House of Commons and the House of Lords are subjected to the same difficulties and are required to resolve them. It is unhelpful, unsatisfactory and liable to be misinterpreted in the country at large if the Government, Parliament and their branches find difficulties for themselves in implementing legislation that is applied to the remainder of the country.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government appear to be suggesting not that it will be difficult for public authorities to implement the legislation in the same way as every other business and activity, but that if they fail to do so, they should not be subject to the same procedure as everybody else? Is that not the peculiar situation in which we find ourselves?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Indeed, that is one of the peculiarities of clauses 35 and 36, but to remain in order, I will stick to the point that I was making about the amendment. We seek reassurance from the Minister. The complexity of drafting, particularly in clause 51(3)(b), may mean that the Minister is able to assure me that the Bill will apply to the House of Commons and the House of Lords exactly as it will elsewhere. If that is not the case, I would like the Minister to explain why Parliament is so special and different that the difficulties that it will experience in implementing the Bill should be provided for, while other employers will not get special treatment in facing those difficulties.
<P>
The contract with America is the source of the key concept that the legislature should not be allowed to treat itself differently in framing legislation that will have an impact on citizens. That is an admirable principle. I hope that the Minister will be able to give me the reassurance I seek.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge in his probing about the equal operation of the Bill in this place and in another place. It is right in principle that it should operate equally. It has not been many years since Crown property and the activities of the state through, for example, the national health service, began to attract broadly the same rules and regulations--for instance, on health and safety--as ordinary mortals outside. That is a principle that we all now find useful and we would welcome the Minister's reassurance.
<P>
With incredible perception and independently, the Minister and Opposition Members have tabled amendments, Government amendment No. 159 in the Minister's case and amendment No. 237 in ours, which would have an identical effect.
<P>
Amendment No. 237 came to me in the small hours of one of our many debates--a longueur in what was otherwise a coruscating display of perception by my hon. Friends, although not, I hasten to say, by myself. The Bill appeared to provide for different treatment of the Lords and the Commons and that did not seem sensible. I assumed that clause 36(2) and(4) were alternative definitions that had been melded together and that one of them was, therefore redundant. I prefer the formulation that the amendments would achieve. The Minister will no doubt speak to those in due course.
<P>
I shall pose two questions to the Minister to eliminate the need to discuss them in the clause stand part debate. One, strangely enough, relates to home workers. The Houses of Parliament form a large organisation which employs many people. Even parliamentarians who receive a salary or allowances number more than 1,000. There is, therefore, a lot going on. We ought at least to rehearse the concept of home work in relation to such large organisations.
<P>
Although I did not see them do so, my hon. Friends may, in the course of our long deliberations last week, have got out their knitting. Had they done so, they could even have been remunerated on a piece-work basis and would have created an employment that came under the national minimum wage. That would have been in addition to their very productive employment as members of the Committee.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the sake of clarity, I should say that knitting is not permitted in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am indebted to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, because I never knew that. I shall restrain my needles. We could, however, make a hypothetical case or assume that the activity was carried out clandestinely, without the knowledge of the Chairman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that that would be a gross slur on the Chairman. None the less, we have the point. The House authorities may prevent them from doing so, but it is not inknown for persons to make presentations in this place and to receive a fee for doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Is it in order for a member of the Committee to be busy putting pieces of paper in envelopes with all the appearance of undertaking constituency case work?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is a serious point. Members of the Committee will know that they are here to examine the Bill. Although that may be a great strain on their constitutions, they must stay awake and take part in what is going on. That obviates the need to indulge in correspondence, knitting or other diversions. Those may be of considerable importance, but they must be deferred until the Committee has ended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I had a horrible feeling that I had, metaphorically, stirred up a hornet's nest. Given the mood of consensus and amiability, the only point that I need to make is that it is possible for activities to go on in this place which are not strictly related to our employment. The point is not restricted to hon. Members and could concern domestic and other staff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend concede that, in an age that depends increasingly on the electronic transference of information, the place at which work is done becomes increasingly difficult to define? Information is transferred electronically and may be poised in the ether, waiting to be plucked out and for work to be done on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I wholly agree with my hon. Friend's point, which informs some of the attitudes of Conservative Members to home working. If such information were beamed down into the Committee, however, I am sure that you would rule it out of order, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
I rest on the point that people may do several things simultaneously and may work in several places or during rest periods between doing other things. I would like to feel that we knew where we stood in relation to work that was conducted in this place, but which was not necessarily part of the work of this place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Amendments Nos. 239 and 240 deal with those who provide services under contract to the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Members of Parliament often have contracts for people to undertake external research. The amendments are, therefore, useful in bringing greater certainty to the issue of whether national minimum wage provisions apply in this place and the other place, just as they do to other employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes, I agree.
<P>
The second point that I wanted to flag up concerns our personal staffs. It needs to be clearly understood, and I do not think that members of the Committee will differ on it. It should not give rise to serious difficulties for hon. Members and their employees because hon. Members should be discharging their responsibilities and pay an appropriate rate. But given, in particular, that public funds are made available to us through, for example, the office costs allowance for the conduct of our constituency business, and given that all hon. Members employ secretaries, researchers and other ancillary staff, I assume--and I should like the Minister's assurance to this effect--that all such arrangements will be covered by the national minimum wage separately from these clauses. Such positions are part of the general remit of the Bill and I want to be sure that there are no exceptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> At this point, perhaps my hon. Friend would consider the many examples of hon. Members using for research assistants those who are politically committed and who are therefore not doing it primarily for the money. I do not do this, but I know that many of my colleagues pay a very small amount to such assistants--it is more or less an honorarium rather than any thing approaching a salary. Has my hon. Friend considered that this provision will mean such hon. Members being forced to pay those assistants nothing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I have a feeling that his known ingenuity will allow him to return to the topic of mixed employment--employment that is partly for profit and partly for voluntary contribution--at a later stage. He gave a good example in this case.
<P>
I employ a research assistant, although most of my research is conducted up here in my head, as may well be evident in my contributions. He usually deals with difficult constitutency cases involving solicitors. He is paid a modest flat-rate fee and is called on as required. He seems to be exactly the kind of employee who may be appropriate for a longer pay reference period. I do not anticipate any trouble--I seek to be fair and generous in my arrangements--but it is important that the Minister should consider such cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Surely the issue here is that that individual is the hon. Gentleman's employee and not an employee of the House of Lords or the House of Commons. The clauses relate to those who are directly employed by the House authorities, not by Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is exactly the assurance that I wanted. I am pointing out that many people work in this place, but only a minority are employed by the House authorities. The Minister confirms my reading of the Bill, which is that clauses 35 and 36 bear on only those who are directly employed as members of staff of another place or this place.
<P>
The Minister also confirmed that we as Members of Parliament, albeit using public funds that derive from the House of Commons, are responsible for our own compliance with the national minimum wage in respect of our employees. I do not want to signal in any way that we should escape or seek to evade those responsibilities or that, in practice, any of us would wish to do so.
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber </B>(Amber Valley): This issue does not seem to be a problem. I have a contract of employment with my staff and I would be shocked if I were caught paying less than whatever the minimum wage turns out to be. I believe in treating my staff properly and I provide a contract of employment. We are talking about the staff who are employed within these Houses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> I have hardly started. There are 1,500 staff employed in this House. It is important to put on record that we are all committed to the idea that they should be treated as decently as we expect staff outside the House to be treated. I am confident that Opposition Members would not dare to say anything different. They would not dare to incur the potential loss of the good will that we enjoy from the staff who work for us and who do such a good job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> I should like to pursue my argument. I am confident that we would all want to support our staff. I find it hard to believe that we could be opposed to a measure that would do that. It is important to put that on the record and to ensure that our staff are properly covered by these provisions, as by other employment legislation. If nothing else, our marathon sittings of last week would make us all feel that. Because of Conservative Members' intransigence, we had to sit through the night, which seems an odd way to run the country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) said earlier, we enjoyed it in a strange way. There was a great deal of team spirit and bonding on this side of the Committee. However, the point is that we were able to decide, but the poor staff just had to agree. There were heartrending queries from a number of them as to whether we were going to stay up all night again; that should make us ensure that they are covered by the Bill and have a decent rate of pay and conditions. It would be almost immoral to ignore those members of staff with whom we have spent several nights.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry said earlier that we had put in 50 hours of unpaid service last week--we were constantly available for duty--we were permanently at risk and we were unpaid. The only difference is that the staff were paid and we want to make sure that they are properly covered by the Bill. As the hon. Member for Buckingham pays Linda, who works at home for him, a decent pay rate, I am sure that he would wish to ensure that the same conditions apply to the staff of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I have already set out with remarkable clarity my arrangements for the payment of my cleaner. I am glad that it has been a source of such amusement to Labour Members.
<P>
I was at the outset trying to help the hon. Lady. She said that she would be shocked to be caught paying her staff below the national minimum wage. I think she meant that she simply would not wish to pay her staff less than that rate, rather than that she would be shocked to be caught doing so.
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> That is an extremely helpful intervention. Of course I would not pay my staff less than the minimum rate--indeed, far more than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> Not at this stage. I am also sure that the hon. Member for Buckingham, who claims that he tips well--although I have not checked that out with the Dining Rooms here--will also agree that tipping should not be the only pay in which we pay our staff.
<P>
I have made a slightly flippant contribution, but our staff do an excellent job for us, and we want to ensure that they are properly covered by the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I shall speak to Government amendment No. 159. I emphasise that the purpose of clause 36 is straightforward and self-evidently clear. It is to ensure that members of staff of the House of Commons and House of Lords are also entitled to receive the national minimum wage. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked a perfectly fair question: whether this would be the same in the private sector. The answer is yes. The House of Lords has confirmed that all staff employed are under a contract of employment and are therefore employees. That is reflected in clause 35, which applies to staff with a contract of employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the Minister accept that it is a dangerous precedent to frame legislation that deals only with the situation as it exists. There is nothing in the Bill that would stop the House of Lords from employing workers other than on contracts of employment in the future. I take it from what the Minister said that those workers would by definition be excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That was the purpose of providing the Secretary of State with powers. If there was any change in contractual arrangements, that would be taken into account. The purpose of the proposal is to ensure that contracts of employment in the House of Lords, which are legal arrangements, are covered by the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Can we be clear about this? Is the Minister saying that if in future the House of Commons or House of Lords were to contract for services with persons under terms which would otherwise have formed a definition of ``worker'' under clause 51, that is not covered by clauses 35 and 36 and would need to be brought within the scope of the Bill by subsequent regulation. That is the impression that I get from the Minister's comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> There are two things about this: I said that in general terms there are powers in the Bill for the Secretary of State to make changes, whether the matters are to do with the House of Lords or anything else, to ensure that the legislation is up to date.
<P>
Secondly, I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was referring to contracting out services currently undertaken by House of Lords staff. Any such arrangements would be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, which would mean a continuation of their employment rights, including the minimum wage. Someone employed on a contractual basis--an agency worker, perhaps--would also be covered by the Bill. Therefore, every contractual arrangement in relation to provision of services in this place is covered. The clause deals exclusively with staff employed by the House authorities. It has been worded to give clarity in that respect.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government amendment is a piece of tidying up. The clause was drafted with a subsection (2) which confirmed that references to an employee or a worker were to be construed as references to a member of the House of Commons staff, but we have taken further advice. Such confirmation is not necessary and subsection (2) should be deleted--the clause achieves its purposes without it. Subsection (1) provides that employment as a member of House of Commons staff is the same as other employment. Subsection (3) preserves a staff member's right to take a case before a court. Subsection (4) defines a member of House of Commons staff. Nothing further is needed. I ask the Committee to support our amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 237, as the hon. Member for Daventry said, has the same effect as Government amendment No. 159. At least there is some agreement, and I hope that Conservative Members will withdraw their amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 239 would extend the clause to House of Lords staff who are workers as defined by the Bill but who do not have a contract of employment. The amendment is unnecessary. The House authorities have confirmed that staff employed by the House of Lords have a contract of employment. They therefore qualify as employees under the Bill. There is no need to cater for those without such contracts.
<P>
Amendment No. 240 deals with the same issues in relation to House of Commons staff. Again, the amendment is unnecessary but for a different reason: clause 51(5) ensures that where clause 36 refers to ``employment'', the word covers a worker as defined by the Bill who does not have a contract of employment. The clause therefore already achieves what the amendment intends.
<P>
I hope that Conservative Members will agree that amendments Nos. 239 and 240 are unnecessary and will withdraw them. If they press them to a vote, the Committee should reject them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister has resumed his seat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I had hoped to ask the Minister a particular question. I seek your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody, as to how to proceed. We have been told that clauses 35 and 36 will apply as does every other part of the Bill and that House of Commons and House of Lords staff will be similarly treated. However, that does not appear to be the case in respect of the power to issue a penalty notice. Clarification on that point and a statement of the Government's view on disapplication of penalty notices are required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. I am grateful for his clarification of the situation which is as I suspected, but it was important to establish that. I am still worried that different employment practices may not be properly catered for, but I accept that the Government intend employment by the House of Commons or the House of Lords to be placed in the same context as any other type of employment and that the Secretary of State has reserve powers to amend the legislation if future practices render that intention ineffective.
<P>
In light of the Minister's constructive response and helpful clarification, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 35 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. To avoid doubt, I should say that the Opposition did not press for the Division to signal dissent to the abdication of the Bill to another place. We did so to give ourselves thinking time in which to check. We had seen that a Government amendment was in the group. We realised after the Division was called that the Government amendment applied to clause 36, which was why you, Mrs. Dunwoody, wisely did not call it under clause 35. Having I hope restored our bona fides, I advise the Committee that the Opposition will not oppose the Government amendment to clause 36. As further proof of good will, the Opposition will vote for clause 36 with the Government, if they are inclined to move it.

<B>The Chairman:</B> It is always helpful for a Committee to have such supportive hon. Members who wish to assist the Chairman on every possible occasion. I am tremendously grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but if hon. Members would allow me to stagger on in my own inadequate way, I might manage quite well.
<H4><center>Clause 36</center></H4>
<H4><center>House of Commons staff</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment made: No. 159, in page 23, line 34, leave out subsection (2).--[Mr. McCartney.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee. Will the Minister confirm the Government's position on one point? In clause 35(3), which relates to the House of Lords, the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relevant member of the House of Lords staff''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is interpreted in connection with a contract of employment. Any worker who is not formally an employee is therefore brought under the definition of worker, and thus into the provisions of the Bill. Under clause 36, however, the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relevant member of the House of Commons staff''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is not defined by reference to a contract of employment with the House of Commons. It is defined in relation to appointment by the House of Commons Commission and to membership of the Speaker's personal staff.
<P>
That is a potential loophole in the Bill. The House of Commons could contract the services of persons who would thereby become workers and who may be have an employment contract, but who would not be relevant members of the House of Commons staff for the purposes of the clause. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain why my worries are unjustified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Briefly, I wish to repeat what I said a few moments ago. I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said about Conservative Members' intentions for the clause, but why do clauses 35 and 36, unlike other clauses, provide that the House of Commons will receive different treatment from any other employer?
<P>
The notes on clauses state that the House authorities requested exemption from the requirement that a penalty notice be issued to recalcitrant employers on the grounds that it is inappropriate. We must be careful to avoid creating the impression that we treat ourselves differently from others. The House should not maltreat employees, nor should it fail to pay them in accordance with the Bill. However, if it does it should not be above the law: it must be subject to the same disciplines and procedures as any other employer.
<P>
I may be making an innocent error, and perhaps I am unnecessarily anxious. I hope that the Minister will reassure me.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Both hon. Gentlemen made a fair point. The clause applies to House of Commons staff. The House of Commons Commission is considered to be the general employer, and Madam Speaker is the employer of her personal staff. As in clause 35, which covers the House of Lords, clause 36 does not permit the enforcement officer to issue a penalty notice to the Commission for non-compliance.
<P>
The clause is not an attempt to treat the House of Commons differently from other employers. We expect the Commission to comply with the law: it is not our intention to allow it a loophole for non-compliance. However, I understand what has been said. I shall re-examine the matter, and if clarification is necessary I shall be glad to supply it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 36, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 37</center></H4>
<H4><center>Mariners</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 47, in page 24, line 2, after `Kingdom' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`under Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Amendment No. 47 is a minor drafting correction tidying up the provisions relating to mariners. It ensures that references to mariners are technically correct. Amendment No. 48 removes an otiose provision. The amendments do not alter the effect of the clause, and I invite the Committee to support them.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 48, in page 24, leave out line 5.--[Mr. McCartney.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Now that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, have helped the Committee back on to an even keel, I wish briefly to raise two matters.
<P>
First, I am worried about how the clause will work in practice. The legislation covering merchant shipping is something of a thicket, but the notes on clause refers to the fact that most mariners on British-registered ships would in any case be covered as employees. The clause is designed to pick up exceptions where mariners spend extended periods abroad--we have all come across constituents in this situation--and bring them within the remit of the clause.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have two concerns. First, the notes on clauses suggest that there are parallels with other employment provisions. That is the most sensible way to proceed. However, merchant shipping legislation contains other provisions relating to jurisdiction that may be different. The Minister might not be able to respond now, but I invite him to consult with his officials and make sure that there are no awkward or anomalous situations where the rules for employment are different from those that apply in other matters.
<P>
I have a certain sensitivity in relation to this matter because some years ago I was involved in a maritime accident that took place on a British-registered ship in the territorial waters of another country. In those circumstances the legal forum and the question of who was responsible for what were unbelievably complex.
<P>
My second point relates to flagging out. I do not know a great deal about this subject but there has been concern in recent years. As more impositions have been made on British employers and the costs of British registration have become relatively high--this is not a subject that we would want to discuss at length in this Committee--there has been a growing practice of flagging out. Many of us are rather sad about that. I do not want to make the exaggerated claim that the application of the national minimum wage to merchant seamen is likely to make a huge difference to that situation; I doubt that it would.
<P>
There might, however, be cases where ships were flagged out and had a material connection with the United Kingdom in that they usually plied their trade between British ports. I do not know whether the rules would allow them to do so exclusively. Those ships would, for all practical purposes, be British and British nationals might be involved. The Minister can tell the Committee whether those British nationals would be embraced by the Bill. Whether or not that is the case, it would be slightly offensive if the only effect of the clause were to encourage those people to go offshore--if I may use that shorthand term--and further diminish the size of the British-registered fleet.
<P>
Those are general but serious considerations and I should like the Minister to address them, particularly the latter point. The last thing any member of the Committee wants is to push more ships out of United Kingdom registration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I should like to take up my hon. Friend's point about flagging out. Many of our debates on clauses have been about what might happen in a particular sector of the labour market if a minimum wage were introduced, so they have inevitably been theoretical and, to some degree, speculative. That does not apply with this clause. In most sectors of the labour market job mobility means that individuals can move abroad and that overseas workers can be brought in to undercut them, but for mariners, almost uniquely, it means that the job itself is mobile. The flag under which the job is licensed can be and is easily moved around.
<P>
We know that flagging out has for some years been a problem for the British merchant fleet. I hope that the Minister will be sensitive to any measure that might increase its incidence. We must not only preserve the employment of British mariners, but have regard to the security and safety aspects of having a sizeable merchant fleet. Members of the Committee will know that safety standards on British-flagged ships are likely to be higher than those of other countries, which for obvious reasons, I will not name. That absence of safety not only affects the mariners themselves but can affect people on shore in this country. Crudely put, if a foreign-flagged and foreign-crewed oil tanker breaks up off the coast of Britain, we suffer more than anyone else; it does not matter under which flag it flies.
<P>
Will the Minister consider the practical effects of the clause, particularly on crews that are partly British and partly foreign or wholly foreign? The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an individual employed to work on board a ship registered in the United Kingdom shall be treated as an individual who under his contract ordinarily works in the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How will that encourage shipowners, who may well want to substitute foreign crews for British crews because they are cheaper, to maintain their ships as British-registered ships? I await the Minister's guidance.
<P>
This is an industry to which much of what the Government have been saying unfairly about other industries may well apply. I should be grateful if we could be spared the Arthur Daley section of the Minister's standard reply for at least the rest of today, but perhaps there are some Arturo Daleys in other countries who are not good employers of their seamen and whose bad employment practices affect not only their employees--even to the extent of putting their lives at risk--but the environment on and around the coast of Britain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does not my hon. Friend think that the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, would be able readily to testify to the correctness of what he is saying?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister famously had a distinguished career in this field of endeavour before he took up his current career.
<P>
I hope that the Minister has considered the fact that in this part of the labour market, it is almost uniquely easy, first, to substitute foreign workers for British workers and secondly, for British companies to cease to be British companies. Given both those factors, it would seem relevant to consider whether the effect of this well-intentioned clause would be significantly to increase the speed at which the British merchant fleet is diminishing. Can he give us some reassurance on that?
<P>
Even if the Minister says, as he has in debates on other clauses, that good employers will not be affected by the provision because they will already be paying above the national minimum wage and that it will affect only a few cowboys, unfortunately and uniquely for this clause he has no power over those cowboys. Cowboys employing home workers or piece workers are unlikely to go to other countries to find workers to replace their British ones who are currently being exploited, to use the Minister's words.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend share my interpretation of the clause as having the potential to create the perverse incentive for owners--even owners of ships that are registered in the United Kingdom--to employ those who are not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, that is, those who are not UK citizens?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Absolutely. I shall come to that in a minute, because it strikes me that a change in the make-up of crews might well be a significant side-effect of the clause.
<P>
As I was saying, in all other areas of industry the Minister has the power to enforce the Government's will on bad employers, but in this instance, he does not. I am not making a theoretical case. Anyone who has studied the decline of the British merchant fleet will know that that decline is due partly to the fact that employment practices and standards of safety in the British fleet are by and large higher than those in some other countries. The Minister faces a situation which is in many ways unique in the whole of British industry.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire made a good point about who can suddenly be deemed to be ordinarily working in the United Kingdom. By and large, shipowners prefer crews to be of a single nationality for ease of working and use of language, but there are examples--they will probably increase in number--of mixed nationality crews. The clause will encourage that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Further to the intervention of our hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, does my hon. Friend agree that the clause is not only likely to accelerate the trend for foreign crewing of ships, but might result in inequity between workers who may be paid different rates which depend on their place of residence? That would not be conducive to good teamwork on a ship.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> While my hon. Friend is catching his breath, what would happen under European Community law if United Kingdom nationals availed themselves of the national minimum wage while European citizens not resident in the United Kingdom did not qualify?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> To deal with those interventions in order, a mariner deemed to be ordinarily working in the United Kingdom might deem himself not to be working in the United Kingdom because he does not reside here when ashore or because he pays tax to another jurisdiction. I am not clear about how the clause will be enforced on a shipowner. The Government might deem a ship to operate from a British port and the mariners ordinarily to work in this country, but they might think of themselves as not from this country.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made a good point about increasing inequity on a ship and the possible side effects on morale and safety. Clearly, that would be bad not just for the crew, but for wider society which relies on ships to be operated safely.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry mentioned competing minimum wage jurisdictions. Unless and until a single European currency is introduced, there will be different minimum wages across the European Union. That would result in the bizarre sight of shipowners jurisdiction hopping in search of the most advantageous minimum wage legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To amplify my hon. Friend's point, inspectors of differing nationalities could check compliance with different national minimum wage regimes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is a nightmarish possibility, both for the inspectors and, in particular, for people who are trying to operate ships profitably.
<P>
Those points--all are valid--illustrate the difficulties: the industry is international; an extremely complex body of law has built up; ships pass between jurisdictions; and workers and shipowners can change jurisdictions. This innocent clause, which specifically applies the minimum wage to mariners, opens a Pandora's box. I hope that the Minister can set our minds at rest that those problems will not emerge.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor: </B>(Solihull): I rise in slight uncertainty because I do not have a comprehensive mind that can keep track of all the amendments and subtract words from the Bill as we go along. I may not be alone in that, but I do not know whether paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are mutually exclusive. To secure an exclusion, does (a) have to apply, or (b) or (c), or does (a) have to apply together with (b) or (c)? The addition of the word ``and'' or ``or'' after paragraph (a) would clarify that question. I realise that the matter is one of drafting semantics but it would not require a formal amendment, as it falls into that category of textual change that can be accomplished, without objection from any quarter, the next time the Bill is printed.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can find the inspiration to respond to my question.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alasdair Morgan </B>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale): I thought, Mrs. Dunwoody, that the Committee would welcome a change of face among the contributors.
<P>
I wish to underline what has been said already by various hon. Members. I am interested in the ferries that ply from the mainland of Great Britain to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Recently, foreign and European Union crews have been substituted for British crews. For example, on one of the ferries from Stranraer to Northern Ireland, the British crew was replaced by a Spanish crew.
<P>
To the best of my knowledge that ferry remains a British-registered ship, but I hope that it will no longer be possible for employers to use substitute crews simply because they can pay them lower wages. That is what they do and they make no bones about it, saying that the very competitive market forces them to it. Will the Bill require the ferry companies to pay their crews the minimum wage, regardless of whether they wish to change the registration of a ship?
<P>
Ferries ply between two different parts of the United Kingdom, or between the United Kingdom and other European Union countries such as France or the Republic of Ireland. I am worried about the possible loss of jobs and about the safety implications. The language ability of foreign-registered crews is tested occasionally, but I doubt that, in an emergency, those crews would reach the high standards demanded of British crews.
<P>
I look forward to the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall make two brief points. First, I endorse everything that Conservative Members have said about the clause's potential to accelerate the decline in size of the UK-registered merchant fleet. Has the Minister held discussions with his ministerial colleagues who are responsible for the UK merchant marine, and has he taken into account any problems that they brought to his attention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall be happy to give way as soon as I have finished my second point.
<P>
A spirit of compromise and consensus has broken out in the Committee, Mrs. Dunwoody, so I hope you agree that, although the matter I wish to raise is strictly relevant to clause 37, it may also be relevant to the debate that we shall have later on clause 34. It is about the circumstances of civilian employees on Royal Navy vessels.
<P>
I do not know what the Minister will say about the Bill's effect on the armed forces, nor whether he will touch on the subject of civilian employees, of whom there are substantial numbers on Ministry of Defence vessels. Everybody on the Committee will recall the terrible tragedy of the Sir Galahad in the Falklands. Many of those killed were civilian employees of the Ministry of Defence. It is not clear how clause 37, which imposes minimum wage requirements in respect of persons who are employed on UK-registered vessels, will interact with whatever the Minister announces on clause 34.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend an important point, but will he comment on the use of the UK merchant marine alongside the armed forces in times of crisis? Clause 34 refers to reserve forces, but to what extent does clause 37 offer the opportunity for amendments to take account of their need to do exceptional hours of work in exceptional cirmcumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I do not wish to anticipate the debate on clause 34, which would be unwise. The Minister's remarks on it in his opening address suggest, however, that many of the issues that will be raised in support of different arrangements for the armed forces will also apply to the merchant marine in certain circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perhaps I can assist my hon. Friend by entering a modest trailer for an amendment to the new clause that the Minister has tabled. It relates to circumstances in which civilians are engaged in ships--
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Order. I have tried not to restrict hon. Members, but if they tip over into debating other clauses, they will affect my attitude towards the time that I give for debate on them. The point is terribly simple, and I hope that hon. Members will remember it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall indeed do so. I should just say that the point occurred to me in relation both to wartime conditions and to the issue of parity between civilian service employees and armed forces personnel in peacetime. I am sure that my hon. Friend is right to raise the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I merely seek to flag up the issue. As we have debated it over the past few minutes, it has become clear that more and more issues will have to be dealt with. That is because of the unusual context of the merchant fleet and the poosible involvement of merchant mariners on Royal Navy vessels or on merchant ships that are engaged under crisis conditions. We are not necessarily talking about war having been declared; in that case, we would assume that special conditions would apply anyway. It is important that the Government address themselves to those possibilities and ensure that the provisions of the clause are adequately and properly drafted. In that way, they will give the clause the flexibility that it needs to ensure that the military's effectiveness is not impaired by the provisions on merchant seamen and that the right spirit of harmony exists between members of the armed forces and civilian employees who find themselves on ships together.

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> For a short period after leaving school, I was a merchant seaman. I plied my trade between the West Indies and King George V docks in London on sugar boats. I also travelled between Glasgow and Monrovia in west Africa bringing back bauxite for the steelworks that were then in the west of Scotland. I do not know whether it was luck or good judgment, but my career in the merchant navy was cut short after an accident, and I came shoreside. This is where that has landed me--in a debate on mariners.
<P>
The debate has ranged far and wide. Some of the issues are more easy to resolve than others. Some of them raised problems that were somewhat exaggerated, but which were worth raising. Others raised problems with which the Government had to grapple. We have had to look back to the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 to see whether the wording was consistent with that of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. The United Kingdom has a long history of such legislation because of its seafaring past. That legislation has often concerned the meaning of registration in the UK or in a UK port. Over the years, Governments of all persuasions have had to try to resolve such matters.
<P>
They were resolved in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. The application of employment law to mariners was settled in the Employment Rights Act 1996. The Government have followed the consistency in legislation, in terms of the Merchant Shipping Acts and the Employment Rights Act 1996, and the clause applies that consistency to mariners. They are defined as persons
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``employed to work on board a ship registered in the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Exceptions apply if a mariner works entirely outside the United Kingdom, or if a mariner is not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. Within the parameters of universal application, the Government have had to take into account the fact that some mariners work outside the United Kingdom.
<P>
The hon. Member for Boswell--[Laughter.] Sorry, the hon. Member for Daventry. There was a constituency called Bosworth. I think that a great battle took place there, but being a Scot, I do not think that we participated; at least it was not a battle that we lost. I must be careful, because Braveheart is sitting on the Opposition Benches. All of this is an attempt to get round the fact that I have not received some of the answers that hon. Members want.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister's welcome honesty should not be taken as a sign of the Chairman's indulgence--it goes too far through the various battles of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The lifeboat has not arrived yet.
<P>
I wish to get the debate into proportion. The Committee is discussing about 10 per cent. of water-transport employees, the vast majority of whom receive pay at a significant rate, even at the lower levels. That should not be used to trail what I think the minimum wage should be, which is a matter for the Low Pay Commission. Consequently, the clause will affect few mariners in the sense being suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Low Pay Commission tells me that it has received evidence from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. It does not appear to have received evidence from the General Council of British Shipping. Will the Minister say whether he or his Department have received representations from that organisation?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Off the top of my head, no. I shall check, and if the Department has received such respresentations, I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman receives a copy. To my recollection, no such document has crossed my desk. I am a big supporter of the General Council of British Shipping because of my previous occupation.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of flagging out. All hon. Members have been anxious about the issue for a long time. During the last decade or so, an all-party group of MPs has worked with the General Council of British Shipping to try to find policies that will reverse the decline of the British merchant shipping fleet.
<P>
That issue is critical to the Government, as has been reflected in our policy. Along with the General Council of British Shipping and relevant trade unions, the Government recently established a shipping working group to look at what can be done in relevant policy areas. The group will seek agreements that may develop a structure for shipping and turn round both the process of flagging out and the reduction in tonnage registered in the United Kingdom. Irrespective of this Bill, and given the overall picture of British shipping, the Government have already, in co-operation with the industry, considered the policies that need to be developed to ensure that we have a highly skilled and effective industry which is based in the United Kingdom and which operates to the benefit of its economy. There is common ground about that. Indeed, the American company Esso is one of the oil companies that has continued to operate its tanker fleet outside and within the UK under a UK flag. It has done so because it can demonstrate to its American owners highly skilled, efficient and effective employee relationships as well as highly skilled employees.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Given the complex nature of much merchant shipping, the new high class vessels require, as well as capital investment, a highly skilled and motivated work force. That is critical, and not just because of the disasters that have taken place. Opposition Members have mentioned some of the dangerous conditions that vessels plying the open seas are in. Vessels occasionally enter United Kingdom ports and remain there because they are not seaworthy or because the company abandons the ship and sometimes the seafarers as well. The UK then looks after the crews either through the trade unions or the International Maritime Organisation. On occasion over the past few years in Liverpool, local residents and churches have made donations to feed, clothe and maintain mariners who have been abandoned by their former employers.
<P>
All this background is useful and reconfirms the necessity to have proper standards. It thus reconfirms the need to ensure that clause 37 stands part of the Bill and that those mariners who are paid a low wage can, in the circumstances described in the clause, secure the minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford asked what the result would be in a mixed-nationality crew. The position of each member of the crew is considered separately. All crew members resident in the United Kingdom will be entitled to the minimum wage. Foreign nationals are less likely to be resident in the United Kingdom and will not be covered. That is not a big issue because even when I was at sea, there was a range of pay scales. Even those who were doing the same job as me, who became resident in Hong Kong, for example, and worked on the same ship as me, received a different pay rate and different conditions of employment. Whether that was right or not is another matter. Irrespective of the minimum wage, a ship is a complex organisation. A cruise liner, for example, employs huge numbers of people; they have different skills and do different jobs. In any event, there is a complex set of arrangements for remuneration and pay. That will always be the case. The minimum wage is just another aspect that an employer will have to take into account in making sure that the remuneration paid to the employee is commensurate with the minimum wage, if it applies to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My point concerns differential payment according to residence, and takes up the point of the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan). Assuming that the Spanish crew referred to by the hon. Gentleman live on board the vessel that is plying between two ports in, for example, Ireland and the United Kingdom, could the Minister confirm whether that crew would be considered to be ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I think that we can do a belt and braces job on this. Clause 1(2)(b) refers to an individual who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is working, or ordinarily works, in the United Kingdom under his contract''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The contractual arrangement refers clearly to the United Kingdom. However, it is also true that that person could possibly be resident in the United Kingdom by virtue of where he is staying. If so, he would be covered by clause 37. That important point was raised by the hon. Members for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale and for Runnymede and Weybridge, and we believe that we have covered it in both clause 37 and clause 1(2)(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Unfortunately, those arrangements would not apply to a similar situation where one end of the journey was in the United Kingdom and the other was abroad--for example, a ferry journey to the Irish Republic or the European continent. The Minister cannot use such arrangements to cover those individuals unless he can prove that they are ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is true, up to a point, but it is also true that under the proposed workers directive for arrangements relating to the European Community, employees can have a detriment for doing a job that is not consistent in one part of the Community compared with another. I will write to hon. Members who seek clarification on that matter. The purpose of the clause will be met in practice. I will consider the matter and return to it later.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) asked whether we could agree on a technical amendment. We have removed paragraph (a). The hon. Gentleman's point has therefore been met in the drafting and I hope that he is satisfied. I thank him for drawing it to my attention. He was not as lucky as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire who scored a bull's eye in an earlier sitting when he found a mistake in the Bill for which I thank him again.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to explain some of the intricacies of a mariner's lifestyle as they relate to clause 37 and that members of the Committee will now approve the clause.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I suppose that I should have prefaced my remarks by saying that of all the constituencies in the United Kingdom, Daventry is the least likely to attract the declaration of an interest. However, we all have an interest in the smooth conduct of maritime trade on which the whole country is deeply dependent. We bear the Minister no ill will and we bear the enactment of the clause no principled ill will. The Minister has set out to answer our questions, but I am not convinced that he has wholly answered them or that answers are available. There was a skirmishing action while further answers were supplied. In an effort not to discourage the Minister, but firmly to encourage him, we must divide the Committee, pending further and better particulars.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry to detain the Committee, but as the Minister has kindly offered to clarify the question of residence, I draw attention to another point. The Minister spoke of the reference in clause 1(2)(b) to a person who ``ordinarily works''. In clause 37(c), there is a reference to a person being ``not ordinarily resident''. It seems to me that the latter phrase is to be understood in the way that the phrase ``ordinarily resident'' is used by the Inland Revenue. When the Minister clarifies the issue of residence, will he make it clear whether that is the case?
