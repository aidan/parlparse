</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Since you were last here, Mr. Benton, a great spirit of optimism has enthused our proceedings. The Government have shown themselves to be flexible. They have abandoned great chunks of the Bill under the pressure of the Opposition's persuasive arguments. Their decision has been warmly received in the House and outside. It is in that spirit of optimism, produced by the Government's belated recognition that we are the source of most of the wisdom on how to improve the Bill, that I move the amendment. I take the constructive approach that has characterised our proceedings. I want to improve the Bill, in particular to make a fresh attempt, notwithstanding previously rebuffed efforts, to ensure that the Secretary of State consults local authorities.
<P>
Amendment No. 146 relates to clause 31, which reinforces the dictatorial role of the Secretary of State as if it needed reinforcing! Clause after clause gives powers to the centre; further unrestricted powers can be exercised by the Secretary of State over almost every detail and aspect of the work of regional development agencies.
<P>
Amendment No. 145 relates to clause 32, which identifies bodies that are to be consulted. It is noticeable that the clause identifies only a non-elected quango as the body that must be consulted for guidance and directions. Clause 32 conspicuously refuses to identify other bodies, such as elected local councils. That gives us is an interesting insight into the attitude of the Secretary of State and his opinions of the importance of elected local councils. His conclusion that he should tell RDAs what to do shows his lack of respect for the value and relevance of the views of local councils.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will decide to accept the amendments. Since Tuesday's fiasco, when the Government collapsed in the face of reasoned argument, I have hoped that they might be in the business of building bridges with local authorities which, in the light of the great and understandable concern voiced by those authorities, need to be built. When the Minister replied to our debate on Tuesday, he admitted that the Local Government Association had expressed dismay about other provisions in the Bill. The Government now have an opportunity to begin repairing some of the damage caused to their relationship with the local government world. I urge them to accept the amendments with that aim in mind.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Angela Eagle):</B> I always enjoy the peculiar view of the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) on what has gone on in the Committee. As Hansard is here recording everything, it is a matter of public record that the Government have listened to some of the anxieties concerning clauses 24 to 27 and have taken them away to reconsider them. If the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) persists in calling that a collapse or surrender he will not encourage us to listen in future. We are reconsidering those clauses in the light of experience of legislation that a Conservative Administration put on the statute book, to see whether they are needed in the new, more partnership-oriented provisions in the Bill.
The hon. Gentleman persisted in caricaturing the pattern of non-departmental public bodies, which the agencies will be during their initial phase of evolution, as subject to some sort of Secretary of State diktat. Yet, as the hon. Gentleman knows, that is a well worn, tried and tested way of delivering administration in various areas; and the previous Administration set up many NDPBs. We are discussing not diktat by the Secretary of State, but accountability to Parliament via Ministers. We must not allow the hon. Gentleman to suggest that there will be Hitlerite dictation, because that would be a misrepresentation of the provisions.
<P>
Amendments No. 146 and 145 relate to the general powers in clause 31 for the Secretary of State to issue guidance and directions to RDAs on the exercise of their functions. They would place an obligation on the Secretary of State always to consult local authorities in the region before issuing guidance on any matter. It will not always be right for local authorities to be consulted on guidance given to RDAs, so we must resist the amendments. The argument has become familiar during the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
However, there are some forms of guidance, on which I hope the Committee can agree, on which it would be right to consult local authorities. For example, it would be right to consult local authorities on guidance issued to agencies on consultation arrangements in the absence of a regional chamber. That would directly involve local authorities in the region, so it would be right to consult them and we would do so. As we said on earlier amendments, we hope that such matters can, more often than not, be worked out in the regions without the need for a direction from Whitehall. That is the principle underlying the thrust of the Bill. If we issue guidance in such matters, it would be right to consult local authorities and we shall do so.
<P>
It would be wrong to oblige the Secretary of State in all instances to consult local authorities on every matter concerning the chain of accountability between agencies, Ministers and, ultimately, Parliament. Such matters are for the Secretary of State to determine as he[Angela Eagle]
thinks fit. I am thinking of guidance on the preparation of accounts and records or the provision of advice and information to the Secretary of State. In such instances nothing would be gained from placing a duty on the Secretary of State always to consult every local authority in the area.
<P>
We do not propose that the Bill should list the forms of guidance on which local authorities should be consulted. I hope that the examples that I have given illustrate the sort of areas in which consultation would be proper. Such lists in primary legislation are not helpful and there should be an element of discretion, watched over by Parliament because Ministers are ultimately responsible to Parliament for their decisions. I assure the Committee that we shall consult local authorities on guidance when their interests are directly affected. With that assurance. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for outlining the Government's intentions, but I am disappointed that the flexibility that we welcomed so warmly on Tuesday does not seem to have been carried through to today. Against that background, I must press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 147, in page 16, line 28, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5) Any guidance or directions issued by the Secretary of State under this section shall be published.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have heard more than once about the Government's commitment to openness, which the amendment seeks to address. Unless the commitments to which Ministers have regularly referred were given with the same cynicism as some of their other statements during the Committee's proceedings such as their statements about not taking powers away from local authorities Ministers should welcome amendment No. 147.
<P>
The people who will be affected by the work of regional development agencies are those who live and work in the region. Those people have a right to know what the Secretary of State orders the RDA in their region to do; otherwise it may be difficult to evaluate the agency's performance. Members of the RDA will also favour such openness, if they are told by the Secretary of State to do certain things and cannot exercise their own judgment about what is right for the region. It is bad enough for the people who, for example, live near Rainham marshes where I enjoyed a pleasurable visit yesterday morning to find that their future will be dictated by a regional headquarters which may be hundreds of miles away, but if those who are concerned with Rainham marshes discover that the agency must do things at the bidding of Whitehall, it is important that they should be aware of that and know that certain decisions are not being made by members of the RDA in the interests of that particular region. So the amendment would also be to the advantage of members of the agency.
<P>
It would be extraordinary if the Secretary of State were unable or unwilling to let an agency decide for itself how to exercise its functions. Given that the Secretary of State will have appointed the members of the RDA and has powers to dictate the agency's strategy, one might think that he could trust it to carry out the agency's functions without issuing yet more guidance and directions. If he cannot even trust those whom he has handpicked to do the job and has to use the power in clause 31 to issue directions, the least he can do is make those directions public.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I was astonished to see that amendment No. 147 had been tabled. I can only assume that the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) has not read the Bill if he felt that it was even remotely relevant to push such an amendment at this stage. The amendment is completely unnecessary because its contents are already dealt with in several clauses, some of which we have discussed and others of which we have yet to consider.
<P>
Clause 32(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State shall arrange for any guidance given under this Part to be published in such manner as he considers appropriate."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 42(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any direction under this Act" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is to say, that which is given by the Secretary of State "shall be in writing."
<P>
I refer the hon. Gentleman back to clause 17(2)(b), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A report under this section" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the RDA's annual report shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"set out any other directions given to the agency under this Part during the period to which the report relates."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 42 requires the Secretary of State's direction to be in writing. Clause 32(4) requires him to arrange for any guidance given under that part of the Bill to be published. Clause 17 requires directions not only to be published but to appear in the RDA's annual report. That more than adequately covers the intention behind amendment No. 147. I ask the hon. Member for South Suffolk to withdraw the amendment; the provisions are already there in three other clauses.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I had intended to speak before the Minister, and to say that, on the basis of the opening remarks of the hon. Member for South Suffolk, we supported the amendment, which is consistent with questions that we have raised and intentions behind the amendments that we have tabled. However, I accept the Under-Secretary's assurance that the importance of publishing guidance given to RDAs is already recognised in the Bill, and is indeed the Government's intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not persuaded by the Under-Secretary's response. I should like to point out some of the flaws in her argument. She suggests that clause 32 is helpful in dealing with my anxieties. However, if she reads the Bill as I have, she will see that clause 32 refers to guidance; it does not refer to guidance and directions. I am especially worried about directions. Presumably, if members of the RDA board are brave enough, guidance may be listened to and taken account of, but not necessarily acted on in every particular. Directions are much more specific. If the Under-Secretary says that she is willing to amend clause 32 to include the words in line 35 "guidance or directions", and to delete the words in line 36 "as he considers appropriate", that would be a satisfactory response to the amendment. However, she has not done that. She is relying on a clause that deals with quite a different matter.
<P>
The Under-Secretary referred to clause 42, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any direction under this Act shall be in writing."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It says nothing about that direction being published. Presumably, it is likely to be in writing 
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Clause 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am coming to that. Presumably, given all the other powers that the Secretary of State must exercise, if he gives directions to RDAs, he will not have time to telephone each of them individually and tell them what to do 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): The Internet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not sure whether the courts have tested whether information on the Internet is considered to be in writing or in some other form. My guess is that it could be regarded as being in writing. Either way, for directions to be given in writing is not the same as for those directions to be published so that they are available to those who will be affected by their consequences the decisions made by and policies followed by RDAs at the behest of the Secretary of State. It is not the same thing.
<P>
I have two anxieties about clause 17. When we debated clause 17, I moved amendments to try to ensure that the annual report was published within a reasonable period of time, in relation not only to the period to which that annual report relates not too long after the end of the year but to the time the Secretary of State receives it.
<P>
From the Government's answers to those debates, we are aware that the Government do not intend to specify a fixed time period. It could be months or even years before the annual report is available. When this Committee started we highlighted the fact that the Government based their central argument for justifying the establishment of regional development agencies on statistics that are five years out of date. We have every reason to be anxious because there is no provision in the Bill to require the publication of reports within a reasonable period of time. The Minister expects us to rely on this inadequate clause to meet my concerns, despite the fact that I have already suggested that minor amendments to clause 32 would easily achieve the objective in mind. The removal of four or five words at the end of line 36 and the addition of two words in line 35 would meet my concerns completely.
<P>
It is not clear to me but I am willing to be advised on this matter that the directions referred to in clause 17(2)(b) are the directions that clause 31 enables the Minister to issue.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman is known for having a small supply of goodwill, which he seems to have exhausted in the Committee's previous sitting. If he will not accept my assurances that guidance and directions will be publicly available which is provided for in the primary legislation then I must point out to him that nothing in the Bill precludes an RDA from making it immediately known via a press release that a direction has been made. With that further assurance, I plead with him to exercise a little goodwill and to recognise that the points he makes in amendment No. 147 are completely covered by the Bill. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) suggests, why does the Under-Secretary find the amendment so objectionable if those points are so well covered? I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her assurances, but it is still unsatisfactory that it is up to the RDA to publish any directions and that the Secretary of State has no obligation to do so. That could lead to unnecessary conflicts between the RDA board and the Secretary of State. We must therefore press the amendment to a division.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> In the introduction to the White Paper, "Building Partnerships for Prosperity", the Secretary of State made what I believe was intended as a philosophical statement:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government was elected to modernise Britain. To decentralise decision making."
[Mr. Yeo]</ul></font>
<P>
The Bill allows the Secretary of State to appoint an unelected quango that will oversee regional activities. Until Tuesday, that quango was going to be able to take substantial powers from local elected councils. The quango may also operate hundreds of miles from 
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn):</B> Drivel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> On the contrary, the Minister refused to accept a Conservative amendment intended to divide the Western region into two parts so that there would be some chance that the people of Cornwall would not have their affairs dictated by the Minister's appointed bureaucrats in Bristol, a city closer to Westminster than to some parts of Cornwall. Unelected bureaucrats may sit in offices hundreds of miles from the areas over which they exercise power. The Government who claim to be trying to decentralise decision-making are enshrining that principle in clause after clause.
<P>
The Secretary of State will appoint RDA members, issue directions about RDA strategy and dictate even such details as the form of a notice of a public meeting. There is no detail of RDA activity over which the Secretary of State may not exercise dictatorial powers.
<P>
<B>Dr. Doug Naysmith </B>(Bristol, North-West): Are not the powers of which the hon. Gentleman speaks currently exercised at the government office for the region in Bristol?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman, who has sat through four weeks of our proceedings, understands what the Bill is about. We know that the Minister does not understand it; when we reached clauses 24 to 27, he found them so appalling that he had ignominiously to withdraw them. No regional development agency yet operates in the west. The government office in Bristol exercises several powers, but cannot issue directions to an RDA that does not exist.
<P>
Clause 31 goes into yet more detail. The Secretary of State already has all the powers that I have listed, but is taking a further power to issue directions on the exercise of functions that he has set out, that he controls and that will be performed by handpicked people whom he has told what their strategy should be and in whose affairs he is intervening as much as possible. Yet he needs even more powers under clause 31 so that he can issue directions on how the agencies should exercise their functions. He may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"restrict the agency in relation to the exercise of its functions",
<P>
or require agencies to exercise their functions in a particular manner.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Dr. Naysmith:</B> The point is that most, if not all, of the functions that will be transferred to the RDAs are currently exercised by civil servants in Tollgate house, Bristol. The Bill sets up a form of accountability that will open up decision making. Far from centralising, the Bill devolves power.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentions accountability. To whom will the agencies be accountable? There is no directly elected regional assembly. The only part of England in which a directly elected regional assembly will be set up is the part in which the people are being denied the chance to vote on whether they want it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The intervention by the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) is materially incorrect. English Partnerships does not operate from Tollgate house in Bristol, but has its own regional office. The Rural Development Commission does not operate from Tollgate house. It is true that the regeneration programmes receive guidance from the regional office there, as they do across the country. A local authority that wishes to influence any of those three organisations has three places to go. Under the Bill, everything will be brought together in one centre so that the number of channels of influence will radically diminish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a most important point, reflecting his considerable knowledge and expertise. He is right to say that there is no single office from which all else stems. His point about the Rural Development Commission will be pertinent later, when we discuss clauses that will allow the Secretary of State to abolish that commission. My right hon. Friend's example shows that the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) is mistaken and that the Bill involves further centralisation because it will remove decision-making from local regions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that the Government recently closed the MAFF office in Truro, which is another example of centralisation?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am bound to say that I was not aware that the Government had closed the MAFF office in Truro. I am deeply shocked by that information, which is another example of the Government's cavalier disregard for the remoter parts of the west country. Judging by my right hon. Friend's expression, that office performed an especially valuable service for a relatively poor region.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> When the Government introduced those offices, the west country was the only region that was given more than one office, because it was important to recognise the region's unique characteristics. I am especially aware of that example, because I was responsible for putting the scheme in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The matter is getting graver by the minute. My right hon. Friend had a distinguished record in the previous Government on more than one occasion his work has attracted the admiration of the Minister for the Regions and I am staggered that the Government have overturned one of his decisions. When he took his decision, he clearly had in mind the interests of the people of that part of the west country, including Truro. I am puzzled that the Government were not dissuaded by their coalition partners, who are politically strong in that part of the country.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. By the minute, our debate is going further from the clause. Committee members should restrict their remarks to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West.
<P>
<B>Dr. Naysmith:</B> The Committee should have all the necessary information about this matter, although I appreciate that my comments are not strictly about the clause. Apart from the Government office in Bristol, there is also a Government office for the south-west in Plymouth, which was probably opened by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. The Bill will introduce openness in discussions about the many matters that are currently decided in those rather closed Government offices in the south-west.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am immensely encouraged to learn that there is a Government office for the south-west in Plymouth but how soon will the Minister close that one, too?
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): Listening to everyone discussing my region is too much for me to take without intervening. Before we give too much adulation to the previous Government, we should remember that they also tried to close the MAFF office in Truro, but because of a strong campaign by the Liberal Democrats, they failed to do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's interest in his part of the world, but our debate has strayed far from the clause, and the hon. Member for South Suffolk should return to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am most grateful, Mr. Benton, for your guidance. I should hate to stray from matters that are directly relevant to the clause. I was trying to respond to concerns that were expressed on both sides of the Committee, and I shall wrap up the matter by saying that my right hon. Friend's wisdom is shown by the fact that he decided to keep the Truro office open.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> On that point, do the Opposition's left wing and right wing agree on the policy to take towards the MAFF office in Truro? If they have come together on that matter, the Conservative party has gained at least some unanimity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister will know, from our debates over the past four weeks, that there is not so much as a wafer between my right hon. Friend and myself on any matter relating to the Bill. Clause by clause, we have voted together and spoken on the same side. I am extremely grateful to my right hon. Friend for bringing his expertise to my assistance a few moments ago. He added to my knowledge of the havoc that the Government have wreaked in the west country, where they closed offices left and right.
<P>
The clause is another one that makes a mockery of the second sentence of the Secretary of State's introduction to the White Paper, in which he claims that he wants to decentralise decision-making. The Bill would set up a quango, with members appointed by the Secretary of State, which would take resources from elected local councils. The strategy of the agencies would be dictated by the Secretary of State and minute details of operations would be controlled by him. The clause would simply strengthen further central Government's role in telling regional development agencies how to do their job. That cannot be justified.
Despite my intention to press the clause to a Division, it is likely to remain in the Bill. I should therefore be grateful for advice from the Minister about the subjects likely to be covered by the guidance and directions that the Secretary of State will be empowered to issue under clause 31(l)(a) and (b). Will the guidance and directions cover any of the following seven subjects: the role that the agency may play in contributing to environmentally sustainable development; targets for reducing the area of derelict land and increasing the share of new building on previously developed land; the need for the agency to assess the environmental impact of its activities and to consult the public when setting out its priorities; the role of environmental indicators in monitoring and identifying the agency's priorities; the agency's role in preventing dereliction; the agency's role in rural areas, particularly in meeting their distinctive economic, social and environmental needs; and the need for environmental criteria to be applied to activities that are funded by the agency?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman persists in caricaturing a tried and tested administrative arrangement such as an NDPB, many of which were set up and used by the previous Administration, as dictatorial and centralising, when he knows that that is not the case. Under the arrangement in question, the main functions of a body, whether a regional development agency, English Nature or anything else, can be set out in legislation or guidance, as appropriate, so that the body can get on with its job, subject to scrutiny by Ministers and, through them, Parliament, and under the financial arrangements that are the responsibility of the Public Accounts Committee, and which the National Audit Office oversees. That is exactly what is happening in the case that we are considering. There is nothing innovative about the form in which the power is being devolved to the English regions.
<P>
If Conservative Members have such great objections to the method of proceeding that we propose, why did they so often use it when they were in government? If, as the hon. Member for South Suffolk seems to suggest, they object to development agencies as centralising agents even though they are the opposite why did they not abolish Scottish Enterprise or the Welsh Development Agency? Why did they establish a similar agency in Northern Ireland? The hon. Gentleman's objections to our method of proceeding seem shallow and sudden. They seem to have developed after 1 May last year.
<P>
Clause 31 does not intend to dictate; it is a perfectly usual proposal. It will enable the Secretary of State, who is responsible to Parliament for the expenditure of the money, to give guidance and directions to an agency on what it should do and how it should behave. It may restrict the exercise of an agency's function, or require those functions to be exercised in a specific manner, perhaps because there are strategic reasons for doing so. The clause will enable the Secretary of State to give[Angela Eagle]
regional development agencies guidance on specific matters the hon. Gentleman correctly identified rural issues as appropriate for guidance as to the RDA's approach. As we have said many times in previous debates, the draft guidance will be subject to consultation with the RDAs; it will not just be produced and fired off in all directions. The guidance will be helpful.
<P>
Clause 31 contains reserve powers to direct if something is wrong, unpredictable or detrimental. It gives the Secretary of State the power to fulfil his or her duties to the House. It is as simple as that. There is no need to worry about any other aspect of the clause. It is subject to Parliament, it will be open, published and available. It is open to Ministers to give guidance on matters mentioned in the hon. Gentleman's list of seven. At present, we plan to give guidance on rural areas and on sustainable development; we may give guidance on other matters in the future if we deem it necessary. The guidance will be subject to consultation; there will be a two-way dialogue between the RDA and the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State sees fit, it is possible that RDAs may develop and pursue matters in such a way that guidance does not need to be given. It may be useful for RDAs throughout the country to take a similar approach to matters such as the use of sustainable indicators, for example.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that clause 31 has no sinister or centralising intention. It will simply allow the Secretary of State to exercise his or her powers, for which he is responsible to Parliament and, in financial matters, to the Public Accounts Committee. Guidance may be issued on how the RDAs are to manage financial matters so that accounts and annual reports, which may be similar, can be well prepared. That is the kind of thing that the clause attempts to tackle; the Secretary of State needs a power in the Bill to enable him to fulfil his duties to this House.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I have explained more than once to the Committee that in the special circumstances that exist in respect of Scotland, for example, we support the concept of an agency whose functions are similar to those proposed for the English regions. However, we do not believe that regional development agencies are needed in every part of England; that is why we opposed the Bill on Second Reading, and why we continue to oppose it. But if RDAs are to be inflicted on every region of England, arrangements that are somewhat different from those established for Scotland may be beneficial. If regional development agencies in English regions are to achieve credibility and gain the respect of the people who live and work in the regions over which they exercise powers, it would be helpful, in achieving that respect and credibility, if they were seen to be a little bit independent of the Secretary of State, without having to act in response to the Secretary of State's directions. Of course, as we now know, two or three years after the directions are issued, it may be possible for people to discover that some of the RDAs' more unlikely and unhelpful actions were not examples of the board exercising its judgment, but the result of the Secretary of State's directions.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that establishing a power to issue guidance and directions does not mean that a vast flow of guidance and directions will be given? The clause simply establishes powers.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Of course, the Minister is right that establishing a power does not mean that the Department will provide a daily dose of instructions. But the Bill is riddled with opportunities for the Secretary of State to control regional developments agencies' activities. That renders the clause unnecessary. If the agencies are perceived to be the creatures of central Government, it will be hard for them to achieve the credibility that will help their success.
<P>
I shall deal briefly with the subjects about which guidance might be given. I welcome the fact that sustainable development and rural areas will be among them, and the Minister's reference to environmental indicators. We support the evolution of indicators that measure a range of economic statistics in a more environmental way. There is cross-party agreement on that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I am rather puzzled, and I hope that the hon. Member for South Suffolk can help me. He listed several subjects about which he would like RDA boards to receive guidance. He also suggested that he would not be happy for another independent quango to be set up. Yet he argues also that the clause should be removed. That would remove the Secretary of State's ability to issue the guidance that the hon. Gentleman would like to be given on, for example, sustainable development. If the clause is removed, how will the hon. Gentleman's aims be achieved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Let me explain my views. It would be better for agencies to be able to act more independently than they will be able to act under the Bill. However, after examining the arithmetic, I know that, under the beady eye of the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland), the Committee will vote to retain the clause. I want to be constructive and ensure that, if the Secretary of State is to have the power for which the clause provides, he will exercise it in a benign and beneficial way.
<P>
I suggested subjects on which guidance should be issued. They are not the only subjects, and I do not necessarily advocate them all with equal force. The Minister gave a helpful response on that, and I am reassured that other matters will also be considered.
<P>
If guidance is to be given, let us ensure that it will help to deal with some of the anxieties in regions where there is less enthusiasm for the concept of a regional development agency than the Government believe.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) got it right. Her intervention explained the reasons for the clause's inclusion in the Bill. Establishing the power to issue directions does not mean that there will be a constant flow of guidance and directions. The power will be used, only when appropriate, to set basic frameworks. It will not mean over-prescription of RDAs' behaviour in the regions. Decentralisation does not mean providing no structure within which RDAs can forge their way, but giving them guidance and directions, if that is needed to give them a framework within which Parliament intends them to develop and work. It is as simple as that. We believe that some value would be added to the categories mentioned by the hon. Member for South Suffolk, such as in developing sustainable indicators. There is a clear need, however, for financial guidelines so that every RDA does not have to reinvent the wheel.
<P>
Clause 31 has been drafted in a spirit of helpful guidance rather than evil intention. I reassure the hon. Gentleman, if he does not know this already, that the Government always behave in a benign and beneficial way; we have no intention of behaving in an evil or malign way. Although the hon. Gentleman said that he wants to press the clause to a Division, perhaps he will decide, in a benign sense of togetherness, that a vote is not necessary.

Clause 31 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 32</center></H4>
<H4><center>Guidance: supplementary</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I thought that it would be helpful to put a couple of matters on the record about what we intend clause 32 to do, because I may be able to give balm to those who are still worrying about clause 31.
<P>
The clause sets out supplementary provisions relating to the Secretary of State's power to give and revoke guidance. Subsection (1) requires that the agency be consulted before guidance is given. That guidance is taken into consideration by RDAs on carrying out their functions. The Secretary of State is also required to publish any guidance that he gives to them. The clause allows guidance to be revoked if it becomes out of date, which is a general and sensible provision, but it also sets out further protections, which Opposition Members have requested throughout our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for those comments. In my remarks on amendment No. 145, I mentioned my concerns about clause 32. The difficulty arises because the Bill refers to consultation with RDAs, but it does not give any other category of organisation the same statutory recognition. Nevertheless, I listened to what she said.
<P>
We believe that elected local authorities are among those who should be consulted, although I appreciate that it is impossible to include in legislation all those bodies with whom it might be considered worth while to consult. Others will include representatives of business and employees, and the voluntary sector in some areas will have important advice to offer, which I hope the Secretary of State will take into account before issuing guidance. However, in the light of our discussions, I do not wish to press the clause to a Division.

<H4><center>Validity of transactions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> To a layman, the clause looks like one of those clauses that says, "If we break the rules, there is nothing you can do about it." No doubt, if the other party to a transaction with an RDA broke the rules, it would have to answer for its actions. But I expect that the Minister will be able to rely on precedent and tell me that such a one-sided approach has already been enshrined in other legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> How perceptive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> One of the entertaining aspects of these debates has been that, half the time, Government Front-Bench Members have attacked the actions of the previous Government and, the rest of the time, they have heavily relied on those actions to justify what they are doing now. I hope that, one day, someone will carry out a study into that; it might be worthy of a PhD.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Would you like to write it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am far too busy correcting the more serious blunders in legislation as I did on Tuesday to be able to devote myself to that. However, I am sure that others of a more academic bent might find it instructive.
<P>
I fear that I may have even been a member of a Standing Committee that approved a provision similar to that in clause 34.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor </B>(North-West Leicestershire): Will the hon. Gentleman please show some gratitude for the fact that Tuesday will be one of the high points of his life?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am only too happy for hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to dwell on the events of Tuesday. Indeed, they were a highlight of the[Mr. Yeo]
Committee's proceedings. Few of us have experienced a situation in which the Government decide to rip out four key clauses from a Bill at the end of a lengthy debate. But I do not want to be churlish about that; I said at the time that we warmly welcomed the Government's decision. It is a fine reflection of the fact that, on that matter at least, the Government were willing to listen to the reasoned arguments of the Opposition.
<P>
To return to clause 34

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We heard it on Radio 4 yesterday morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> That is not the end of the story either.
<P>
I suspect that similar provisions to those in clause 34 are to be found in other legislation, but I should like one assurance from the Minister. The Bill includes provisions that relate to compulsory purchase. Those are matters of great concern to anyone who owns property that is the subject of a compulsory purchase order. I should like the Minister's assurance that nothing in clause 34 weakens the position of individuals and businesses who might want to make claims and are facing possible compulsory acquisition of their property.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Clause 34 may seem odd to anyone reading it for the first time. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the reason for that is not previous Conservative legislation but case law; specifically, a case in which a local authority attempted to get out of a contract by saying that it had acted ultra vires so the entire contract had to be invalidated. The clause covers that case law.
<P>
The clause provides protection for both parties. It protects people from having their contracts invalidated because the RDA got its procedures wrong. It also protects RDAs from people who renege on a contract because of procedural defects that the RDA may inadvertently have slipped into. The clause allows the private and public sectors to contract with each other predictably. It disallows the chance of trying to invalidate what might be an important contract halfway through with the excuse of ultra vires or wrong procedures. It results from case law and problems that arose in the past. It creates a more stable environment in which both parties to a contract may deal with each other on more than a short-term basis.
<P>

The hon. Gentleman asked about CPOing. The clause does not relate to CPOs, which are covered by clause 35.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Seventh schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It might be helpful if I briefly put on the record the purpose of the schedule. It makes minor amendments to existing legislation following the introduction of regional development agencies: the records of RDAs will be treated as public records; their actions will be subject to investigation by the ombudsman; they can enter into agreements with local authorities and public bodies for the provision of goods and services; members of RDA boards may not stand for membership of the House of Commons or the Northern Ireland Assembly.
<P>
The schedule merely deals with consequential amendments to other legislation and I hope that the Committee will be assured again by the changes, particularly the public nature of RDA records and the fact that the agencies may be subject to investigation by the ombudsman.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We have now come to the part of the Bill that deals with the role of the Rural Development Commission. I hope that we can establish clearly in the mind of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn) that there is a distinction between the RDC and the Countryside Commission.
<P>
The RDC has been frequently mentioned during our proceedings and was mentioned on Second Reading and in exchanges before Christmas, following the Secretary of State's first statement about RDAs. The Government have been at pains to stress that Ministers have travelled around the country to seek the views of people interested in rural issues.
<P>
On 12 February, the Minister referred to some of his visits around the country, saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I must admit that when I was visiting some organisations, I bumped into several ex-Tory Members and MEPs. The plethora of rural organisations that benefit their little pockets needs to be examined." [Official Report, Standing Committee E, 12 February 1998; c. 280.]</font></ul>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister did not say that lightly. He would not say such a thing unless something in his recent experience gave substance to such an extraordinary assertion. I want to give him the opportunity to tell us who those Tory ex-Members of Parliament and Members of the European Parliament were.
<P>
Will the Minister name the "plethora of rural organisations"? Was that comment another of his remarks which, on further consideration, may turn out not to be true? Is he able to identify only one Tory ex-MEP on the payroll of any public body that is concerned with rural matters? If so, will he confirm that last week's remark inadvertently misled the Committee?
<P>
It is important to get this matter straight.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I feel it right to suggest to the hon. Gentleman and the Minister that this matter can be dealt with only in relation to the Rural Development Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Benton. I am sure that the Minister will be able to answer my questions in relation to the RDC. I hope that he will confirm that no Tory ex-Member of Parliament and no Tory ex-MEP is on the payroll of the RDC.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that no person or organisation primarily concerned with countryside matters supports the Government's claim that seizing the RDC's regeneration programme and transferring it to urban-based organisations is likely to achieve an outcome helpful to rural communities? Do the Government recognise the great alarm that has been aroused by their proposals for the RDC? That alarm has been made worse by the Secretary of State's gratuitous attack on the former chairman of the RDC, Lord Shuttleworth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Whom he has never met.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> As my right hon. Friend says, the Secretary of State has never met Lord Shuttleworth. It would be to the credit of the Government if the Minister felt able to apologise for the gratuitous attack made in the House of Commons in December.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us when the Government propose to decide how many RDC staff face the sack as a result of their proposals? Does the Minister appreciate how offensive it is for the Government to seek yet more powers for the Secretary of State to wreck the RDC? Their treatment of that organisation is already disgraceful, and the people who work there labour under a cloud of uncertainty. The best way for the Government to make amends for the damage that they have caused is to build on the helpful precedent that the Minister set on Tuesday when he withdrew clauses 24 to 27 this morning, he should withdraw clauses 38 and 39.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I wish to echo my hon. Friend's sentiments. I do not believe that organisations have the right to eternal life. They come into existence, do their job, and when they have done so, it may be best for them to go. The principle of regeneration involves precisely that process. Partnerships come into existence, carry out their functions and, when they have delivered them, they disappear. The Minister is in the process of winding up the urban development corporations under such a philosophy. However, if organisations disappear, we must ensure that what replaces them does the job as effectively.
<P>
Policies tend to go through cycles. There is a fashion for consolidation for bringing everything under one roof on the grounds of integration and, to use the current buzz word, to meet strategic objectives but after a short while, the cycle moves on and targeting and disaggregation become the fashion. People say, "This is a great big organisation. Perhaps we need one that is a bit more targeted." The cycle therefore goes round we see disaggregation and the separation of powers and of functions, and new organisations are born. That happened under the previous Government, and, when fashions change, I have no doubt that it will happen again under this Government.
<P>
The RDC was subject to changes under the previous Government its powers, functions and activities were regularly reviewed in geographical and functional terms. That organisation's advantage is that it managed to achieve a remarkable degree of targeting on small-scale schemes for example, on schemes that might involve the expenditure of just a few thousand pounds in a village. The RDC could reach areas of acute deprivation in larger areas that, more generally, were prosperous.
<P>
I have read the Government's proposals on regeneration. At the back of that document there is an interesting annex about how to identify areas of deprivation it asks which indices should be used. When identifying where there are real problems, it is important to get down to the parochial level. The RDC's skill was to operate at that level with very small amounts of money although, of course, it also levered money in. It brought benefits to areas that might have escaped the attention of a more broad-ranging organisation.
<P>
I should like the Minister to allay my concerns about that matter. Such concerns are not the prerogative of any one party. RDAs should be able to reach to the lowest level and to target effectively, and they should be responsive in the same way that the RDC was. There is a danger that a larger organisation that necessarily concentrates on the more important economic developments the Minister would call them strategic developments will either not deal with the smaller problems or it will do so in a way that, quite frankly, is not as cost-effective or as good as the RDC's approach.
<P>
I do not want money to be wasted in my constituency any more than I want it to be wasted elsewhere, and I do not want it wasted on a small scheme any more than I want it to be wasted on a large scheme. We must ensure that the smallest level is reached and that the hard-headed process of cost-effective scrutiny continues.
<P>
The clause deals with the RDC's ability to transfer its property, rights and liabilities to carry out relevant functions. Will the Minister repeat his assurances that the way in which the Secretary of State makes guidance, directions and appointments will pay particular attention to the ability to address small-scale problems which are intense local problems in rural areas and that those problems will be addressed with the equivalent expertise and cost-effectiveness of the Rural Development Commission?
<P>
I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk said about the Secretary of State's remarks about Lord Shuttleworth. They were silly and unfortunate remarks, and had the Secretary of State had time to reflect he might not have made them. Of course Lord Shuttleworth is a Tory, but many people in public life are capable of doing a good job without flying their own political flag. Most Members of Parliament do not wave their flags when they hold their constituency surgeries. We do not ask those who come to surgeries what party they voted for at the previous election. I have never done so, and I have a strong suspicion that if I looked at my canvas cards I might obtain a slightly more authoritative version of how those who volunteer their political allegiances may have voted. That does not affect my dealings with them.
<P>
We must get out of the habit of assuming that a person with a particular political label will inevitably have a set of attitudes and a culture with which we disagree. It is not mature to make such assumptions I hold quite a candle for the Deputy Prime Minister, who is an extremely able man in many respects but the comments about the noble Lord were silly. I hope that the Minister will put on record his appreciation of the work of the noble Lord and that of the Rural Development Commission. The Rural Development Commission will not disappear in its entirety, and the Minister should say something about how he envisages its evolution in a necessary partnership with regional development agencies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister was responding to a resignation letter that he received about one hour or so I am not sure of the exact time before he was to go to the Dispatch Box to introduce the White Paper. That resignation letter, rightly or wrongly, had found its way into the hands of the Opposition spokesperson, probably at the same time as it was received by the Deputy Prime Minister. I do not believe that that was the best thing to happen in such a situation. I can assure the Committee that I had a number of discussions with the Rural Development Commission and Lord Shuttleworth to discuss our plans in a constructive way. I have probably had more personal meetings with the RDC than with any other non-departmental public body with regard to the establishment of RDAs. I had a good working relationship with Lord Shuttleworth and I respect his work and the honourable position that he took in his resignation. The way in which he conducted himself in resigning, however, was somewhat questionable, and it was that which provoked my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
The Rural Development Commission has done, and will continue to do, a good job with regard to regeneration and policy development. It has been alleged that none of the rural organisations support the establishment of RDAs. I assure the Committee that the rural training and enterprise councils, for example, have been extremely supportive of the RDAs. They see the RDAs in a strategic context, and have welcomed the thrust and philosophy behind them. Action with Communities in Rural England have also made strong representations in support of the RDAs. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for South Suffolk noticed the near unanimity of support for RDAs when he perused the 1,500 submissions, and that he read in great detail, intent on what it said, the submission from Action with Communities in Rural England in support of the Government's policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I acknowledge that the concept of RDAs received some support from several organisations that responded to the Government's consultation exercise last summer. However, in my perusal of their responses, I did not find organisations that deal primarily with the countryside specifically advocating the dismemberment of the Rural Development Commission, and certainly not its abolition, with which the Secretary of State now has the power to proceed under the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That was not the specific question posed to the rural TECs or to Action with Communities in Rural England. They thought a better co-ordinated strategy under RDAs would be far better to address the problems of rural areas than those adopted hitherto. That is easy to understand.
<P>
Non-departmental public bodies that work in the field are subject to the comprehensive spending review, to which I have already referred in Committee. Such bodies include the Rural Development Commission, the Countryside Commission, English Nature, the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency and the MAFF next steps agency. A plethora of organisations must be considered. Any responsible Government would have to examine any overlap. It has been brought to our attention that there has been a proliferation of such organisations. We must examine the role of such organisations, whether an overlap occurs, and if so where, and whether we can move more strategically to deliver services. Of rural activities, 80 per cent. take place this side of the farm gate; 20 per cent. take place on the other side. That balance has shifted significantly. It is therefore right that we examine those institutions in our comprehensive spending review and discover whether they deliver and provide the best value for money.
<P>
The RDC's budget is about 40 million, about 25 million of which goes into its regional regeneration structure. Its skill is in levering in other amounts. A figure of 800 million was quoted as coming from the single regeneration budget. Over the past few days, in considering round four of the single regeneration budget, I have noticed several rural schemes in which the RDC is probably the lead player strategically, but the finance comes from other quarters such as the European structural fund and the single regeneration budget.
<P>
Is it not therefore logical to bring that philosophy to a new body, called a regional development agency? I assure the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) that guidance and appointments will be undertaken from the perspective that rural areas must have an informed voice on RDA boards. It is important to put that on the record.
<P>
Government policy, through the comprehensive spending review, is to examine existing organisations, as is sensible. We are all getting used to the flamboyant language of the hon. Member for South Suffolk, and we usually make allowance for it. He asked when RDC staff would be "sacked". I assure the Committee that we shall examine the role of the RDC, as with all areas under consideration, with a view to bringing stability whenever that is possible. We do not go around sacking people willy-nilly. That was more the philosophy of the previous Administration than it is of this one. We appreciate the skills that the staff employed by all such organisations deploy. We do not want to lose those skills; we want to bring stability. The comprehensive spending review has been accelerated so that we can come to some conclusions about what will be done with rural areas.
<P>
I take your advice, Mr. Benton, and will not, as the hon. Member for South Suffolk asked me to, discuss individual members of bodies outside RDAs other than to say that I believe that the chairman of the Countryside Commission, Richard Simmonds, is a former Member of the European Parliament.
<P>
Clause 38 would enable provision to be made for the transfer of property, rights and liabilities from the Rural Development Commission to regional development agencies. Subsection (1) would enable the Secretary of State through directions to require the Rural Development Commission to make one or more schemes transferring such property, rights and liabilities to an agency as seemed appropriate. Subsection (2) would allow for the specific details on transfer schemes, set out in schedule 8, to have effect in relation to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The concern that I feel as, I think, does my right hon. Friend, who expressed it eloquently has not been entirely allayed by the Minister's remarks. I dare say that we may return to the subject of agency functions when we consider amendments to clause 39. However, the Minister just acknowledged the success of the Rural Development Commission in levering in substantial extra sums of money to help it pursue its objectives. That success which I am glad the Minister recognises is not a powerful reason for running the Rural Development Commission down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Just to put the record straight, the figure from SRB was about 250 million. The total budget of the RDC is about 40 million and about 25 million of that is for regeneration work. There is a levering in of 10 times that about 250 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am happy that the Minister has had a chance to put the correct figures on the record. The point remains that if the Rural Development Commission is clearly successful, there appears to be no cogent reason for changing the basis on which it operates. The onus is on the Government to demonstrate that a completely different structure will maintain and even improve present performance. I am not sure that there has even been an attempt to make that case.
<P>
The Minister says that he appreciates the skills of the Rural Development Commission staff. I only plead that his appreciation will extend to ending as early as possible the uncertainty that affects some of those staff. I suspect that the comprehensive spending review will take some time to emerge from the agonised negotiations around Whitehall, and it is unfair that through no fault of their own individuals should be kept uncertain about their future, while spending Ministers do battle with the Treasury.
<P>
The Minister mentioned several agencies besides the Countryside Commission that are concerned with rural issues and communities and I therefore assume that it is in order for me to do so too, so I repeat my earlier question. The Minister told the Committee that he had encountered several ex-Tory Members of Parliament and of the European Parliament, while he was visiting the organisations that he named. How many were there? Four, five, 10 or 50? Or was there only one, and did the Minister last Thursday, at column 280, inadvertently mislead the Committee? Will he confirm that he met only one person such as he described, and that that one had nothing to do with the Rural Development Commission? I hope that he will clear up that matter once and for all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The theoretical points that the hon. Member for South Suffolk made this morning will serve no useful purpose for people in rural areas. We want to develop, through the RDAs, a strategic overview for the eight English regions outside London, and ensure that, for the first time, rural areas will make a major impact at regional level on strategic thinking on economic regeneration, and begin to tackle weaknesses in the competitive base of their regions.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Compartmental thinking has dominated, both in and outside rural areas. There is a proliferation of organisations in rural areas, and sometimes they do not co-operate sufficiently. But they have never been able to make an impact on major decisions about overall regeneration strategies. If the single regeneration budget is to be brought into the RDAs, it would be ludicrous to leave bodies such as the RDC out on a limb, without influence. Rural TECs presented a forceful argument that, for the first time, there would be a strategic overview. We will not simply be working in compartments. The RDC, through its innovatory abilities, will be allowed to bring together SRBs and objective 5b money from the structural funds.
<P>
Lincoln university, which is new, assists development in that part of the country. We want to encourage an overall view and strategy. That is accepted by many people in rural communities. It will enhance the quality of life and the potential for creating wealth.
<P>
It has been argued that organisations in rural areas should be kept at arm's length, dusted down occasionally and then told to return to their little serfdoms. That is a ludicrous way in which to tackle the serious problems of rural areas.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk was right. The Conservative party has had an enormous influence on rural areas for many years. I have nothing against Lord Shuttleworth. However, the Conservative party used quangos to make political appointments. That is well[Mr. Caborn]
documented. The chairperson of the Countryside Commission was a Member of the European Parliament. Political nominations to quangos have brought the Conservative party into disrepute. At one stage, one had to be a member of the Conservative party to become a school governor in some parts of England. The Conservative party's record is appalling. It has misused and politicised quangos.
<P>
The Labour party does not oppose quangos. We established, for example, Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh Development Agency. They were set up to create partnerships, not to be abused by an ideologically driven Government who were in power for 18 years. Plenty of evidence exists to show that the Conservative party often fixed membership of quangos.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> On a day when John Monks and Sheila McKechnie have been appointed to the board of the Bank of England, the Conservative party does not need to take lessons about the merits or ethics of appointing political supporters to key public posts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman questions the integrity of those people who have been appointed to the board of the Bank of England. I emphasise that we have changed the terms of reference for the SRBs. We have established monitoring committees, which include all the partnerships. I have met representatives of seven out of the nine or 10 English regions to discuss SRBs. Every director who visited me this week or last week claimed that we had created one of the best policies. They support bringing together people from right across the board who have an interest in their region, in a way that is not politically motivated, to advise Government offices. That will mean better-quality decisions, which will be accepted much more readily by the partnerships in the English regions.
<P>
The allegations made about the two people appointed to the board of the Bank of England are wrong. Their appointment will broaden the thinking of the Bank of England. Our policy on the single regeneration budget will greatly improve matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The point about political appointments nevertheless remains true. I make no judgment about the integrity of the individuals who have been appointed to the Bank of England, but their political affiliations are well known. It is pretty extraordinary for the Minister to argue, on the day the appointments are announced, that it is a new departure and that the Conservative party was wrong to appoint someone like Lord Shuttleworth to the chairmanship of the Rural Development Commission. The Government are doing exactly the same; perhaps that shows that little can be advanced in defence of the clause.
<P>
The Minister has been characteristically unwilling to confirm the truth of what I say. I therefore state, for the record, that there is no Tory ex-Member of Parliament or ex-Member of the European Parliament on the pay role of the Rural Development Commission, nor has there ever been, as the Minister tried to imply last Thursday. In spite of the Minister having said at that sitting it is reported in Hansard at column 280 that in his travels round the country he met several Tories who were formerly Members of the European Parliament or Members of Parliament, he actually met only one.

Clause 38 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 8 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 39</center></H4>
<H4><center>Powers in relation to the Commission</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 18, leave out lines 28 and 29.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 149, in page 18, leave out lines 30 and 31.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I preface my remarks in support of the amendments by reminding the Committee that it is not too late for the Government to withdraw clause 39; they showed their willingness to think again after a protracted debate at our previous sitting. I am happy to debate the amendments for the next couple of hours, as was necessary on Tuesday morning, and to withdraw them at the end of the debate, but if the Government wish to withdraw clause 39 immediately it will save us a lot of time. If, however, the clause is not withdrawn, as it should be many people outside the House would welcome that it is the Committee's duty to try to improve it.
<P>
Amendment No. 148 would prevent the Secretary of State from transferring the RDA's functions to other public bodies. Amendment No. 149 would prevent the Secretary of State from conferring on another body functions currently exercised by the RDC. Throughout the debate on Second Reading and our proceedings, the Government have put forward no argument of real substance notwithstanding the Minister's remarks today to support removal of more than half the budget and activities of the RDC. That is a big slice of the commission's work.
<P>
The true explanation, as many people have realised, is that the Government need to lay their hands on some money and want to find a pool of cash with which to fund the first activities of RDAs. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has been outgunned by other Departments in negotiations and cannot find enough cash, so the Secretary of State has turned to areas under his own control to milk them instead.
<P>
A pattern is emerging more and more clearly that where the Government have a financial need, rural areas must bear the cost. We have seen that in the national health service as counties such as Suffolk, which has had the smallest increase of any health authority in the Oxford and Anglia region, find resources switched away. Urban authorities are doing well while Suffolk does badly.
<P>
It is of direct relevance to the Bill that the same pattern has emerged for the revenue support grant. Distribution changes will take away 100 million from shire authorities, which reinforces the concerns of rural communities about the impact of RDAs. The same pattern applies to the proposed arrangements for the agencies.
<P>
The Government need clause 39 to give legislative respectability and approval to a smash-and-grab raid on the RDC. Subsections (1)(a) and (b) are the weapons that the Secretary of State may use to break up the RDC. There has been a consistent refusal to justify that action, but I remain hopeful, even at the 11th hour, that that will be put right. On Tuesday, the Minister consistently refused to justify seizure of planning powers from elected local councils in clauses 24 and 25; there was no justification for those clauses and they were withdrawn. In the same way, the Government have refused to justify the Secretary of State's smash and grab because there is no justification for it. I hope that Tuesday's precedent will be followed and the clause withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> The hon. Member for South Suffolk ended somewhat abruptly, and I am not quite ready. I have grown used to hearing him being more expansive.
<P>
Despite the Minister's response on clause 38, how half the RDC's work will be transferred to RDAs remains unclear. What will happen to the other half of the work? Clause 39 gives the Secretary of State the power to dissolve the RDC, but we do not know what would happen to the rest of the RDC's important work on national research and the advisory programme dealing with rural issues. That is an important part of its work.
<P>
It is worrying to those who serve rural areas that the funding for that part of the RDA's work is subject to comprehensive spending review. That is not comforting. However, the Under-Secretary assured the Committee during an earlier debate that the current RDC grant for the half of the work that is to be transferred to the RDAs will be ring-fenced.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have an RDC office in my constituency and the staff are worried about what will happen to them. How many of those who are currently working on regeneration projects will be transferred to RDAs? I do not share entirely the sentiments of the hon. Member for South Suffolk becaue RDC staff are in general constructive and positive about the changes. They see benefits in spreading the ethos of the RDC's tradition to the new RDAs. It is important that experience of a rural focus and small-scale local development should be an integral part of the ethos and experience of the RDA boards. We shall reserve our position on the amendments until we have heard the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am puzzled about the meaning of the clause. We understand that the regeneration work of the RDC will be transferred to the RDAs. If so, why does not the Bill say so and limit the provision to that? The clause is the most general provision imaginable and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"make provision for the transfer of any function of the Commission to another" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
unspecified 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"public body".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that code for the regeneration activities being passed to the RDAs, or does it refer to the residual activities of the RDC and, if so, where will they go?
<P>
My fear is that the RDC will be below critical mass. When the regeneration activities have gone, the remaining operation will be so small that it will be almost natural, during the next phase of a review, for people to question whether there is any point in an autonomous organisation continuing to deal with such piddly little matters. The Department seems to be positioning itself to get rid of the whole of the Rural Development Commission, and that may turn out to be the case. If the RDC's most important activities are removed, there may be an argument for removing the rest.
<P>
I do not understand why the Government are not transferring all the activities of English Partnerships to the RDAs. Maintaining it simply to keep the millennium dome ticking over seems illogical, and it would be better to take the rest and be done with it.
<P>
Where will the remaining activities of the RDC be transferred? What is the mysterious other "public body"? Will the Minister spell that out? Does the provision cover regeneration functions or residual functions, or is the Secretary of State giving himself the power to wind up the Rural Development Commission in toto? Will the Minister give examples of the sort of public body to which the clause refers?
<P>
As you would expect, Mr. Benton, I tried to enlighten myself by referring to the notes on clauses, but you will not be surprised to learn that they were singularly uniformative. The notes on clauses merely paraphrase the Bill in identical language, so again I was frustrated in my praiseworthy efforts to be adequately informed to debate the clause. I am sure that the Minister will be able to illuminate the matter in his characteristic epigrammatic style and explain precisely what the provision means.
<P>
So, to summarise, will regeneration functions or residuary functions be removed? Will that be done in one go or bit by bit, using salami tactics? What power will be granted? Is the Minister satisfied that the RDC's remaining activities will give it sufficient critical mass? Will he give two or three examples of other public bodies? What procedures will be involved? And will he please spare me the answer, "It will all be done by affirmative resolution in a Committee of the House of[Mr. Curry]
Commons."? If that were done, the characteristically critical faculties of Labour Members would, no doubt, be exercised in the same way as they have been exercised over the past few months.

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I shall deal first with the points of the hon. Member for South Suffolk. I shall try, once again, to explain to him how our proposals to enhance the RDC will affect RDAs.
<P>
The RDC's spend on regeneration is about 25 million, it levers in about 250 million from single regeneration budgets and objective 5b structural funds. Putting rural communities at the centre of the decision-making body will provide a strategic overview for regeneration and for wealth creation. As the Bill clearly states, RDAs will be responsible for those matters. Keeping the RDC at arm's length from that decision-making process is not the right way forward the RDC should be involved with RDAs' regeneration decisions.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk used the phrase "smash and grab", but anyone who reads the Official Report of our debate will appreciate that there is no smash or grab. By making that allegation, the hon. Gentleman showed a marked ignorance of the derivation of public money for RDAs. The SRB, which I think has a spend in excess of 1 billion, comes from four Government Departments: the Department for Education and Employment, the Department of Trade and Industry, what is now called the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and, latterly, the Home Office. All those Departments will be involved with RDAs through the SRB. To say that there has been a smash and grab by the DETR is absolutely ludicrous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does the Minister agree that his RDAs would have been more powerful if he had persuaded the DTI to send its regional selective assistance grants to them? That would have been a more strategic approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Not at all. The right hon. Gentleman, whose point of view I normally respect, surprises me. His comments on regional selective assistance grants suggests that he has not read the relevant parts of the White Paper or of the Bill as closely as he should have done. Money for RDOs will go directly through the RDAs.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that regional selective assistance is a United Kingdom issue. The previous Administration had problems dispensing regional selective assistance, and the Scots and the Welsh were accused rightly or wrongly of dominating the process. He and I know that government offices can already dispense up to 2 million, and that there has been much inward investment, which has been a distinct advantage to Scotland and Wales.
<P>
The President of the Board of Trade, my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), is bringing together a concordat at a United Kingdom level, which will be published soon. It will ensure fairness for all regions, including Scotland and Wales. It would be wrong to bring regional selective assistance under the control of RDAs without including a UK dimension because that would not secure value for money and it would put the English regions at a distinct disadvantage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister is now giving us information that it would have been useful to have when I asked how the Government would control competing subsidies between the regions. Now he tells us that the DTI will use one instrument to distribute selective assistance. It would be helpful if the mysterious concordat, which has been in the making for a long time it has been under negotiation for months could be published as soon as possible.
<P>
The Government announced that they wanted to reach a concordat a term with religious overtones and it would be helpful if we could see the concordat before Report. The problem of competing subsidies is important, as the Minister acknowledged on Second Reading. It is all very well to say that a concordat is being concocted, but we need to see the concoction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We are rehearsing arguments that the Committee has already debated. I was asked about regional selective assistance, and have explained a logical way of dealing with that part of regional selective assistance that relates to big mobile investments. It would put the English regions at a disadvantage to make that part of the role of RDAs. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said that the DTI was not co-operative in terms of the wider infrastructure of inward investment. The funding for RDOs will go through RDAs, and whether they want to include inward investment in the role of RDAs or want to contract it out 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> We are slightly confused. The Minister has mentioned RDOs alongside RDAs. Will he explain how the "O" fits into the "A"?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> An RDO is a regional development organisation, like the investment arm of Yorkshire and Humberside. RDOs are charged with responsibility for inward investment. They are bodies with which the private sector will be involved, but public money will be channelled through RDAs. They may then contract out inward investment. The money provided by central Government to support those organisations will now go through RDAs.
<P>
It is unfortunate that the right hon. Gentleman, who has been in the House for many years as a Minister for some of them is not even familiar with the terminology of RDOs. So let me explain in words of one syllable. Public expenditure for inward investment will go through RDAs. Regional selective assistance will stop at UK-level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am sorry, but I am still not very clear, and it seems that the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Agency is not clear either. I have a document from Mr. Eric Wright, chairman of Yorkshire and Humberside Development Agency, in which answers are given to questions posed by the regional business community. One of those questions is,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"What are the implications for YHDA?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The answer is,
<P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is for the region to decide whether the RDA should undertake inward investment work itself or contract the work out to YHDA. This decision has yet to be made."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, there is some confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman tell us the date of that publication?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I can only tell the hon. Gentleman that it came in today's post.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> It is okay making statements like that in Committee, but will the right hon. Gentleman check exactly the date of the document from which he is quoting? We made the position clear on DTI expenditure on RDOs, such as the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Agency that is an RDO in Yorkshire, if the right hon. Gentleman wants it spelt out. We provide public money from central and local government and the private sector supports that. That body will now be funded directly through the RDAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is February 1997 it just came in the post today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I rest my case. The hon. Gentleman should get up to date. Some of the Opposition's thinking is set in 1997.
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It may have got the date wrong.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let us move on.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I have a feeling that the agency may be chronologically challenged.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can only suggest that the hon. Gentleman challenges it outside the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Thank you, Mr. Benton. I shall do my best to move on.
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton referred to half the RDAs' resources. I accept that there is some uncertainty surrounding the RDC. the Countryside Commission and others that are subject to the comprehensive spending review. We shall try to conclude the review as quickly as possible.
<P>
The regeneration part of the RDC's work will come under the RDAs. That argument has been well rehearsed. The rest of the RDC's work it is a national organisation is being considered in the CSR. We will want to retain the expertise that is at its national level, but I am not able to say whether that will stay in the organisation or go, for example, to the Countryside Commission. We want to keep the expertise, in one form or another, in an organisation that will be able to provide the regional structures to carry out important data collection and other services. Where the expertise will be domiciled is open to question because of the CSR.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Where it will be domiciled is not as important as whether the funding will be retained for that aspect of its work. It will be difficult for us to support subsections of the clause that give the Secretary of State the ability to dissolve the RDC unless we know the outcome of the CSR and we receive the reassurance that that work will continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I understand that. The Opposition will have to make that judgment. We are trying to bring together a more effective organisation which will deliver for rural areas and the countryside in general. We want an organisation that offers better value for money while providing a strategic overview. That is important. It is why we are undertaking a serious CSR. We are not just talking about finances; we want to know whether organisations are delivering what they say they are delivering and, if not, whether they can be made better.
<P>
In the consultations that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I carried out after the White Paper was published, we contacted not only English Partnerships and the government office, but all the RDC's staff. We gave them an opportunity to discuss matters with us. We want to retain the skills that are inherent at regional and national levels. We will try to create an organisation that will give us full value for money while contributing its full knowledge and wisdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> No one complains that organisations should be subject to periodic scrutiny that is obviously sensible. Will the Minister confirm that the clause is giving the Government the power to wind up and transfer the remaining activities of the RDC? I am not making a judgment because that may or may not be the right thing to do, but I want to be clear that that is what the clause says.
<P>
Incidentally, the paper from the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Agency asks for comments to be received prior to Wednesday 11 March 1998, so I surmise that it should be dated February this year.

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Either that, or it is a long consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): With this Government, it probably will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is not true. We had a consultation, produced a White Paper and presented a Bill to Parliament in less than seven months. That is pretty good going by any stretch of the imagination. No allegations can be made that we do not consult or produce White Papers for debate. Although they have not responded to the challenge, Oppositon Members have been given every opportunity to scrutinise the Bill in much more detail and with much more intellectual gravitas than has been forthcoming. I rest my case.
<P>
It may take some time, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that the amendments would transfer powers and leave a corpse; the RDC would have no function at all, as I shall explain later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Will the Minister confirm that an outcome of his fundamental spending review may be a decision to dissolve remaining activities of the RDC? Just to be clear on the chronology, could it be a consequence, as early as that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Equally so, the comprehensive spending review may result in our retaining the RDC.[Mr. Caborn]
Those options are open, and must remain open, while we are undertaking a comprehensive spending review, which the clause allows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I do not dispute that. The Minister has just argued that the clause gives the power to dissolve the commission. I have said that there may be a case for that. I then said that the earliest opportunity at which that might take place could be as a consequence of the fundamental spending review that is now under way. We could face a motion in the House, which the clause states would be on affirmative resolution, to dissolve the remaining functions, in the relatively near future, if that were the outcome of the spending review. If the outcome were to go in the opposite direction and bolster it, no doubt we would applaud that. I merely want to be sure that the first rendezvous, as it were, is the outcome of that spending review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is right, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I have made clear to the Committee. Moreover, I have put pressure on those involved to accelerate the comprehensive spending review because I want to remove uncertainty. I also want to ensure that we have an organisation that is fit to deliver for rural areas and the countryside in general. It is in everyone's interest to ensure that decisions are made as a result of the comprehensive spending review as quickly as possible. That is a desirable aim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Could the other public body to which he refers be the regional development agency itself? Could residual functions be transferred to RDAs, giving them the entire RDC competence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I could paint many scenarios. I could ask the RDC to have a representative from each of the nine English regions on its board. I cannot answer such questions, because the comprehensive spending review is examining such matters in terms of policy, spending and organisation. As quickly as we can, we shall bring to the House the result of that review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> It is interesting that the Minister can paint many scenarios of what the provisions mean. Surely it is the Minister's role to decide what the scenarios should be, and to put it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The Opposition Whip did not understand that I was saying that many scenarios could be painted as outcomes of the comprehensive spending review. The comprehensive spending review is examining not only the RDC but all those bodies that deliver to rural areas the Countryside Commission, English Nature, the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency and the MAFF next steps agency are all included. Many scenarios can therefore be painted.
<P>
I should like to turn to English Partnerships. It is disgraceful that Opposition Members talk about EP as though it existed merely for the dome. Conservative Members ravaged coalfield communities by closing 31 pits. I know that that does not matter to Conservative Members, who are chatting on the Back Benches. Some of us, however, believe that we owe a debt to those mining communities. Therefore, with the coalfield communities initiative put in train by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, English Partnerships has started to examine how to bring some hope and life back to those communities. It is disgraceful for Conservative Members to claim that all that English Partnerships has to do is to look after a dome a few miles from here. We are trying our hardest to reinvigorate physically and socially some of the most ravaged parts of the United Kingdom, which the previous Administration reduced to that state. Those coalfield communities have served the nation well in war and in peace. They kept the lights on and the energy supply going, but the previous Administration just cast them to the wind. With English Partnerships, we are trying to bring hope back to those communities, and all that Conservative Members can do is to be dismissive. If there is a guilt complex it should be weighing heavily on the minds and hearts of Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> That is all very spectacular, but it does not make much sense. If the RDAs are capable of co-operating with each other as the Minister claimed that they were in an early debate on the frontiers of RDAs, which I raised in relation to the Thames gateway they must be capable of co-operating in relation to coalfield communities, which span a number of areas. If the Minister believes in devolution to the local level, in empowering people and making them responsible, why does he not have confidence in the ability of RDAs to co-ordinate the full competency of English Partnerships to solve the problems of coalfield communities? Nobody is suggesting that those problems should not be addressed, but I question the logic of maintaining a rump of English Partnerships to supervise a handful of schemes if the Minister's confidence in the RDAs is justified.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the Minister replies, I remind the Committee that we are straying slightly from the amendment. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I will do so, Mr. Benton. Our great love for the coalfield communities and the contribution that they have made provoked me to stray a little from the amendment. English Partnerships can be wound up under clause 39, as can the Rural Development Commission. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that coalfield communities are an important part of the work of English Partnerships, just as the millennium dome could be part of the work of the London RDA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> With respect, the Minister said that English Partnerships could be wound up under this clause. This clause specifies the Rural Development Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, accurate and in time clause 41 is the relevant clause. He will want to share his thoughts on the coalfield communities when we debate clause 41.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Taunton's point about consultation between staff and the RDA board, we are taking a strategic view to ensure that the RDC is taken seriously at board level.
<P>
Clause 39 contains provisions relating to the Rural Development Commission, including the Secretary of State's powers to tansfer functions from the RDC to other public bodies or to confer on other public bodies all or part of a function of the RDC. That would be achieved by statutory instrument, which would be subject to affirmation resolution by both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
Amendment No. 148 would prevent the Secretary of State from transferring any existing RDC functions to another public body. Amendment No. 149 would prevent the Secretary of State from conferring functions corresponding to those of the RDC to any other body. Those amendments, in combination with amendments Nos. 150 to 152, would leave the Secretary of State with only the power to stop the RDC from exercising any of its functions, although the RDC would continue as an organisation. That would be a ludicrous situation.
<P>
The future of the RDC is being considered as part of the comprehensive spending review. Whatever the outcome of that review we are committed to retaining a national focus for expertise, advice and information on rural matters. The Bill must allow for any number of options, pending the outcome of the comprehensive spending review. The amendments would allow for only one the retention of the Rural Development Commission, whether or not that appeared best for rural areas and regardless of whether the commission remained viable as a purely national organisation. That would not be acceptable. Is it imaginable that a core organisation should exist, with no function? The amendments would bring that about. They are irresponsible, and I hope that they were tabled as probing amendments.
<P>
I understand that the hon. Member for South Suffolk is concerned about rural interests and about how the regional development agencies would protect them. I can reassure him that, as I have said often, the Government are committed to promoting the interests of rural areas. The best way to do that is by attending to their specific needs within an overall framework for the economic development and regeneration of a region as a whole. By putting urban and rural regeneration on the same footing within the regions, we will ensure that rural interests are given their full weight.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The regional development agencies will have a specific remit in relation to rural areas. We envisage that they will design rural development programmes targeted on their most deprived rural areas, and will monitor, consult and report on rural programmes and how they are being tackled. The funds that they will inherit from the Rural Development Commission will be separately allocated to ensure that they continue to be spent on rural areas. I believe that the hon. Member for Taunton asked about that. Also, at least one member of each regional development agency board outside London will be able to contribute a strong rural perspective. Where there are larger rural areas, more such members may be needed.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for South Suffolk will see that the Government are committed to rural areas, and I ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Government's commitment to rural areas is perhaps illustrated by the fact that the only time any passion entered the Minister's speech was when he spoke about the coalfield communities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> They are in rural areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I was about to say that; it is true that some are in rural areas, but a great many rural areas have real needs that the Rural Development Commission has helped to meet and which have nothing to do with coalfields. It is a pity that the Minister's interest is so narrowly focused.
<P>
Far from being irresponsible, as the Minister tried to characterise them, the amendments have provoked an important debate one of the most important that the Committee has had. I assure the Minister that they are not just probing amendments. I am very concerned about the wide powers that the Secretary of State would obtain under clause 39(1)(a) and (b). Those provisions clearly give the Secretary of State the power to dismember the Rural Development Commission. What is proposed is not just the transfer of the regeneration functions; it is a matter of abolishing the Rural Development Commission, something that we shall debate when we reach later amendments.
<P>
We have had a chilling warning not the first that this Committee has received. Not only have the Government not made up their mind what other RDC functions they want to transfer, or to what public bodies regional development agencies would be an option, but the Bill does not specify that, so there would be others, and on the whole I am glad of it but, most significant, the Minister has said that the decisions will not be taken until the outcome of the comprehensive spending review is available. That is the heart of the matter. This is nothing to do with meeting the needs of rural areas, or concern for the future of rural communities, whether coalfields or not. It is about cash, the Chancellor's demands on the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and his expectation that the Secretary of State will decide how to meet rural areas' needs only after he has reached financial targets that will be set without reference to those needs. That is an astonishing admission; Ministers are in the business not of making policy, but of doing the Treasury's bidding. They examine the spending, and think about rural areas only after fulfilling the Treasury's requirements. It is an extraordinary way in which to decide Government priorities. Of course, financial considerations must be a constraint on any Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Ah!
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> But not even the most biased critic of the previous Government can claim that every policy stemmed from a spending review in advance of its conclusions. The Minister said that he could not decide on even a minor matter, such as the future of the headquarters staff of the Rural Development Commission, until he reached an agreement with the Treasury about the outcome of the comprehensive spending review. The policy is not needs driven, but cash driven. The Committee and others outside will[Mr. Yeo]
remain ignorant of the Government's intentions for the commission's functions, apart from those of regeneration.
<P>
I share the anxiety of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon that removing the regeneration functions of the RDC could threaten the viability of its other functions. That was the intention when the policy decision was announced. It is a step-by-step process of dismemberment.
<P>
We have established that the document to which my right hon. Friend referred is current and not 12 months out of date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Have we?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Yes. If any doubt remains, the matter will certainly be clarified by Tuesday.
<P>
It is clear from the document that there is great confusion at the sharp end about what is happening. The Minister believes that the matter is clear, but it is not clear in the minds of those responsible for implementing the Bill's objectives. That is serious, but not surprising. The Minister's answer to any question about the Rural Development Commission is that he can say nothing until the comprehensive spending review is completed.
<P>
Under the circumstances, it is necessary to press the amendment to a Division. If the Minister had been able to tell the Committee which functions would be transferred, we might have been persuaded to withdraw the amendment. However, he insists that the sweeping power should remain in the Bill.
<P>
