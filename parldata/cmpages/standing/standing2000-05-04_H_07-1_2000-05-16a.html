<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 19, in page 17, leave out lines 22 to 41.—[Mr. Letwin.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): We were discussing whether there is sufficient reason to retain proposed new section 161, which relates to writs of assistance. I should not want to bore the Committee by repeating the arguments advanced before we adjourned. Suffice it to say that before I would be willing to withdraw the amendment, I would want to hear from the Paymaster General an absolutely compelling case for retaining the writ of assistance, in the light of the fact that it is a draconian measure that is not matched by the powers that the police have.
<P>
If I may, I shall discuss amendment No. 20, which is also in this group.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not in order. We are discussing amendment No. 19, and hon. Members will notice from the selection list that amendment No. 20 is to be debated separately, not with amendment No. 19.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In that case, Dr. Clark, I have finished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I shall be brief in commenting on this Conservative amendment, which the Liberal Democrats do not support. In an informal exchange with the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), I commented that he was in danger of becoming a dangerous liberal As far as I can tell, he is trying to remove powers from Customs and Excise that it requires to tackle fraud and smuggling, especially as, as we discussed in debating earlier clauses, smuggling is on the increase. The Paymaster General will correct me if I am wrong, but I imagine that those powers help Customs and Excise in its fight against drugs and highly damaging criminal activities.
<P>
The clause amends Customs and Excise's existing powers—which are wide ranging and, to some minds, including my own, too great—to search and forfeit without any safeguard for the citizen. The Government seem to be trying to strike a balance between ensuring that Customs and Excise has the power to tackle smuggling and catch drug criminals, for example, while ensuring that United Kingdom law is in line with the Human Rights Act 1998 and does not give overbearing powers to officials but ensures that some safeguards for citizens are provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the difference between proposed new sections 161 and 161A is the judgment of what is reasonable? If a magistrate judges that there are reasonable grounds for suspicion, he will issue a search warrant. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that Customs and Excise should be the arbiter of that reasonableness, rather than a magistrate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am saying that writs of assistance have been part of the armoury of Customs and Excise officials for centuries—
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo) indicated assent—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Paymaster General nods. During many Conservative Administrations, those powers were in the hands of officials, and it was not thought then that they were an affront to civil liberties. Time moves on—and, I hope, our tests for what is right progress.
<P>
Liberal Democrats welcomed the new test and safeguard for the rights of the citizen that the Government introduced, by enshrining the European convention on human rights in British law through the Human Rights Act 1998. Despite the fact that smuggling is increasing, the Government are right to say that the powers must be in line with that Act.
<P>
The Government are also right to say that Customs and Excise needs the powers, however. There are instances when large-scale criminals, who smuggle not only cigarettes but narcotics and do a huge amount of damage throughout the country, can be seized only on the spot. It would be wrong for the Committee and the House to say that customs officials must allow a van that is right in front of their noses and that they know is full of narcotics to go past because they do not have the powers of a search warrant from a magistrate. That would clearly be nonsense, and I hope that the hon. Member for West Dorset will agree with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that the police should have a writ of assistance, and not have to rely on a search warrant when they have similar grounds for suspicion about narcotics to those he has described? Is that Liberal policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> No, that is not the position. We are discussing Customs and Excise officials, who operate on the country's frontiers—
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman says no, but in the main they act on the borders, which was why they were established many centuries ago. The Government are modernising the powers of those officials, in recognition of the fact that we have a different balance now. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, of course. We must have a balance and we must ensure that those rights are safeguarded—I speak on behalf of a party that has a deep commitment to the civil liberties of our citizens. I am not making a partisan point, as I believe that all parties in the House have that commitment.
<P>
I cannot believe, however, that the hon. Gentleman really wants to push his position as he is doing today; he would not do so if he consulted his right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe). He seems to want to take from the authorities at the borders the power to prevent some serious crimes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): Will the hon. Gentleman show us where the Bill states that the powers are only to be exercised at the border of our country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am not basing my case solely on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Yes, you are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> No; if the hon. Gentleman had been listening to me he would have noticed that I did not try to make that point. The reality is that in the vast majority of cases those powers will be exercised at the frontier. However, because we need to change Customs and Excise practices, those powers are increasingly used inland—normally at the excise houses, and on the roads and fairways that lead to them. They are not used in street corner shops, and so on.
<P>
The issue is whether such strong powers should be retained in that small number of cases where they are deemed necessary to tackle serious crime. I believe that the Government have got the balance right. We might need to revisit that issue, but the liberalisation measure in the clause is right. They would be wrong to go as far as the hon. Member for West Dorset suggests, and I hope that they will reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I start with the point on which I think the Committee will agree with the hon. Member for West Dorset. He is correct to draw attention to powers in the Bill that Customs and Excise can operate and to seek clarification on their extent and the reasons for them. By going through some basic points, I hope to reassure him.
<P>
The debate is focusing on the question of whether there should be search warrants or the continued use of writs of assistance. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that there is currently no requirement to limit the use of writs of assistance. By practice, Customs and Excise has been careful in how the power has been used. We have decided that it is correct to put into legislation how we expect the limit to operate on a writ of assistance.
<P>
It might help the Committee if I explain briefly what writs of assistance are and give examples of seizures in which they have been used. I shall also state the frequency with which they are used, as the matter is important. Finally, I shall return to the questions that are at the heart of the hon. Gentleman's points, which are whether the power is appropriate for the work of Customs and Excise and whether it is unnecessary because an alternative can easily be used.
<P>
Writs of assistance are documentary authorisations to search unspecified premises for smuggled goods and anything else liable to forfeiture under customs law. They do not apply only at our frontiers, but operate inland if that is where the goods are. They are issued by the Queen's bench division of the High Court at the beginning of a monarch's reign and remain valid for six months after the end of the reign. During that time they are lodged at various Customs offices, where the senior manager is responsible for their use.
<P>
The issue of writs of assistance is entirely under the control of that Customs and Excise senior manager. My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) gave a good example about drugs. The point made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) was that seizure would not be possible where goods were liable to be moved rapidly.
<P>
During March 2000, information was received that a container carrying cigarettes was being delivered to an address in Barking from which it would be removed within an hour. The writ of assistance was used to gain entry to the premises as there was insufficient time to obtain a search warrant. More than 5 million cigarettes were seized. Three people were arrested and subsequently charged with excise offences. Without the operation of the writ, the consignment would have been lost and the opportunity missed to knock out a major criminal organisation. Given what the Conservative party has said about other issues connected with criminal activity, it expects quick and decisive action when necessary.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall cite another example. In August 1999, on the basis of information that premises in the Thanet area were due to be cleared of duty-unpaid cigarettes, a team with a writ responded in one hour. That included driving the 20 miles to the location. For the detection of 165,000 cigarettes, the premises were searched and the goods were seized one to two hours before clearout was due. Such an opportunity would have been lost had a writ not been granted.
<P>
As part of an exercise in January this year, a blitz operation took place. Officers visited a house in Wales, but were refused entry. They saw a significant number of smuggled cigarettes in the hall and used the writ to gain entry and seize the goods before they could be moved. In February this year, following information received about events in Glasgow, a woman was seen at a motor vehicle with bags of cigarettes. When approached by officers, she immediately ran off to a house with some of the bags. She refused to answer the door. The officers confirmed, from the cigarettes left in the car, that duty had not been paid on them. The officers obtained a writ to gain entry to the house and cigarettes were seized.
<P>
I am trying to demonstrate the speed that might be necessary when using the writ as a result of intelligence information. The hon. Member for West Dorset is saying that the use of the writ instead of a search warrant should not become the status quo. Under the amendment, writs of assistance could be used only in emergencies. We estimate that that might be 5 per cent. of the total cases.
<P>
I have to hand the figures from 1989 to 1998–99. In 1989, writs were used 230 times. By 1997–98, they had been used 263 times and, in 1998–99, writs were used on 301 occasions. We want to enable customs to respond quickly. The clause modifies the power to enter and search premises for smuggled goods. It is intended that such power should be used only in urgent situations, hence the requirements under the Bill. I must say to the hon. Gentleman that failure to have the power would be inappropriate given the intelligence-led work of much of our challenges to smuggling, be it of cigarettes, drugs or other illegal items in the United Kingdom.
<P>
We shall resist the amendment. To abolish the power to enter premises entirely would severely undermine the ability of customs to deal with an ever-growing and extensive criminal activity. We are limiting a power. It was never questioned under the previous Government. It is not as though we are giving customs such powers for the first time. We are asking ourselves what is appropriate and trying to find the balance between safeguarding the work of customs and protecting rights. It is a question not just of loss of revenue, which is obviously very important, but—as I have explained several times—of the strategies that Customs and Excise is developing to break up the ability of criminal networks to distribute the goods, as well as to remove those goods. We can pour staff into seizing goods, but as long as people believe that they are beyond the scope of prosecution we will be dealing with an impossible position.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman might like me to explain the procedure for issuing the writ. This touches on his point about the power, which is substantial, not being set for all time, never to be revisited. The writs are lodged under secure conditions in Customs and Excise offices where the manager is responsible for their custody and use. To obtain a writ, the case officer must apply in writing to the senior manager and provide evidence as necessary to support his or her application, which should include an explanation of why a search warrant is inappropriate. The biggest problem will be time and the danger of goods being moved on.
<P>
If the senior manager decides that the application is justified, he or she will release the writ to the officer—the named officer in the record—who must return it to the senior manager as soon as the search or searches that the officer intends to carry out, under the authority of the writ, have been completed. Full records are maintained in the relevant local customs offices on the use and return of every writ to Customs and Excise. We can therefore continue to monitor the appropriate use of the power.
<P>
The only other question is that of an appeal against the use of a writ. When customs uses a writ of assistance as an authority to search premises, the owner or occupier of those premises cannot prevent that search. However, if that person is unhappy with the way in which he or she has been treated by customs, he or she may make a written or verbal complaint, which has to be dealt with formally in accordance with the standard procedure of customs for complaints handling. That involves the appropriate officer carrying out a thorough investigation of the complaint and issuing a reply within 10 working days, in which the findings on the reasons for using the writ of assistance are fully set out.
<P>
If the complaint is upheld, the reply will say what customs intends to do to put it right. That may vary. If someone is still not satisfied with the handling of his or her complaint, he or she can ask the adjudications office to examine the case. If still dissatisfied after the adjudicator's decision, he or she may ask the local Member of Parliament to refer the case to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. Checks are therefore in place.
<P>
I shall respond to the other points made by the hon. Member for West Dorset. The power is being reduced to make it clear that a search warrant should be used, except in exceptional, urgent circumstances in which applying for a search warrant would lead to the loss of the seizure through the goods being moved. The records on the use of the writ are kept clearly and it is an appropriate power, given the challenges that we now face, and the speed with which drugs and other goods are moved. While the writ for access to premises was still necessary, we believed that it should be limited on the grounds of reasonableness. That is the effect of the clause.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that explanation. His amendment completely removes our ability to use the writ to enter premises under such circumstances, which would leave us dependent on a search warrant. Given the exceptional problems of time constraints that may occur, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that it is appropriate that the writ of assistance remains, albeit limited by the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In the light of the Paymaster General's remarks, which we accept in good faith, we would not want to press the amendment to a vote. However, we will want to revisit the matter next year, and, perhaps, in succeeding years, depending on which party forms the next Administration. If the current Government are still in power when we consider the next Finance Bill, perhaps the Paymaster General or her successor will explain how the provision has been used, how many times and in what way. All hon. Members should keep a watchful eye on how it is being used. I accept that, if it is sparingly used, it may do no harm. As the notes on clauses state, and as the Paymaster General was at pains to admit, it remains an exceptional and rather odd provision. It may, in due course, need further tightening. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 18, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) Nothing seized shall be copied, retained or used in any way if the thing seized is subject to legal professional privilege.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to tarry long on this amendment. Indeed, I was so anxious to deal with it quickly that I did so in excessive haste earlier. Before I speak about the amendment, I want to point out that seizure—which arises on page 18 of the Bill, especially at line 14—causes considerable anxiety. A letter from a constituent of one of my hon. Friends makes it clear that there is a great deal of latitude in how Customs and Excise proceeds in the case of a seizure that is contested. There are two modes of appeal—one at condemnation proceedings before a magistrate, and one at a tribunal. Different Customs and Excise officers take different views on whether a seizure is a decision to refuse to release the goods, and, therefore, whether the appeal at the tribunal can progress while condemnation proceedings are stood over. That is one of many complexities that arise in cases of seizure.
<P>
Although the relevant subsection applies under the power of search warrant, seizure, if directed against a dreadful criminal, is thoroughly sensible and legitimate. However, it is a very strong power. In that context, the Opposition have tabled amendment No. 20. The same spirit lies behind the amendment as was exhibited by the Paymaster General in relation to the previous subsection. We are open to correction, but our impression is that the drafting of the provision would allow Customs and Excise to seize and use a document that, under normal circumstances, would be subject to legal professional privilege. That seems an excessive power given that, to use the analogy again, under normal circumstances the police could not engage in a similar use of such an item after having seized it at port. I believe that I am right to say that they would have to return it if it had come into their possession.
<P>
Amendment No. 20 probes whether our interpretation is correct. If it is, it raises whether it is justifiable that legally privileged documents can be seized and used. Finally, it stands as a general question about whether the powers of seizure are adequately controlled.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman again, and hope that that means that we can deal with the amendment quickly. The amendment seeks to prevent anything seized during a premises search from being copied, retained or used if it is subject to legal professional privilege. We shall resist it because it is unnecessary, and I shall briefly explain why. Section 19 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which applies to customs investigations through the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Application to Customs and Excise) Order 1985, already goes further than the amendment, as it prohibits the seizure of items if there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are subject to legal privilege. In fact, the amendment would give us wider powers. It would limit what officers could do with seized legally privileged items, but would not prevent their seizure in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for that explanation. She may quickly relieve our anxieties. Will she confirm that her understanding and that of her advisers is that, under PACE, any document found ex post to be a legally privileged document would have to be returned and not used?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am not sure that I can answer that question as accurately at the moment as I should on such a serious matter. A document should not be seized if there is reasonable doubt that it is a legal document. PACE requires us to respect legal privilege. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to consider the matter, I shall be happy to let him and all the members of the Committee know in writing, as I would not want to mislead him. I am sure that the safeguards that he requires are in place. Legal privilege is a hotly defended principle that is to be respected, and the legislation makes no attempt to do otherwise. I shall reply to the hon. Gentleman on that specific point, as it relates to a more general point about how Customs and Excise operates when documents are found to be covered by legal privilege, even if they are protected under PACE.
<P>
I can give the basic reassurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks, in that his amendment is unnecessary because the PACE provisions cover Customs and Excise. We should be in order on that principle. On that basis, I hope that he will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On the basis of that reassurance, and pending a further explanation in writing that would permit us to return to the matter on Report if that explanation is not as full as the Paymaster General expects, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 26</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to search articles</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 18, line 42, after `search', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but, in any event, for not more than fifteen minutes'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee long, although perhaps that is a bad metaphor to use. Amendment No. 21 relates to a provision that contains what is, to the layman, some apparently odd drafting. It allows Customs and Excise to detain a person who has been placed under arrest because of an article being searched that is on or about the person being detained
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for so long as may be necessary to carry out the search.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To the layman, that seems to be as long as a piece of string.
<P>
The amendment is largely a probing amendment. The Paymaster General may tell us that it is established practice of Customs and Excise to limit the period and not to use the power to detain people for a long time when there are other reasons why it may be convenient for Customs and Excise to do so. Provided we have a clear assurance on that matter, I shall not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I am just trying to picture the scene of a Customs and Excise officer with a stopwatch in one hand, frustrated and thinking, ``If only the Conservatives hadn't bound us with this ridiculous regulation of 15 minutes, we might be able to find whatever is secreted away in that vehicle.'' Is the hon. Gentleman really suggesting that the amendment would help, rather than hinder, law enforcement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As I have been trying to explain—although I would not expect the hon. Gentleman, with his usual partisan spirit, to have followed very closely the line of argument that I was advancing—I do not hang my hat on 15 minutes. I want to probe—
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): Plucked out of the air.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes, plucked out of the air, as the Government Whip, in his usual pellucid fashion, says from a sedentary position, in order to probe the limits that will in practice be placed on the use of the power. If the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) suspended his partisanship for a moment, he might agree that he, too, would dislike what the amendment is intended to prevent—what might under the clause constitute legal but nevertheless be in moral terms abusive use of the power, whereby Customs and Excise holds people up for an awfully long time on the pretext that it is necessary in order to search them but in fact in the hope of putting them under pressure.
<P>
I am not saying that that is what Customs and Excise has been doing. I have no knowledge of the matter. However, to a layman, the drafting seems to allow that. I hope that the Paymaster General will be able to reassure us that guidance and practice lie behind the drafting, which would relieve our anxieties about such quasi-abuse.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall ask the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing the amendment once I have explained why it is unnecessary, and I shall ask my hon. Friends to resist it should it be pressed to a Division. The clause empowers Customs officers to search the articles of people, when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that they also have with them alcohol and tobacco products, which are chargeable to duty or liable for seizure. It will enable Customs to tackle more effectively the increase in the number of people who carry smuggled goods on foot. The change in the law reinforces and underlines the Government's commitment to tackling such criminal activity.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would time limit such searches to 15 minutes. Customs have no wish to detain people longer than is necessary to ascertain the contents of their accompanying luggage. An officer will be permitted to detain a person or an article for as long as is necessary to carry out the search. If an officer detains a person or article for longer than necessary, he or she will clearly be acting outside the law. I must correct the hon. Gentleman by saying that people being searched are not under arrest. Such a power is only a search power.
<P>
Clearly, it would not be acceptable to have a time limit under the Bill whereby those who were engaged in criminal activity could spin out the time as a result of which Customs was unable to carry out the search. Equally, it is not in the interests of Customs to antagonise members of the public and, thus, officers will ensure that the search is carried out as quickly as possible. In most cases, the time necessary to search one item such as a bag, sack or a suitcase will be far less than 15 minutes—and so it should be. We do not want to make it sound as though one Customs officer could take 15 minutes to search a bag. A balance must be struck in ensuring that such searches are carried out as quickly as possible.
<P>
There are circumstances, however, when setting a prescriptive time limit would handicap Customs and prevent it from dealing with smuggled cigarettes, for example. A recent case involved a person who had 16 suitcases. When the suitcases were searched—which I am sure that members of the Committee appreciate would take slightly longer than 15 minutes—they were found to contain 160,000 cigarettes. Under the amendment, what must a Customs officers do? Will he have to stop searching after eight suitcases and say, ``Okay, lad, off you go''? That is not acceptable. The hon. Gentleman has gone on before in Committee about sending out the wrong signal. We would be saying to smugglers that they could enter the country with 32 suitcases given that the grounds of probability of our finding the one that had the smuggled goods within 15 minutes would be a racing chance.
<P>
A prescriptive time limit could be exploited in ways in which honest members of the Committee would find it difficult to dream up. But such individuals are ever-creative in how they seek to get goods into the country. The amendment appears to be introducing a safeguard for the public, but it would undermine matters. Such individuals make a living and a profit at the expense of honest taxpayers and shopkeepers. We are not talking about the detection of a few extra packets of cigarettes that people inadvertently bring in over their limits, but of hundreds of thousands of cigarettes, perhaps 20,000, 40,000, or 60,000 at a time. I am informed that, in our experience, 20,000, 40,000 or 60,000 can be contained in only two or three suitcases, so we need the power.
<P>
5.15 pm
<P>
I shall continue so that the hon. Gentleman is clear in his mind what is going on. The power that the clause proposes will enable Customs and Excise to tackle more effectively the unsavoury behaviour that takes place in car parks near the hoverport in Dover. Foot passengers can be seen blatantly passing packages to waiting accomplices and literally running to catch the next hovercraft to go back and get more goods.
<P>
To give the scale in legal activity, I shall give examples. On Sunday 30 April, customs of officers accompanied by police and market inspectors visited a market in east London. They seized 43,000 cigarettes and 18 kg of tobacco, which were on sale. The access to where the tobacco is concealed in bags is important.
<P>
On Sunday 7 May, on another visit to another London market—I am giving London only as a close example that we can all understand, but it is not solely a London issue—73,900 cigarettes, 24 kg of tobacco and seven vehicles were seized. Detections made by customs could be even higher. We see the activity but currently do not have the power to tackle it. We would all agree that that power is necessary.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Dorset rightly says, the power is open to complaints through the procedures already discussed on the clause if it is not correctly used. As a Minister, I have to reply to innocent members of the travelling public who may have been searched coming through, for instance, Heathrow airport. I have to explain that the issue is about protection from criminal activity. The information that we have collected will enable us to deal with people blatantly cocking a snook at honest members of the community. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want to see the protection of those individuals rather than that of honest taxpayers.

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I may be showing my ignorance, but I would be grateful if the Paymaster General explained whether the police or customs officials have similar powers when they believe that someone is smuggling narcotics.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I understand that that is so, as the matter is about forfeiting illegal goods. I have given examples about cigarettes because those cases have proceeded. The legal process for narcotics cases tends to be a little longer drawn out. I thought it unwise to give examples, as the prosecution process is delicate. The issue is about reasonable grounds for believing that people are carrying goods that are liable to forfeiture.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I emphasise that I am not trying to catch the Paymaster General out at all, but new subsection (2) specifically refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>dutiable alcoholic liquor, or tobacco products.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know whether that means that the powers that we are discussing are not available to customs officials. Are those powers to be found in other legislation? I am not necessarily putting forward a party proposal, but there may be a case for giving customs officials the powers to tackle drug smugglers, given that the smuggling of narcotics is arguably more damaging than the smuggling of alcoholic liquor or tobacco products.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's question. The power is not a general stop and search power; it is specifically there to deal with the types of crime of which I gave examples. A search for drugs would not be done without an arrest, and there is another piece of legislation that backs that up. It is not a job for Customs and Excise, and the power is not an equivalent to the stop and search powers that the police would have. It is important, when considering appropriate powers, to ensure that they are limited and targeted to the specific requirements.
<P>
My officials have told me that there were 184 cases in 1997–98 of searches of people, but police have the primary powers to deal with drugs inland. Although customs would work with the police on intelligence and has the obligation to deal inland with excise, the police have the obligation to deal with drugs. To avoid the confusion of any encroachment on to police powers, drugs are deliberately excluded from the scope of the clause.
<P>
I hope that that covers the issue. Although the hon. Gentleman is right to feel that a search should be done as quickly and efficiently as possible, and that individuals should be detained for as short a period as possible, the imposition of a time limit in the legislation would undermine the effective operation of the powers. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment. However, such powers do need to be considered and scrutinised carefully as they are used, to ensure that they are used appropriately. It should go without saying that that is what the Government will do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for her remarks. Listening to the exchange between her and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), I got the sense that there was a grey, fuzzy area, which may repay further investigation by a Select Committee or something of that sort. She made a convincing case in her examples against the duty differential, which she otherwise defends. However, she also made a compelling case against the arbitrary time limit. I hope that she will see fit to institute some set of procedures that will guarantee that the wide power that she argues is required is never abused. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,

<H4><center>Security for customs and excise duties</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I tabled amendment No. 22 to express our anxieties about the clause and I hope that it has allowed the Paymaster General to consider the clause in detail. The explanatory notes claim that the clause is made unnecessary by the requirement to conform with EU legislation, in particular directive 92/12/EEC. Interestingly, they state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The measure will not have any input<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—I think that that should be ``impact''—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on current trade practices.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The explanatory notes invite the conclusion that the clause merely tidies up a legal difficulty vis a vis Community legislation, without having an effect on anybody. I wish to probe that, partly on the ground that one should always be suspicious of claims that Her Majesty's Government are going to the trouble of switching something around, when they themselves believe that doing so will have no practical effect.
<P>
Articles 12 and 13 seem to be the relevant part of directive 92/12/EEC—again, I am open to correction from the Paymaster General—particularly article 13. Article 13(a) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An authorized warehousekeeper<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—that is the kind of matter that the clause deals with—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall be required to<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) provide a guarantee, if necessary, to cover production, processing''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on. I take it that the difference between the law as it stood and the law as it will stand if the clause is accepted is the provision for kinds of security, including guarantees, that are not bonds. The Paymaster General may be able to give us a pellucid explanation of why bonding is not a sufficient implementation of article 13 of the directive or perhaps of why I have misunderstood the article. It seems odd that while article 13 substantively provides for the present situation, the clause seems—by the Government's admission—to add nothing to it. That needs explanation and I hope that the Paymaster General will, in a few brief, crisp words, explain why that oddity has come about. We shall then rest content.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall do my best to rise to the challenge that the hon. Member for West Dorset has set for me in explaining why the amendment is not necessary.
<P>
When the Government undertook their review of alcohol and tobacco fraud—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It may be only a small point—I hope that the Paymaster General will not think me pedantic—but we are debating not an amendment but the clause. The hon. Gentleman's amendment was not permissible because it proposed the deletion of the whole clause, which is against standing orders.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. You and I are at one on that matter of procedure. It was my error. Your ruling will also help me explain why the clause is necessary.
<P>
It came to light in our review that the United Kingdom had not fully implemented all aspects of European law on the completion of the single market on 1 January 1993. That was an oversight of the previous Government. We have always required the UK trade to provide guarantees that cover liabilities to other member states and we continue to do so. In 1993, that was not translated into necessary legislation. The clause is technical in the same way in which you rightly pointed out, Dr. Clark, that the hon. Member for West Dorset was speaking against the clause, not seeking to amend it.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The clause is necessary to remove any doubt that the Government are not complying with the legislation and to prevent any possible legal challenges and wrangles from arising in the future. We are regularising the Bill. No new procedures will be required; the clause simply puts into legislation what should have been made law on 1 January 1993. It confirms the way in which we have been operating since 1993.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Is the Paymaster General saying that, when we demanded bonds—which is what the legislation previously demanded—we might have been taken by a clever lawyer not to have been demanding guarantees?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, that is not what I am trying to say. The clause will resolve the absence of our commitment in legislation and make it clear that the procedures that we were pursuing were, in fact, in line with the requirements of EU legislation. It will not change our practice. That our legislation has so far missed out such a reference is a niggling problem. Since 1 January 1993, we have been operating within the requirements of EC law. I know that the hon. Member for West Dorset looks for plots and mysteries that are connected with the EU, but the previous Government made the mistake and it is better to tidy it up now. It does not change how the trade operates or the obligations that we have required of it since 1993.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall not go on at length about the clause, nor will I press it to a Division. I hope that the Paymaster General will go back and find out what she was meant to have said and what the clause is about. It inserts in previous legislation a measure that allows for bonds and the idea of guarantees. The only other change that it makes is that it allows the demand for such bonds to be made not merely on behalf of Her Majesty, but on behalf of other member states. I cannot understand from what the Minister says—I wonder whether she does—the nature of the change. There may be nothing amiss, dangerous or suspect about the clause, but I hope that she will take the opportunity to find out what is going on in the clause to reassure herself that it is a tidying-up provision rather than some subterranean covert action to introduce new measures. However, I shall not press the point beyond what it will bear.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 27 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>The Chairman:</B> As the Committee will be aware, clause 28 was dealt with earlier and we come now to clause 29.
<P>
Clause 29 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>CLIMATE CHANGE LEVY</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 133, line 11, after `supplies', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and shall be calculated by reference to the carbon content of the supply.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to one of the central parts of the Finance Bill. It is strange that clause 30 consisted of 7 lines, whereas schedule 6 is 82 and a bit pages long. That is something of an imbalance, which is no doubt one of the reasons why the schedule has generated so many amendments. The levy has had a long gestation period—there was a great deal of consultation before the Chancellor's first announcement, between his first and second announcements, and since the publication of the Bill. The proposals have been subject to many running repairs—renewables and, to some extent, combined heat and power were given exemptions, and the amounts recycled in terms of efficiency measures have been changed. Subsequent amendments indicate that the Government are continuing to install bits and pieces as they think the provision through. The content of the 82 and a bit pages is complex, and is becoming more so, not less.
<P>
In tabling amendments to schedule 6, Liberal Democrat Members aim to make sure that the Government meet their commitment—which is properly made on behalf of the United Kingdom—in relation to targets for greenhouse gas reduction. We also aim to make sure that wider environmental objectives are met, and that the provision operates positively for United Kingdom industry and employment, and does not become an albatross. As long as it is designed, initiated and monitored properly, it should provide opportunities for industrial growth, improved efficiency and competitiveness and improved exports. Some of the amendments that we have tabled—along with other amendments that we will support—are designed to do that. At the very least, we must make sure that the introduction of such a significant new measure is not to the detriment of UK industry, business, jobs and investment.
<P>
Amendment No. 78 would improve the Government's proposals, make them more effective and ensure that they are sustainable, not just environmentally but in terms of taxation. We do not want a tax that has to be tinkered with and messed about every year, as loopholes, gaps and inconsistencies appear. We also want a fairer tax. The amendment focuses on what the climate change levy should have been in the first place—a penalty for using fuels with a high carbon content. The taxation should be based on the amount of carbon in the fuel consumed. In short, the amendment substitutes a carbon tax for the levy as proposed in the 82 pages of the schedule.
<P>
The amendment is conceptually simpler and would produce less complex legislation. It would make it less difficult for energy users to understand what they must do to maximise their advantage and minimise their disadvantage, provide greater incentives to switch from carbon-based fuels to those that are renewable and cause less environmental damage, and provide a framework for the best and most efficient use of all their energy.
<P>
Incidentally, it will have far fewer tax points than the proposals in the schedule. I say ``incidentally'', but it is not as incidental as all that. On the basis of representations that I have received, it seems that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is ``giving serious thought''—such is the official phrase—to how best to deal with 10,000 or more applications to be registered in connection with the tax. Giving serious thought is ``civil service-ese'' for, ``It looks like a complete nightmare''.
<P>
One might have hoped that the Government would already have thought of a carbon tax. I should like to draw the Committee's attention to what the Minister said on Second Reading, when he referred to the social welfare issues as the ones that had steered the Government away from the idea of a carbon tax. His remarks were brief, but he conceded that operationally it would be far better, for the reasons that I have provided, but that he had to be aware of the social welfare issues. The carbon tax would, inevitably, be a tax on all energy users, including those in the domestic sector and those facing fuel poverty.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats do not seek to disguise the impact of the tax, but we do say that the problems should not be dealt with by 82 pages of complex and convoluted alternatives. Those in fuel poverty must receive state support not only to alleviate their poverty, but to avoid the wasteful consumption of fuel in the first place.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): Looking at the drafting of the amendment, I am unclear how it would remove the remainder of the 80-odd pages of legislation. Will the hon. Gentleman tell me more about the mechanics of the replacement scenario?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I would be the first to say that if the amendment were accepted, I would be delighted and only too ready to co-operate with the civil service and Ministers regarding consequential amendments. I do not propose to detain the Committee with a complete worked example of the operation of the carbon tax at this stage, but I would like to point out that the Marshall report, among others, argued that such a tax would be simpler, have fewer tax points, and be much more straightforward in concept and operation. There are some ``buts'', but I assure the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) that although some issues will need to be addressed, it would not require 82 pages.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats have made separate proposals for the alleviation of fuel poverty. We strongly believe that there are ways to tackle the problem. I moved some amendments to the Utilities Bill, which would have tackled it. I and some other members of the Committee are also members of an all-party group that has been drawing up proposals for submission to the Government about the alleviation of fuel poverty. Whether we have the climate change levy or the carbon tax, there will be a separate need to take account of the problems of fuel poverty, which will require legislative action to change the benefits system. We should not throw out the baby with the bathwater. We should not opt for the complexity of the climate change levy in its current form when there is the simpler alternative of the carbon tax.
<P>
The carbon tax is based simply on the amount of carbon that a unit of fuel contains. It has no substantial technical problems, either of definition or of implementation. The Marshall report conceded that it would be operationally easier, but steered away from that in accordance with its terms of reference provided by the Government. Most usefully, in terms not just of taxation, but of changing people's behaviour—and, in this context, changing the business community's investment behaviour—there is a much clearer connection between the cause of the problem that the levy is designed to alleviate, which is greenhouse gases, and the solution, which is to burn less greenhouse gas fuel. In contrast, despite the various concessions in relation to renewables and partially to combined heat and power, the climate change levy is still somewhat disjointed even in its own terms, never mind in its connection to the rest of the Government's policy.
<P>
I hope that I have set out the broad context of amendment No. 78. I should be interested to hear what the Government have to say about it. If we are to rely significantly on using the market, the price mechanism and taxation policy to achieve our Kyoto objectives, the carbon tax would be fiscally, financially and environmentally cleaner. It would drive forward more quickly the substitution of non-carbon-based fuels and the efficiency of investment.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): What effect would the hon. Gentleman's amendment have on the coal mining industry that remains in this country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> It would have an effect proportional to the carbon content. I remind the hon. Lady that the majority of coal burned in this country is imported. If the purpose of the climate change levy is to protect the coal industry, I hope that the Financial Secretary will be prepared to make that clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman's colleagues in South Yorkshire fully agree with the proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will find the opportunity to ask them in due course. It was getting a bit sleepy in here and it is all to the good if we have woken people up. The whole House must recognise that the country faces a difficult set of choices about meeting our greenhouse gas emission targets. I understand that Labour Members are committed to meeting them. I hope that they are; they seemed to support the Deputy Prime Minister during his negotiations. They must recognise that, to do so, we must burn less carbon-based fuel. If they do not accept that, they should not support schedule 6, as that is its inevitable consequence. It is designed to reduce the consumption of carbon-based fuel.
<P>
It may be best not to face up to that in Committee, but I want to make it clear to Labour Members that that is what they are voting for in schedule 6. I do not dispute it, and hope that they do not do so either. Amendment No. 78 is a better tax proposal than the Government's. It would be a long-term sustainable tax, which would not require the doctoring and twitching that we believe that the climate change levy will need. It would also be less onerous on industry, as it would recognise the reality that about a third of energy consumption in our country is in our domestic sector.
<P>
I hope to hear from the Government that, among all the revisions to the proposals that they originally drafted, they are now prepared to accept amendment No. 78.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's amendment. Although I do not think that it much improves the tax, it is nevertheless designed to tackle one of the paradoxes of the Bill, which is that although the purpose of the energy tax, or climate change levy, is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the tax will not be levied on carbon. The levy is designed to tax energy in a more general sense, which is not an especially good proxy for greenhouse gas emissions. The amendment is attractive in concept, but it does not measure up to the scale of the problem that confronts business and industry, on which the tax will be levied in less than a year's time.
<P>
The tax is a fantastically complicated way of achieving not much. It is designed to churn money around the business system, but it is completely unnecessary, because the required reductions in CO2 emissions can be much more easily achieved in other ways. Indeed, as the Government have ended the effective moratorium on gas-burning power stations, the required targets are likely to be already met. If we add an emissions trading system and voluntary agreements, to which many industries are perfectly willing to sign up, it is clear that there are plenty of alternatives to the tax.
<P>
The tax is also unfair, and I am afraid that the amendment does not deal with that. Many firms and industries will be precluded from negotiating energy reduction rebates, whereas other firms, arbitrarily, are in sectors that will be able to do so.
<P>
Perhaps the most obvious point is that the tax is almost comically complicated and is being added to almost daily. The schedule is already like a paperback book, but, as many outside organisations have already pointed out, it will be duplicated or triplicated when the secondary legislation is produced, which we have not even read yet. Much of the tax is still invisible and is referred to only in primary legislation.
<P>
We hear that a Committee headed by the Labour peer Lord Haskins is to investigate regulation, including over-regulation. It can only be a completely toothless and moribund body, because there is no sign that it has commented on, still less objected to, the regulatory content of the tax.
<P>
The amendment, which would turn the tax into a carbon tax, would not materially improve those deficiencies, as I shall illustrate with an example that has just come to my notice—the threat to the china clay industry in the west country. We referred earlier to the difficulties faced by Cornwall in particular, whose tin industry has closed and whose fishing industry has suffered badly as a result of the common fisheries policy. I come from near that part of the world, so I have some experience of the ravages of industrial decline in Cornwall and further up the west country peninsula.
<P>
The china clay industry is important and, as an extractive industry, uses considerable quantities of energy. The industry has calculated that, under the Bill as drafted, it will face an additional cost burden of £4 million a year. I shall be interested to hear whether the amendment would alter that. The industry already faces stiff competition from other producers, particularly in the Ukraine and Brazil. Of course, both those countries have no intention of introducing any form of energy tax. The effect is likely to be that our industry declines further and loses more employees and that supplies of china clay—or kaolin as it is actually called—will be sourced from those two other countries where environmental standards are lower.
<P>
As we are talking about a global atmosphere, the overall effect will be detrimental to the world environment. We have here a threat both to industry and to the environment. That is why the managing director of one of the firms is reported in the Cornish Guardian as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The sad fact is that refusing to make the levy more sensible will actually fail to reduce global warming.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If kaolin production in the UK is replaced with production in other less environmentally conscious countries with less stringent controls, total carbon emissions will be increased, whilst at the same time losing jobs in the South West.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The article reports him also saying that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Government lobbying had met with disinterest and intransigence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
showing that, worst of all, the Government are aware of the problems, which have been explained to them, but have ignored the industry's concerns. They are proceeding with a tax that is damaging and refuse to give to this extractive industry the opportunity to cut its costs by signing up to further energy efficiency measures.
<P>
So it is a serious situation. My reason for giving that example is to ask whether the amendment, by turning the levy into a carbon tax, would help. It would not, because the overall revenue would remain much the same. It is possible that the china clay industry would be able to source its power from Hinkley Point nuclear power station in the south-west. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) was strangely silent on the issue of nuclear power. The two main beneficiaries of a carbon tax would be renewable energy, which is largely produced without creating carbon dioxide emissions, and the nuclear industry. The Liberal Democrat party is traditionally extremely hostile to the nuclear industry, so I was a little surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not explain its conversion on that point.
<P>
I want to give the Committee the benefit of hearing what was said in a letter by Ian Fells, who is professor of energy conservation at the University of Newcastle. He wrote to the Times on 4 January 2000, drawing attention to the fact that Bradwell nuclear power station—which is also located in the west country—is to shut in two years' time. He points out that nuclear power produces its energy without greenhouse gas emissions. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Bradwell power station could have had a life extension of ten years but that would have required additional investment which, the company says, cannot be justified if the energy tax is going to be applied to nuclear electricity . . . By taxing nuclear electricity it may accelerate the closure of some of the older nuclear power stations and increase carbon emissions to the tune of four million tonnes a year by 2012 or earlier. This is just about the saving the Government expects to achieve by introducing the climate change levy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He ended his letter by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Perhaps the time has come to try to put together a coherent energy policy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with that.
<P>
The Government have not thought through the implications of their tax, nor had the hon. Member for Hazel Grove thought through the exempting of nuclear power from that tax when he tabled the amendment. It has been put to him that such a measure would extinguish the coal industry, but coal is taxed under the Bill. Labour Members may not fully understand that. The Government were in a more pro-coal mood when the Bill was drafted, and that may be why the tax was designed as it was. Nevertheless, they have changed their minds about the industry, as evidenced by the lifting of the gas moratorium.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am carefully listening to what the right hon. Gentleman is saying. Will he explain how the Conservatives think that the country should meet our Kyoto target commitments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We do not need any persuading of the seriousness of the threat of global warming and we believe that it is important to take sensible precautionary measures. Lady Thatcher was the first Prime Minister to take the issue seriously and her successor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), went to Brazil to sign the Rio convention, which we met in full. By contrast, the present Prime Minister has shown little interest in the issue of global warming, and is yet to make a speech on the subject of the environment.
<P>
We have a good record. Yes, we believe that it is important to meet in full the commitments that we entered into at Kyoto. They could be met by a combination of voluntary agreements with industry sectors, an emissions trading system of the sort that we may debate another time, and increased use of gas burn, particularly for electricity generation. A combination of those measures will meet our Kyoto targets without the need for an energy tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Clapham </B>(Barnsley, West and Penistone): The right hon. Gentleman did not mention clean coal technology yet, earlier in his remarks, he mentioned the old global system of pollution and the need to tackle pollution globally. One way would be to develop clean coal technology and export it to a country such as China, which uses 15 GW of conventional coal-fired capacity each year. If we could transfer the technology, we could tackle the global system more efficiently.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I say that I, too, recognise that the schedule is large. It comprises 82 pages, as has been said. In the debate so far we have gone a little wider than the scope of the amendment, which is understandable at the beginning of debate on a large schedule. However, my co-Chairman, Mr. Cook, and I may decide that we have covered the schedule at the end of the debates on the amendments, and that we do not need to discuss it separately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. I am rapidly drawing my remarks to a conclusion. I think that the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone made a good point. Environmental problems often have technical solutions. When I was a junior Minister responsible for coal in the Department of Energy, I was an enthusiast for technologies such as the gasification of coal. I was interested in finding other ways of producing electricity from coal than the traditional pulverisation and burning in power stations. Exporting that technology to a country such as China, which has an enormous and increasing coal burn, might be a way forward. It is a feature of the coal industry that, in essence, it is a process for taking carbon out of the ground—carbon that has built up over hundreds of millions of years—burning it and putting it quickly into the atmosphere. It is at risk from any attempt to reduce the threat of climate change.
<P>
Nevertheless, we must explore other technical options, which could be done without the need for the tax. I have looked for an adjective to describe it, but all I can say is that it is dim. It is a bad tax. It is damaging, unnecessary and anti-competitive and, worst of all, it is unenvironmental. The attempt of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove to improve the provision is interesting, but it does not begin to measure up to the scale of what is wrong with the tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I, too, was interested in the attempt to remove from the Bill about 82 pages of legislation. Given the complexity not so much of the energy elements of the proposal, but of its implementation side, any member of the Committee who cares to study the depths of the schedule will understand why my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) rightly told the Committee that the tax was badly drafted and very complex. It will be a lawyers' paradise. I should have liked the amendment to illustrate in more detail how the proposed alternative carbon tax would have worked. That would have given the hon. Member for Hazel Grove the chance to develop an alternative view. In so doing, he would have inevitably brought us into the discussion about the nuclear industry, which would have been the opposite argument and, in theory, completely outside the effects of a carbon tax, simply by definition of the process.
<P>
In my constituency of Fylde, we have the Fuels Division headquarters of British Nuclear Fuels. During my recent visits there, it became apparent that we face a major problem, which, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, is that the old Magnox power stations are gradually coming to the end of their life. What is not so well known is that the first closures are likely at Dungeness A of the advanced gas-cooled reactors. The process of removing carbon-dioxide-free generating capacity from our electricity supply industry is on an accelerating curve. The carbon tax proposal may well have addressed that situation; it would have placed strong emphasis on developing alternatives that were non-carbon based. Sadly, we shall not have the opportunity to hear more precisely about the Liberal Democrats' view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I wish to reassure the right hon. Gentleman that I have considered such matters and that were you, Dr. Clark, to say that it would be in order, I should be happy to deal with them later in our debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Perhaps we shall be treated to that. The carbon tax, as such, would have accelerated interest in nuclear power generation and in a policy that the Government do not have of a balanced energy portfolio. If they had such a policy, the nuclear industry could again play a significant part in the generation of electricity in this country. I certainly do not want to keep all my energy eggs in one basket. It is important to have a range of choices.
<P>
The carbon tax would have laid further emphasis on renewables. Later amendments will give us an opportunity to explore in more detail the implications of the ending of the gas moratorium. The emphasis that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove placed on renewables also gives me an opportunity to put before the Committee the thought of following the Government's proposals under the Department of Trade and Industry's new and renewable energy programme entitled ``Wood Fuel for Electricity and Heat''. If I did so, I could suggest to the Committee a proposal that would remove at a stroke the need for the climate change levy as drafted, and for the CO2 target. It would also give United Kingdom agriculture a massive shot in the arm and comply entirely with the thrust of the English rural development plan.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove played to the theme of the environmental benefits of his proposed carbon tax, and if the Government are interested in those, we could get to grips with my proposal on short rotational coppice. In a letter to me, the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the right hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Ms Quin) confirmed that planting 41,000 hectares with short rotational coppice would remove 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. We would require 108,000 hectares, which represents 0.58 per cent. of the United Kingdom's cultivable area. The carbon tax is relevant in that as long as one keeps replanting the short rotational coppice that is used by new coppice, one locks up any carbon and carbon dioxide in a permanent bank. That would achieve the objective of the climate change levy and provide a massive boost for UK agriculture. As long as one keeps planting 0.58 per cent. of land area, one enables the objective of the climate change levy to be reached.
<P>
If the Liberal Democrat proposal on the carbon tax were accepted, it would offer great encouragement to adopt my suggestion. It is disappointing that the Government have so far said nothing seriously innovative about tackling the proper question of carbon dioxide emissions without the tremendous complexity that the amendment seeks to address.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee will be aware that it has been decided on the Floor of the House that there shall be a tax. It is therefore not in order to discuss whether the tax will exist; it is in order to discuss only an amendment on the type of tax or, indeed, the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove to the effect that it should be a carbon tax, rather than an energy tax. We must not go back to debating whether the tax should exist, because that stage has passed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The spirit of my remarks dealt with the objective of the climate change levy to draw the Committee's attention to the issues that the amendment appeared to raise. It would substitute for the existing words the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>by reference to the carbon content of the supply.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My proposal is based on the result of adding those words to the schedule. The amendment would place particular emphasis on non-carbon power supplies, and the proposals on nuclear power and on short rotational coppice would, in my humble judgment, fulfil the required objective. However, I have made the point and I shall soon bring my remarks to a conclusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Is my right hon. Friend suggesting that because the coppice absorbs carbon in the atmosphere, the coppice rotation system would have a lower levy charge than other forms of energy production under the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I do not want to focus the debate solely on short rotational coppice. However, in simple terms, as I said earlier, we are talking about a permanent bank for carbon and carbon dioxide. In concept, that would be greatly encouraged as an alternative if the Committee agreed to the carbon tax proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. St. Aubyn. I am sure that you will speak to the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. I shall do my best to do so and I know that you will call me up short if I fail. However, I have to say that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells spoke movingly about the problems that the levy will impose on the china clay industry in Cornwall. I was an avid reader of the Cornish Guardian for 10 years when I lived just one valley away from the heart of that industry. If the levy means that production will transfer out of this country to other parts of the world where carbon emissions are much higher, that will have not only a negative environmental impact, but a devastating impact on that part of the country.
<P>
Some parts of the old china clay pits are being converted into the so-called Garden of Eden. There is certainly something nai¨ve and innocent about the Government's approach to this sector. We hope that tonight, they will accept some fruit from the tree of knowledge and become more realistic about the implementation of the tax.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I would like to speak about another business based in my constituency that will also be severely affected by the way in which the levy is imposed. I see a glimmer of hope in the idea proposed by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. If we agree the principle that carbon emissions be taken into account, it should lead to diversification of the levy's application.
<P>
I shall provide an example to demonstrate that the way in which the levy is applied at the moment is indiscriminate and that it hurts industries that are relatively pollution-free as much as, or even more than, industries with a high pollution level. I am particularly worried about the BOC group, whose European headquarters is in my Guildford constituency. It had planned to make its worldwide headquarters there before the recent merger plans were announced. I am told by BOC that the impact of the climate change levy will be £8.4 million in the first year. Its national insurance contributions will be mitigated by only £0.4 million—a net cost to BOC of £8 million a year.
<P>
BOC is in the business of air separation, which is a clean and environmentally friendly process. There is no logic to imposing this type of levy on a clean business, yet that is precisely what the Government are proposing. BOC operates seven large air separation plants across the United Kingdom and uses about 2,000 million kW of electricity to drive the process every year. It has major customers, such as Esso, ICI and car manufacturers, which play key roles in the UK economy. Over the past five years, it has significantly improved the efficiency of its plant. Indeed, its new plants are twice as efficient as the old ones. Scientific opinion takes the view that the new plants are close to the thermodynamic limit of what can be achieved in terms of energy efficiency.
<P>
As I said, it makes no sense to impose this sort of levy on businesses such as BOC and its air separation plants. BOC has met the requirements. It has made itself as clean and efficient as possible. It can do no more. If the levy's objective is to improve the environmental performance—its conscience, if one likes—of British industry, BOC has already reached that point. If the burden of £8 million a year continues to be imposed on BOC, it will show that the levy is not about environmental improvement, but simply another Labour tax on business.
<P>
The amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, in seeking to introduce a tangible, measurable effect and to achieve a switch from carbon-generating to non-carbon-generating sources of energy, would test the good intentions of the Government and ascertain whether the levy is about the environment or just a crude and cumbersome way of raising additional revenue.
<P>
It gets worse than the fact that BOC will be charged an extra £8 million a year; under the terms of its contracts it must pass that financial burden on to its customers. Its customers' competitiveness will undoubtedly suffer, as will that of the UK. A comparison must be made with users in Germany and the Netherlands, who are already effectively exempt from similar forms of levy. It makes no sense to impose the tax on users such as BOC. If BOC's use of non-carbon sources of energy were to be recognised in the imposition of the levy, it, and other affected users, would not experience the problems that are caused by the crude way in which the Government are making their proposals.
<P>
When the Ministers consider the amendment I should like them to explain the interaction between the energy supply used by business and the energy efficiency agreements into which the Secretary of State is expected to enter. Is the purpose and thinking behind the amendment wrapped up with the way in which the Secretary of State strikes individual deals with major energy users? In other words, will a business such as BOC be able to argue that because it is so energy efficient and because its sources of energy supply are the most environmentally friendly that it can find, it should be subject to a much lighter regime than the Bill threatens? Can those agreements mitigate that £8 million a year cost to BOC?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have had an interesting and wide-ranging discussion on the amendment. The right hon. Member for Wells has shown us how the Conservative party is setting its face against the steps needed to address the problems of climate change. As far as I know, only the Conservative party maintains that there is a painless route to tackling this problem. A couple of Opposition Members gave the impression that there is an easy solution and a painless way of meeting our Kyoto objectives—and, presumably, of going beyond them in due course.
<P>
That was not the Conservative party's view in the past. It is still not the view of the Secretary of State for the Environment in the previous Government who said in February last year:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Ozone depletion and climate change are not concerns that can be met in the short term. They demand alterations in our lifestyle that are neither easy nor quick.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Opposition Members would do well to ponder his words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Is ozone the subject of the climate change levy too?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The words that I quoted referred to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ozone depletion and climate change.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A couple of speeches from Conservative Members gave the clear impression that they thought that there was a quick, easy fix to which the matter. That is not the view of the former Secretary of State for the Environment, and neither is it the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No one on the Opposition Benches has suggested that the solution is quick or easy. We argue that the tax favoured by the Government is the most damaging and environmentally unfriendly way of tackling a serious problem. That is our objection; we are not saying that the problem does not exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Perhaps we are making a little headway. There was certainly a reference to a couple of simple things that might be done, and a couple of odd measures here or there. The right hon. Member for Fylde thought that it was a question of planting willow trees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I did not mention willow, nor did I say that it was simple and easy. I did quote the Minister of State, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as the source of my information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The trees that would be coppiced are willow trees. I think that I have the edge on the right hon. Gentleman, as I visited the power station being constructed in Selby, which will generate power by the method that he advocates. I am glad that he has drawn the matter to the attention of the Committee. I agree that short rotation coppicing is an environmentally friendly method of generating power. However, it is wrong to suggest, as he did, that we can solve our carbon dioxide emissions problems through that device alone. A range of measures will be necessary the climate change levy especially to address the problem.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence </B>(Preseli Pembrokeshire): In all the examples that I have seen of short rotation coppicing, the environmental and financial cost of transport is not included. Will my hon. Friend confirm that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know how courteous the Financial Secretary is, and that he feels obliged to respond to questions, even if they are out of order—I do not refer to the hon. Lady but to earlier debate. I am sure that the Financial Secretary would like to answer those questions that are out of order as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Thank you for that guidance, Dr. Clark.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend, as a number of significant costs are attached to short rotation coppicing. Its overall costs—including transport costs—are among its fundamental difficulties. It has a role to play, however, and, as one of range of measures, there is lot to be said for it.
<P>
I have heeded your advice, Dr. Clark. The Government published projections for global temperatures in this year's Red Book, and the scale of the problem is clearly substantial. We are committed to achieving the Kyoto objective of a 12.5 per cent. reduction in UK greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. Indeed, we made a further commitment to a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2012. The Red Book shows that, in particular, transport emissions continue to rise. Therefore, while we are on track to achieve the Kyoto objective by 2010, there will, on the basis of current measures, be a rising trend.
<P>
It is important to emphasise that Kyoto is not the end of the story—there will be further international agreements that go beyond Kyoto. In the past week, a number of respected authorities have called for deeper cuts. Simply scraping past the Kyoto objective in 2010 is not by any means sufficient—a range of additional measures will be needed. The climate change levy is an absolutely vital contribution to our strategy.
<P>
I have more sympathy with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. He was right to say that the climate change levy has had a long gestation period. Lord Marshall—who was president of the Confederation of British Industry at the time—was asked in March 1998 to carry out his study. He had wide-ranging discussions, and an announcement was made in the Budget of March 1999. Following announcements and consultation since then, the levy will only take effect in April. The gestation period has been long, as the hon. Gentleman said. He was also right to say that there has been a great deal of consultation, discussion and listening.
<P>
I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's use of the term ``running repairs'' for what has emerged from that consultation. I prefer the view of the Round Table on Sustainable Development, which comprises several eminent individuals. Last month, it published its report on economic instruments to promote sustainable development, which stated that the climate change levy was a ``success story''. That is right. The report describes the long and careful gestation period and the responses that the Government made to the consultation. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the opportunities for improved competitiveness in United Kingdom firms and new export opportunities for UK manufacturers as well.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would require the rate of the levy to be calculated by reference to the carbon content of the supply. I note that the hon. Gentleman has not proposed the rates of levy that he would advocate. They might have caused difficulties among his party members in South Yorkshire and other places as well, so I do not blame him for ducking that challenge, although it might have been more helpful to the Committee if he had done the calculation.
<P>
We choose to calculate the rate of levy by reference to the energy content of the supply. There is one especially compelling reason for that, to which the hon. Gentleman alluded. We have always made it clear that we are determined not to impose new taxes on domestic fuel consumption and so add to the significant level of fuel poverty that affects nearly 5 million households around the UK. As suppliers can distinguish between domestic and business consumers only at the point of consumption, that is where we will charge the climate change levy.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that his proposal would make the levy more attractive to business, because a large chunk of it would be applied to domestic consumers. Presumably he envisages a substantial addition to the fuel bills of such consumers. We have made it absolutely clear that we think that it would be wrong to add to their fuel bills in that way, especially given the high level of fuel poverty.
<P>
We have made the key decision to have a ``downstream'' tax. The hon. Gentleman referred to the views of Lord Marshall, who stated in his report that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the leading option for a tax would, in my view, appear to be a ``downstream'' tax on the final use of energy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We made that decision for the reasons that I have explained. Under the current electricity pool arrangements, we could determine the carbon content of electricity as only a broad average. We cannot tell what the carbon content of electricity coming out of a socket in the wall is, because nuclear power stations, hydro-electricity, coal-fired power stations and a variety of other methods could have generated it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Will the Financial Secretary concede that a consequence of that will be that the china clay industry, for instance, will not be able to choose to use electricity from renewable sources or nuclear sources and thereby avoid the levy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, that certainly is not a consequence. Any business consumer could opt for renewable energy supplies, which will, as we shall hear in our debates, be exempted from the levy. The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong.
<P>
We will keep the basis for setting climate change levy rates under review in the light of developments in electricity trading arrangements. Because of the current changes in arrangements, we expect significant reductions in the cost of electricity. Figures quoted by Opposition Members took no account of those. Although I sympathise with the thrust of the amendment and acknowledge the case that it makes, it would be wrong and premature to accept it at this stage, particularly in the light of the damaging consequences for domestic customers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I was reminded during the debate, Dr. Clark, that you are something of an expert on the topic. Perhaps you will be able to help us all.
<P>
I have been encouraged by some of the contributions and thank the right hon. Member for Wells for saying that the amendment was attractive in principle. He went on to say—I hope that he does not mind my paraphrasing his point—that it does not take out enough of the rubbish to meet all the requirements that he believes appropriate. I draw his attention to the other amendments that my hon. Friends and I have tabled, which he might accept would, taken as a whole, achieve some of the objectives for which he made an eloquent case.
<P>
The china clay industry has been discussed in some detail. The right hon. Gentleman asked whether the amendment would address the problems faced by the industry. That clearly depends on the rate at which any tax is applied to those who use energy and on whether they can avoid the tax by changing their source of energy without unreasonably increasing their prices. Amendment No. 72 may give us an opportunity to debate that. One of the fundamental problems experienced by the china clay industry is the rate not just at which it must pay for energy, now or in the future, but at which it must conduct its international trade because of the value of the pound to other currencies. The Financial Secretary might wish to give a view on that.
<P>
Several hon. Members, including the right hon. Members for Fylde and for Wells, raised the issues of nuclear power and renewables. They seem to be under the impression that I have deliberately avoided talking about them. I am more than happy to do so and to reveal, if that is the word, that last autumn I published a book on the UK's future energy policy, although I suspect that you would not allow me to read it into the record, Dr. Clark. You are indicating that that is the case. The carbon tax would make existing nuclear installations economically viable for longer. The issue of what they are replaced with when they are no longer safe—they are subject to annual MOT tests, as it were—is an entirely different one. It would also bring on stream renewables to a much greater extent because there would be a clear preferential option.
<P>
The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone referred to clean coal technology. I am happy to join him in supporting the UK becoming a centre of excellence for clean coal technology. The introduction of a carbon tax is entirely neutral in terms of the achievement of that objective, which would need a decision of principle by the Government and those in the coal industry that they are determined to go ahead with it. I fully support that objective.
<P>
Various arguments have been made about alternative fixes. The right hon. Member for Fylde raised the issue, in Committee and on the Floor of the House, of the short coppice rotation system. I visited a number of the pilot projects that are under way, including one in Cornwall—to make a geographical connection. They do not at present provide an economic solution, any more than the second generation of nuclear power. We must take account of the fact—we hope that the amendment does so—that we are in a free market economy and must consider the price structure that we create and the marketing situation that develops, as well as the taxation regime that we impose. In a different forum, I suspect that the right hon. Member for Fylde would oppose raising electricity production costs to the level that short coppice unfortunately requires. Some of the later amendments relating to horticulture will cover the issue that he raised about carbon sinks.
<P>
Amendment No. 78 would lead to more rapid diversification of energy use away from carbon sources. That is the Government's overriding objective. The Financial Secretary took pains to deal with some of the other speakers' arguments in his response, but somewhat overlooked any rebuttal of the carbon tax. That tax would solve the Government's social exclusion and poverty problem, which is why the Financial Secretary initially said that the Government wanted a downstream tax. The climate change levy will not solve that problem. It will remain necessary for the Government to devise mechanisms for investing money, to ensure that the poorest households have the means to run energy-efficient homes and reduce their expenditure.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) introduced a Bill on a related matter, and other hon. Members have supported similar Bills to tackle the issue of cold homes vigorously. I know that the Financial Secretary, in a previous existence, strongly shared that objective—I am sure that he still does—and fully recognised that it needed discrete and definite Government action. The Government may refuse a carbon tax because it would make the situation worse, but that does not change the fundamental fact that they must act to improve the situation. To fall into the trap of the social welfare issue is sad and wrong, I am afraid.
<P>
We feel strongly about the matter, and we will divide the Committee if the Government do not accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I would be grateful if the Financial Secretary clarified my last point. Perhaps the Government plan to answer the points raised by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove to some extent by referring to the negotiated agreements system. Will that system take proper cognisance of what industries have done to minimise the amount of energy that they need and restrict the types of energy that they use to power their businesses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman's question had nothing to do with the amendment. The negotiated agreements and the objectives in those agreements certainly take account of progress made towards achieving energy efficiency in each sector. I imagine that we will discuss that further in debates on other amendments to the schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 133, line 13, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) The levy shall only be charged if—
<P>
(i) the amount of electricity generated by natural gas in December 2005 is not at least 14 per cent. higher than the amount so generated in May 2000; and
<P>
(ii) the amount of electricity generated by coal in December 2005 is not at least 13 per cent. lower than the amount so generated in May 2000.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment was to recognise the changed circumstances now available in the United Kingdom for the generation of electricity following the lifting of the gas moratorium. As I shall illustrate, the objectives of the climate change levy could be met if the gas moratorium has had the anticipated effect—that more electricity will be generated by using that power source.
<P>
The aim of the amendment is to defer the introduction of the climate change levy until December 2005 to give an opportunity for those gas-fired power stations to come on stream that are now able to do so by virtue of the lifting of the moratorium, to see whether, in effect, they would do the same job as the climate change levy. That would give the Government the opportunity to reconsider if their existing proposals require amendment in the light of the changed circumstances.
<P>
The Financial Secretary made an interesting point in our earlier debate when he said that there may well be further international CO2-saving targets in the future. I recognise that a Government in pursuit of their international targets—just as the previous Conservative Government were—might wish to have a range of options to achieve their objectives. Therefore the amendment does not simply seek to strike out the mechanism of the climate change levy although, for the reasons stated in the previous debate, I have reservations as to the way in which that has been framed.
<P>
The proposal came about as the result of a series of parliamentary questions to the Department of Trade and Industry in an attempt to find out whether the gas-fired power stations affected by the moratorium had the capacity to meet the requirement in CO2 savings of the climate change levy. In an answer sent to me on 14 February, the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe pointed out that 15 proposals amounting to 6 GW of new gas-fired capacity had been refused under the moratorium. That translates into 42,000 million kWh of electricity.
<P>
When I looked, again by means of parliamentary questions, to the same Department to find out what transfer of electricity power generation to gas would have to take place to meet the requirements of the climate change levy, I discovered that, in effect, if half the moratorium gas-fired power stations were to come into operation, the consequent CO2 savings would meet the requirements of the target in February this year of the climate change levy. Therefore my amendment, which would give five years to allow just half of the gas-fired power stations to come into operation. That seems a realistic period within which those plans could be re-activated and the power stations could come into operation.
<P>
What would the amendment mean overall in terms of existing energy sources? I recognise that the Government, by allowing the moratorium to be lifted, are bound to allow many more gas-fired power stations into the system than are required to meet the climate change levy. Consequently, there will be an impact on the sources of fuel to generate our electricity.
<P>
The other part of the amendment would specifically require two percentage changes to occur. The levy would be charged only if the amount of electricity generated by gas were not at least 14 per cent. higher than the amount generated in May this year and electricity generated by coal was not at least 13 per cent. lower. Our figures have been confirmed by parliamentary answer and translated into those percentages with the Library's help. Put into context, that represents the equivalent of a 25 per cent. reduction in the electricity output of a power station such as Drax. The Government's moratorium would be more damaging in terms of the potential for coal generation of electricity, whereas my proposal would be less damaging.
<P>
The Financial Secretary may have said that there were no easy, cheap, uncomplicated or painless ways of dealing with the climate change levy. However, the reason for this proposal is to point out that, as a consequence of a change in Government policy, the targets on carbon dioxide set by the climate change levy will be met—almost on auto pilot—if just half the proposals affected by the moratorium on gas-fired power generation come into existence.
<P>
I am worried that we may get into a situation of almost double counting. If we save the 2 million tonnes of CO2—that is what the climate change levy seeks to achieve—the Government will by the levy itself make a free gain by virtue of the gas-fired power stations. They must come clean and tell us whether they are increasing the target to 4 million tonnes or what exactly the plan is. My proposal has the merit of giving a breathing space, removing a vast amount of complexity and simply following what is now Government policy to lift the moratorium on gas-fired power stations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I support my right hon. Friend's amendments. I cannot be the only member of the Committee to have been involved in a number of cases involving the gas moratorium and to have seen the damage that it was causing.
<P>
In my case, a zinc smelter—which incidentally is foreign-owned—in a neighbouring constituency applied to fit a gas-fired electricity-generating plant and was turned down. That not only kept its costs higher than those of its sister plants in Germany, but created bemusement, because the smelter was effectively prevented from cutting its CO2 emissions. The plant that the people at the smelter wanted to install would have used gas, which of course produces less C02 per unit of electricity generated. They were baffled by the Government's energy policy and were therefore pleased when the Government recently executed a U-turn by announcing the lifting of the moratorium, which they and many others perceive as one small step towards a more environmentally benign energy policy that will help competitiveness, too.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Like the right hon. Gentleman, I welcome an environmentally friendly policy that I understand will result in a long-term reduction in the use of unnecessary resources. The amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Fylde makes it a condition for the levy that more resources be used. Does he believe that there is an infinite supply of natural gas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> There is certainly a huge amount of natural gas in the world. Without going back to my failed career, when I was at the Department of Energy and tried to ascertain the quantity of gas in the North sea, I rapidly concluded that those in possession of the gas and wanting to sell it had every interest in persistently underestimating the reserves. Indeed, every year the reserves seem to increase.
<P>
I am told by people who know much more about the matter than me that, globally, although there is obviously not literally an inexhaustible supply, titanic quantities of gas have been discovered but have not yet been exploited. The end of wasteful gas flaring will enable more energy to be retained for use. If ways can be found to liquefy gas and transport it more cheaply and efficiently through pipelines, the world will have a supply of energy that will certainly last until the end of the century, at which time other technologies may have become more appropriate. I continue to believe that one day nuclear power will return. If global warming is genuinely a threat and the climate changes, mankind will have to turn to nuclear fission, and possibly nuclear fusion, to supply its energy needs. However, that is a long-term necessity that will arise only if the darker predictions turn out to be true.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will supply accurate figures on what proportion of the block schemes now being implemented might present an alternative to the energy tax. My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde asked whether half those schemes would be sufficient to reduce CO2 emissions by an equivalent amount. If that is not accurate, perhaps the Financial Secretary will supply his figure.
<P>
I was interested to hear the Financial Secretary's reply to our earlier debate, in which he hinted that the Kyoto commitment would be met anyway, and that he now intended to justify the tax on the grounds that it might be required after 2010. A tax will therefore be introduced next year not for present requirements but to fulfil a commitment, which has not been negotiated, in 10 years' time. Even if he cannot produce them immediately, I hope that he will give us some accurate and comprehensive figures on the trend in CO2 emissions and reductions and tell us how and whether the same reductions could be achieved by the means suggested by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde, who has done so much work on the matter.
