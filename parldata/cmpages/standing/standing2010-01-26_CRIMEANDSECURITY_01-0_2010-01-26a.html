Chairman:</b> I welcome hon. Members to the first sitting of
this Public Bill Committee, which I am sure, will be conducted in an
orderly and good-humoured manner.</div>
<a name="10012658000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we
begin, I have some domestic announcements. Ever conscious of
Members&#146; comfort, I am happy for them to remove their jackets,
should they wish to do so. Please ensure that mobile phones, pagers and
other electronic gadgets are turned off or switched to silent mode
during Committee
meetings.</div><a name="10012658000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
are reminded that there is a money resolution in connection with the
Bill, copies of which are available in the room, on the table to my
left. I also remind Members that adequate notice of amendments should
be given. To be eligible for selection at a Tuesday sitting, Amendments
must be tabled by rise of the House on the previous Thursday. For a
Thursday sitting, amendments must be tabled by the preceding Monday. As
a general rule, my co-chairman, Mr. Cook, and I will not
call starred
amendments.</div><a name="10012658000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
everyone is familiar with the procedures for taking oral evidence in
Public Bill Committees, so it might be helpful if I explain briefly how
we will proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the
programme motion on the amendment paper. That debate is limited to half
an hour. We will proceed to a motion to report written evidence and a
motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of
the oral evidence, which I hope we can take formally. Assuming that the
second motion is agreed, the Committee will sit in private for a short
time, after which witnesses and members of the public will be invited
back into the room and we will start to take evidence.</div>
<a name="10012658000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Committee agrees to the programme motion, we will hear oral evidence in
this week&#146;s sittings, which I shall chair, and revert to the
more familiar clause-by-clause, line-by-line scrutiny next week, when
Mr. Cook will join
us.</div><a name="10012658000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

11</b><b class="B">Mr. Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North

barrister, practising in the criminal courts.</div>
<a name="10012658000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">My questions
are for either of our two witnesses and are about clause 1 and
searches. I had the advantage, many, many years ago, of being a special
constable, so  I have carried out searches&#151;not very
competently, but I have done so.</div>
<a name="10012658000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
Bill deletes the obligation to obtain the name and address of the
person questioned. That rather surprises me. I should have thought that
you needed their name and address. Secondly, the ethnicity of person to
be searched is to be recorded as they themselves describe it. I would
have thought that that gives rise to the possibility of some rather
offensive questioning. Might it not be better if Bill provided for
ethnicity as perceived by the constable? That would avoid the necessity
for questions on the point. May I have your comments on both those
matters?</div><a name="10012658000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> We in the police service have wrestled with
that conundrum for some time, ever since the inquiry into the death of
Stephen Lawrence, when stop-and-search was looked at rigorously. Yes,
we think there is a real conundrum there. Somebody stopped could
describe themselves as being of one type of ethnicity, when clearly, to
the person who is speaking to them, they are not. We recognise that
problem. How you get around it has never been resolved to my
satisfaction, but we have to trust that common sense will
prevail.</div><a name="10012658000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also important to recognise that you are dealing with human beings.
It is not just about filling the form out; it is the human interaction
you have with the individual you stop that is most important. That is
something that we often forget when we talk about stop-and-search. We
are so focused on the process that we forget that it is the interaction
that we are having that is the most important. If that interaction goes
well, there will not be a problem in terms of person a describing their
ethnicity.</div>

Hogg:</b> Is that true of Jan Berry as
well?</div><a name="10012658000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I think so. A lot of front-line police
officers in meetings that I have held with them over the last couple of
years have identified the confrontational nature of asking the
question, &#147;How do you describe your ethnicity?&#148; It can
pose a
problem.</div><a name="10012658000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000392"></a>Mr.

far.</div><a name="10012658000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I think it depends on the circumstances. I do
not think you need to record that for every single search. It is a
question of proportionality. I agree with Paul&#146;s observation
about a lot of focus being on paperwork and process as opposed to the
interaction that might go on. We also confuse intelligence gathering
with a stop-and-search form. If you are intelligence gathering, clearly
you would need to be able to identify the individual you are speaking
to.</div><a name="10012658000039"></a>

McKeever:</b></i> It is certainly not a huge problem to us.
It makes sound common sense. However, there are occasions, as Jan says,
where it is not absolutely necessary. As a good young constable
patrolling on the other side of the river over in Lambeth, I knew
pretty much who the villains I was dealing with were and I did not have
to ask them for their name and address. That is how it should be. There
are occasions when you already know who you are dealing with. Could it
cause problems? Of course it could,

Bill?</div><a name="10012658000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> Yes, we think that there is some good
common sense in the Bill in relation to stop-and-search and other
aspects. There are no major new pieces of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>business in the Bill as we see it, but there is a lot of tidying up and
addressing of tangential problems that we in the police service deal
with. We are happy with it; there is nothing that we are directly or
absolutely opposed to, and we are quite open to the changes that are
being suggested. Perhaps some minor adjustments could be made here or
there, but generally we are fine with
it.</div><a name="10012658000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000396"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I hope that, during this morning&#146;s
questioning, the areas that you are a little concerned about will
reveal themselves. Jan Berry, would you like to make an opening
statement?</div><a name="10012658000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> My viewpoint centres on the bureaucratic
burden that the Bill might impose on front-line officers. Obviously,
the stop-and-search provisions aim to reduce the bureaucratic burden,
which has to be welcomed, with the proviso that I would still expect
police officers to be collecting and collating intelligence. I would
not want them to see the lack of requirement to record details as a
reason not to collect intelligence. That could relate to about 880,000
stops, so there is potential for a great reduction in bureaucratic
burden.</div><a name="10012658000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the remainder of the Bill, it seems to me that some bureaucratic burden
could be added. I am not sure how the Bill will actually assist in some
of the areas such as gang violence and domestic violence beyond what
the police service can already
do.</div><a name="10012658000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><a name="10012658000397"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I have a rather
simple question on the back of Paul&#146;s comments. How do you deal
with young people who stand in front of a police officer and say,
&#147;I&#146;m white Irish,&#148; when they are clearly
not&#151;they might be black Caribbean or something else? You can
just imagine young people sending messages to one other on Twitter
saying, &#147;This has been introduced; tell the police you&#146;re
something you&#146;re not, just for the hell of it.&#148; What does
a police officer put in that
column?</div><a name="10012658000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I think you answer the question with your
question. What do we do? It is not answered and it is a problem for us.
Clearly, that message will get around and it could cause us some
problems in interactions with young people on the street. Let us be
absolutely clear: most young people are great. We do not have a problem
with most young people and I think that over the past few years there
has been a bit of a demonisation of young people. We do not talk about
middle-aged or old people in the same way as we tend to talk about
young people. Most young people I came across were good, decent folk.
It is only a small minority that we are going to have problems with, so
we need to put that in context from the word
go.</div><a name="10012658000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I think there is a provision such that, where
it is quite clear that there is a total difference between the
ethnicity you are being told and what you can see, you have the
opportunity to have a discussion about it, depending on the
circumstances; or there are provisions where police officers can give
their own view of what the ethnicity is. However, as Paul rightly says,
it does cause some
confusion.</div><a name="10012658000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000398"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> But if this is being recorded via electronic
means, which tend to be logical and require you to say certain things
in certain spaces, that does not give an officer flexibility.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="10012658000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> You are absolutely correct. On the 16
different classes of ethnicity, you would not have the opportunity to
put another
class.</div><a name="10012658000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><a name="10012658000399"></a><b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): I do not want to
labour the ethnicity point, but what advice do officers currently get
on establishing people&#146;s ethnicity, if they are doing a
stop-and-search and filling in the form
themselves?</div><a name="10012658000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> It comes down to common sense, I think. You
have to look at who you are dealing with in that social interaction. I
do not think that there is any dedicated instruction given to officers
on that. It is left to their own observations and common
sense.</div>
<a name="10012658000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000400"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> One point that I wanted to follow up in what
Mr. Hogg said is the matter of name and address not being
required. Jan Berry, you said that you would, in any case, expect
officers to collect additional information. What is your expectation?
Would you assume that, perhaps in the majority of cases, officers would
collect names and addresses, even if stop-and-search was changed so
that was not required?</div>
<a name="10012658000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I think it is about the term a
&#147;requirement&#148; to collect a name and address. If you need
to record who you stopped and why you stopped them, because of what was
going on in the area, which may be a particular hot spot, or there is
intelligence about other matters or for a specific purpose, then that
is why you need to record the names and addresses. However, I am not
sure that there is a requirement for the name and address for every
search.</div>
<a name="10012658000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000401"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Can I pursue that line? We know that the number of
stops and searches that do not lead to an arrest is, I believe, 90 per
cent. Do you feel that the percentage of stops and searches that do not
lead to further action is a problem? To cut that percentage, can more
work be done on the training provided to officers on what constitutes
reasonable suspicion?</div>
<a name="10012658000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> That is a fair suggestion. We all know that
some officers are very good at targeting under stop-and-search, so
perhaps their intuitive ability could be inculcated into the rest of
the police service. Having been on the streets for many years, I know
that it is very difficult to say what will cause you to stop a
particular individual or what nuances you are picking up from them. It
is a difficult thing to pass on to other officers. We are very good at
instructing officers on the law and on process, but not so good at
passing on the street skills and human skills of picking up those
signals and signs. There is some merit in what you say about trying to
pass understanding of those signs and signals on to officers from those
who do it very well. Some officers are excellent.</div>
<a name="10012658000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> To add to that point, Paul made the point
earlier about the interaction. There is no doubt that there has been
some really good experience in the Metropolitan police force area and
other areas, where particular crime hot spots have been used, better
training is given to officers and experience is shared between them.
That has demonstrated a better quality stop-and-search in the first
place and better outcomes. There is an argument that if you improve the
training for officers, give them the opportunity to practice that skill
and have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>far better intelligence about crime hot spots and where stop-and-search
can be used effectively, it provides a better quality of search and
better outcomes.</div>
<a name="10012658000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">To go back to
your earlier point about how you train people to identify ethnicities.
There is a code for ethnicities. There are 16 different ethnic origins
that police officers have to choose
from.</div>
<a name="10012658000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000402"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I call Andrew Rosindell, who is the shadow
spokesman.</div>
<a name="10012658000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><a name="10012658000403"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Rosindell</b> (Romford) (Con): All of us want less bureaucracy
and to see the police able to do their job more effectively without
being bound up in paperwork and red tape, and having to record
information that is of no use. Perhaps Mr. McKeever could
answer first. Do you believe that the Bill goes far enough to reduce
the burdens on the police? Is it necessary for the police to record so
much information? Is it better to let them decide what is relevant and
what may be useful for intelligence, rather than have such a prescribed
way of doing things?</div>
<a name="10012658000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> There is definitely merit in the last part
of your question&#151;in allowing us more discretion in what we do
and do not record. In terms of whether the Bill goes far enough, I
think it is a step in the right direction. It is showing the right way
forward in trying to reduce the bureaucratic burden. A lot of
bureaucracy, as Jan will be able to tell you better than me, is
generated within forces anyway. Although we are very good at following
the quantitative, measuring approaches, what matters to the public is
not the quantity of what we do, but the quality. It is no accident that
we have inspectors and superintendents in the police service. They
actually used to inspect and superintend what those under their control
did. We have lost that to some degree. The quality of what officers are
doing seems to be less important to those in command than the quantity,
and we have to get away from that. When I ask the question, officers
never say that they have had letters of thanks about the way they have
collated the statistics on something they have dealt with. However,
they have had plenty of letters of thanks about the way they have dealt
with individuals and the social interaction they have undertaken,
whether reporting a crime, or perhaps even dealing with something on
the streets.</div>
<a name="10012658000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000404"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> So putting more trust in the police constable
dealing with an incident and letting him or her decide what is relevant
in the information they record would be a much simpler, less
bureaucratic way of dealing with
things?</div><a name="10012658000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> It is&#151;it is a balance, though. I am
very strongly in favour of allowing officers to use their discretion,
but you have to have some regulation or rules to make sure that they do
not step outside what is acceptable. There has to be something, but it
has to be fairly loose to allow discretion, because every stop and
every interaction will be different. We cannot prescribe what they must
do in each of those stops. So, yes, I think there is great merit in
what you say.</div>
<a name="10012658000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> To add a little to that, the point that Paul
makes with regard to accountability is absolutely right. It is about
proportionate accountability. Left to everybody&#146;s discretion,
you have to have a framework within which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>officers work. About a year ago, the rules changed for stop-and-account,
with a considerable reduction in the amount of detail needing to be
taken for a stop-and-account, as opposed to stop-and-search. Of the 44
forces where that is available&#151;I think one of them is the
British transport police&#151;only 13 forces are actually doing what
was intended to reduce the bureaucracy. Fifteen are using a reduced
form and 15 are still doing exactly the same as they were before. Even
with a change in direction for stop-and-account, some of the benefits
that could have accrued are not yet being accrued. Some of the reasons
are around technology. Some of the reasons are around chief
officers&#146; decisions on what they want their officers to
record.</div>
<a name="10012658000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><a name="10012658000405"></a><b class="B">Jim
Dobbin</b> (Heywood and Middleton) (Lab/Co-op): To follow
Mr. Rosindell&#146;s line of questioning, we all agree,
even from the statements that have been made, that one of the aims of
the Bill is to help reduce bureaucracy and allow the police more time
to do other things. Have you any hard and fast statistics, so that you
can calculate just how much extra time your officers will have?
Subsequently, what cultural changes will be required in the force to
apply that
thinking?</div><a name="10012658000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I think the cultural changes are the most
important. You can chop away at different forms and different pieces of
paperwork, but you need to change the ethos and culture in the police
service. Over the years, in recent times especially, we have grown the
bureaucracy unnecessarily. We have to stop that and get back to what we
should be doing: dealing with individuals out on the
street&#151;victims of crime&#151;in a proper way and giving them
the time they deserve, rather than focusing on the quantitative
approach as we have in the past. It goes right across the police
service from how we reward chief officers. What motivates them in the
work that they want done? Why are they recording so much of this
information? What is the driving force behind it? Some questions need
to be asked. What makes chief officers go towards this
unnecessary&#151;as many officers see it&#151;recording and
collating of statistics, facts and information? Is it necessary? A lot
of us say, &#147;No, it is not. We have gone too far&#148;. We are
there for the public; we are not there for the statisticians and
collators.</div>
<a name="10012658000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I will start with the cultural side. It is
enormously difficult to change a culture. Changing culture is
complicated. There are a lot of police officers whose foundation of
learning and policing&#151;their experiential learning on the
street&#151;has been about stop-and-search and qualitative
assessment. So now when we come along and say, &#147;We want you to
use a little bit more common sense about who you stop and search, and
how you record it,&#148; it will take a little bit of time to
introduce.</div><a name="10012658000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
benefits and how they can be used are particularly important. There is
no doubt that you will have to record less on the street; in some of
the early pilots, about 10 or 15 per cent. of time was saved. The
interaction on the street should not really be any different, but about
10 per cent. of time could be saved from recording on the street. Then,
of course, you have the knock-on effect on everybody else who handles
that information all the way through the system. That is where
considerable savings can be used. How you use that additional time is
extraordinarily difficult to capture, but I think that police forces
need to explain far better to local communities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>their tactics on stop-and-search and stop-and-account&#151;what they
provide and what the police are now able to do differently that they
were not able to do before in the time that has been freed
up.</div><a name="10012658000071"></a>

18</b><a name="10012658000406"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): I have a
couple of points following those questions and answers. The first is on
officers who are using the powers at the moment and the statistic that
90 per cent. of stops do not yield anything. What work is done with
local commanders on the ground to analyse the officers concerned? Has
analysis been done and has it been found that officers may have been in
the job for a long time and therefore it is a cultural thing that needs
changing? Or is it that officers who have only been in the job a short
time may be more prone to stops where nothing comes of it? What is your
experience of
that?</div><a name="10012658000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> My experience is that insufficient analysis is
actually undertaken. If you have all those data, you need to use them
intelligently. I am not convinced that happens in all places.
Certainly, if you have an officer who conducts 100 searches and, of
those 100 searches, 80 result in arrests and in a number of offences
being convicted, you would say that was very productive. If you have an
officer who undertakes 100 searches and only one of them ends up in an
arrest and a subsequent court appearance, you might question how they
are using the power. I would want a little more intervention by
front-line supervisors. What I am hearing from first-line
supervisors&#151;sergeants and inspectors&#151;is that many of them
do not feel able, because they do not have the  time, to have
the type of intrusive supervision that is necessary. The challenge is
to free up sufficient time to give them the opportunity to undertake
the analysis you talk
about.</div><a name="10012658000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000407"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> Paul, do you have any comment on that, or does it
tie into your earlier comments? You were talking about inspectors not
being able to inspect and about superintendents. Is there anything you
want to
add?</div><a name="10012658000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> Very much so. The information we are
getting back from sergeants on the front line of supervision is that,
as Jan says, they do not have time to undertake the intrusive
supervision and correct and tilt back in the right direction those
officers who are getting it wrong and who are perhaps not as successful
as other officers. As a young sergeant, I would go out with all my
officers regularly and try to ensure that they were tilted in the right
direction.</div><a name="10012658000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was interesting looking at Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s report on
public order policing. He highlighted a particular problem when
officers were not being briefed very well at all in public order
situations. I think that comes through from policing generally. The
briefings could be better. We often assume that officers know what they
are doing, but in fact, they actually need a little more information
about when, how and why. It comes back to the quality approach: to get
good quality, you need good, effective front-line supervision. That
means an adequate number of sergeants who are trained in what they are
doing, and good inspectors and above as
well.</div><a name="10012658000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000408"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> If I may press you on the name and address issue,
I am struggling to fathom why an officer would not automatically record
a name and address, or why there would not be a requirement for that
with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>every single stop. If you had stopped an individual a number of times in
a particular area and had not recorded the name and address of the
individual and a couple of days later there was a serious incident in
that area, how would you recognise the possible connection between the
individual being found in the area acting suspiciously but not enough
to take it forward, and  that serious crime? If you are not
collecting those data constantly and automatically, how will
that be of any use?</div>
<a name="10012658000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I agree with you. There will be
circumstances such as you describe that will cause us problems. Yes. I
will go no further than
that.</div><a name="10012658000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I think it goes back to the point about what
intelligence you need to gather and what you do not. If you stop a
person and search them and you find nothing, and there are no other
circumstances for thinking you need to keep that intelligence, from an
accountability point you need to record the fact that you have
undertaken a stop-and-search. But whether you need to record all the
details of absolutely every search, I am not so sure. I take your
point. In most cases you will need to be able to put that person in
that place if something transpires later that you need to go back
to.</div><a name="10012658000079"></a>

21</b><a name="10012658000409"></a><b class="B">Shona
McIsaac</b> (Cleethorpes) (Lab): If one theme is coming
through, it is about how this will get through to front-line officers.
It is a complaint I hear quite a bit. An announcement is made that
something will be done and we are now here debating the Bill, but the
time delay before the new powers are used is a worry. I want to get
some idea about how confident you are that all forces will make sure
that these changes are passed on to the front
line.</div><a name="10012658000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I am not at all assured in my own mind that
they will get through to front-line officers quickly and effectively.
That is from past experience. I have been involved in my home
force&#151;the Metropolitan force&#151;in working up strategy to
train officers in new processes and procedures. There is a belief among
those designing the training programme that magically everyone will be
trained up to the desired standard. The reality on the ground might be
very different. There is one particular example in relation to
stop-and-search. There was a requirement that officers would have two
or three hours&#146; training in a particular facet of the work they
did. The reality on the ground as reported by friends and colleagues
was that they were sent an e-mail saying, &#147;This is coming in.
Work to this standard from today.&#148; That was it. So am I
confident that it will happen? No, I am not. Some forces have been very
good at ensuring it happens. Other forces will not be as
good.</div>

22</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000410"></a>Shona

disparity between forces in the way they may use the new powers, if
they come into
force?</div><a name="10012658000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> There is a legal requirement that they will
use the new powers in the way described, but I think there will be some
confusion initially, almost inevitably, when those powers come into
being.</div><a name="10012658000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> The training that Paul describes has been
lacking in a lot of areas. Again, the supervision&#151;having the
opportunity to encourage people to change&#151;has a part to play.
You have to go back to why the changes to stop-and-account have not hit
home. There are two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>reasons. One is about the technology, because a lot of the technology
took longer to be changed than people anticipated. Some of it is about
culture, but some of it is also about community consultation.
Stop-and-account and stop-and-search are emotive issues in local
communities. Police forces have undertaken big consultation exercises
with police authorities on the use of stop-and-search and
stop-and-account, but some forces felt that just to change it without
going back to those local communities was a step too far. Although I
accept that point, we are now 12 months on. The fact that there are
still 30 forces not undertaking it in the way that was intended when
the procedures changed on 1 January is
worrying.</div>

Brake:</b> To follow up that point, Jan Berry, are you in
effect saying that it is the fault of senior officers in relation to
stop-and-account who have chosen not to go for the streamlined version
and are still maintaining the need to collate information beyond what
is required under stop-and-account? If that is the case, what can be
done to get senior officers to take on board what was supposed to be a
more streamlined, effective process?</div>

spoken to chief officers over the past few months and they tell me that
this is not happening. I then have meetings with front-line officers
who have local performance indicators that require stop-and-search and
stop-and-account in the same way. It is about getting the messages
through to absolutely every level but, you are right, it starts with
chief officers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000413"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> This is a very brief point&#151;again, for either
of you. As to technology, looking back, the records were always
paper-based and I do not know the extent to which it is possible for
the constable on the beat to keep an electronic record, so
he or she does not have to make a written report. The record would be
made either on the scene electronically or subsequently by tape machine
or laptop, for example. Could you help us on the technology now
available?</div>
<a name="10012658000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> It is a varied picture around the country. I
think that the British Transport police have technology specifically
for stop-and-search and stop-and-account. There is a direct piece of
technology for that. Very few other forces have that level of
technology.</div>
<a name="10012658000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000414"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Is it coming forward, do you know?</div>
<a name="10012658000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> People have to decide what technology they
want, to be honest. We do not want police officers to have one piece of
equipment for this and one piece for that. The kit needs to be
integrated and have more than one application, so it depends on the
equipment. Some police forces are using electronic notebooks on which
they can record the information once, and that information then
populates different databases, which can be quite effective. Other
forces are using the airwave radio for recording stop-and-account and
are moving 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>very slowly towards a more electronic version, with PDAs, Blackberrys
and so on to record the information. There are 42,000 mobile data
devices being used currently by front-line police officers, but not all
of those devices will be able to record stop-and-search details
although, in the fullness of time, they will, but, from my point of
view, that needs to be expedited.</div>
<a name="10012658000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> Indeed, lots of people are willing to
provide kit and equipment out there, and there is a lot to choose from.
We have to be very careful when we go to procurement to ensure that we
get the right kit. An awful lot of money is already being invested in
technology to record stops-and-searches, crimes and so on on the
street.</div><a name="10012658000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
certainly seem to be going into times of financial hardship, so we have
to be very careful about how that money is spent. We have been saying
for a long time in the Police Federation that we should look at more
central procurement to ensure that we get the right kit and do not have
43 different models of that kit out there. That is important, but we
also need to take into account local considerations where necessary.
More work needs to be done in that area in particular, but is the kit
available? Yes, it is coming online.</div>
<a name="10012658000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000415"></a>Mr.

is that the impression that we are to get?</div>
<a name="10012658000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> Yes, very much
so.</div>
<a name="10012658000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000416"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> It is important, as I said earlier, to make the
job of the policeman effective, straightforward and less bureaucratic.
We all agree on that. Modern technology does not just mean using
electronic devices. Surely, the fastest way of dealing with the
situation is to radio information through to the police station with
someone logging it or the voice of the police constable being directly
recorded on some sort of device. Is that not a quicker, simpler way of
dealing with it than having to write notes either on an electronic
notepad or on paper?</div>
<a name="10012658000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> There are lots of different ways that you
can deal with the recording of information, some of which you describe.
If you are looking at employing additional people in police stations to
listen to what the officers are radioing in, I am not sure it would be
a cost-efficient way of undertaking the process, but it is certainly
worth looking at.</div>
<a name="10012658000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000417"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> However, do you not agree that if a system to
radio in the information was there, the police on the beat would have
more time to deal with other incidents, rather than having to record
all this information when there perhaps are more urgent things that
they could be getting on
with?</div><a name="10012658000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> Yes, indeed. It does happen on occasions
now, but we must not lose sight of the fact that technology is not the
panacea for all our problems. Everybody here must use e-mail systems,
and you can waste an awful lot of time dealing with unnecessary
e-mails. You can generate more unnecessary work. If you look at the
number of e-mails that you receive each day, most people can discard 80
per cent. of them straight away, but you still have to go through them.
So you are actually creating unnecessary work for individuals.
Technology can do exactly the same. You impose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>requirements on people that were not there before. We have to be careful
when we look at technology that it cuts back the time required and does
not put additional burdens on
people.</div><a name="10012658000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> The potential for voice recognition at some
stage in the future is great, but we are not quite there at the moment.
At some point in the future it would be great. Victims could put their
information directly on to the system and there would be no paper
involved, but we are some way away from achieving that. The type of
process that you describe was introduced for crime recording in many
forces. Either the information was taken over the telephone in the
first instance, or an officer was sent who collated the information and
phoned it in. That was considered to be good practice. We are now
having second thoughts about that, because you are taking up two or
three people to do exactly the same task. That can be very confusing.
The jury, for want of a better term, is still out.</div>
<a name="10012658000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is really
important that we get the process right first and then apply technology
to assist us. If you apply technology to a bad process and if we do not
get that interaction for stop-and-search and stop-and-account right in
the first instance we will be using technology to make it even more
inefficient. So we have to get the process of stop-and-search and
stop-and-account right first and then apply the technology to
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000418"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Earlier, Mr. McKeever said that the
Bill was a step in the right direction in this respect. I think
Mrs. Berry said that we have to have the correct framework
for the police to deal with this. My question is very simple: if it is
a step in the right direction, do you think it is going far enough, or
could we do more in the Bill to reduce bureaucracy and increase the
effectiveness of the police? Mrs. Berry, what would the
framework be if you were
deciding?</div><a name="10012658000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> Me
first?</div><a name="10012658000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000419"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> There were two questions, one to each of
you.</div><a name="10012658000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> Step in the right direction? Yes it is a
step in the right direction but we are only dealing with
stop-and-search in the Bill. If you look at police bureaucracy
generally, there is an awful lot of it out there, and it would take an
awful lot more than just dealing with stop-and-search to put it right.
Our interaction with the Crown Prosecution Service could be looked at
and technology introduced, but we are going outside the scope of the
Bill. The Bill deals with stop-and-search in particular and one or two
other areas. To cut back on bureaucracy wholesale, the Bill would have
to go an awful lot further and look at all aspects of
policing.</div>
<a name="10012658000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my
experience bureaucracy is a bit of a red herring in that it is a
symptom of the problem rather than the problem itself. Somebody touched
on the cultural aspects of policing but something that was not touched
on is impositions on us from other agencies that we do business with,
such as the CPS. We do not have control over some of the demands made
on us. We have to look much wider than just this Bill to address some
of the underlying problems in the bureaucracy we deal with. You could
cut bureaucracy enormously by ensuring that we are not dealing with the
same people again and again. We have a revolving-door process in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>the criminal justice system whereby between 47 and  90 per cent.
of people who go through it will reoffend again within a short period
of time. We need to stop that. We need to get those aspects of the
criminal justice system right. You could halve bureaucracy overnight if
we were not dealing with the same people again and
again.</div>

to deal with this
matter.</div><a name="10012658000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I refer to this as the framework that you were
speaking about. I think that the framework would need to look at a more
targeted approach to stop-and-search&#151;intelligence-driven, but
very much on local information involving communities, and being very
aware of the risks in that particular area. Any framework has to be
risk-based. We are still an accountable organisation, so we have to
have some form of record, but training officers to understand what type
of intelligence they need to gather and what type of searches they need
to undertake in order to gather that intelligence would, I think, be
part of that framework. Does that
help?</div><a name="10012658000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000421"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> When the word &#147;framework&#148; was
used, it was about the framework that the police would have to work by,
in terms of what information they recorded. What I am trying to get at
is how to absolutely reduce as much of this as possible so that time is
not wasted and the police can get on and do their job. But what would
the framework be for an average police constable doing the job of
stopping and searching? What is the absolute minimum that we could
expect, or that it would be reasonable to
expect?</div><a name="10012658000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan

stop-and-search?</div><a name="10012658000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000422"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="10012658000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> What is different between stop-and-search and
stop-and-account is that there is greater intrusion with
stop-and-search than there is with stop-and-account. Stop-and-account
is a conversation and stop-and-search takes it one step further. So in
the level of public accountability, there is a requirement on the
police service today to be accountable for actions in respect of
stop-and-search, but I think that that is on specific areas&#151;the
numbers of searches and the areas in which those stops and searches are
taking place. What has happened as a result of those stops and
searches? So: better information to the public and the community about
particular hot spots of crime; what police are doing in those areas in
respect of stop-and-search to attack that crime; how many stops and
searches they have undertaken; what the results of those stops and
searches were, so that people can understand how stop-and-search is
being used in the context of local crime and local antisocial behaviour
problems.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000423"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Jan, may I ask you a question? The Chair does
not intervene in these matters, but I wish to ensure that the evidence
you are giving is properly understood. You, more than Mr.
McKeever, have mentioned the word technology. Are you able to define
precisely what you mean by technology? People out there reading your
evidence might be interested to know precisely what you mean, and what
devices you mean when you use the word technology.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div><a name="10012658000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> Certainly. When Sir Ronnie Flanagan undertook
his review of policing, he proposed that the details that would be
recorded for stop-and-account, as opposed to stop-and-search, should be
able to be undertaken by technology, rather than in paper form. What he
meant by that was using the Airwave communication radios that police
officers have to record the location, because officers&#146;
locations can be identified from the Airwave radio. They record where
they are, the fact that they have undertaken a stop-and-account, and
the ethnicity of the individual they have stopped. That automatically
populates the data records back at the police station&#151;or back at
police headquarters, or wherever they are recording them&#151;so that
the information is collated. There is no paper. It is literally
pressing a button on their Airwave radio to say, &#147;I am in the
High Street and I am conducting a stop-and-account on a white European
male.&#148; That is the amount of detail. It is all done by
technology.</div>
<a name="10012658000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively,
you may have something like a BlackBerry, and on that BlackBerry there
will be a template where you can record the fact that you have
undertaken a stop-and-search. That information is then put on to the
main databases of the force in a number of different ways. Sometimes it
means putting that BlackBerry on to another device that downloads the
information. On other occasions, the information is downloaded
automatically. There is a variety of different ways in which the use of
technology will enable information to be collated and collected on
central
databases.</div><a name="10012658000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000424"></a>The

that?</div><a name="10012658000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I concur with what Jan is saying.
Technology is useful, but you have to get the processes right first,
otherwise, it is a waste of time and money to go through the exercise
of implementing that technology. We have seen that in the past. Get it
right first and then decide what technology you need to use
afterwards.</div><a name="10012658000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000425"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> There has been a lot of talk about bureaucracy.
Obviously, less bureaucracy for officers enables them to do their job,
but at the same time, bureaucracy is necessary from a civil rights
point of view. One of the Bill&#146;s provisions will reduce the time
during which an individual can request a copy of the search record from
12 months to three months. Do you know how many people currently
request their search record after more than three months? How many
people could, therefore, be told that they are out of
time?</div><a name="10012658000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I do not know, but I can find
out.</div><a name="10012658000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I do not have that detail. The last time that
type of question was asked, there were a handful of people who had
asked for the record at any later period, let alone 12 or three
months.</div><a name="10012658000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000426"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Right, so normally you are saying that very few
requests come in at all.</div>
<a name="10012658000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> For personal data. There are plenty of Freedom
of Information Act questions regarding stop-and-search and
stop-and-account in general, but very few people who have been stopped
are calling someone for the detail 12 months later. But that
information will be available and we can find out for
you.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="10012658000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000427"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Are you aware of whether that was something that
senior police officers were requesting? Do you have any idea where the
request came from? Given that, from what you have said, very few
requests are made, do you know why there is the necessity to reduce the
time from 12 to three
months?</div><a name="10012658000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000428"></a>Jim
Dobbin:</b> For clarification, do you think that the changes
suggested should apply in a similar way to the stop-and-search of a
terrorist?</div><a name="10012658000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> Well, I hope we would arrest a terrorist
because we knew who we were dealing with. I do not know whether you
mean stopping and searching a terrorist just walking about generally. I
think the concern is not so much about stopping the terrorist, but
about stopping those who are not terrorists. That has proved to be a
bit of a problem recently. Again, it comes down to training and
briefing in particular. It tends to be exercised during large
demonstrations, such as the G20. I go back to Sir Ronnie
Flanagan&#146;s report on public order policing. You have to ensure
that officers know what they are doing, what the requirements are and
how far their powers actually extend. We make an assumption sometimes
that they know those intimately, but that is not always correct. The
briefing has to be right when those powers&#151;particularly the
section 44 powers&#151;are to be exercised. If we were dealing with a
terrorist per se, I hope that it would be done not by stopping them,
but by more stand-off surveillance and other similar
activities.</div><a name="10012658000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> There have been a number of concerns about
overuse of section 44. In the Metropolitan police area recently, there
has been greater emphasis on the quality of searches and the quality of
the occasions on which section 44 searches are being authorised. The
number of section 44 searches has come down considerably over the past
two years. Do we need to get names and addresses in those
situations?&#151;If the searches are necessary. I think terrorism
brings a different dynamic and I suspect that the details and names and
addresses would be
important.</div><a name="10012658000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000429"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I thank both the Police Federation and Jan Berry
for the help they have given in looking at the bureaucracy issues. Jan
has produced a very helpful report on the wider issues that we are
looking at. The Bill reflects one particular aspect of
stop-and-search.</div>
<a name="10012658000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may, I
would like to follow up on the point that Jim Dobbin just made. There
are, if you choose to call them Sir Nicholas, amendments relating to
stop-and-search that call for the complete repeal of section 44, so it
would not be operational in the event of the amendments being accepted.
Does the Police Federation, rather than Jan, although I welcome views
from her, have a view on whether section 44 should be repealed, given
its usage by various forces across the country?</div>
<a name="10012658000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I can see the argument for asking for it to
be withdrawn or repealed but I think it has a use. It has to be very
carefully managed. The problems in the past were not with the law
itself but with the management of it, by particularly senior officers
who may have exercised the power more widely than it should have been
exercised. There are times and occasions when it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>can be useful, such as G20, as long as it is used proportionately and
correctly. It gives officers powers. We have to look at the potential
outcome if terrorists strike, which could be very wide-reaching indeed
for the economy and Government. We have to ensure that we stop
terrorists when we can, and if section 44 can do that in some way, it
is good and proper. We support maintaining section 44. Its management
needs to be looked at rather than the section
itself.</div><a name="10012658000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000430"></a>Mr.

Jan?</div>
<a name="10012658000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan

section 44 earlier.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000432"></a>Mr.

you have a view as to the amount of time that clause 1 will ultimately
save for police officers across England and
Wales?</div><a name="10012658000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> To quantify that is very difficult indeed.
You would have to do it force by force to see what benefit actually
accrued. From my experience, I think that you would save a fair bit of
time but I cannot quantify it here and now. I do not know if Jan has
done the work in the past, but it is certainly beneficial. We cannot
argue against that at all.</div>
<a name="10012658000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> There are 880,000 searches that the provision
would apply to. I have not calculated the minutes on the record in the
first place, but I think that somebody averaged the time as seven
minutes per stop-and-search form. Some of those seven minutes must be
saved and then there are knock-on benefits. They will depend on
forces&#146; internal systems and processes and how much further time
is saved as the administration in back offices is undertaken. At the
very least, you are talking about 880,000 times seven
minutes.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000433"></a>Mr.

year. How does that figure seem to you?</div>
<a name="10012658000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I could not argue with that but there would be
some saving. The important thing is how you use those 20,000 hours more
effectively and how communities are advised of how those 20,000 hours
are being used.</div>

38</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000434"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> In relation to the recording generally, we have
estimated that we would save from 12 to seven items being recorded, and
of those seven, as Jan mentioned, we think that three could be
automatically undertaken when Airwave is rolled out. Would either or
both of you agree that that would be practical on the rolling out of
Airwave?</div>
<a name="10012658000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I certainly think so. I was remarking to
some of my colleagues on the way here that we have gone back to pretty
much the standard that I was used to working within when I first joined
the police service 33 years ago. I thought that was probably the right
way to do it, but we have been through all sorts of convolutions since
then and we are now back to where I started. I am pleased with where we
are. It is a step in the right direction and it can be recorded as you
say.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div></div><a name="10012658000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I think that Airwave can be useful but, as I
said earlier, we have to ensure that police officers will not be
required to carry a number of different mobile devices. I think we
should use Airwave for as much as it is possible to use it, but we also
need an eye on the future&#151;how police officers would have one
device, which would be their Airwave radio, in addition to being able
to collect and collate all the other information they would require as
part of their normal daily
duties.</div><a name="10012658000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> May I add something, Sir Nicholas? I think
the most important aspect of all this is that by reducing the number of
questions you are required to ask, it actually allows more leeway in
the interaction you are having with the member of the public you have
stopped on the street. That is vital, because the quality of that
interaction will determine the relationship and confidence of members
of a community or of individuals in the police service in the future.
That has to be a real benefit that we accrue. Put aside the time
savings and everything else. The quality of that interaction will
improve because you are not asking as many intrusive questions. That is
good and we welcome
it.</div><a name="10012658000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000435"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It appears that members of the Committee have no
further questions for you. Bearing in mind that we have concentrated
almost exclusively on stop-and-search, and taking into account the
questions that have been put to you, is there any other matter in
relation to stop-and-search that you do not think has been adequately
covered? Would you like to expound it further? We have a moment or two
in
hand.</div><a name="10012658000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I should like to reiterate my opening
statement. It is a very important tool in the weapons against crime and
in ensuring that our communities are safe. It has to be used
proportionately and correctly, and we need to ensure that the
front-line supervision is right and that we have the right number of
sergeants and inspectors supervising constables on the streets to
ensure that we get the right quality. That is what we want to do. The
quantitative aspects are important, but the individual we are stopping
is not interested in the quantitative recording of the data; they are
interested in how they are dealt with. That is the most important
aspect of
stop-and-search.</div><a name="10012658000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I totally agree with what Paul has just said
and conclude by saying that sometimes we focus a little too much on
paper and how much time is being saved rather than what we are seeking
to achieve. Intelligence and information gathering is the DNA of
policing, and we would not be able to provide safety and security to
communities without collecting and collating information. But it has to
be the right information and it has to be done intelligently, which I
think is the point that Paul was
making.</div><a name="10012658000147"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000436"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I intend to call Mr. Hogg in just a
moment, but I seek clarification of what Mr. McKeever has
just said. He talked about having the correct number of sergeants and
the appropriate front-line management. Do we have either, do we have
both or do we have one and not the
other?</div><a name="10012658000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> There is certainly a very strong feeling
throughout the country that there are not enough sergeants who can
impose intrusive supervision, which is an absolutely essential element
of good quality policing. They are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>tied up in too many bureaucratic processes elsewhere and spending too
much time at stations. That is where a wider culling of the paperwork
would be hugely beneficial to the communities we serve. Allow those
sergeants to get back out on the streets, as I used to do on every day
of my service, to ensure that the quality was
right.</div>
<a name="10012658000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000437"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Jan, do you want to add something? You are there
to reduce the
bureaucracy.</div><a name="10012658000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Berry:</b></i> I am there to challenge Government and
policing to reduce it; I do not think I can do it on my own, much as I
would love to have that power. Paul is right. Sergeants and inspectors
need to be out there nurturing, encouraging, directing and leading new
officers. When they are stuck behind computer screens trying to
populate the latest national standard, that is not the best use of
their time. We need to have intrusive supervision out on the streets. I
am absolutely convinced of that. I said in my report that about 30 per
cent. of the bureaucratic burden in forces could be lost tomorrow and
nobody would notice the
difference.</div><a name="10012658000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000438"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Sir Nicholas, you may not allow me to ask this. We
have concentrated on stop-and-search, but if we have time I would also
like to know the Police Federation&#146;s views on DNA. You may take
the view that this is not an appropriate time, but on the other hand
you may think that it
is.</div><a name="10012658000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000439"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is an entirely appropriate question. It is
whether or not our witnesses feel that they can reply. But perhaps, as
you have put the question on DNA, I will ask both our witnesses for a
brief
response.</div><a name="10012658000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I can understand the question, because it
has caused us some scratching of heads and a bit of thought in relation
to some of the provisions in the Bill. From a policing perspective, we
like to have as much information at our disposal as possible, so with
my policeman&#146;s helmet on, I am content with the provisions in
the Bill. If, however, you look at the single target we now have, which
is improving public confidence, I am not sure that we can wholly
achieve it when we are retaining the DNA of people who have been
through the system and are then found to be totally innocent of
whatever it was they were originally charged with. Why we are keeping
the DNA past that point is something that causes me some concern in
relation to trying to maintain and enhance public confidence in the
police service. If any member of the Committee, or I, was to be
arrested and to be found not guilty of whatever it was that we were
arrested for, I think we would be unhappy to find that our DNA was
being kept for a period of
time.</div><a name="10012658000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000440"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Why do you think that a member of the public would
be unhappy if they had been acquitted? What is the reason for that
unhappiness?</div><a name="10012658000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> It is their DNA and if they had not been
arrested it would not have been taken in the first place. They have
changed their status in the community; whereas their peers and
colleagues, who have not been arrested and found not guilty, do not
have their DNA held by police, they do. From a policing perspective, is
it good to maintain a large database? The larger the better, from a
policing perspective, but is that actually enhancing public
confidence?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000441"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Where do you think the balance falls between those
two competing
considerations?</div><a name="10012658000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> There is a model in Scotland that is used
in a more conservative way. The DNA is not retained if you are found
innocent, unless you have been through a criminal process involving
violence or sexual offences. I think that perhaps to limit them in that
respect would be more appropriate than retaining the DNA of everybody
for a period of time specified in the Bill, but we need to give the
matter more
thought.</div><a name="10012658000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000442"></a>Mr.

hear about previously unsolved crimes being cleared up because of
retention of
DNA?</div><a name="10012658000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> Yes, they would
be.</div>
<a name="10012658000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000443"></a>Mr.

unhappy&#151;</div><a name="10012658000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> That they would be happy or
unhappy?</div><a name="10012658000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000444"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> Your previous answer was that a member of the
public who was arrested and subsequently found not guilty but had their
DNA retained would be unhappy about that and that the public would be
unhappy about that. My question is, are the public also unhappy when
they hear that because of that retention of DNA, previously unsolved
crimes have been cleared
up?</div><a name="10012658000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> They are happy with that and there is a
number of high-profile cases where that has proved to be hugely
beneficial, yes. So there are two sides. From the police perspective I
am very happy to retain DNA, but with the imposition of a target of
public confidence for the individual I am not so sure&#151;not quite
so convinced of it. From a policing perspective, you are absolutely
right. There are benefits.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000445"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Briefly, there are also instances where the
police have genuine concerns about an individual who is taken to court,
perhaps on a lesser charge, and is found not guilty, but is undoubtedly
somebody the police have reason to believe may go on to commit further
crimes. If that DNA is not retained and a further crime is committed,
you are losing a piece of evidence are you
not?</div><a name="10012658000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> If they are convicted of a lesser
crime?</div><a name="10012658000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000446"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> If the person goes on and commits another, more
violent, offence but the DNA has not been retained because that person
was deemed to be innocent of the previous charge, you are effectively
losing a significant piece of evidence.</div>
<a name="10012658000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I do not understand. If they are convicted
of an offence the DNA will be
retained.</div><a name="10012658000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000447"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Say a person is somebody who the police have
genuine concerns about. The police are able to bring a lesser case
against the individual, but the lesser case collapses&#151;it falls
down. They are innocent, therefore their DNA would not be retained.
They then go on to commit a further crime or crimes&#151;perhaps more
serious crimes&#151;and come to court, but you then do not have the
DNA evidence from the previous alleged offence to use to help convict
them.</div>

beneficial.</div><a name="10012658000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000448"></a>Alison

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000449"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000450"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> As the DNA database has been opened, do you not
think that perhaps the logical conclusion of some of the arguments that
are being put in relation to DNA is that everyone in the country should
have their DNA registered? Do any of your colleagues advocate that sort
of
approach?</div><a name="10012658000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
McKeever:</b></i> I am sure some officers do advocate that
approach. I have given my DNA to the database to ensure that I could be
screened out if I were at the scene of a crime or what have you. I have
no personal concerns about giving my DNA. Should it be imposed on the
general population? I would have to give that some serious
consideration. Yes, I would have some worries about
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000451"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have now run out of questions. Can I say to
Paul McKeever and Jan Berry that the Committee thanks you very much
indeed for the thoughtful and helpful information you have provided to
this Public Bill Committee. It will certainly assist us in the further
debate on this important Bill. On behalf of all the Committee I thank
you very much indeed. I now call the next panel of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000453"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I thank you for coming before us. I ask Shona
McIsaac to put the first question to
you.</div><a name="10012658000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000454"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> Thank you for coming. Obviously we shall be
talking about gangs and the proposed injunctions for those under the
age of 18. To kick off this evidence session I should like you each to
explain how you deal with under-18s under current powers. Do you think
that those powers are used consistently across the
country?</div>
<a name="10012658000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000455"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Shona, could you perhaps indicate to which of
the witnesses you are directing your question or whether it is for all
of
them?</div><a name="10012658000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000456"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> I want to know whether any of them have a
particular view about this, but obviously the most appropriate person
to start off would be Sue Akers in her role with the
Met.</div><a name="10012658000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Akers:</b></i> I will do my best. Clearly we have all the
powers under the criminal law to use to deal with under-18s. We deal
with antisocial behaviour and there are numerous other areas. In
policing, we do our best to avoid criminalising young people and, if
possible, to work in partnership to try to divert them from crime.
There is an awful lot of activity in policing that goes to that
partnership effort in diverting young people. The criminal law is the
last resort for
us.</div><a name="10012658000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> The existing powers that can be used in
relation to children and young people involved in gang-related activity
obviously include the criminal law and the current scheme in the youth
justice system before children and young people get to court of
reprimands and final warnings and interventions from youth offending
teams at the final warning stage. Then they can be charged and
prosecuted. There are also, very importantly, the powers of local
authority children&#146;s services to go to family courts for care
proceedings, including secure care orders. That aspect has been
ignored. Children who are being drawn into gang activity are at risk of
harm and there are grounds in some cases for local authorities to
exercise their civil powers in the family
courts.</div><a name="10012658000187"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> Antisocial behaviour orders are clearly one of
the key powers in the toolbox in relation to local authorities. They
are used in this context, but they fall short in a number of areas,
which is why we are looking closely at the injunction. Some of those
areas are around the time it can take to achieve a full ABSO, the
response from the court and the management of the individual within an
ASBO. We have used ASBOs reasonably successfully in Manchester but we
find that there is a gap in terms of our powers here. There are lesser
legal scenarios that we can bring into play here and safeguarding
legislation and powers is obviously really important in this context
too. We would see the response from a local authority and partnership
perspective as being the legal and criminal response when necessary,
but there is also a significant element of support alongside the
challenge that the legal response
brings.</div><a name="10012658000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> In Manchester we have seen the various
authorities&#151;police, local authorities and others&#151;using
the powers they have in child protection or antisocial behaviour and I
have become aware of the fact that there comes a point when those
powers peter out and it is probably at the critical point. A young
person, usually 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>a young man, may be complying to a certain degree with various orders
but at the point where the police or their parents feel the person is
in danger, there are limited powers to act. That is why we see this
type of injunction as extremely important in very special and very
occasional circumstances. They are necessary when other things have
failed or the person is not complying. It is the final thing. I would
not want to be the police officer or the local authority social worker
who goes back to the parent and says, &#147;We couldn&#146;t do it.
We couldn&#146;t protect your child because we did not have that
power. We did not have that last tool in the box.&#148; That is what
we are looking at
here.</div><a name="10012658000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000457"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> I have a couple of questions. I almost should
declare an interest as I have been a fan of the way that Manchester has
addressed antisocial behaviour issues and such problems for many years.
I just thought I would get that off my chest.</div>
<a name="10012658000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> Thank you very
much.</div><a name="10012658000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000458"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> A pleasure. My question is addressed to the pair
of you from Manchester, so I apologise to you other folks. I shall be
coming to you. You may hesitate to answer this, but I should be
grateful if you could be as candid as possible. You talked about a
toolbox of measures. To what extent do you feel other local authorities
up and down the country are either selectively looking in that toolbox,
ignoring it completely or perhaps using the tools but tinkering with
them? Do you feel there is a possibility that this may be seen as an
almost gimmicky power that they use instead of going through the
toolbox? I feel that many of them do not do
that.</div><a name="10012658000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> It is difficult to speak on behalf of other
local authorities, because I am not an expert on them. I can say what
works and what does not work in Manchester, and I will be candid about
some of the difficulties that we experience in using all the tools in
the box, and we have many. I may make some comparisons where I can with
other local authorities, but I will not name them because that would be
unfair.</div><a name="10012658000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly
around antisocial behaviour legislation, the ASBO is, like the
injunction, the last resort. Many things can be used before an ASBO,
and that often takes place in other settings. A parenting order, for
example, may be granted in the context of a school setting within the
domain of children&#146;s services and education. They may feel
slightly less than comfortable about a parenting order being the line
of first resort, but we see a parenting order as being a wholly
constructive, very integrated and very positive way of dealing with the
first step along that line of legislation. That does not always happen
for us in Manchester so I would guess, given what you have kindly said
about our vociferous approach to the use of antisocial behaviour
legislation, that it does not happen in other local
authorities.</div><a name="10012658000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
there unwillingness? In the general context of crime and disorder
reduction partnerships, I would say not, but there may be a slightly
different approach from the children&#146;s services arena. However,
I am going to caveat that by saying that, as I think public protection
and safeguarding issues come closer together for all of us in the
public sector, we see the value of the types of orders and initiatives
that bring those two constituencies together with a shared
understanding around challenging 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>negative behaviour but supporting the pro-social approach. I think there
is a necessary coming together here. My belief is that this type of
legislation, and the iterations before it, actually make a difference
in creating understanding around why that collective joint working is
so
important.</div><a name="10012658000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> To add a few points to that, I think that
while there are a range of legal tools in the box, none of them are of
any use unless they are used properly. Their proper use is critical. I
would say that the proper use&#151;and, indeed, the success of
Manchester&#151;is that they are used in a wider policy context. For
example, antisocial behaviour is dealt with as part of neighbourhood
management, and it is part of parenting policy and educational policy.
Indeed, I do not think that the issue of injunctions before us today
would achieve anything standing on its own, but within a framework of
proper strategy, thinking and planning and engagement with partners,
other actions can be taken and it will be another option in the final
stages.</div><a name="10012658000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
context is important. The question I would ask anyone who is looking at
any local authority to judge where they are successful or not in using
this type of legislation is: what is the policy context, policy
framework and practice in which you are engaging? If they just say,
&#147;We use an ASBO because we&#146;ve got trouble on x
estate,&#148; I can bet your bottom dollar that although that
response may appear to be instant, it is not sustainable. I think the
achievement in Manchester is building it into a policy framework. Key
to that framework is the engagement with the public and parents.
Without their buy-in, understanding, engagement and support, these
policies would evaporate. In fact, in Manchester I think we have seen
greater reporting of crime because the public recognise that the police
and other agents can do something about it.</div>
<a name="10012658000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Moss
Side area, for example, where gangs and guns have been an issue, in the
last three or four years we have seen increased engagement, increased
information and increased confidence in the police, because the public
have been confident that the police and others can do something about
the problems they are presented with. That is key. So this range of
polices is extremely important, but it must be seen in
context.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000459"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> It was a very long question, but I will do my
best. Basically, are other local authorities around the country using
the powers that are in the toolbox, are they not using them at all, are
they misusing them, or are they ignoring the full use of some of the
powers that already exist? Therefore, I wondered whether this
particular injunction could just be used almost in a gimmicky way by a
local authority that is not making full use of the powers that it
already
has.</div><a name="10012658000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> I will raise one concern, which is in
relation to the ASBOs and the other antisocial behaviour powers. This
measure is ostensibly designed to cover a small number of children and
young people in a small number of cases. That was originally what was
envisaged for ASBOs in relation to children and young people too, and
they were primarily designed for adults. However, we have obviously
seen that a high percentage of them are being applied to children and
young people, and their misbehaviour.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div><a name="10012658000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the enthusiasm of many local authorities for ASBOs has waned slightly
and we have seen the numbers of applications for ASBOs going down, on
the understanding that other powers, such as acceptable behaviour
contracts, which obviously do not involve a coercive court order, can
be more successful in fully engaging the child and their family in
taking measures to address behaviour.</div>
<a name="10012658000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I echo the
point that Ms Noble made. These injunctions are slightly different, but
a prohibitive order in itself, which simply prohibits the child or
young person from doing a list of things, will achieve nothing, because
if the child does not receive support to change their behaviour,
especially in the chaotic circumstances in which such children are
often living, they will not have the capacity to change it.</div>
<a name="10012658000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are very
concerned about these injunctions, which we have not really addressed
directly so far in this evidence session. That is because they bypass
the existing youth justice system, which is designed to deal with
children and young people using people with enormous expertise in that
sector, and because effectively they will impose all kinds of
requirements and prohibitions on children and young people who have not
been convicted of any criminal offence. These injunctions are really
equivalent to a community sentence.</div>
<a name="10012658000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with
ASBOs, we have already seen examples of powers that were designed to be
used as a last resort in a small number of cases becoming very popular.
You can see how police and investigators who find it very difficult to
gather evidence for criminal prosecution, as happens in gang cases
because there is a conspiracy of silence and witness intimidation, find
it difficult to prosecute those cases, and we are concerned that this
measure will effectively be used as a short
cut.</div><a name="10012658000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Akers:</b></i> The performance of local councils&#146;
crime and disorder reduction partnerships is patchy across the country.
It very much depends on whether an area is prepared to acknowledge
publicly that it has a problem with gangs, so that you can even
consider injunctions.</div>
<a name="10012658000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thing
that attracts me about the injunction that is being proposed is not so
much its ability to prevent activity but its ability to help to divert
people away from what could potentially be a disastrous route for them.
If it is to be used effectively, it must be used sparingly and in very
specific cases. It must be closely targeted and the conditions
surrounding it must be very bespoke, so that it has the desired effect
and prevents a recurrence of violence, benefiting both the victim and
the potential reoffender, which is what this is all about.</div>
<a name="10012658000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I echo
what my colleagues have said. The key is that the injunction must be
very focused, very targeted and very bespoke to the
problem.</div>
<a name="10012658000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000460"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> May I follow up on that? I had a long list of
points to make, but I will defer to the other Members of the Committee;
otherwise, I shall be hogging the whole session.</div>
<a name="10012658000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
legislation as it is written, do you think that it is tough enough or
that it needs to be tougher, in the sense of requiring that wrap-around
of other services&#151;family services or whatever&#151;and in the
sense of requiring not only the injunction and that things should be
prohibited but action from a local authority, so that the authority
does something specific?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div><a name="10012658000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sally, you
might want to kick off the answers to that question.</div>
<a name="10012658000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> We oppose the legislation on children in its
entirety. That is a preface. To answer your question, it essentially
imposes prohibitions and requirements on the child or young person.
Obviously, once in the realm of positive requirements, it is envisaged
that if you tell them to attend a certain programme, that will be
provided. I imagine that it will be provided by the YOT, which will
have to be consulted before the order is made, but there is nothing in
the legislation itself to compel the local authority or YOT to offer
certain programmes, for example.</div>
<a name="10012658000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is one
problem that has come up in the criminal context with youth
rehabilitation orders. The legislation contains all kinds of helpful,
inventive requirements such as mental health or alcohol treatment, but
in many areas those programmes and facilities are not there, so courts
are powerless to make orders in those terms, because nothing will
happen. It depends on availability.</div>
<a name="10012658000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Akers:</b></i> I go back to my point about needing to be
bespoke. It would be ludicrous for a court to give a power incapable of
being carried out by the area where it is making that judgment. That is
why I think that it should be used sparingly, and it should be very
careful to make sure that either the requirements or preventive
measures surrounding the injunction can actually be carried out;
otherwise, it is completely pointless.</div>
<a name="10012658000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> I want to say something about the services
that meet the needs of high-risk vulnerable young people. It is
absolutely crucial that those services are there, and it is absolutely
possible to provide them. I challenge any youth offending service or
local authority to reflect on its own practice if it does not provide
them. We must do so in close
partnership&#151;</div><a name="10012658000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000461"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Could you spell out the
services?</div><a name="10012658000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> I can name some of the services that we have
in Manchester. We have a youth offending service, which is as close to
integration into crime and disorder services and children&#146;s
services as it is possible to be. The brief for that service comes not
simply from an enforcement perspective but from a safeguarding, child
protection perspective too.</div>
<a name="10012658000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I very much
take Miss Ireland&#146;s point that the young people might have needs
over and above many of the cases that youth offending services
currently deal with, and that the packages of care might not currently
exist within those services, but is that not our challenge? Should we
not be developing those services? Absolutely. Can we develop them? Yes,
we can.</div>
<a name="10012658000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have an
independently commissioned piece of work, &#147;Eight till
Late&#148;, which works with the siblings and families of gang
members in schools from the age of eight. It is a small but significant
piece of work that, as Sue Akers said, de-escalates the potential for
involvement in serious gang violence. We have a multi-agency gang
strategy team in Manchester that brings together all the key agencies
that need to work on the issue, as Councillor Battle said, to make a
difference, get to the root of the problem and begin to rehabilitate
those young
people.</div><a name="10012658000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
last thing that I would say is that in terms of the perception of the
community, family and individual and our services, we are talking about
high-risk young people. They are very serious situations that those
young 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>people either find themselves in or create for others. My view is that
we have to think differently to work with that high
risk.</div><a name="10012658000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> The context in which the injunctions will
operate needs to be understood. Although there is an obvious crossover
to link them with ASBOs, they are very different in many ways. Where an
injunction is applied for, it would not be unreasonable for the courts
to identify what has happened up to now, the interventions and who has
been involved with the person, so that it is clear, and where they will
go next. It is not simply turning a tap off or fastening somebody in
their own home. It is about a further journey for the individual that
is out of the context of being a gang member. That is the context in
which we see these injunctions being operated, and we would be highly
critical of any local authority or, indeed, any authority that just
used them willy-nilly, without that understanding. They should not be
using them unless they have done lots of things beforehand to get
there.</div><a name="10012658000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
example is a young man who we have given a great deal of support to. We
rehoused him elsewhere. He complied with everything everyone said to
him on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday night he was
out, Saturday night he was out, Sunday night he was out with the gangs
and around and Monday morning he was back into compliance. That man was
a danger to himself and others, and we did not have the real power to
say, &#147;Friday night, Saturday night and Sunday night are the same
as the rest of the week, son, for the rest of your life.&#148; I
think that is what these powers would do. Out of context, that would
make no difference; in context, it is
vital.</div><a name="10012658000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> I just want to come back quickly on the last
resort point. Everybody seems to be agreed that these powers should be
used as a last resort if they are to be used. The problem is that there
is nothing in the legislation to guarantee that. It depends entirely on
the discretion of the individual local authority or police, because
these can of course be applied for by police as well. These provisions
would be improved by there being some sort of consideration of the
court, specified in the legislation, before granting the injunction, to
the effect that other measures have been tried and have not worked in
this
case.</div><a name="10012658000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000462"></a>Jim
Dobbin:</b> My constituency borders Manchester to the north,
so I am very interested in what is happening there at present. Like all
Members here, I have estates where there are some serious gang
problems. I have one estate where two families run the estate and it is
serious stuff. Although the legislation is about injunctions, the
message that really should be going out from this evidence session is
so important. It is the kind of message that should be inclusive; it
should run alongside this
legislation.</div><a name="10012658000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested in the links within the different agencies at local
authority level, particularly the schools and the police. I have two
schools where there is a designated police officer based in the school,
and that is very comforting for me and the local community. I have
another school where a member of the staff will go out with a police
patrol on a Friday evening, so they are able to identify some of the
youngsters who may be in danger of getting into trouble and they can
have some influence on the youngsters the following week. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>interested in that kind of initiative and whether you think that it is
the kind of initiative that we should all be
pursuing.</div><a name="10012658000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000463"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Who do you want to answer, Jim? All of
them?</div><a name="10012658000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000464"></a>Jim
Dobbin:</b> All of them if they have something to
contribute.</div><a name="10012658000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> I think what Mr. Dobbin describes
is damn good neighbourhood policing, and that is the sort of thing that
we do see in our neighbourhoods. It is the foundation on which other
things will be based. It also deals with the prevent agenda. Police
officers and local authority officers who are well connected with the
community can pick up some of the first signs and signals and then need
to have the right pathways to direct the young people or others to
where they can get the appropriate support and, indeed, courses of
action for prevention through things like parenting&#151;developing
their knowledge and
experience.</div><a name="10012658000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
you describe is the foundation, and that was the context I was talking
about, saying that within most neighbourhoods it should happen, but
there are instances in some neighbourhoods where the level of gang
membership and violence that follows from that is totally different. In
some parts of Manchester, young people will fight out their differences
with their fists and may throw a few things. In other neighbourhoods in
Manchester, young people fight it out with a weapon&#151;a
gun&#151;and the consequences are absolutely devastating for the
young people, their families and the community. It is a different scale
and different ingredients. Certainly the work of Excalibur in
Manchester has used the neighbourhood policing methods to build up
confidence and support among parents and the community&#151;and,
indeed, gang members. They are seen not only to be there to enforce the
law, but to protect.</div>
<a name="10012658000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
foundation, that method, I would applaud. I recognise it to be part and
parcel of this. When somebody says, &#147;What is the policy
context?&#148; and you get out the rule, you start with neighbourhood
policing, you go right the way through and you end with neighbourhood
policing.</div>
<a name="10012658000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000465"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Maureen, this is very much your area.</div>
<a name="10012658000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> I want to focus on the schools aspect, which
was part of the question. Safer schools partnerships are a policy
initiative that is beginning to embed at local level. With our safer
schools partnerships in Manchester, in those geographic areas where we
know we have concentrations of the kind of extreme problems that
Councillor Battle described, we rate such schools, with the head
teacher&#146;s permission, as being tier 3.</div>
<a name="10012658000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">That tier 3
status means that they will have a full-time police officer in school,
supported and paid for by the school itself, with an explicit role not
just around problem solving in the playground&#151;not to reduce that
role or to use the phrase, &#147;It is not important&#148;, as it
is very important to have that hands-on role&#151;but to engage with
the school and its senior management and with all the local
partnerships, to tackle some of the problems that you&#146;ve
described.</div>
<a name="10012658000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">A tier 2 or
tier 1 school may also have some of that, but what was interesting for
us in developing a response with the police for safer schools is that
none of our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>schools that were rated tier 3 in relation to gang violence or violence
that might be associated with extremism have rebelled in any way
against that categorisation. They have said, &#147;We want to work
with you. We recognise that we have a problem here. We don&#146;t
feel stigmatised by that. We have to take positive action. We are on a
journey with those schools and we have some way to
go.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012658000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">But the whole
school community there is involved; there is a feeling among parents in
those schools that it is not a school declaring its hand by saying,
&#147;We&#146;ve got big problems.&#148; It is actually a school
saying, &#147;We&#146;ve got some issues, and we&#146;re going to
tackle them.&#148; There are some very positive things, and
I&#146;m sure in your own area you&#146;ll be aware of the safer
schools partnership. It is an excellent route to working with some of
those further upstream issues that can result in the displays on the
streets that we heard about.</div>
<a name="10012658000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> Three things, quickly. First, we have all
seen the reviews that come out after serious cases both of harm to
children and where children have committed serious offences. They are
common characteristics. They all talk about information sharing between
different agencies, and the need for different agencies to be able to
raise concerns and share them so that a complete picture can be put
together, so that they can identify where a child is at risk of serious
offending or of serious harm.</div>
<a name="10012658000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Safer schools
partnerships can be positive. One thing that we would wish to
avoid&#151;we are talking about the lower end rather than serious
gang-related violence&#151;is for every fight in the playground to
become a criminal justice issue as a result of the presence of a police
officer in the school. That is very important.</div>
<a name="10012658000322"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Thirdly,
on education, I highlight that many of the children at risk that we are
talking about today will not be in school. The proportion of children
in custody&#151;those who have committed serious offences and who
have not been in education sometimes for years before going into
custody&#151;is shockingly high. We must be looking, as part of the
solution, both at the exclusion of children from school and provision
for children who have been excluded in terms of pupil referral units
and their
attendance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000466"></a>The

overview?</div><a name="10012658000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Akers:</b></i> I have a national overview, but I can
rebalance it and put the southern side&#151;or the London side. The
good work going on in Manchester is being replicated in London. It has
obviously driven the safer neighbourhood teams in every single ward. We
are a big part of the safer schools partnership. We have dedicated
police officers in 181, I think at the last count, secondary schools
and pupil referral units. All the cases that we have sadly seen will
show that we are not there yet and we still need to do more around
talking to each other and sharing information across the agencies, but
it is improving.</div>
<a name="10012658000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000467"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Do you want to come back on that,
Maureen?</div><a name="10012658000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> I want to say one thing in response to Miss
Ireland&#146;s point about non-attendance at school, because I think
this is absolutely crucial for this group 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>of young people. We did a deep dive on 30 cases, when we were
reformulating our gang strategy in Manchester, of explicitly
gang-involved young people who had shot, or been shot at. So these are
the top of our risk population. Almost every one of those young people
was a regular school attender and almost every one of them wanted to be
in school. The ones who were not in school were excluded and we had
some difficulty in getting schools to take them back into school, for
very obvious reasons.</div>
<a name="10012658000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Safer schools
partnerships have offered us the solution there. We now have head
teachers who say, &#147;I know there are some risks around this young
person, but we have worked out, as a school, how we are going to deal
with them.&#148; So we do not get a reactive situation. We are
actually planning for these young people being in school. I think we
must understand some of the characteristics of these problems. I
absolutely take the point around a larger population of young offenders
that they are often not in school. Our experience was that they were in
school and wanted to be in school, and could actually perform
reasonably well. So we cannot erect barriers to
that.</div>
<a name="10012658000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000468"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I have no experience of these injunctions at all, so
I would like to ask you a few brief factual questions and then I want
to ask you a general question, probably to everybody, but would you
reply very concisely please, because colleagues want to get
in?</div>
<a name="10012658000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I
assume that section 34 of the Policing and Crime Act 2009 is in force.
Can you tell me how many injunctions have been issued in your
respective areas? Secondly&#151;again a factual question&#151;what
are the resources implications of section 34? In particular, what do
you judge to be the resource implications of clause 36 of the Bill,
which is the enforcement section? Thirdly&#151;this is the general
question&#151;has anybody really given serious consideration to the
civil rights implications of all this? It is clear that an injunction
can be issued against a young person where there is insufficient
evidence to bring home a criminal charge. Yet it is quite plain that
the injunction restricts liberty in a variety of ways and can lead to
enforcement action of the kind that is provided for in clause 36. That
gives rise to civil rights issues relating to the young person. I have
not heard that addressed at all.</div>
<a name="10012658000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, two
factual questions and one general question&#151;and very concise
answers, if you would be so
good.</div><a name="10012658000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000469"></a>The

first?</div><a name="10012658000246"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Akers:</b></i> My information is that it is not yet in force
and therefore we have not taken out any of these injunctions as
&#147;adults not yet empowered&#148;&#151;that is my note here.
So we cannot answer your subsequent question on the kind of resources
that will be required to do that. On the civil rights aspect, the way I
have looked at this is that it is all about extreme violence. If used
properly, the objective would be to stop somebody being killed, or
killing another.</div>
<a name="10012658000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000470"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> But that gives rise to the civil rights questions
that need to be addressed, because an injunction, as I understand it,
actually restricts people&#146;s ability to do this and that. The
injunction can be issued at a lower 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>standard of proof than that required for the conviction of a criminal
offence. That is a matter that has to be addressed, whether that is
desirable or
undesirable.</div><a name="10012658000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000472"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000474"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have a disagreement. Sally
Ireland?</div><a name="10012658000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> I should like to address the civil rights
question directly. One of our key reasons for opposing the application
of this legislation to children is the human rights implications.
Mr. Hogg is right to say that essentially these injunctions
allege serious criminal conduct: encouraging, assisting or carrying out
acts of gang-related violence. It is notable&#151;although it is
overstating to give the example of homicide, effectively&#151;that
there is no minimum level of seriousness of violence before these
injunctions can be applied for or given. We could be talking about more
minor activity, particularly in the context of children and young
people, where more minor activity may be happening.</div>
<a name="10012658000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The civil
standard of proof is explicitly in the legislation. It is interesting
to compare that with ASBOs. The ASBO legislation was silent as to the
standard of proof: that is, should it be a balance of probabilities or
beyond reasonable doubt? The House of Lords, in the case of McCann,
determined that the seriousness of the allegations of an ASBO was such
that, although they were civil not criminal orders, as a matter of
pragmatism the criminal standard of proof should be applied in all ASBO
applications. So it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the
antisocial behaviour occurred. The Home Office is clearly trying to get
round that in relation to these injunctions by putting in the
legislation that the civil standard applies. Notably, it has also moved
them, unlike ASBOs, which are applied for in the magistrates
court&#151;</div><a name="10012658000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000475"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Could I just pause you? With regard to that Court of
Appeal
judgment&#151;</div><a name="10012658000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> It was a House of Lords
judgment.</div><a name="10012658000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000476"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Was the court saying that it was for public policy
reasons desirable that the standard of proof should be at a criminal
level?</div><a name="10012658000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> Yes; it is quite customary in the civil
courts, as I am sure you will be familiar. Where fraud is alleged, for
example, in the civil courts, a heightened standard of proof is used,
because of the seriousness of the reputational damage to the
individual.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div><a name="10012658000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000477"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Are you suggesting that this is an attempt by the
Home Office to go behind the decision of the Court of
Appeal?</div><a name="10012658000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> It was the House of Lords, the McCann
case.</div><a name="10012658000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000478"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Even more serious in that
case.</div><a name="10012658000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> It is definitely to avoid a repeat of
McCann, if it is silent on the standard of proof in this legislation.
Because this legislation is very clear about it, essentially a
declaration of incompatibility would have to be issued under the Human
Rights Act 1998. As we know, the courts are quite cautious about doing
that. I would also say that the constitution of the Supreme Court that
we now have&#151;as opposed to the House of Lords that we had back in
2002&#151;means that, in my opinion, it would be less likely that
such a declaration would be issued.</div>
<a name="10012658000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth making another comparison with ASBOs. ASBOs can only prohibit
conduct: prohibit individuals from associating with other individuals
or entering proscribed zones, that sort of thing. These injunctions can
make all sorts of positive requirements, including that the person is
at a certain place for up to eight hours a day. We are talking
effectively about a curfew. So they can impose a curfew; they can
require them to attend programmes; they can, as Mr. Hogg
said, make all kinds of inroads into the person&#146;s life in a
variety of areas, without any criminal conduct having ever been proved
to the criminal standard.</div>
<a name="10012658000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a last
resort, if the injunction is breached, children and young people could
be looking at custody for up to three months. That goes entirely
against the Government&#146;s stated policy that custody for children
should be a last resort. That is also an international legal
requirement under the UN convention on the rights of the child, to
which the UK is a core signatory. There are serious concerns about
this.</div><a name="10012658000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000479"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Who wants to come in first? Maureen Noble or Jim
Battle?</div><a name="10012658000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> I will speak briefly. I am not a lawyer,
politician or police officer. From a public protection point of view,
there is merit in looking at this injunction. The young people I know
and see will sometimes benefit from restrictions being placed on them.
That does not override a civil liberties argument, and I would never
suggest that it
does.</div><a name="10012658000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the context of Manchester&#151;the area that I know well&#151;we
are dealing with the young people in our top 30 who need more than they
have now. I say that with all seriousness and passion. They are highly
at risk of killing or being killed. It is incumbent on us to examine
every element of this, including the civil rights element. However,
requiring them to be in certain places at certain times is sometimes
beneficial to them, although that is restrictive of their liberty. We
need to show that we are concerned and that we
care.</div><a name="10012658000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> Although it may be comfortable or natural to
compare these two ASBOs, I think we are talking about a different
animal. The standard has to be measured against the level of violence
that is encountered or perpetrated in a particular area by gang
activity. It is not general antisocial behaviour. In the Moss Side
area, antisocial behaviour in its conventional sense is, believe 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>it or not, very low. But this type of behaviour is sadly higher. I am
pleased to state that it is actually declining, but it is still
there.</div><a name="10012658000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
approach to this Committee is to say, &#147;Yes, we do recognise
there are human rights implications here. We recognise that there are
human rights implications when a young man holds a gun up and shoots at
another. And we recognise that there are human rights implications when
another is
killed.&#148;</div><a name="10012658000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000480"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> But that is a criminal offence, of
course.</div><a name="10012658000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> Absolutely. We see the highest form as using
the criminal law, and where appropriate it should be used. But there
are issues relating to the availability of evidence. We have
encountered silence within communities, partly because of the degree of
confidence in our ability to respond appropriately. We have also seen
silence in communities because of intimidation and
fear.</div><a name="10012658000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that on balance these types of injunctions would serve, first,
the individual, secondly, the community and, thirdly, would support the
authorities in providing the type of environment that young people can
grow up in. It is difficult and challenging and it is not easy, but to
deny us that capacity would be a step backwards rather than
forwards.</div><a name="10012658000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000481"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Listening to you speak, Councillor, I had the
impression that your authority, or whoever, may seek injunctions quite
frequently, unlike the evidence of Sally
Ireland.</div><a name="10012658000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> I can assure you&#151;I have said it
before&#151;that these would be incredibly rare: as rare as
hen&#146;s teeth. They will be used extremely rarely, because we
believe that we have other strategies at our disposal and other ways of
addressing this. I think we have demonstrated that. The number of gang
incidents has declined rapidly. But we have used other tools. We regard
this as the final tool. I disagree with Miss Ireland. The tools are not
there to be used except as the very last resort, because if they were
used in any other way they would become invalid and would be incredibly
difficult to
administer.</div><a name="10012658000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are looking at the point at which a young man sets off and the police
are aware and they have to intervene. They have not got the powers at
the moment and I think they need
them.</div><a name="10012658000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000482"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> May I follow on from your point, yet again? You
talk about the numbers involved being small. Do you have a sense at all
of the number of young people who would potentially be affected by this
type of
injunction?</div><a name="10012658000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> Let me start by talking about what we know in
terms of the size of the population in Manchester. We have a
sophisticated monitoring system for gang membership that starts with
recognition of issues in school&#151;the wearing of badges and
regalia, and associations&#151;right the way through to those who are
criminally convicted and their associates. We have a good database and
monitoring system in respect of that. Our Manchester database probably
contains between 500 and 600 names of young people who are
gang-involved. The Committee should understand that that goes from the
wearing of a colour to the carrying of a gun, so the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>spectrum is vast. We are looking at the very top of  that
spectrum. For the purposes of this injunction, we are probably looking
at a potential cohort of around  30 young
people.</div>
<a name="10012658000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000483"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> In your area or more generally?</div>
<a name="10012658000283"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> In Manchester. Many of those young people will
be subject to custodial sentences already.  By young, I am
talking about people from the ages of  10 to 24, which is
defined as a young person in some  of our youth services. There
is a big age span, but potentially that very top group is of around 30
young people. Some 25 per cent. of those young people are in custody at
any given time. Another 25 to 50 per cent. will be either under the
supervision of the youth offending service or engaged with another
service through which we are managing their behaviour, and they are
often contributing to the management of that behaviour. That leaves us
with potentially eight, 10 or 12 young people. I do not think that we
can talk hard and fast on this. We do know that in Manchester gang
membership is growing; the numbers are increasing. The trajectory from
joining and wearing a colour to carrying a gun is
shortening.</div>

67</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000484"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Can we go back to the age issue? You talked about
a spectrum from 10 to 24. The Bill introduces a lower limit of 14. We
all know from our constituency work, casework and going out with the
police that significant numbers of young people&#151;eight, nine, 10
or 11-year-olds&#151;are being used by and are joining gangs. We also
know that they are capable of perpetrating some pretty awful offences,
as we have seen in recent weeks. Those young people do not fall within
the powers. Within the figures that you have given, how many younger
people&#151;below 14&#151;would you say could potentially fall into
a group and slip through because of how the legislation
applies?</div><a name="10012658000285"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> I cannot give you exact numbers but we know in
Manchester that the age of what we would call gang-membership is
falling, and the Committee has looked at what we believe constitutes
gang-membership. Fourteen is not young now, but 10, perhaps, still is.
Our understanding is that the proposal has been formulated in
conjunction and consultation with a wide range of agencies, which felt
that 14 was the right level. The age of criminal responsibility is 10.
Are there 10-year-olds in Manchester that this possibly could be
applied to? Yes, there are, because there are 10-year-olds who are
deeply gang-involved.</div>
<a name="10012658000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000485"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Particularly when we know that these young people
are being drawn in, not so much due to peer pressure, but, rightly or
wrongly, due to hero worship to a degree, is there also a risk that the
injunction will be see as a badge of honour that somebody will strive
to
achieve?</div><a name="10012658000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> As I said before, we see this as the end of a
process. I would not see it as a graduation process because, by the
time we were at an injunction, there would have been a great deal of
engagement with the young person. That young person will be aware that
the authorities, the police and others are fully aware that they are a
member of a gang, a danger to themselves and a danger to others. That
is why it is not the same as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>when people claim that ASBOs are that type of badge&#151;this is
different. We would be way down the road on this. I would have thought
that somebody who saw it as a graduation process would be totally
wrong.</div><a name="10012658000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="10012658000289"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> I want to come back to the 10-13 age group.
If these injunctions are to be applied, there are even stronger
arguments against extending them to that younger age group. If younger
children are being drawn into gangs, they might be being drawn in by a
high combination of intimidation/fear. The presence of a court order
stating, &#147;Stop this behaviour&#148; will not act as a very
strong disincentive when weighed against those influences, which would
be very strong on such a young child. Obviously a response is needed,
but that should be a children&#146;s services response, because we
are talking about young children who are deeply at
risk.</div><a name="10012658000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000486"></a>The

point.</div><a name="10012658000291"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> I have spoken with my local MP, Tony Lloyd,
to say that we think it would be more appropriate if it was moved to

young people and older children as
well.</div><a name="10012658000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000487"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000489"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000490"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Thank you for your evidence today. I think that
the public listening to the debate will want to know how the new law
will affect and improve their neighbourhoods and local communities.
Some of you represent local government, and the police and local
government obviously have a role in enforcing the measures. Will the
legislation make a huge difference, and will there be a visible
difference in how the police and local authorities are able to tackle
the problem of gang-related violence and threats against people? Will
it make a difference, or is it yet another piece of legislation that
reads well in the national newspapers but will not make a blind bit of
difference on the ground? What is your honest opinion on
that?</div><a name="10012658000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000491"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May I suggest that Sue Akers and Sally Ireland
provide a national overview for that question before we come down to
deal with
Manchester?</div><a name="10012658000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Akers:</b></i> You would think, if the measures are used
properly, that the communities would see a difference, because the
desired effect is the prevention of violence, to which I have already
alluded, and to try to get young people away from gangs and into
mainstream education, or whatever else, to change their way of life. If
that is successful, communities would see a difference. They would see
reduced violence in their areas, which should then be calmer and nicer
places to be. It is a big if, because we have all said that we would
use that sparingly. If you target young people who are the most violent
and who cannot be addressed by means of criminal law or other means, it
would be useful.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div><a name="10012658000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">One point we
have not made, but which perhaps it would be useful to make, is that it
could be used as a useful interim arrangement. When you sense that
someone is clearly at high risk of serious violence, but there is
insufficient evidence to go down the criminal route at the point, you
could usefully get an interim arrangement whereby you seek to prevent
the violence and protect individuals, but at the same time you could
carry on with a plan to prosecute using the criminal law
route.</div>
<a name="10012658000299"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> I have just two points. I am sorry to keep
comparing these with ASBOs, but in a way they are a more serious
version of ASBOs. It is notable that about two thirds of ASBOs for
children and young people are breached. High rates of breach could
compromise the potential effectiveness of the orders. We are worried
that we will see a high percentage of the children and young people who
are subject to the orders end up in custody because they have breached
them.</div><a name="10012658000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is another danger with these measures, because obviously they are
designed for when a child or young person is already involved in gang
behaviour&#151;if they are used as a last resort, they will be deeply
involved&#151;so it is important not to emphasise such measures at
the expense of effective early intervention. We do not want children to
get to the point where this sort of order will be applied for against
them. There is a danger that a headline piece of legislation like this
from the Home Office can mask failings by other departments in
mainstream services in helping to prevent children and young people
from being at risk of this
behaviour.</div><a name="10012658000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000492"></a>The

important.</div><a name="10012658000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> There is no greater headline than a front page
stating that a 14-year-old was shot in Moss Side last night. That is
the biggest headline of all. It is a dreadful headline. It gives a
community no confidence whatsoever about it being a good, happy and
cohesive place to live, and that it is worth making an effort. It also
reflects a lack of confidence in the public agencies. We are all of the
same mind&#151;we will use this injunction sparingly. We do not,
fortunately, have huge numbers of young people whom it would apply to
and, if our justice and intervention services work properly, nor should
we. But we need to create a mood and a message for local people,
families and young people that we can and will take action when
appropriate. This is part of that
message.</div><a name="10012658000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a strong focus in Manchester on working with local people and
saying to them, &#147;You said. We did.&#148; Local people in Moss
Side tell us that they want us not only to punish and enforce against
young people, but to help and assist them. I believe that this
injunction, used properly and effectively, will do both of those
things; it will challenge and it will
support.</div><a name="10012658000304"></a>

violence to deal with the use of animals, particularly dangerous dogs,
in crime?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div><a name="10012658000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000496"></a>The

Jim?</div><a name="10012658000309"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Battle:</b></i> I think it refers to all weapons, such as
knives and guns. If people are using animals as weapons, it is
obviously criminal. But I think that the essence of it is about
behaviour towards each other, the regulation of that behaviour, and
making sure that the behaviour is acceptable to the individual as well
as to the neighbourhood. It relates back to your question. It is about
being able to make sure that those neighbourhoods are peaceful. If you
contrast the difference between the number of violent, gang-related
crimes in one neighbourhood and another, even across the road in, say,
Fallowfield, which is 100 yards away, or further down in Wythenshawe or
further away in Macclesfield or Middleton, it is a totally different
environment and neighbourhood. Therefore, I think that the issue of
gang-related behaviour has to be challenged, and I think that the
definition here covers all those
points.</div><a name="10012658000310"></a>

seconds and can our witnesses answer
briefly?</div><a name="10012658000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000498"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> I will ask it in 30 seconds, but I suspect it will
require a five-hour answer.</div>

Chairman:</b> Robert, may I just say that we have the
discretion of going slightly over time, but can you still be
brief?</div><a name="10012658000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="10012658000500"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> Thank you. I will keep it as succinct as I can.
There is nothing new in gang violence, wherever you look; we have had
football violence in the 1980s and the mods and the rockers fighting on
Brighton beach. What has changed that means that 10-year-olds are
joining gangs? I do not think that that has happened historically. The
provisions are tackling the physical signs and outcomes of that, but
what do we do, and what are you doing, to get to the underlying issue
that is causing this problem to become a greater one? Or is it becoming
greater?</div><a name="10012658000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000501"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May I suggest that Maureen Noble and Sally
Ireland briefly deal with this
question?</div><a name="10012658000315"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maureen
Noble:</b></i> What has changed? I think that our
understanding of the nature and extent of gang violence in England has
changed. Gang violence in England is not the same in Manchester as it
is in Birmingham or London. There are distinct differences, and we
understand them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div><a name="10012658000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will talk
about Manchester&#146;s particular situation. The change has been
family ties and local associations. The gang culture that began 30 to
35 years ago in Manchester has grown and spread. The acceptance of
violence as a means of settling scores is deeply embedded in that small
but significant population. Associations with other types of crime and
antisocial behaviour for that population have deepened, and those
people have become less connected, in many respects, with the wider
constituency.</div>
<a name="10012658000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue&#151;this may sound somewhat melodramatic&#151;is that
violence breeds violence. The experience of being shot, I
think&#151;it has never happened to me or, I hope, to anyone around
this table&#151;does something to you. It can create either revulsion
or excitement. There are stakes for many of the young people involved.
It becomes a way of life. The first time, it is difficult; after that,
it is relatively straightforward and easy&#151;frighteningly so, in
some cases. Desensitisation to violence as a means by which you live
your life is something that has
changed.</div><a name="10012658000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sally
Ireland:</b></i> Primarily, I think, this is a question about
society and culture, so we are a little outside the scope of this
hearing, but one point that I will make is that we have seen an
increasing reliance, compared to the periods back in time that you
discussed, on the state&#146;s formal mechanisms of control to
discipline the behaviour of children. Informal methods of social
control of children and young people by parents, neighbours and schools
have all declined, and that lack of supervision and control from more
informal sources may have contributed to a culture where they are
wandering the streets unsupervised and can get embroiled in all kinds
of serious activity. Then it is left to the local authorities and
police to respond to that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012658000502"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have allowed the sitting to go on past 1
o&#146;clock because that last question was important and relevant. I
am glad that I did so. I thank each of our witnesses for the way that
they have expressed their views and the helpful nature of the
information that they have provided, which I am sure will be of
particular interest to the Minister and shadow Minister. The subject is
important. On behalf of the Committee, I thank our witnesses very much
for the evidence that they have given us. It has been most
helpful.</div>
