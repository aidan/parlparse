</P>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Government Resources and Accounts Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at five minutes to Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It gives me great pleasure to participate in a new Standing Committee with, indeed, a new Chairman. Like some hon. Members present, I have spent considerable time in Committee, but this is the first time that I have had the pleasure of your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I welcome you, and look forward to welcoming your colleague, Mr. Butterfill, who will be joining us on Thursday. Mr. Butterfill has been involved with many Finance Bills, and you have considerable experience of chairing Committees on Treasury business, so we shall be in safe hands.
<P>
I note that the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) is sitting opposite me, but I am sorry that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), who I thought would be joining us, is not here. He and I have spent considerable time together debating the Financial Services and Markets Bill. Were that time not always spent in Committee, we could almost be the subject of gossip. [Interruption.] I see that he has just entered the Committee Room. I am looking forward to the pleasure of our spending yet more time together, discussing matters that differ somewhat from those that we usually debate. It is also a pleasure to welcome the hon. Members for West Dorset and for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), and the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis), who is Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.
<P>
I hope that we have a fruitful debate. There has been a great deal of all-party support for the notion of resource accounting. Indeed, the Government Resources and Accounts Bill began its life as a Green Paper, and then a White Paper, under the previous Government in 1994 and 1995. It has been an idea long in the making because of the need to get the Bill right, but the all-party support that it has enjoyed since those early days has enabled us to move forward. The Bill will improve information on the Government's performance and accountability to the House of Commons, and on the way in which money is spent. A more realistic picture will be presented of the way in which resources are used and, in effect, of their opportunity cost, through the accruals accounting system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I echo the Economic Secretary's welcome to you, Mr. Hood, and her prospective welcome to your colleague, Mr. Butterfill. I also reciprocate the wishes for a happy new year that she kindly offered Opposition Members. Let us hope that it will be another year of massive prosperity.
<P>
Sadly, given the fact that we may find ourselves in sittings of the Committee for some time to come, it is possible that my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden, who is Chairman of the PAC, may die before our eyes. I welcome him to the proceedings, notwithstanding his medical condition. His leading opposite number on the PAC, the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams), who was at the briefing session yesterday, is also present. I look forward to notable contributions from them both.
<P>
On Second Reading, Conservative Members pointed out serious defects. During the prolonged period for reflection that was afforded by Christmas and the new year, it has become clear that more matters need correction than we had previously realised. As we examine the Bill clause by clause, we shall want to reconsider certain aspects. Indeed, the Economic Secretary and her colleagues should want to reconsider how best to go about the process of turning the Bill back into what it ought to have been.
<P>
The Bill's main problem is not of essence, but of accident. In essence, as the Economic Secretary said, its direction commands all-party support, as well as that of the PAC and most commentators that consider such matters. Given that it is 600 years—if my history is correct—since the invention of the normal accounting procedures that are used in the private sector, it is remarkable that we are only now debating whether they should be introduced in the public sector. It is clear, even to those of us who think of ourselves as part of the forces of conservatism, that change is overdue.
<P>
The Bill fails adequately to stipulate how definitions are to be reached. Accounts are of little value without accounting standards. There should be some means, external to the Government or the Treasury, of setting standards against which audit can be conducted. Many of the amendments that have been tabled by Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members—I was about to say our Liberal Democrat colleagues, having forgotten that they are actually colleagues of the Government—attempt to remedy that, and I am sure that we will have a long and fruitful debate about those mechanisms.
<P>
I enter the prayer that, after the Committee's proceedings have concluded, and perhaps following proceedings in another place, the Economic Secretary and her colleagues will find some means—without having to abase themselves or admit to any error—of providing an independent source of standard-setting, as Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members wish. It is not in the long-term interests of any Government—still less of democracy—to have a magnificent new accounting system that is an empty box because the standards against which accounting is conducted can be adjusted without limit and by administrative fiat. Although I am sure that our debate will be vigorous, I hope that it will not be a party political dogfight, but rather an opportunity for the Economic Secretary to persuade her officials to reconsider the matter.
<P>
As members of the Committee, we are all elected politicians, of whatever party, with a vested interest in clarity, accountability and democracy. Another set of people—civil servants—are properly employed doing a magnificent job, trying to run public services and especially the Departments of State. I am the last person to object to civil servants—my wife is one—however, the interests of officials cannot be ignored, as public choice theory rightly tells us. Officialdom as a whole has no interest in maximising the exposure of its activities to independent verification, but rather in minimising it. That is the experience of government over many centuries.
<P>
The purpose of this Committee and of Parliament should be to ensure that the innate tendency of any bureaucracy to protect itself and its own discretion is limited in such a way that the public at large, and Parliament in particular, can inspect what is going on, know what they are seeing and take action if they do not like it. Although I recognise that the Economic Secretary is subject to the siren voices once she gets back to the Treasury, I hope that my colleagues and I can persuade her that we are on the same side in this argument. It is as much in her interests as a Minister, a Government representative and a Member of Parliament, as it is in our interests and those of our electors, to ensure proper definitions. That will be a major issue for discussion, especially during our debates on clause 5.
<P>
There is another agenda, on which I do not want to dwell but which it is important to recognise. It is an agenda not of the Opposition, nor of the Liberal Democrats, although I think that I speak for the Liberal Democrats as well as for the official Opposition in saying that it is an agenda of the Public Accounts Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): The Liberal Democrat Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Liberal Democrat quasi-Opposition.
<P>
The agenda of which I speak is sponsored by the Public Accounts Committee, and we are deeply sympathetic towards it. It is not about definitions or standards, but about enforcement, although those concepts go hand in hand. Without proper independent definitions and standards, the enforcement of the resultant changing and fluid item would have little meaning. Moreover, there is little point in proper definitions and standards unless they can be enforced. That would involve the kind of audit that the National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor General have been conducting for many years, and encompassing within it the whole scope of government.
<P>
The Committee benefited yesterday from a valuable briefing by the National Audit Office, which brought home to us how multifarious and messy government has become in recent years, and how many aspects of government are now conducted by bodies that will, if this Bill becomes law, fall outside the scope of audit by the NAO. I look forward to intense debates on several clauses, starting with clauses 4 and 5, concerning the extent to which the Comptroller and Auditor General should be allowed to become involved in those aspects of government that are not straightforwardly departmental, and how far he should have open and unfettered access throughout government. That is a matter of grave concern, and a case in which all Members of the Committee stand on one side of the barricades, while others stand on the other. This is not a case of senior members of the bureaucracy trying to protect themselves from accusations of impropriety. Permanent Secretaries and senior officials throughout Whitehall share the common aim of seeking to stamp out impropriety.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although it is an understandable human phenomenon, the sad fact is that many people aim to minimise the intrusion that powerful external bodies can exercise because it causes much fuss and bother. We understand why the Bill was drafted in a manner that will limit rather than expand the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's activities.
<P>
The Comptroller and Auditor General and the PAC do not have the highest reputation in Whitehall. I suspect that Permanent Secretaries would prefer it—at least until they retire—if those bodies did not exist. I believe that it was Saki who said that one of the consolations of middle-aged reformers is that most of the good that they do must live after them if it is to live at all. It is undoubtedly the prayer of Permanent Secretaries that the PAC should go into abeyance until after their retirement. However, we are interested in the opposite: we want everything to be open for inspection.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Williams </B>(Swansea, West): Even retirement no <P>
longer exists as a line of escape for Permanent Secretaries. The PAC has decided that it will call them out of retirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Even unto death. That may be a harsh doctrine, but I am delighted to hear that the PAC has extended its tentacles to the retired. I shall inform my wife accordingly.
<P>
The Government and the Opposition share a joint interest in this context. We want to amend the Bill so that the Gladstonian settlement, which involves the Comptroller and Auditor General's powers and his relationship with Parliament, will be strengthened not weakened. The greater part of our worries about the Bill would be remedied if there was a clearer way to set definitions and standards and an increase rather than a diminution in the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's enforcement powers.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to another matter, which is not so much a criticism as a line of inquiry that we want to pursue. It arises in relation to some of the probing amendments that we have tabled. I must apologise if Ministers and officials were puzzled by some of our amendments. Those of our amendments that do not raise substantive issues are intended to probe a clause's meaning. I refer in particular to resource budgeting.
<P>
Although the Bill's reporting arrangements are of great importance to democracy, its budgeting proposals matter more in relation to the running of government. It contains relatively few references to resource budgeting. However, unless the Bill makes resource budgeting feasible, the exercise will have lost half of its point. It is not clear to us that everything that needs to be done to permit resource budgeting to work properly has been done; however, I do not suggest that the opposite is so. This is a genuine area of inquiry for us, and we want to raise it as we proceed—we shall do so when we debate clause 1.
<P>
I hope that the Economic Secretary and her colleagues will treat our inquiry in the spirit in which it is intended. I believe that the Government intend to encourage resource budgeting, although questions remain about timing and implementation. We shall discuss those matters later in relation to amendments that were tabled by members of the PAC.
<P>
The desire to move towards resource budgeting is a joint endeavour. We recognise how arduous an undertaking that will be, and can dimly intimate the huge complexities that will arise when the Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence, for example, begin to undertake it. The process may involve seismic shifts in the way in which British parliamentary democracy works. We appreciate that common concerns are involved in this vastly complex matter. We do not understand exactly what the Bill will permit or whether all that needs to be done to permit resource budgeting has been done. I hope that we shall be able to discuss that rather than debate it because from that discussion may come Government amendments to facilitate resource budgeting.
<P>
Finally, I speak for all my colleagues when I say that our approach to the Bill will be neither to delay it unnecessarily, nor to hasten it unnecessarily. This is one of the least politically sexy Bills on the Government's agenda, but it is probably one of the most important. If ever a Bill deserved serious and detailed scrutiny in Committee, this is it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I join the Minister and the hon. Member for West Dorset in welcoming you to the Committee, Mr. Hood. When you saw the title of the Bill you may have thought that you had drawn the short straw, but our debate will show that it covers a crucial matter. Our constituents elected us to spend time discussing such matters.
<P>
I associate myself and my colleagues with many of the comments made by the hon. Member for West Dorset and the tone in which he made them. You will notice, Mr. Hood, that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are approaching their work without party political labels attached to their lapels. It is important to engage in genuine debate as parliamentarians because the matter before us is so important constitutionally. I am pleased that the hon. Member for West Dorset now believes that it is of true significance. Some hon. Members were surprised when I said during the debate on the Queen's Speech that the Bill was extremely important and probably one of the most important Bills of the Session. I am glad that people are beginning to realise that it is of huge significance and that it is important to get it right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hesitate to tease the hon. Gentleman, but if he reads the Hansard reference he will see that he engaged in slight hyperbole by suggesting that the Bill was one of the most important since Gladstone. I was responding to that comment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am tempted, but the hon. Gentleman should check the record.
<P>
We were reminded in our National Audit Office briefing yesterday that the House has debated Government accounts only twice in the past 150 years, when considering the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts 1866 and 1921. We should be prepared to give the Bill whatever time is required for full scrutiny and I am sure that you will assist us in that process, Mr. Hood, because it is incredibly important to get the Bill right. Those who, like me, have served on every Finance Bill Committee during this Parliament know that we spend a long time discussing proposed tax changes and that the taxation side of Government finances receives detailed scrutiny. The Committee is considering the accounting framework and it is unlikely that the House will consider the matter again for many years. It is important to spend time considering the expenditure side in the way that we consider tax legislation.
<P>
A parallel may be drawn with experience in other legislatures. The New Zealand Parliament passed the Financial Reporting Act 1993 and did so quickly. That Act encompassed the private sector as well as the public sector, but, perhaps because it was rushed through, it had to be amended no fewer than five times during the following four years. It is unlikely that the House, with its busy agenda, would be able to return to the matter so frequently. I therefore hope that the Government will realise that they should not rush the Committee's proceedings. To echo the remarks made by the hon. Member for West Dorset, I hope that the Government will seriously consider all amendments. In Committees that I have served on, Ministers have often had a completely closed mind, partly because of the party political nature of the issue concerned. I am sure that the Economic Secretary will deny that—Ministers always say that they come to Committees with an open mind. The truth, however, is that there is often no real intention of giving serious consideration to amendments. In this Committee, I hope that Ministers will attempt to do so.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset is right to suggest that there are two sides: the parliamentarians, who represent the wider people, and the civil servants, who have their own interests. The hon. Gentleman talked about how the civil servants' interests might be pursued and might relate to this issue. I do not denigrate the work done by civil servants. Anyone who has looked at the resource accounting and budgeting done in all Departments cannot but be impressed by the huge amount of work, innovation and intelligence of civil servants, who have changed the whole Whitehall accounting system. That is an incredible feat, and I pay tribute to the civil servants for it. Parliament comes in at the final stages to give that work legislative authority, and we have a different approach and set of interests. I hope that Ministers will recognise that and will understand that however hard and diligently civil servants have worked and served this House and the public, the Committee might need to push a little further to ensure that the new system is as near perfection as we can hope to achieve. If the Economic Secretary were sitting on the Opposition Benches, as she did previously—
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> indicated dissent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Economic Secretary shakes her head—she has always been on the Government Benches. I apologise, but I cannot say that I hope that that continues. If she can imagine being on these Benches, she will understand the importance that we will put on getting the system right and obtaining the correct information. The hon. Member for West Dorset was right to say that these are hardly politically sensitive issues. I can recall one report in the Financial Times on the Second Reading debate, but I do not think that it appeared in any of the tabloids. The Government will not lose political face by accepting any amendments. Their standing in the opinion polls will not be affected by being open-minded. On that basis, the Economic Secretary need not be worried that we will rush to the fax machines with press releases on significant Government U-turns, thereby damaging their electoral prospects. Millbank will not put pressure on the Economic Secretary to hold the line. That is not the political background to the Bill.
<P>
I therefore hope that the Minister will feel more confident in being open-minded about the amendments that we propose. The hon. Member for West Dorset covered many of the concerns of Liberal Democrat Members about the Bill. He spoke about the need for clear definition of accounting standards, which we will discuss under clause 5. My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) and I put our names to many of his amendments on clause 5, as we believe that there should be a cross-party approach. We do not wish to make political capital out of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset talked about the role of the NAO and the importance of retaining the rights that are perceived to be attached to it. We must not rub out those rights by mistake. For example, it is very important that the Comptroller and Auditor General has access to all accounts to which he feels he must have access.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that there will be a chance later on—when we shall make a number of points—to discuss wider aspects of holding the Government to account for finances and financial reporting. On Second Reading, I raised the need to examine the way in which the supply process works in this House before the reporting stage is reached. That may prove difficult to incorporate into the Bill, and I shall seek your advice, Mr. Hood, on the matter. I wonder whether we could persuade the Government, either at this or a later stage, to establish a statutory basis for the supply process, so that the House can contribute to the budgetary process and the decision-making process before money is spent. I hope that the Economic Secretary will reflect on the importance of that. As a parliamentarian, she surely wants this House to play a greater role in budgetary decisions that affect our country.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We would support an effort to regularise our procedures and, perhaps, a move towards line-by-line appropriation and scrutiny in the budgeting process, provided that you, Mr. Hood, find that that falls within the meaning of the long title and the conception of the Bill. I am conscious that we are entering terrain that current amendments do not cover, but we join the Liberal Democrats, and perhaps others, in asking whether such a move would be feasible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for that helpful intervention.
<P>
In concluding, I should say that I have some sympathy for the Economic Secretary. She has not held her post for long and has a very wide brief to master. Excluding the Chancellor and the current Paymaster General, there has been quite a fast turnover of Treasury Ministers, so it is difficult for them to master everything. Of course, Treasury Ministers are dependent on civil servants, who have worked on this subject for many years and know it inside out. On Second Reading, the issues of accounting standards and the need for an independent body were raised. A civil service memorandum was subsequently sent to, I believe, all members of this Committee. One could tell that it was written in a virtual panic. The issue had been raised late in the day, and civil servants wanted to explain to Committee members that the accounting standards process that underpins resource accounting budgeting was independent, and had the stamp of approval of many other bodies, including Committees of the House.
<P>
However, on reading that memorandum, I became more convinced of the arguments that we put forward on Second Reading. If the civil service and the Treasury are worried about the matter, perhaps there is a need for us to pay particular attention to it. I ask the Economic Secretary to read the memorandum, which makes frequent reference to how wonderfully independent the process has been. I ask her to question again whether that process is fully independent, and whether there is a cast iron guarantee that it will remain independent.
<P>
When the Economic Secretary's colleagues brought other legislation to this House—I am thinking in particular of legislation relating to the Bank of England—they took a different approach. They wanted to make the Monetary Policy Committee statutorily independent and they were right. Interest rate policy should be independent and be seen to be independent, and that independence should be based in legislation. Accounting standards have the same importance. We shall argue that point forcefully, and we hope that the Minister will re-examine the advice from her officials and question them as to whether we can take the final step to enshrine that independence in law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry that a little mirth was provoked on the Opposition Benches a few moments ago, but the hon. Gentleman's remarks reminded me of paragraph 15 of the memorandum to which he refers, in which the Treasury expressed itself thus:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The three board members who gave evidence to the Treasury Committee on 4 December 1997''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
members of the Financial Reporting Advisory Board—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``expressed the view that they were independent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Laughter.] I am sure that that is true, and that they are independent. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that not only their independence but whether they have the power to use that independence to set standards is at issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right, and we shall explore that point in great detail later. The question is not only the FRAB's independence but whether it will be able to direct standards of accounting. The Bill would give that power to the Treasury, while the board sits in an advisory capacity. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is a question not only of independence but of whether the board will have any power. I hope that the Minister will give that issue serious consideration.
<P>
None of us can foresee how long this Committee will sit, but I hope that the Government—and the Government Whip, in his usual friendly way—will assist hon. Members on both sides of the Committee in giving the Bill the careful scrutiny that it deserves.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I rise to endorse comments made by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
I am reminded of the importance of Back-Bench Members of Parliament in scrutinising legislation, when I read the documents before me. The right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) put it well when he said that we must scrutinise carefully the legislation in front of us. He recalled a discussion that he had with the then Chancellor of the Exchequer when he was a Minister in the Callaghan Government. He reminded the Chancellor that he was a Member of Parliament first, and a Minister second. I am a Member of Parliament who scrutinises legislation first, and, in this Committee, a party politician second. In that sense, I strongly echo the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset and the hon. Members for Kingston and Surbiton and for Newbury, who are not so much the quasi-Opposition as the continuity Opposition or the provisional wing of the Opposition. Whatever kind of Opposition they are, they will join Conservative Members and, I hope, Labour Members, in examining the amendments tabled on their merits.
<P>
We should remind ourselves that this is not primarily a technical Bill, although it is to a degree. It is a constitutional Bill—a Bill with radical constitutional implications—and all parliamentarians who have read it have major concerns about it. Throughout the Bill there are proposals that will undermine the accountability of the Executive to the House. They will do that, no doubt more by accident than design, by undermining the ability of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff at the NAO to audit, without fear or favour, the accounts of departmental and non-departmental public bodies.
<P>
I am concerned about the fact that it will be up to the Treasury to decide precisely when a system of resource accounting is fit to be up and running and activated before cash accounting is finally dispensed with. The Bill compromises the rights to audit that the Comptroller and Auditor General currently enjoys across a whole swath of Departments. Furthermore, huge areas of the public sector—including pension liabilities, Partnerships UK and other big ticket items in the national accounts—are not covered at all by the Bill.
<P>
It behoves Members of the Committee to examine the absence of independent accounting standards. The Comptroller and Auditor General will have to come to conclusions on the basis of a true and fair view without such standards being in place. Conservative Members want to see a regulatory and proprietary basis for the regime that is going to be introduced under resource accounting and budgeting.
<P>
Conservative Members will behave in a scrupulously cross-party fashion. I am pleased and relieved to see several eminent right hon. and hon. Members on the Government and Opposition Benches who also sit with great distinction on the Public Accounts Committee. They have tabled several technical amendments, which I confess that I do not yet fully understand. I will do my best to grapple with them.
<P>
As Conservative Members said on Second Reading, and have restated during today's proceedings, we want the Bill to progress on to the statute book in a state that does not compromise the ability of the Comptroller and Auditor General to stand in our shoes when he audits public accounts—because we, ultimately, stand in the shoes of our taxpaying constituents.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, Opposition Members will table amendments in a reasonable spirit. Right hon. and hon. Members on the Treasury Bench, in its new and old incarnations, have always been well-behaved, reasonable and jovial. It has been a delight, almost without exception, to debate with them in many Standing Committees which have considered Treasury Bills, and I hope that that good-natured spirit will continue. However, I hope that Ministers will accept more amendments than has been the case in previous Committees, because the amendments to the Bill are among the most important that have been tabled to a Treasury Bill since the general election.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Davis </B>(Haltemprice and Howden): It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. Hood. It has been our joint fate over the years for me to speak, in various capacities, in Committees that you chair. That has always been a pleasure for me, if not so much for you. I shall do my best to make it so during the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
Several members of the Committee have commented on the fact that I am here in the capacity of Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. As such, I am broadly supportive of the thrust of the Bill, and want to see it make good progress on to the statute book. However, all members of the PAC who are serving on the Committee are concerned about some aspects of the Bill. The PAC has long had an interest in the rights of Parliament. In the previous Parliament, the PAC produced a couple of reports, proposed changes relating to matters that should have been dealt with and suggested that the Procedure Select Committee should become involved—it did so in relation to a report last year. Those issues are raised because the Bill goes to the heart of Parliament's constitutional role in the provision of supply to the Government. I am concerned about the preservation of that role.
<P>
All of the amendments that appear in my name also appear in the names of the right hon. Member for Swansea, West and the hon. Member for Newbury, both of whom are members of the PAC. Those amendments have cross-party support and are intended solely to preserve and, where possible, to enhance Parliament's role in the process of budgeting and to maintain the Government's accountability.
<P>
Unusually, the sittings motion raises serious timing issues that may affect the quality of our discussions. I believe that the Government want the Bill to reach the statute book by Easter, primarily because they want Partnerships UK to be in place sufficiently early for the private finance initiative to be accelerated. I have no objection to that. That presumably explains why—unusually—a motion was introduced before Christmas on the Floor of the House to allow the Committee to sit this afternoon.
<P>
I do not object to the Government's approach and I accept that making rapid progress with the Bill and with the orderly pursuit of resource accounting may have some benefits. However, that does not mean that we should consider matters in an irrational order. I should be happy to expedite the Bill's progress so long as doing so does not undermine our decisions.
<P>
Several Committee members have said that this is a serious Bill that raises constitutional issues. The PAC report states that it goes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the heart of Parliament's role in holding government to account.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have used the innovation of a special stage with some constitutional Bills, in particular the Freedom of Information Bill, but they did not do so with this Bill, although it is a constitutional Bill. It would have been appropriate to do so because it involves significant specialist input. It is unfortunate that that approach was not used. Moreover, the Government's original promise to consult with the PAC about the draft Bill was not met. I do not fault the Government for that—it resulted from pressure on parliamentary draftsmen, which made it impossible for the PAC to see the draft sufficiently early in the drafting process.
<P>
That combination of circumstances meant that after the Chief Secretary to the Treasury heard, on Second Reading, the concerns of current and previous members of the PAC, he undertook—he volunteered—to appear before the PAC to discuss its concerns about the Bill. That may be a unique occurrence—Ministers do not normally appear before it. The first date on which it was possible to do that is tomorrow, but that introduces a serious problem. The selection list quickly comes to the PAC amendments to which I referred earlier. The first group of amendments—amendments Nos. 21 to 23—relate to clause 4. However, they are relatively technical and involve matters that I do not expect will be altered by the appearance of the Chief Secretary of the Treasury before the PAC tomorrow. However, all of our subsequent amendments are significant, potentially controversial and could be influenced by the views of the right hon. Gentleman. I hope that the Treasury's views will be influenced by the Chief Secretary's appearance before the PAC tomorrow.
<P>
I am concerned that the sittings motion will allow us to enter into a mode that the Americans call, ``Load, Fire, Aim.'' That involves acting before one has made a proper decision. I should be happy to give way to the Economic Secretary or to the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), who is a Whip, if either of them wishes to intervene. I am concerned that once the Committee has considered amendment No. 3 and those amendments that are grouped with it, it should not consider any subsequent amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): It is unusual for a Whip to speak in Committee, but my comments concern the business of the Committee. It may benefit the Committee if I make a brief contribution.
<P>
We want to proceed with the consent of all parties. I have discussed with the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and the senior Labour Member on the Committee how we might progress on this matter. We do not intend to rush through consideration of the Bill. When we discussed the matter before the Committee met this morning, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee made it clear that he would be happy if we could reach amendment No. 7 before dealing with those heavy amendments that he will discuss with the Chief Secretary in the Public Accounts Committee tomorrow. I am happy with that, and, were we to reach and dispose of amendment No. 7, the Government would be happy to draw stumps on the Committee's proceedings today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I thank the Whip for that intervention. I hope that it sets a constructive tone for the whole Committee. I reiterate that the interests of the PAC are not at odds with those of the Government. We both have a common interest in the effectiveness of such an important Bill, which should enable Parliament to have a proper grip on Government accountability. The Bill could have enormous advantages for the modernisation of government—to use the Government's favourite term. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton would not have been entirely wrong if he had said that this was one of the most important financial reforms since Gladstone. One element of the reforms—which is not addressed to any great extent, if at all, in the Bill—concerns the outcome and output aspect of the measurement of government. That offers the possibility of massive improvements in the performance of Whitehall and the Government. All parties in this House would support that, and I shall do all that I can to promote it in Committee and subsequently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Williams:</B> I should like to thank the Whip for two reasons: first, for the helpful announcement that he has just made; and, secondly, for his unequivocal agreement to my request to remove a member of the Committee—who was not specified—to make a place available for me. I can therefore emphasise to the Committee that Public Accounts Committee amendments stand in the names of all its members, whether Labour or Opposition Members. They also stand in the names of all members of this Committee, and constitute a protection, especially for Opposition Members, against Executive domination. I would not have asked to serve on this Committee if I did not think that such matters, which would not otherwise have been discussed, were of profound importance.
<P>
Unusually, the amendments also appear in the name of the Chairman of the Public Accounts Commission, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne, who, for many years, was the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. That should underline to Ministers and Labour Members who have become accustomed to the confrontational nature of Committees—which is an inevitable feature of the way in which the House works—the nature of the flagged-up amendments. I am grateful to the hon. Member for West Dorset for not adding his name to them, as we did not want to suggest that they were party political. They are serious amendments, and members of the Committee should make decisions on behalf of all Back Benchers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I also welcome you, Mr. Hood, as Chairman of this Committee. In the major affairs of state, proper accountability to Parliament and independent auditing standards are crucial. Clauses 15, 16 and 17 have been squeezed out and cover a different and specific matter: the enabling machinery and financing for the establishment of Partnerships UK. We shall table amendments to those clauses, but I want to make some points up front.
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Conservative party is a great supporter of the PFI. We are delighted with the success that the Government have made of it. The Treasury task force has been very successful in increasing the number of PFI projects. It has played a valuable role in the crucial task of liaising with projects, the Departments involved and the marketplace, and puts up the subcontract tenders for PFI projects and the financing tenders.
<P>
The Government have described the establishment of Partnerships UK as a transfer of the Treasury task force to a separate and permanent base, the argument being that it would be difficult to retain its employment on a temporary basis in the Treasury. We have some doubts about how that concept will work, but we support it in principle. It would be wrong if the new Partnerships UK competed with the private sector in both the provision of finance and the management of PFI projects. That would give a majority private sector-owned body privileged access to public sector business, and none of us wants that. When we come to clauses 15, 16 and 17, we shall try to limit the total amount of money that the Government may pump in through the new body. Hon. Members may have noted that its activities were intended to be outside as well as inside the United Kingdom, and we shall try to confine its activities to those which the Government have planned for it. The Bill would allow Partnerships UK to become the financier and manager of PFI projects. The Government made it clear in earlier debates that that is not their intention, and we do not want that to occur.
<P>
I had not intended to speak today, but it seemed appropriate to focus on that part of the Bill, which is separate from much heavier and weightier matters of state.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I should like to make a few brief comments, not least because this is the first time that I have had the pleasure of being a member of a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I welcome you to the Committee, Having seen the Amendment Paper and that my name is attached to 64 of the 87 amendments and two of the four new clauses, you may be tempted to think that I intend to be a troublemaker and to cause the Committee difficulty. I assure you that that is not so. I am well known as a constructive member of all Committees, and intend to be so in this Standing Committee.
<P>
The Bill is valuable and makes many important changes to the way in which the Government handle their accounts. It is high time that central Government caught up with what has been happening for years in local government, which has a proper system of accounting. None the less, many changes need to be made and I have put my name to some amendments.
<P>
I want to comment on the amendments tabled on behalf of the Public Accounts Committee. It is all too easy for the Government to think that the PAC is a problem because its purpose is to monitor how the Government are spending money and to consider whether corrections are needed. Nevertheless, such a monitoring body can prove extremely helpful to the Government. The Government should not be frightened of a body such as the PAC: it would be far worse if something went wrong, and was allowed to continue to go wrong, with the way in which the Government handle money. I hope that the Economic Secretary and her colleagues will recognise that, although the PAC may occasionally cause some short-term embarrassment to the Government, its work is immensely valuable to any Government in the longer term. The strength of the PAC and, in particular, the National Audit Office's ability to look at all matters pertaining to Government accounts are important not only to Members of Parliament—who, so far, have been discussed largely in relation to the amendments—but to the Government. Such strengths may save them from errors that they might otherwise make. That must surely benefit the Government and, indeed, the Economic Secretary.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am sorry that I sound rather croaky: I am recovering from a cold, and I hope that I am not about to catch flu from the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden.
<P>
I welcome all the comments that have been made this morning, particularly the Committee's reiterated support for resource accounting and budgeting, which, together with Partnerships UK, is the principal reason why we are debating the Bill. I welcome the expertise on both sides of the Committee, which will be available to us during all our sittings. I also welcome the suggestion that the matter is not party political. We shall look for evidence of that in people's thoughts on, and responses to, the Government's efforts, as well as in our own responses to proposals. I hope that we can be positive about such proposals on a number of fronts. Not all Committee members who raised issues this morning will be satisfied with our responses, but I hope that we can have a productive discussion none the less.
<P>
I should reiterate that the Bill deals with resource accounting and budgeting. On occasion, each of us is tempted to think that a Bill can be made to do anything that we want it to do, but I am sure that Committee members will not stray down that path. Of the many issues that have been raised this morning, that of National Audit Office access will generate considerable discussion. However, I was pleased to discover that all Committee members welcome the broad thrust of the Bill.
<P>
It may prove worthwhile for me to run through what the Government see as the Bill's advantages and the possible achievements to which this process will lead. The central advantages will include a more strategic approach. As Opposition Members, particularly the hon. Member for West Dorset, noted, the Bill constitutes a modernising that should have taken place many moons ago. Only lately are we following in the footsteps of good private sector accounting procedures. The Bill will provide a better basis for resource allocation and lead to improved management of the economy, which is central.
<P>
At departmental level, there should be better management information and resource allocation and, of course, better capital management through changes to the way in which we view capital. The linking of resources to objectives must be right, because it will make managers more financially aware in the way that they regard their management decisions at departmental level.
<P>
I should not conclude without referring to Parliament, especially given the comments that were made by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden and my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West. Resource accounting and budgeting will provide stronger information with a clearer focus on the use of resources to achieve objectives. That will act as a springboard for a much stronger focus on information to Parliament and accountability to Parliament when the process is fully developed.
<P>
I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Whip about our willingness to have a good debate about the matter. We are not seeking to make progress in anything other than the most reasonable manner, so as to allow for proper discussion of the relevant issues. As a politician, I am a little concerned by some hon. Members' paranoia about the role of mandarins and the siren voices that they appear to hear. While I accept the existence of distinctions between politicians and civil servants, I believe that members of the Committee are here to try to make a better Bill. In a sense, I am here neither as a Minister nor as a Member of Parliament, but to get the best feel for the public interest and to act on their behalf. Therefore, I shall not side with any of the various distinctions that hon. Members have offered me, but merely say that we are in Committee to do the best possible job. Given hon. Members' earlier comments, I am sure that that is what we will do in the course of subsequent sittings.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Government Resources and Accounts Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at five minutes to Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> There is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I remind hon. Members that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Application of sums issued</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 10, leave out `the service of'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 2, in Clause 2, page 1, line 16, leave out `the service of'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Before I embark on my comments about the amendments, I reiterate the declaration that I made on Second Reading of an interest in relation to clauses 15, 16 and 17. I shall not be speaking about those clauses, but my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs will do so. Although what he will be saying directly conflicts with my interests, my position should be taken to be genuinely neutral.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 fall exactly into the class that I described in my opening remarks as probing amendments. While I have no great anxiety to see the changes that they propose being made to the Bill, I want to know exactly what the Government intend by the clause, and should like the Economic Secretary to clarify, if possible, the system that is to be employed. That information will be of the utmost importance in helping us to decide whether we need to table amendments or new clauses at a later stage in the Committee's deliberations.
<P>
There is a helpful explanatory note to clause 1. Having said what I did about the 500,000-odd civil servants, I should say that an admirable job has been done in preparing the explanatory notes, which is not always the case. We are very grateful for that. In paragraphs 5, 6 and 7, the fundamental explanation given on clause 1 is that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``maintains the principle of annuality.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the purpose of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall be applied towards the service of that year''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in line 10 of clause 1. That is a strange and arcane phrase. I note with some amusement the inevitable description in the explanatory notes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Subsections (1) and (2) modernise the provisions of section 2(1) of the Public Accounts and Charges Act 1891''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If I were to walk out into the street and ask someone what was meant by applying something towards the service of a year, I doubt that they would regard it as a modern way of speaking. Nor would they be able to give the slightest indication of what it meant. However, I understand that the wording has some legal significance. The question is what legal significance and how it relates to resource budgeting.
<P>
Before I embark on that question, I also note that if the clause does maintain strictly the principle of annuality, it conflicts with statements made earlier in the tenure of the Government. For example, in European Standing Committee B, the then Economic Secretary to the Treasury stated that the Government would reconsider the general application of the rule of annuality. That rule is obviously a difficult issue. On the one side, it protects parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary sovereignty, as the explanatory notes suggest. It prevents people in the public service from accumulating huge cash balances and then circumventing parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
On the other side, the rule also causes gross irrationalities. We are all aware of the scramble at year end to spend unspent cash balances, frequently on unnecessary or even counterproductive activities, to use up the money in order not to be docked the following year. That is a common bureaucratic phenomenon in every country in which I have worked, in industry or public service. People with a certain amount of money to spend do not want to see it unspent at the end of a year, because they can be sure that someone in the finance ministry or treasury will say that they do not need the same amount the following year. In some cases that leads to gross irrationalities.
<P>
There are examples in our museums and universities of such cases. Projects that could have been properly undertaken across a number of years were not undertaken or were undertaken in the wrong spirit because of the annuality rule. There is a problem with annuality, and I thought that the Treasury was looking seriously at that under the present Administration. That appears not to be the case, which is a pity. However, let us accept for the moment that that is its intention.
<P>
I shall now ask a precise question. How does this issue relate to resource accounting? What is the year in question, from the point of view of resource accounting? How will the system operate? My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden—the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee—and others present who are members of the PAC will have more experience than me of the budgeting process. They may be able to inform us on the subject at least as much as the Minister and her phalanx of unseen officials.
<P>
I am in a state of genuine perplexity. As I understand it, one of the underlying principles of resource accounting is that we shall move from a system of cash to a system of accruals, so that expenditure is expenditure incurred rather than expenditure made in the year, for the purpose of resource accounting. None of us has the slightest quibble with that. If expenditure is incurred in a particular year, in the sense that the Department of State makes a contractual promise to an outside body to spend money in a certain way, will that item satisfy the rules laid out in clauses 1 and 2 on the incurring of expenditure? I am not sure how the phrase in clause 1:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall be applied towards the service of that year''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
makes that clear. If it does, will the Economic Secretary clarify how it does? Furthermore, if, in a particular year, the money was not spent but incurred, would it be covered by the phrase? That is important; we do not want a Bill that, due to some lacuna, disestablishes that which it is trying to establish by forcing cash expenditure. I do not doubt that a good answer exists to that, but no ordinary human being—not even an ordinary lawyer not versed in this particular part of the law—could conceivably understand how the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall be applied towards the service of that year''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
permits the incurring of expenditure even where there is no cash expenditure.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary explain a vastly more important matter than mere phrasing? How will the budgeting process under resource accounting work? What exactly will be allocated? Opposition Members have spent some time trying to understand that, not from the Resource Accounting Manual, and still less from the ``National Asset Register'', which are broadly silent on the matter, but from helpful briefings that we have received from, for example, the National Audit Office and outside accounting firms. However, I am still perplexed. I might be wrong, but I suspect that other Committee members, from all parties, are similarly unclear about how the process will work. The Committee should be given a clear exposition of how it will work, so that we can ensure, as we discuss the other clauses, that our contributions are keyed in the right way.
<P>
I shall briefly explain why I am confused, which is always difficult, as one may be so confused that one does not know the cause of one's own confusion. However, I think that I have correctly identified the symptoms of my disease. In the old days, the item that was being authorised was clear—cash. That was the sole virtue of the system, and, presumably, the reason why it lasted so long despite its irrationality. We all know what cash is. Parliament knew what cash was, and I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden, his colleagues and predecessors knew what it was. Therefore, when Parliament authorised the expenditure of cash in a year, it knew what it was doing. In the brave new world, two things will happen. First, the incurring of liabilities to spend, or contractual obligations to spend, will be authorised. I have no problem with that; industry has dealt with that for a very long time. Secondly, Departments and departmental budgets will be thought of no longer in terms of the spending of cash—whether now or in the future, because of contractual liability—but in terms of the resources that they will use up in the year. For example—here begins my perplexity—there will be an allocation of depreciations. Somehow or other, the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall be applied towards the service of that year''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will mean, or will be intended to mean, that Parliament, through the PAC and other forms of activity, will authorise Departments to use up a certain proportion of their resources as depreciation in the year in question. I have to admit that I do not yet understand how that will be done or what would be used to measure whether it had been done.
<P>
I want to return to the question of definitions and to provide a suitable prelude to our discussion of clause 5. There are currently many definitions of depreciation: different Departments support different propositions about depreciation rates for identical or highly similar items. For example, if a Department that had a previous straight line depreciation principle of five years for a particular item changed to a declining balance of seven years, would Parliament have authorised the right amount in advance? How would Parliament know whether that had been done? Although that Department's volume of activity would not have changed one iota, the amount that was registered as the use of resources for the year in question could have altered significantly. Such changes are small when considered alone, but cumulatively they could be large. If a large spending Ministry with large fiscal assets, such as the Ministry of Defence, or the national health service, changed its principle of depreciation, the difference could be as much as £1 billion.
<P>
I have to admit that I do not understand the situation, although I harbour what I hope is not the naïve belief that members of the PAC understand it. I do not understand how control will be exercised in the absence of a standard-setting body that is outside the Treasury and answerable to Parliament.
<P>
I am genuinely perplexed about the question of liabilities, to which I referred on Second Reading, and which my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) raised earlier. Clause 1(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``every sum issued in pursuance of the Act shall be applied towards the service of that year.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden was absolutely right to suggest that the essence of democratic control involves the control of money. In the end, all that we do in Parliament is, alas, a row of beans if the control of money passes elsewhere. I believe that the Supreme Soviet retained virtually complete control of primary legislation throughout its life, although it never controlled any aspect of government activity because money was controlled by the politburo. We must avoid that situation and ensure that Parliament retains control of money.
<P>
One problem that we have suffered for a long time—it is not the Government's, or the Economic Secretary's, fault—involves the fact that when liabilities were piled up, authorisation in the ordinary way was not available because the liabilities were not cash items in the year in question. The phrase in the Bill ``service of that year'' keeps ringing in our ears.
<P>
I may be wrong, but I do not suppose that my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden or any previous Chairman of the PAC considered whether the Beveridge proposals, which were universally welcomed, would lead to a massive set of implicit liabilities—perhaps the largest liabilities that the nation has—in relation to existing and forthcoming pensioners. I doubt whether such proposals were ever approved, although I expect that year-by-year spending of cash on patients was approved.
<P>
We shall move to resource budgeting and resource accounting, and from the expenditure of cash to the incurring of that expenditure. If someone is promised a pension for January that is paid in December—or perhaps I should suggest a pension that is promised for April but which is authorised in March—the payment would count in the correct year rather than in the wrong year. What is the status of the implicit guarantee that the pensioner will receive a pension for many years? An enormous part of the purpose of accounting in the private sector is to enable managers, the board and shareholders to understand why such contingent and actual liabilities are piling up over long periods. When it comes to budgeting, they look at their balance sheet. The proposition covering balance sheets for Government accounts omits any mention of the enormous, gargantuan liabilities, so large that they dwarf all but those of the world's largest firms.
<P>
What is the meaning of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall be applied towards the service of that year''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in clause 1(1)(b)? In the new and braver world of resource budgeting, how will Parliament gain some control over the incurring of liabilities, at least to the point of authorising them? It is fundamental that, if we fail to achieve that effect in clauses 1 and 2, the Bill will not be as good as it should be.
<P>
I shall be grateful if the Economic Secretary will explain how the resource budgeting process will operate under clauses 1 and 2. What will be done about annuality and why has it been decided to preserve it intact? How will Parliament authorise, and know that it has properly authorised, the using up of resources in depreciation, given the absence of an independent and answerable standard-setting body for depreciation? How will Parliament deal with the liabilities that Government pile up through policy-making and implicit, but not statutorily enforceable or legally enforceable, contracts with the citizen? How will Parliament monitor those huge liabilities and authorise them?
<P>
If the Economic Secretary can give a clear explanation, we shall have fulfilled our purpose in tabling this probing amendment. If it emerges that those procedures have not been fully thought through, we must ask whether the remedy is administrative or statutory. If it is statutory, we may wish to table amendments to remedy that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not mind my interrupting an interesting and thoughtful speech. He referred to the possible need to revisit the clause and the proposals on supply. During our debate on the sittings motion, I referred to the possible solution of a statutory basis for supply. Has he considered that possibility? We could have different types of appropriation and votes for different types of expenditure, and appropriation related solely to capital expenditure. That approach, if set out in detail in the Bill, might deal with some of the problems that he has outlined and ensure that confusion is ended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that material question. Paragraph 5 of the explanatory notes is illuminating. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The system of supply is largely non-statutory and it is not intended to change this.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That left me with a doubt that I was unable to resolve after an amateur and brief investigation. I could not find any statute governing the system of supply, but I may be mistaken. It is clear that there is no intention to change that.
<P>
I am as conscious as any member of the Committee of the great merit of doing things as they have been done if that has worked. I hope that Labour Members will forgive me for making a mild party political point, but I do not share the current regime's huge enthusiasm for change for change's sake, and for modernisation in all domains. My position is far from that—if there is a working supply system, which is good at grappling with events, and is non-statutory, that is fine. I fear, however, that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton might be right, especially given the greater and greater concentration of power in the Executive over the past half century. Given the growing and dizzying complexity of government, I wonder whether any Members of Parliament—even our most distinguished and expert representatives on the PAC, who receive a great deal of technical help—are in a good enough position to be sure that the current supply system works properly.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, as I dimly understand it, a small but rather powerful grenade—in the form of resource accounting and, perhaps, resource budgeting, about which I am still somewhat mystified—has been lobbed into the gentle fabric of understandings and conventions. That fabric had evolved over centuries—Gladstone merely addressed something that had been happening since Magna Carta, the two great purposes of which were to make the king judge in his own court, and to ensure that some degree of control over the money supply was exerted by those who were not the Executive. Parliament has been involved ever since. When something that has evolved so delicately over such a long period is subject to a completely new set of principles, the question must be asked whether the old system of convention will survive. As I admitted, I do not think that I know the answer. In response to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton I would say that if the Economic Secretary can set out a clearly articulated set of processes, conceived by the Government and discussed with the PAC, and if she can explain to the Committee how they will work—perhaps also in written form later—I shall be the last person to try to impose, as a matter of principle, a set of statutory constraints. I fear that that is not the case, however, and that this will be our opportunity to put in order the method by which Parliament votes money. If not, we will end up with a mess, and the Government, still less Parliament and the people whom it represents, will not profit. I suspect that that will be an arduous undertaking; I do not know what the end point is, or how the evolution of the Bill fits in. We might not be able to achieve everything that we want at the speed at which we are now moving. However, I hope that some progress will be made.
<P>
My time in Parliament—a little more than two years—has convinced me that in the United Kingdom we are much less well served, and have been for a long time, than the citizens of the United States by the process of parliamentary scrutiny of supply. That deficiency is not brought about by the Bill; it is a deficiency in the Dicey infusion from which the UK benefits or suffers, according to taste. It has been better handled under the separation of powers, and Parliament has shortcomings in that respect. The background to my views on that is the same as that of the hon. Gentleman. I start with the presumption that, whether or not we do so through the Bill, we will move towards closer parliamentary control and more open scrutiny of line by line spending.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying his position. Like him, I hope that the Economic Secretary will give a full and clear explanation of how we will retain the principle of annuality, move to resource accounting, and deal with complex issues, such as depreciation, which are attached to accruals accounting. Even if she can do that, I hope that she will consider putting the supply process on a statutory basis because of the point that the hon. Gentleman has just made—that the House does not perform its duties well in scrutinising the way in which public money is spent. Scrutiny always takes place after money been spent rather than before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will gather, I am sympathetic to that view. There are two drawbacks to the ex post, rather than ex ante, review. First, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden and other members of the PAC will forgive me for saying that it inevitably tempts them into being unnecessarily critical after the fact, because they act as spotters of trains that have gone wrong. It is much easier to have a rational debate about a particular line of spending before the money has been spent. If the debate takes place afterwards, it can resemble a pack of detectives desperately looking for where the bodies are buried and the identities of the villains. An adverse effect of being exclusively ex post is that an unnecessary and undesirable antagonism may develop between Permanent Secretaries and the PAC.
<P>
Secondly, during my experience of working at the heart of government—admittedly as an adviser, not a Minister—no member of the Cabinet, nor his senior officials, had the slightest idea of how much he was spending or what he was spending it on. Of course, many Ministers knew about one small part of what they were spending and, somewhere, a principal or assistant secretary knew in awesome detail what was being spent. However, at the higher reaches of government there was no real understanding of the amounts of cash that were being spent—let alone of the depreciation or liabilities involved.
<P>
If one were to ask the Secretary of State for Defence, or any of his recent predecessors, what he actually spends his Department's money on, he would perhaps be able to mention one or two very large ticket items but of the rest he would be largely ignorant. That is partly because no such person is forced to come and explain each item in advance, as is the case in the United States Administration. That is a very instructive process. Perhaps the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton shares my experience of sitting and watching it happen. Very senior people have to defend every item of expenditure down to a minute level of detail. Not only are items defended—many times, alas, when they should not be—but, crucially, the people responsible know what they are spending. They come out of the experience as better men and women.
<P>
I share the hon. Gentleman's view that we should be moving in that direction, but I am not sure whether the Bill will enable that. Clauses 1 and 2 certainly do nothing of the kind. Can the Economic Secretary explain whether there lies, between the gaping holes that are left by clauses 1 and 2 and the ideal scenario of the United States' magnificent mechanisms for controlling line by line expenditure ex ante, a clear conception of administrative practice under resource accounting that will at least ensure that that the position is no worse than it is at present? If we cannot be assured of that, a statutory mechanism must be put in place to enable it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Davis:</B> I should like to respond to a couple of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset has raised. Some of the technical matters relating to depreciation will dissolve if some of the later amendments are accepted. His and the Liberals' amendments on external accounting standards would render it much less important, and the PAC amendment relating to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a true and fair view''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would have a significant effect in reducing its impact. The subject of cash controls will arise again as an important component of later discussions about the precise form of resource accounts and associated budgets, and need not concern us too much in relation to clause 1.
<P>
The issue of contingent liability is pertinent and one of the great gains that will come from resource accounting. The fact that we must address the issue and measure it is an inescapable consequence of the road that we are going down. My hon. Friend's fingers are crossed, but, if we do our job as parliamentarians, that will be an inescapable consequence.
<P>
You looked a little fidgety, Mr. Hood, when my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset referred to supply, so I shall not go too far into that, save to say that the current organisation of supply in the House is a disgrace. There is no other word for it. It is an obsolete disgrace; it has come into disuse. Rather than test your patience, Mr. Hood, I recommend that you read my evidence to the Procedure Committee 18 months ago or the Procedure Committee's findings, which are very informative and which I support wholeheartedly.
<P>
The inclusion of the words ``the service of'' is important. They mirror the terminology of the annual Appropriation Acts. Parliament votes money for specific services outlined in the Appropriation Act. Authority is provided for money—both parliamentary grant and Departments' own generated income—for those services and only for those services. Removal of those words would reduce parliamentary control. I am glad that these are probing amendments, because I would have to vote against amendment No. 1.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> First, perhaps I should ensure that the Committee is aware that clause 1 relates only to cash expenditure and that there is no confusion about that. We sought the advice of the House authorities and were told that a similar clause was not required for resources in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have only just started, but I shall give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for giving way, because it is better to deal with points as they arise in this complex matter. She said that clause 1 relates only to cash expenditure. If she is about to explain, I shall rest content, but how can the annuality limit apply to cash expenditure if we are moving to an accruals basis? I do not understand how the two match.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> There will be a resource decision and a cash decision in respect of any departmental expenditure. What we envisage in the clause relates to the departmental expenditure limit and not to the annually managed expenditure. The clause relates to the financial year ending 31 March. Parliament votes supply annually, as the hon. Gentleman knows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Let me make sure that I have understood the hon. Lady's statement because it will remedy any ignorance on our part. Is she saying that she envisages approval for incurring the expenditure during the year of a resource decision and, separately and on top of that, a departmental limit on cash spending during the year?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, I confirm that. I hope that that is helpful to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I noticed your twitchiness, Mr. Hood, as did the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, when the question of whether supply was statutorily based was raised——
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I would like to make some progress before the hon. Gentleman intervenes.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Dorset said, the supply system is largely non-statutory. There is no need to change it under resource accounting and budgeting, and we do not intend to do so. We must remember that the purpose of the Bill is to introduce resource accounting and budgeting, and we do not seek in any way to change the long-standing constitutional procedure by setting up a comprehensive legal framework for supply. In any event, that would be a very different task from that with which the Bill confronts us.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government do not believe that the amendments are necessary, so I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for West Dorset say that they are probing amendments that will not be pressed to a vote. We do not propose to use the introduction of resource accounting and budgeting to change any long-established procedures. In the few cases where mention is made in legislation of the supply system, we are proposing the minimum necessary changes. We want to retain the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the service of the year'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden has also endorsed. That phrase is of long standing and has a generally accepted meaning that the amendment would disrupt. The amendment would bring a lack of clarity to the requirement that money or appropriations in aid that are voted in a particular year by Parliament be used only for purposes—``the service''—authorised for that year. In making progress, we do not want to break with current arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I accept what the Economic Secretary is saying about the amendment, but I would like clarification of her previous answer. Clause 1(1) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a Consolidated Fund Act or Appropriation Act''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does she envisage that an Appropriation Act will, as it were, come in two parts that will appropriate the resource and appropriate the cash? As a matter of parliamentary procedure, how will Parliament be informed about the relationship between those two parts?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I see the matter exactly as the hon. Gentleman has outlined it, and I shall return to the question of the relationship between the two parts in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of spending patterns in the financial year—a subject with which we are all familiar through various aspects of the private and public sector. Under existing cash arrangements, and under resource accounting and budgeting, we intend that, subject to parliamentary approval, there will be unlimited end-of-year flexibility in respect of departmental expenditure limits, given that there is, as it were, a three-year fixed programme. One hopes that that will override the need for irrational spending decisions at the year end.
<P>
In practice, some of the pressures will be removed for at least a couple of years of the rolling programme. My understanding is that Departments will be able to move unspent money without affecting or reducing the following year's expenditure. Money that is currently proposed for departmental expenditure limits for the year in question will not be affected. The provision will at least minimise the possibility of people being encouraged to spend more rapidly as the financial year draws to a close—an effect that the hon. Member for West Dorset finds unattractive, as we all do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. I want to make sure that I have understood the Economic Secretary correctly. Is she saying that, as a matter of Government practice, there will be unlimited end-year flexibility under the three-year rolling programme and that, as a matter of parliamentary practice, the Government will use their majority to ensure approval on an annual basis of the amounts that emerge as a result?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is helpful. I thank the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I confirm that the answer to both those questions is yes.
<P>
I return to the question of the resource allocation and the cash allocation. The main vote is taken on a resource basis, but there will be a reconciliation on the face of the estimate between the resources and the cash, to bring the two things together. The hon. Member for West Dorset asked how the system would work. It would work by reconciling those two sets of calculations on the face of the estimate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry to intervene again, but it is important that we understand these matters so that we do not make mistakes later.
<P>
I understand that someone could provide a mechanical reconciliation, but can the Minister explain what would happen in the following circumstances? If, in a particular year, a request for resources were approved for a particular Department at a given level, and the consequence of that incurring of expenditure was the expenditure of a large amount of cash the following year, would the cash limit for the Department in that following year incorporate both the effects of the previously incurred expenditure and the anticipated effects of the in-year incurred expenditure?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, I am saying that. The hon. Gentleman raised a number of other points, and I shall address two specific areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way before she moves on to other points.
<P>
We have just debated how the Government expect the estimate and supply procedure to work, and how they are having to change the law to enable that to work on a statutory basis. The Minister suggests that clause 1 will ensure that the voted cash requirement is corrected for the changes that we are debating. Will she explain why the request for the resource side of the estimate will not have to be enshrined on a statutory basis in the same way that the cash supply will be?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am afraid that I cannot do so at the moment. I shall be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman on the matter, but we were advised by the House authorities that it was unnecessary to put that into the Bill. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman why that decision was reached
<P>
On the comments made by the hon. Member for West Dorset on budgeting, we are satisfied that resource budgeting will work. Under that system, Parliament will authorise the use of resources. That will, therefore, include an allocation in monetary terms for items such as depreciation. Additionally, Parliament will continue to vote the cash. We believe that that system will work smoothly.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned liabilities such as pensions, and asked whether there might be problems with those. Liabilities of whatever kind will be included on either the departmental balance sheet or the whole of Government accounts balance sheet, and will be determined by the appropriate accounting standard. I believe that that is financial reporting standard No. 12. Liabilities will find their way on to the balance sheet in the normal course of events, as we would expect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If I have understood the Economic Secretary's comments, Members of Parliament will continue to approve cash. Basically, that system will operate in the same way in which the corner shop operates. The Government will spend so much cash—capital or income—and provide a complicated reconciliation, which will relate the good old-fashioned, simple cash approval to a set of national accounts that are produced on a resource basis. That may be the only starting point from our current position, but should not the long-term intent be that Parliament should approve a set of national accounts that are based on accounting principles and which will eventually substitute for the old-fashioned approach, which involves approving cash along the lines that small shops use?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that we are moving towards resource accounting and budgeting, which involves moving away from cash-based accounting. On budgets that come before the House for approval, there will be a resource basis for a main vote and, at the same time and in parallel, a cash equivalent. Our proposal is that those two accounting bases will be reconciled in the estimate. This is not a transitional proposal and it will not be included in the transitional arrangements for resource accounting and budgeting. However, there are reasons, involving departmental and governmental accounting practices, for having a cash basis and a proper resource accounting basis, although the latter approach is clearly the basis on which decisions will be made and which will bring about the improvements that we mutually support.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds has handed me a document that clarifies the situation. Perhaps I should have understood the Economic Secretary's suggestions earlier. However, had I done so, my perplexity would have been greater.
<P>
The Economic Secretary has not begun to explain how the system will work. Her comments suggest that the lesser of the two limits will bite—there would otherwise be precious little point in having two limits. If the consequences of resource approval—the incurring of expenditure in a particular year, and the cash effects of the incurring of expenditure in previous years—are that the cash exceeds or would exceed the limits of the cash approval from Parliament, the cash approval limit will bite and the resource approval limit will be nullified. If the cash approval limit permitted a greater incurring of expenditure than was permitted by the resource approval limit, presumably the resource approval limit would bite.
<P>
The Economic Secretary may have a better understanding than I do of the way in which those two approaches will operate in relation to a dizzying number of votes, but I doubt whether many of my parliamentary colleagues, including my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, who is one of the most distinguished financiers in Britain, will understand what has been approved. I beg the Economic Secretary to try to get someone in the Treasury to draw her a simple diagram showing how the system will operate. How can Parliament exert meaningful control when two limits will be in operation and no one will know which will govern? No human being alive could predict that, other than by modelling, which is an uncertain art.
<P>
Beyond that, the Economic Secretary said nothing about what parliamentary procedures would be used—she said that it would not be dealt with statutorily—to determine whether resource requests are reasonable. We could set aside the cash and assume that it will be dealt with on exactly the same basis that operates at present, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, accurately described as a disgrace.
<P>
I accept the Economic Secretary's point that in her view—which, in common with the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, I do not share—the Bill is not intended to remedy the current disgrace. We should therefore leave cash accounting aside. However, she owes us an explanation of how resource approvals will be made. It cannot derive from parliamentary practice, as there has never been a resource approval in the whole history of Parliament in the United Kingdom. How will it be done? It will not be statutory, so we cannot read it in the Bill. We therefore need to know what she envisages.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I harbour the perhaps unfounded suspicion that not only has she not said or does not know how resource approvals will be made, but that nobody has given it much thought. However, I have no doubt that somebody in the Treasury will have given a great deal of thought to how the Treasury will make such approvals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making pertinent points. The Economic Secretary has promised to write to me to try to explain why the House authorities did not want the request for resources to be subject to new legislation. Because the House authorities ruled in that way, the Committee has not been given a clear analysis and explanation of how the process will work in practice. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that various Committees have considered the matter—members of this Committee have sat on those Committees and scrutinised the issue—but it is unclear how it will work in practice and how the Government will reconcile two distinct and different limits. In her reply, the Economy Secretary suggested that the reconciliation would be in the estimates. However, under what guidelines and framework will the reconciliation be made? Will it be clear and will the House be able to analyse it properly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must ask the hon. Member for Nottingham, North not to speak to colleagues in the Committee during debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton for his intervention, with which I sympathise fully. However, my concern predates his. Before we reach the manifold and, I suspect, irresoluble problems of bringing before Parliament's conscious mind the relationship between a cash limit and a resource limit, Parliament must establish the resource limit, which is a new phenomenon. We are told that it will not be statutory, and I hope, after my remarks, that the Economic Secretary will tell us exactly how it will work. I suspect, however, that not only do neither she nor her officials know, but that no one has worked it out. What has been worked out is how, within the control mechanism of government, the Treasury will do it.
<P>
I have not the slightest doubt that the Treasury has given a great deal of thought to how it will argue the toss with Departments as part of whatever evolves from the three-year review of resource accounting. I also have no doubt that great difficulties have been encountered, and, as a result, that great uncertainty still exists. However, none of that has anything to do with how Parliament will vet the process. As far as I am aware, Parliament currently has no procedures for vetting resource accounts—nobody in Parliament has ever done it. Before we ascend the slopes of Everest with the complexity of putting the two limits together, we need a base camp. We need an explanation of how the Government, who have an overwhelming majority in the House, and the ability to pass resolutions and to change standing orders, envisage Parliament getting a grip in advance of the resource approvals. The Economic Secretary's argument may be that that will be done in the same way in which it was done in relation to cash, and that the Government will use their majority to introduce a proposal that the overwhelming majority of Members of Parliament will never see. That, at least, would be an honest and clear answer, although it would drive us to table new clauses.
<P>
The Economic Secretary could have given another answer—she could have said that the Government have in mind a process that will allow Parliament to get a grip on resources. She should tell us which of those two avenues she intends to go down. Her choice will have a major impact on our attitude towards the rest of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman gets more information, he becomes increasingly confused, and I hesitate to offer him further information. Most of us find information helpful, but if it causes him further doubts, it will not help him. I was distressed to learn of his doubts about his hon. Friends' capabilities, and to hear his comments on previous Ministers. However, in an effort to be apolitical, I shall not dwell on that further.
<P>
The operation of resource accounting and budgeting will continue to be discussed in detail by the PAC, the Select Committee on the Treasury and the NAO. All of the points that the hon. Member for West Dorset made are part of an on-going discussion about the best way forward.
<P>
Departments will prepare budgets on an accruals basis and they will forecast cash-flows and movements. Reconciliation will be on the basis of the resource accounting policies and the generally accepted accounting principles. That is the way in which the two approaches will be brought together. Parliament will vote the resources that will be consumed by the Departments during the year, and the associated cash consequences, which are obviously not the same. The detailed format of the resource estimates and of the operation of the supply process under resource accounting and budgeting have been set out in the Treasury's recent parliamentary memorandum, which was sent to the PAC, the Select Committee on Procedure and the Treasury Committee. I notice that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden is nodding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am bound to say that we have not received an explanation. I shall further investigate the document to which the Economic Secretary referred. In the absence of an explanation and in the face of much perplexity, we shall withdraw these probing amendments. However, I am not satisfied that the situation has been improved; Parliament is more likely to be confused.
<P>
We shall seek your advice, Mr. Hood, on tabling new clauses. We hope to advance them on a cross-party basis in an effort to remedy the problem. We shall of course consult members of the PAC and, if the Economic Secretary permits, we should be happy to have discussions with officials to ensure that our proposals are better rather than worse from a technical point of view. It would be a tragic error if the House placed on the statute book a Bill that was designed to give a firm basis to national accounting but which did not establish a clear administrative or statutory basis for ensuring that, in relation to resource approvals, there was, for the first time, proper parliamentary scrutiny ex ante.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I reiterate briefly the point made by other members of the Public Accounts Committee that this is the first of the PAC amendments. As such it reflects the view of the PAC and also of the Public Accounts Commission. As the right hon. Member for Swansea, West pointed out, it is also signed by the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon). The amendment also reflects the views of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
<P>
This group of technical amendments arises largely because of the concerns of the National Audit Office. Amendment No. 21 should be treated by the Committee as a probing amendment as it is not perfectly worded in its present form. I intend to return to it on Report, but I shall raise the issue today.
<P>
Clause 4 deals with payments made in error into the consolidated fund. The amendment sets out to correct two aspects of a provision in the Bill that the PAC believes would weaken control over public money. In order to explain the need for the amendments, I need to set out the background and what I understand to be the intention of clause 4. As I said, it is fairly technical.
<P>
A fundamental principle of the system of parliamentary control over Government expenditure is that there should be a single fund into which general taxation is paid, and from which money approved by Parliament for Government to spend is passed to Departments. That fund—the consolidated fund—was set up in 1787 as, to quote the legislation,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``one Fund into which shall flow every stream of public revenue and from which shall come the supply for every service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, Departments also generate income of their own—from fees and charges for services provided, such as driving licences. That income is termed appropriation in aid, as it can be used in support of a Department's spending. However, when Departments receive money additional to their parliamentary grant in that way, there are strict rules about what they may do with it. They may keep and use it only if it is an appropriation in aid authorised by Parliament through that year's Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Act. That was the point of my comment on the Opposition's proposed amendment to clause 1. The receipt must satisfy the description of the appropriation in aid and its value must be within a specified limit. Any receipt that is not an appropriation in aid and not authorised by Parliament for use by the Government must be paid into the Consolidated Fund. Such income is known as a Consolidated Fund extra receipt.
<P>
Clause 4 deals with the situation in which a Department receives money that it thinks it is not authorised to keep and pays it into the Consolidated Fund, but then discovers that it was allowed to retain it. At present, such mistakes are corrected through an administrative procedure set out in Government Accounting, the Treasury's manual for Departments about money management. Under that procedure, known as short surrender, a Department deducts the amount previously paid in error from the next payment that it is required to make into the Consolidated Fund.
<P>
For example, if a Department had made an erroneous payment of £100,000, when it next had to pay £1 million it would instead pay £900,000. The accounts are balanced in that way. Clause 4 provides for the £100,000 to be refunded to the Department before the next payment is due. That is the clause's primary aim. The subsequent payment of £1 million would then be paid in full, since the mistaken payment would already have been corrected.
<P>
I understand from the Government's explanatory notes that the purpose of clause 4 is to remove a negative impact of the inability of Departments to recover immediately moneys paid in error. The behaviour pattern that the clause attempts to correct is Departments' delaying the payment of Consolidated Fund extra receipts until they are certain that none of the money can be recovered. The Government hope that establishing the power to recover amounts paid in error will encourage quicker payment of extra receipts.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I imagine that the Committee would support any proposal designed to remove disincentives for Departments to pay into the fund in a proper and timely manner cash that rightly belongs there. However, the clause has two weaknesses. First, the Bill does not define what constitutes a payment made as the result of an error, and allows the Treasury too much discretion in authorising refunds from the Consolidated Fund. That is a serious weakening of control over public money. At present, money can be released from the fund only if it is for standing services covered by the Appropriation Act, or if it has been authorised by Parliament through an Act or by resolution in the House of Commons. In the judgment of the PAC, this unlimited lacuna is too wide. I should say that a definition is not easy to establish. The amendment, which has been drafted by NAO lawyers, does not meet the requirement, which is why it has been tabled as a probing amendment. I warn the Government now that I propose to table a better amendment on Report.
<P>
The second weakness of the clause is that, as currently phrased, it will allow the Treasury to break the principle of annuality. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 would deal with that problem. The House of Commons votes money for use by a Department in a specific financial year. Any money that is not used during that year is returned to the Consolidated Fund. As drafted, clause 4 will allow money that a Department has overpaid in one year to be refunded for use in the next. That will break a key element of annual financial control.
<P>
As I have said, amendment No. 21 should be regarded as a probing amendment. Amendment No. 23 would insert a new subsection, (2)(a), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A direction may be made by the Treasury under subsection (2) only in the financial year in which the payment into the Consolidated Fund was made.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In conjunction with amendment No. 22, amendment No. 23 would correct the annuality weakness, so I shall press the amendments to a vote.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendments. The Government do not propose to accept them, although we support some of the reasoning behind them. Questions arise about the way in which the principle of annuality would be undermined if Departments were repaid vote cash sums relating to an earlier financial year, but, of course, the Treasury does not intend to use the power for that purpose.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden has failed sufficiently to consider that it is not only vote moneys from Departments that might wrongly be paid into the Consolidated Fund. For example, payments from another source could be credited to the fund in error towards the end of a financial year. If the error did not come to light before the end of that financial year and the start of the next—which, in some cases, could be a very short time—amendments Nos. 22 and 23 would prevent the Treasury from repaying the money. That is one reason why we do not want to accept them in their present form. However, we are sympathetic to the notion that further attention should be paid to the matter, and perhaps we can return to it on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> On the basis that the Economic Secretary will return to the issues of annuality and the discretion that is to be allowed to the Treasury, I beg to ask leave—
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am sorry, but I did not stress the question of Treasury discretion. We intend to make a final decision about that after consulting other interested parties about the issue of whether something has been credited in error. That does not go as far as the right hon. Gentleman would wish; we find that aspect of the amendments less attractive than the others that he raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davis:</B> I will withdraw the amendment, but I reserve the right to return to the matter on Report. My concern about the Treasury's making a judgment about an error was not in the context of parliamentary approval or accountability, but in the more managerial context of the way in which it manages its cash—its working capital management. However, I shall be happy to discuss that with the Economic Secretary between now and Report stage. On the basis that she will deal with the other two matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I assume from the inactivity on the part of Members on the Government Benches that they are content for us to begin this process now, although I am unlikely to make major progress in the next six minutes.
<P>
Clause 5 is the Bill's central clause, and subsection (2) is the central part of that clause. It tells us that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Resource accounts shall be prepared in accordance with directions issued by the Treasury.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 3, which was tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and the Liberal spokesmen, seeks to address the issues raised by that statement. The subsequent amendments in the admirable group that you have selected for debate, Mr. Hood, deal with the same matter.
<P>
I shall explain the background to the amendment by bringing the Committee's attention to the true meaning of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Resource accounts shall be prepared in accordance with directions issued by the Treasury.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We spent some time yesterday, and on a previous occasion, seeking a briefing from the Comptroller and Auditor General about the activities in which he engages when enforcing the system of audit. On both occasions he was at pains to say that neither he nor any other auditor could do anything other than enforce the standards that were laid down. I am sure that that is absolutely true. One cannot expect the Comptroller and Auditor General, or any successor, to invent his own standards for application. Clause 5(2) gives the Treasury the discretion to direct the methods by which resource accounts are prepared. In effect, that means that it will have complete control of the system of resource accounting, including the system of cash accounting. The Economic Secretary has been at pains to point out and the Resource Accounting Manual makes it clear that the three statements—the income and expenditure statement, the cash flow statement and the balance sheet—are all part of the bundle that will be determined by the directions issued by the Treasury.
<P>
Every standard applying to our national accounts after enactment of the Bill, if it is passed unamended, will be a standard set by Her Majesty's Treasury. That is common ground and is clear from the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am sure that we shall discuss that key point during our deliberations this afternoon. The hon. Gentleman will remember that during our briefing yesterday, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General specifically whether the Treasury should be the standard setter for its own accounts. He said that such a process did not apply in the private sector and that the Accounting Standards Board, which is an independent body, set the accounting standards for public limited companies. It would be an odd parallel if the public sector plc—the Government—set its own accounting standards. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will explain his views on whether the Committee should ensure that the Government adopt the process in the private sector. We are, after all, discussing the introduction of private sector accounting methods in the Government sector for the first time. Should not the way in which the accounting standards are set in the private sector be mirrored in the public sector?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I thoroughly echo those sentiments and if you are kind enough to call me this afternoon, Mr. Hood, I shall explain exactly why it is wrong from the point of view of the Government, Parliament and the nation for the Treasury to set the standards. I hope to illustrate that with reference to general constitutional principles and specific details of resource accounting. That is the background to the group of amendments before us. Their purpose is to ensure that we remedy those deficiencies by adopting an analogue to the Accounting Standards Board—the national accounts commission. Its members will not need to testify to the Treasury Committee that they are independent because that will be evident. It will differ from the Financial Reporting Advisory Board in that it will have teeth. It will have power and will be able to set standards.
<P>
I hope that in the course of explaining the activities of that body we shall have an opportunity to review the illuminating annexe B to the Treasury's introductory note that was circulated to members of the Committee on the applicability of current accounting standards to resource accounting. We shall gain much from a review of that annexe and an understanding of just how vast the area of discretion is. I hope that we shall then be able to engage in constructive dialogue with the Economic Secretary, not on the principle—I cannot imagine that she genuinely wishes to resist the principle of an independent accounts commission—but on the detail. We must consider together how to achieve standard setting.
<P>
The Committee may be aware that we have set up a shadow body under the chairmanship of Sir Bryan Carsberg, which is shortly to have its first meeting, but we are not dogmatically attached to the mechanism—
