[Continuation from column 318]
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I was about to conclude my remarks on the amendment. The House of Lords Select Committee, too, concluded that the exemption ``goes too far'', adding:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The test should be an objective one, reviewable by the Information Commissioner''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is precisely my view, and that is why we have tabled the amendments. I should be interested to hear why the Under-Secretary disagrees with the House of Lords Select Committee and the Public Administration Select Committee and intends to pursue the course that he has chosen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It may be convenient for the Committee and may help us make progress if I make some brief remarks on clause 34. The clause should be removed. It is far too all-embracing, and we would welcome an explanation from the Under-Secretary of why it is necessary. Although the amendments that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has tabled and other amendments that we shall discuss later might improve the clause, it is a catch-all clause, designed to mop up anything that might not be covered by clause 33. To a large extent, its existence weakens the arguments that the Under-Secretary advanced in the debate on clause 33. Some of the phrases used make me wonder. For example, the question of what would be likely to inhibit the free and frank provision of advice—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would the hon. Gentleman kindly help me? He is making, in effect a clause stand part speech, rather than speaking to the amendment. Is that because he anticipates my not allowing a clause stand part debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It was in anticipation of my not needing to catch your eye, Dr. Clark, to make a speech on clause stand part. I wanted to draw my remarks to a close. The clause should be removed, but the amendment that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has tabled would undoubtedly improve it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The Government agree that greater openness is necessary, especially in Whitehall, and in many other public authorities, too, but it must be balanced with other requirements. I have often listed those requirements, which, broadly speaking, fall into three categories—the need for an element of privacy, which may be relevant in this case; the need for an element of commercial confidentiality, which, again, may be relevant in this case, but is probably more properly covered by other clauses; and the effectiveness of proper public administration for the public good.
<P>
The assumption that freedom of information has a monopoly on righteousness is not sustainable. Freedom of information is right and proper, and we currently have too much secrecy in our public authorities. However, as all members of the Committee would accept, there are circumstances in which an element of Government efficiency is necessary and that require that certain matters should not, at least initially, come into the public arena. The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross was right to say that government cannot be conducted in the atmosphere of a fish bowl. It is a matter of getting the balance right; the question is how that is done.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment that seeks to do two things. The first is to insert a test of objectivity, rather than reasonableness. There are problems with that, however, and I shall attempt to distinguish between the two tests. A reasonableness test is one where a public authority, which is given a range of decisions that it could reasonably and properly choose, is judged on whether it chose reasonably. The objectivity test is different and more problematic, in the context of the decisions with which we are dealing. It requires the official or the elected person taking the decision to consider whether someone else would take the same view of what constitutes reasonableness. The commissioner would have to consider whether the decision was objectively correct, substituting her view of the balance of the argument for the view of the person properly elected to make that decision. That is a worrying test. I would not go so far as to call it profoundly undemocratic; that would be overstating the case, because there are circumstances in which having an objective test by an unelected person has merit—judges are an obvious example. However, many decisions taken by public authorities are taken in a representative way and are not necessarily based on an entirely objective view of what the correct decision should be—they may be based on an ideological view, for example. Those who face a range of decisions on the issue of freedom of information should be able to ask themselves whether their choice of whether something should be disclosed is reasonable, given the range of reasonable options available, none of which is outrageous or irrational.
<P>
However, the test that puts someone in the position of having to judge what someone else might regard as objective is somewhat different and much more difficult to apply properly. We should have a test of reasonableness that is made by someone qualified to make it, so not just any old person makes that judgment of reasonableness but a person who has some locus or ability to make the decision—someone put in that position by reason of his capability. Although we may question the capabilities of some who are elected—as Members of Parliament that is our prerogative, as it is the prerogative of any citizen—the public has chosen them.
<P>
We have taken the view that the reasonable opinion of a qualified person set out in subsection (2) is the better and clearer test. The amendment would remove the concept of ``a reasonable opinion'' and leave in place the exemption on the grounds of the effective conduct of public affairs being subject to a similar ``would or would be likely to prejudice'' test as other prejudice test exemptions.
<P>
The Government consider that only a qualified person can have a full understanding of the issues involved in the decision-making processes of a public authority. Although the matters covered in clause 34 are arguably less sensitive than those in clause 33, and therefore a class exemption is not justified, we do not consider that it would be right for the prejudice caused by that sort of information to be determined by the commissioner. That would put her in the position of second-guessing every decision. Not only would it impose a large bureaucratic burden on her, it would mean that any judgment that she made would not have been made by a person who was elected to that position, however reasonable the decision might be.
<P>
At all stages, decisions must be reasonable. If someone makes a reasonable judgment but the commissioner, in an objective analysis, takes a different view, it might lead to conflict. To some extent, which side to take is a matter of judgment; one could probably argue for either side, but we prefer our approach. In a sense, the reasonable opinion of a qualified person is a compromise.
<P>
The commissioner can overturn the decision of the qualified person if she believes the decision to be unreasonable, but not otherwise. Within a range, that person is able to make a decision that is reasonable. If they make an unreasonable decision the commissioner can overturn it, but not if it is within the range of reasonableness.
<P>
The Government propose to balance the right to know against other rights—in this case the right of the public to have an effective public administration, but it could be instead a matter of privacy and whether certain information ought to be disclosed. Information about individuals might be requested—for instance, by the press—relating to cases in which a judgment taken by an official or a qualified person was perhaps not right. In matters like those, which in many ways strike at the heart of good administration, a compromise must be reached between the power of the commissioner to order the disclosure of information and effective public administration. The clause seeks to reach that balance.
<P>
I accept that it is a compromise and a matter of judging where to draw that line—as it is throughout the Bill. It is a compromise between the rights of privacy and confidentiality and of efficiency and freedom of information. It is all a matter of judgment, but the amendment highlights the nature of that compromise—that in the end one must come down on one side or the other. One of the reasons that I came down on this side is that it is important for people who hold elected office to be able to do their duty and carry out the job that the public put them there to do. Often that means taking tough and unpopular decisions. It may be about disclosing the personal details of an individual who is accused of particular offences. Does one disclose them when the press are demanding to know everything about that person? Where there is a reasonable range of options, the qualified person should approach the matter properly.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
One point that I made when I intervened was that I was concerned that the approach advocated by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome would remove the issue of the qualified person to such an extent that almost any official could make a decision. A judgment would then have to be made about whether the view reached would objectively be the same as that of the Information Commissioner. That is a bad test, and puts any person who must make such judgments in an invidious position.
<P>
I can see why the idea is superficially attractive and why some might think that always having an objective test is the best policy. There are certain legal decisions where that is right, but we all know from the judgments that we have to make as Members of Parliament that a reasonable decision may be one of a number of options. Every person would not necessarily always reach the same decision. An unhelpful element of doubt is therefore created which would make the clause almost unworkable. The hon. Member for Ryedale advanced an entirely different argument. He argued that there should be no such clause—no doubt we shall come to that on stand part.
<P>
I will not accept the amendment, but I hope that, having heard why we reached the compromise and decided to approach this matter in such a way, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome will withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I appreciate that the Minister has engaged with the arguments and given a reasoned view of why he prefers his position. He will not be surprised to hear that I do not entirely agree with him, even having heard his comments. I shall look carefully at his arguments in Hansard and will reflect on them. The basic problem that he faces is that the test of reasonableness is wide. The number of successful legal challenges of the reasonableness of a public authority's decision is relatively small.
<P>
Unlike many members of the Committee, I am not a distinguished lawyer but I certainly recall from my local government days—the Minister may recall from his—the case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses against Wednesbury Corporation and the test that was applied to local authorities. The test has been successfully applied on a few occasions to show that a local authority has behaved unreasonably in reaching its decision. It suffices that an authority shows that part of its consideration was reasonable and that it was listening to a point of view that it was reasonable for it to have taken into account. Therefore, there is a problem in applying reasonableness solely. Much more important, however, is the obstacle placed in the way of the Information Commissioner.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not accept the broad definition of Wednesbury or of unreasonableness at which the hon. Gentleman has arrived. The process and quality of these decisions are far more constrained by reasonableness than he suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Minister because he has helped my thought processes. He suggested that one person could have one objective view and that another person could have another objective view. If they are different views, to my mind that makes them subjective views. He then said that it was not correct to substitute one objective opinion for another. That undermines the whole purpose of the Information Commissioner, whose job it is to tell the authorities that have presumably made decisions as a result of some form of deliberative process that they have reached the wrong conclusion. It would be more helpful for the commissioner to have access to that process in the context of the clause, but I shall reflect carefully on what the Minister said.
<P>
In parenthesis, I must mention the comments of the hon. Member for Ryedale who made a clause stand part speech. I wish to raise some points that are outside the context of the amendments and were you, Dr. Clark, so minded to consider that that discussion had been adequately explored, I shall make those points relevant to one of the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The debate on the amendments has been so brief that we shall have a stand part debate if the hon. Gentleman so wishes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am most grateful to you, Dr. Clark. In that context, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 99, in page 19, leave out lines 6 and 7.
<P>
The provision that the amendment would delete is another example of the buttons, belt and braces approach of the Government, in that they never knowingly put one exemption into a Bill without repeating it two or three times. It is superfluous, first, because all information held by a Department relating to policy formulation is exempt under clause 33(1)(a). Secondly, any record of communications between Ministers held by Departments is exempt under clause 33(1)(b). Thirdly, because it is a reasonable assumption that, if a document held by another public authority described the conflicting views of different Ministers and was likely to disrupt their collective responsibility, the Government would at the very least have taken the precaution of releasing the information in confidence; it would therefore be exempt under clause 39.
<P>
It is hard to find circumstances in which the clause could have effect without one of the other clauses to which I have drawn attention having been applied. I invite the Under-Secretary to explain why it is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> If there is one place where a belt-and-braces approach may be justified, it is that of protecting ministerial collective responsibility. In many ways, that is the bedrock of the Government, of whichever party. It is a safeguard under our constitution that any Minister who makes a decision or speaks on behalf of a Department or the Government as a whole requires the collective consent of other Ministers to make that statement, propound the policy or deliver that decision or to fail to do so. That protection, which is for the citizen as well, must be ensured.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, who has some experience of such matters, pointed out that Government cannot be conducted in a fishbowl. Collective responsibility cannot be created in a fishbowl, but it must be created. Ministers are expected to advance departmental considerations in any discussion of policy outcome. Those considerations are properly proposed and the process of trying to reconcile them can be protracted. A Government may have to take account of other considerations, not least those of party, in the course of making decisions. There must be discussion and debate about how those can be reconciled before a collective decision is taken, and there is compromise on those matters, but perhaps not always reconciliation.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary is again reciting the reasons for some protection for central Government. We understand that and have no problem with it, but it is covered by other clauses. What subject for concern remains outside the clauses that I have cited?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clauses 34 and 33 clearly apply to different bodies. Certain matters may fall under clause 34(2)(c), but we want to make the position entirely clear. It may be argued that part of the protection is covered by the clause and other clauses, but we now have devolved government and are in the process of reaching collective decisions. Therefore, the concept of collective responsibility might have to grow in terms of how it deals with discussions between the United Kingdom Executive and those elsewhere. Also, the way in which relationships exist between the political parties—
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman need not point out that there is an exemption, as I shall come to that in a minute. If he wants to say something else, I shall give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary has now included yet another reason why the protection need not be included. He correctly suggested that I intended to draw his attention to the fact that clause 26 covers those precise circumstances, so I could have quoted it as yet another example. There seem to be multiple layers to achieve the same effect, which is not sensible drafting.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not sure that that argument deals with what we are trying to achieve in practice. The hon. Gentleman, rather than objecting to the clause in principle, is almost trying to ask me whether I can justify the view of the parliamentary draftsmen that the Bill should be drafted as it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman assents to that view. We think that clause 34(2) is necessary and sensible. The commissioner will be able to review the exercise if the way in which the decision has been approached is unreasonable. Even if the exemption applies in every case, the authority is obliged to consider occasionally making a discretionary disclosure. The exemption is limited in scope and addresses only that information that ought not to be disclosed, as to do so would jeopardise the convention of ministerial responsibility.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that if we remove the provision, we would have to rely on the other clauses. To some extent, it provides a belt-and-braces approach so that no one is in any doubt, which is reasonable. Where there is a very clear exemption—and there may be some question about whether particular documents are covered by the total exemption or by the more discretionary exemption—there will be clarity about which provisions deal with the documents, and one or other of the clauses will therefore apply. A decision could be based on one of the clauses, and the justification for using clause 34 might be the test applied to a document that is the subject of some doubt. The person involved would then have to take a reasonable view, which I do not think is a bad thing. Some of the clauses may overlap, but that overlap has a desirable end because the status of some information will always be unclear. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central describes the provisions as belt and braces legislation. I admit that they are somewhat cautious, and that the matters with which they deal can be covered by more than one clause. The exemption is clear—we take that view, and various hon. Members have expressed their views and commented on whether they agree. If a particular document raises a borderline issue, it could fall into the category under discussion and the reasonable opinion of the qualified person would then come into play.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Despite the overlap, all the relevant provisions are necessary, especially as clauses 34 and 33 apply to different authorities. It is good practice to rely on specific clauses for different authorities as well as on general clauses. There is a danger that we always encounter during discussion of the Bill. We talk about government and the Executive as if that is what the proposed legislation is all about, but we know that it is also about other public authorities. We have a long list of public authorities that could potentially be affected by provisions towards the end of the clause. That is probably the aspect of the clause that would most benefit from consideration. The hon. Gentleman has objected that there is some ministerial overlap. We do not agree on that; I think that it is necessary and he does not. The key issue, however, is that there is very little overlap between clauses 33 and 34, because much of clause 34 will apply to other authorities and will set a somewhat different test to that which is set by clause 33.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary has failed to persuade me that the provisions are necessary, and has not provided any examples of material that would not be caught by pre-existing clauses. I still believe that the provision in question is otiose, although it is not the end of the world if it remains in the Bill, because, as he said, it overlaps with other legislation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 19, line 10, leave out `inhibit' and insert `prejudice'.
<P>
We have established that the Under-Secretary is fond of the word ``prejudice'' and that it is his preferred word. It may be roughly synonymous with the word ``harm'', but it is much to be preferred in legislation. Not only does it fully encompass the Under-Secretary's intentions, but it is familiar to the courts and they will know how to interpret it. It is therefore my humble contention that the word ``prejudice'' is likely to prove more familiar to the courts and will be easier to interpret when interpolated in the clause instead of the word ``inhibit''. I believe that it has the same meaning, although the Under-Secretary may argue that the word ``inhibition'' is not prejudicial and would provide a better phrasing for the clause. I await his comments with interest, to hear whether he has lost faith in the word ``prejudice'' or not.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My faith in the word ``prejudice'' is unabated, and it is the right word to use in appropriate parts of the Bill. The word ``inhibit'', which has much the same meaning, is used in a slightly different context in the clause. If hon. Gentleman considers my dissertation on the word ``prejudice'', he will realise that the context of a word is important. Our views on the words ``inhibit'' and ``prejudice'' do not differ significantly. I accept that the words mean much the same. We wanted to use a slightly different word because the context is slightly different. The word ``prejudice'' has become a matter of dispute; some people think that we should have used the term ``substantial harm''. I am not sure that anyone would realistically want to insert that phrase in the clause. I prefer the word ``inhibit'' because its use does not conflict with that of the word ``prejudice''. I would not die in the ditch because of the amendment; there is nothing of substance between us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary has missed a golden opportunity. He could have finally conceded to an amendment, especially as he has said that he has no problem with it. We would have left the Committee happy in the knowledge that we had succeeded in changing the Government's mind on a vital matter of principle. He would have gone away perfectly happy in the knowledge that the Bill still said exactly what he intended it to say. However, he has fallen short at the last hurdle by saying that he will not accept the amendment.
<P>
There is a nuance of difference between such words; the word ``inhibit'' does not necessarily mean harm, whereas the word ``prejudice'' does. An inhibition can be wholly beneficial, whereas the provision should clearly deal with prejudice to the process rather than a simple inhibition. I should love to press the amendment to a Division, but doing so would not be a sensible use of the Committee's time. However, the Under-Secretary could intervene and say that, after careful consideration, he would accept my word rather than his, and we should be happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I rise simply to put the hon. Gentleman out of his misery and to tell him that I will not accept the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> The latter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I did not want to incur your wrath by proceeding further with my remarks earlier. I do not want to labour the point, because I think that the Under-Secretary has acknowledged that there is a significant difference between us on the clause. We believe that the clause is unnecessary, but it would have been even more unnecessary if the Government had accepted amendments Nos. 134 and 137, because they would have resolved some of the problems. The exchange of views on amendment No. 70 only serves to confirm our view that the clause is not just a mopping-up operation—to mop up any information not caught by the exemptions in clause 33, because the Under-Secretary seemed to concede that the harm being tested is not even prejudice, let alone substantial harm. For that reason, the clause allows not only Government Departments but a range of other authorities to withhold information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Although there may be some overlap, most of the clause deals with non-central Government matters—particularly Northern Ireland, with specific reference to the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Does the hon. Gentleman really feel that there is no justification for a test, if a qualified person could be of the reasonable opinion that certain information should not be promptly disclosed to the public? That provision would apply not only in relation to Northern Ireland, but to many other authorities that hold sensitive information about security and various other matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister answered his own intervention with that last comment. Security matters are caught by a blanket exemption. I do not want to delay the Committee, but it is the belt and braces argument again. We are unlikely to press the point, as the Committee wants to make progress. The clause should not be included in the Bill. However, the caveat is that clause 33 should be redrafted so that clause 34 becomes unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee, nor do I want to argue again that this clause and clause 33 could be drafted more effectively. I have a simple inquiry for the Under-Secretary. Will clause 34 or clause 33 apply to those redbrick quangos that have proliferated recently? I speak of task forces, about which the Bill is silent.
<P>
We are indebted to Lord Falconer of Thoroton, Minister of State at the Cabinet Office, for his definition of task forces. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``My Lords, the difference between a task force and a non-departmental public body is the permanence of the non-departmental body. If the NDPB is intended to be permanent and to carry out permanent functions, it is not a task force, but a non-departmental public body.''—[Official Report, House of Lords, 11 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 526 ]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, there is no difference in kind between a task force and a non-departmental public body. However, NDPBs are listed in the schedule as falling within the scope of the Bill but task forces are not. That may be because they are defined in clauses 33 or 34, which suggests that they will have a blanket exemption simply by virtue of being part of the policy formation process. I should be most grateful if the Under-Secretary would say whether task forces are covered by the Bill and, if so, how.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall deal first with the view of the hon. Member for Ryedale that the clause is superfluous. This clause and clause 33 overlap only to the extent that they make clear how things should be done. Most of the clause is separate and applies the reasonableness test of a qualified person to decisions made by public authorities other than central Government. It is necessary because it deals with a matter that is much broader than central Government.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman used the word ``security'' to dismiss the idea that the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly holds sensitive information that is not security information. I suspect that it holds all kinds of sensitive information about the internal dealings of the Executive that relate to discussions of a politically sensitive nature in the current sensitive situation in Northern Ireland. I do not accept that the hon. Gentleman believes that that matter should be forced into a regime that may prejudice the peace process. If we set that aside, we can probably come to an agreement on Northern Ireland and deal with the rest of the public authorities.
<P>
Other public authorities may hold sensitive information about the commercial circumstances of their dealings and about individual members. None of us, I suspect, believe that that should be on the front page of The Guardian tomorrow. That is partly because there is no great public interest in such matters—indeed, such interest may be prurient—and partly because there may be a proper, legitimate and reasonable justification for not making public sensitive and difficult information about individuals at a certain time.
<P>
The extent to which public authorities are covered by the provision is set out, to some degree, in the clause. It could, however, be increased. Quangos are non-governmental public bodies and will be covered, as perhaps will task forces. However, I shall have to provide a full, detailed answer, as coverage will depend on the nature of the task force concerned. A task force may be outside the scope of the clause, so will have to disclose everything. However, in certain circumstances, it may not. Certain inquiries and task forces may belong to a slightly different category. Essentially, however, many task forces used directly by Government may come into the category. There are also task forces not employed by Government, but from whom we purchase information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary is trying to be helpful. It would be of assistance if he could write giving an indication of the different classes and, if possible, categorising task forces into those classes.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall be happy to provide a broader view. However, I hesitate to commit myself to listing all the task forces and organisations that may be employed by many different public authorities. We are not simply discussing the governmental bodies mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, but non-governmental task forces that are used by Departments but which are not directly accountable to them. However, setting out clearly the categories requested by the hon. Gentleman will assist him and will not make for too long a letter.
<P>
Clause 34 would, in principle, apply to task forces, which are certainly subject to the Bill's provisions. However, not all task forces are likely to be covered by the Bill, as some are private. The Wales new deal advisory task force is listed in the Bill, as is the skills task force. We shall have to consider whether any political task force is covered. Obviously, in future policy development, for instance, or preparing the Labour party's manifesto for the general election, there will be a crossover between the ministerial and governmental and the political. Members of the Committee would all understand that, and accept that I, as a Minister, am quite properly engaged in developing policy for the next Labour party manifesto. I could well be on a task force that was organised by the party to do that, which would not be subject to freedom of information provisions. However, I may direct other task forces to be set up which would be subject to them. I will have to consider those issues and perhaps give the hon. Gentleman a more detailed answer later on.
<P>
On the broader issue, clause 34 is necessary because it goes well beyond clause 33. I do not accept the contention of the hon. Member for Ryedale that it is somehow unnecessary. Given the variety of organisations that it covers, it is entirely possible to imagine the Comptroller and Auditor General, for instance, having information that he might properly feel should not be in the public arena. Provided that he, as a qualified person, had taken the view that that information should be subject to this clause—particularly if it related to Ministers' collective responsibility—it would be difficult to argue that he should divulge it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I did say that our view on clauses 33 and 34 should be taken as a whole. We are not satisfied with the wording of clause 33, and in an earlier exchange we persuaded the Parliamentary Secretary to consider all these issues. The phrase in our amendment,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``confidential communications between departments, public bodies and regulatory bodies''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would cover all the points that the Under-Secretary is making.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point. Clause 34 deals with all public authorities in a broad sense, whereas clause 33 applies specifically to information held by central Government; both clauses are necessary. Submerging one into another would just create a long and complex clause conflating two different issues. It is difficult enough to set out clearly what is entirely exempt and what is subject to the test of reasonableness. We tried to achieve that by putting information held by central Government into a separate clause.
<P>
If anything, I would go further: there is an argument for dealing with the reasonableness test as applied to central Government information in one clause and providing for public authorities in a separate clause, but that would add another clause to the Bill. To some extent, this is the result of the parliamentary draftsman's decision on the most straightforward way of approaching the issue. I am not convinced that the Government and the Opposition are that far apart. When pressed, the hon. Gentleman says that we could deal with this by putting all the provisions in clause 33, but I do not accept that. This is a more convenient, straightforward and understandable way of approaching the matter; if anything, an extra clause might simplify it further. However, the Bill is complex enough without adding so complex a clause that nobody could understand it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Before we leave this important clause, will the Minister tell us more about what he means by ``reasonable opinion'' and ``qualified person''? I appreciate that he has commented on them in his explorations, but rather more on Pepper v. Hart would be helpful with this clause. The two phrases are crucial and I am surely not neurotic in believing that the clause confers a great deal of self-determining power on the qualified persons who are to determine the success of an application.
<P>
At various times during the debate, the Minister has either said, or come close to saying, that decisions taken by non-elected people are undemocratic. He got half way through that sentence this afternoon, saying that such decisions were not as democratic as those taken by politicians. He went about half way through that sentence, regretted what he had launched and back-tracked. I see the hon. Member for Ryedale nodding conspicuously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee further, but the hon. Gentleman raised Pepper v. Hart and I can tell him that any lawyer who studied our deliberations with a view to progressing matters under the Pepper v. Hart principle would have an absolute field day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is even more worrying.
<P>
The Minister looks baffled, but in seeking to justify why he should have the last word in many parts of the Bill, he did say something akin to what I described.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My hon. Friend now agrees. I am sure that he would concede that when a commissioner is appointed by democratically elected Ministers in a democratic Government, the whole framework is effectively democratically determined. Since Lord Neill's deliberations, any appointment quite rightly has to go through many hoops of objective assessment. The Minister will know that many people are deterred from standing for public office because some of the forms that they have to compile are embarrassing, particularly to the most eminent people in their field. So there is a good deal of political structure and democratically determined constraints—most of which, if not all, are wholly proper. I cannot believe, however, that the Minister would give credence to the idea that an independent arbiter is outside the democratic structure in way that a Minister is not. As I said, the Minister has at the very least flirted with that notion on several occasions.
<P>
We have discussed the commissioner's powers before and we will do so again. I hope that the Committee, and indeed Parliament, will be reluctant about giving Ministers—or even qualified persons—the final word. The exact reason for the legislation is the need to place decisions in an objective context rather than to allow them to be taken by people with vested interests. The tongue of the clause may be tucked into itself too much, so I should like to hear more about these qualified persons.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will also say more about ``reasonable opinion'', which could be interpreted as being a high or unhelpful hurdle. He will recall that page 12 of his Department's briefing on freedom on information states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by making the harm test subjective . . . the Commissioner, in practice, could intervene only if he or she could show that the Minister's action was unreasonable in the sense of being irrational or perverse.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thus, the Minister or any other qualified person would have to show only a small degree of reasonableness to be outwith the commissioner's ambit. That is a high hurdle, especially given—being a lawyer, he will know this better than I do—what happened on other occasions. I am sure that I was reliably informed that ``reasonable'' was interpreted by the courts in the case of Halsbury as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a grave error of judgement''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or, by Lord Brightman in R. v Hillingdon 1986, as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unreasonableness verging on an absurdity''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The test of ``reasonableness'' is tough and more serious than the frustration that all of us have habitually come across in our constituencies with the ombudsman and the interpretation of ``maladministration'', under which he is obliged to turn down our applications on behalf of our constituents who think that the ombudsman is an objective umpire on cases that have gone wrong. As members of the Committee know, we often bump up against the ombudsman. It is frustrating when one senses that something has gone wrong but, unless due process has been not been observed by the authority, there is little that the ombudsman can do. He has little power because of the definition of the word ``maladministration'', and ``reasonable opinion'' may have the same and equally frustrating effect. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could say what he understands to be reasonable or unreasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend has raised some matters of profound constitutional importance. I hesitate to refer to at too much a length to the issues that he outlined to the Committee. However, every system requires checks and balances. In a democratic constitutional system, institutions create two factors: first a proper set of checks on the abuse of power and, secondly, the proper exercise of democratic, legitimate decision making. That is also protected, so that those who are elected by the people can, provided that they do not abuse their power, make reasonable decisions.
<P>
My hon. Friend must not necessarily confuse the issues of objective and reason, because it may be reasonable to reach a decision that he regards as objective and which I do not. The assumption that something is objective may be a matter of profound dispute, and reaching a decision that is extremely controversial and based on facts and analyses that can, at each stage of the decision-making process and the arrival at a decision, be controversial, difficult and subject to a dispute necessarily means that the decision maker must have—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It occurs to me that if the Minister would kindly turn to the left, rather than the right, I as well as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central could see his charming visage.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> You are right, Dr. Clark, and I shall endeavour to ensure that my charming visage—if that is what it is—is displayed to you and to my hon. Friend behind me.
<P>
Allowing a certain degree not of discretion but of room in which the decision maker may properly reach a reasoned judgment is important in a democratic system. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central asked me whether we are saying that those who are unelected or appointed, such as judges or the Information Commissioner, are outside the democratic structure. The answer is that of course we are not. They have the role in the democratic institutional framework of providing checks and balances. Those checks and balances exist as a recognition that democracy is not perfect—shades of E.M. Forster's ``Two Cheers for Democracy''—and that decisions are sometimes difficult and controversial. When a decision is taken, others might say that another, better, decision could have been arrived at—I dare say that most of the decisions that I as a Minister make could be subject to that criticism—but provided that the decision maker is acting reasonably and properly and has democratic legitimacy for the decision making, that decision should not be overruled.
<P>
We seek to create a set of balances in the Bill by recognising the overall constitutional approach that it is democratically legitimate for someone to make such a decision, provided that he is acting properly. Wherever possible, I have taken the view that the decision maker—the person elected to make decisions—should make decisions, rather than an unelected senior person in an institution, for example, or someone holding various other roles. Wherever reasonable, I have broadly taken the view that it is better for a person who has been directly elected or who is otherwise democratically responsible to make judgments, because if such a person gets it wrong he or she is answerable and can be removed much more easily than someone who is unelected. Unelected people may have, for quite proper and legitimate reasons, all sorts of protections on their role and position—as would, no doubt, be the case for the Information Commissioner and for judges, for example. That is right and proper, but it means that there is less direct and sensitive democratic input by the electorate. The Bill is all about giving more power to the people and about being sensitive to people's rights.
<P>
My hon. Friend is really asking me whether I think that the decisions of those who are democratically elected are more legitimate than those of people who are unelected. My answer to him must be yes, but that their decisions must be subject to restraints and to checks and balances. However, there are circumstances in which—for example in legal decisions—a judge should properly overrule the decision of a Minister if the Minister breaks a rule, obligation or sense of reasonableness with which he or she has a duty to comply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The argument that my hon. Friend is deploying is interesting, but he is so interested in himself that he is talking about ministerial decisions in general rather than about the constrained ministerial decision of whether to release information—which, is of course a class of ministerial decision, but a very specific one. Unlike most other ministerial decisions, once the Bill is enacted that class of decision will be constrained. One specific constraint will be the recommendations of the commissioner, who is unelected. In respect of such matters, the freedoms provided by the Bill are more constrained and more complicated than the greater freedom that Parliament and convention rightly give to the normal round of ministerial decisions for which a Minister has to take responsibility and on which he must face the judgment of Parliament and the press. Except under the laws of financial impropriety and other such legislation, those freedoms are pretty much unconstrained, and rightly so.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There is no great distance between my hon. Friend and I on the matter. He is right: when the commissioner feels that the decision is reasonable under the clause, the issue of recommended disclosure in the public interest, which is covered by clause 13, may also come into play. When making a recommendation, the commissioner can substitute her own view on where the public interest lies. The Bill therefore contains all sorts of checks and balances, which is perfectly right.
<P>
My hon. Friend's questions were, however, slightly broader, which was why, as he pointed out, I was led down the wider constitutional line. As I said, profound questions arise, and I am not sure that I am entirely qualified to answer them. My hon. Friend was right to say that the clause places more constraints on the qualified people who will make decisions on freedom of information. They are subject to more checks and balances than would usually apply because we want to ensure that the Bill shifts the onus towards public disclosure when the public have a right to know. We are, after all, trying to create such a right, so it is proper to constrain the legitimate role of the qualified person. I do not want, however, to impose constraints so as to substitute entirely the views of the Information Commissioner for a reasonable decision made by a qualified person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to stop interventions, because I believe that they provide the best form of debate. However, I hope that hon. Members will recognise the difference between a brief intervention made as a challenge on a point of clarification and a long intervention that would be better expressed as a separate speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I take the implied admonition, Dr. Clark, and my intervention will be very brief. Will the Under-Secretary comment further on reasonableness? When I invited him to do so, I hoped that he would embolden the commissioner in interpreting the word. Such discretion would be better than the rather terrifyingly constrained definitions, which tell us that something can be bonkers before it is unreasonable. That danger applies even though the decision could be interpreted from the legal precedent or from the Home Office document.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is a question of showing a small degree of reasonableness. The decision must be reasonable, which means that a range of possible answers exist. If a decision falls outside that range, it is unreasonable. It would be cruel for an authority to rely on any definition of unreasonableness that equates it to the plainly mad or irrational. Somebody could reach a decision at which no reasonable person could arrive because he or she has a prejudice about a particular point of view. Such a person may not be mad or irrational but could be so prejudiced that a reasonable person not acting from a prejudiced viewpoint might not make the same decision. Some people might describe as prejudices legitimate views such as political opinions for which others are elected. However, some prejudices are plainly unlawful, including racial prejudice or prejudice of another kind that would mean that a decision might, arguably, not be irrational or mad, but unacceptably prejudiced.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 20, line 26, at end insert `on any living individual'.
<P>
I begin by making two disclaimers about the amendment. First, it is not intended to involve the sovereign in controversy, and, secondly, it is not intended to bring the honours system into controversy as a result of discussion about a current case. However, read in tandem with clause 62(3), clause 35(1)(b) will have the rather remarkable wide-sweeping effect that information about honours will be withheld from the public for 75 years. That goes beyond what is currently provided for under the existing code, which to my knowledge has not caused any problems. It also seems to contravene public policy, not least because, whether we like it or not, the honours system has from time to time been subject to public debate. It is odd to think that as a result of such a provision the activities of Mr. David Lloyd George might not have come to light until this decade. That cannot be considered good.
<P>
It is right to protect the interests of those on whom an honour is bestowed. The amendment would ensure that that is done but that that interest expires with the life of the person on whom the honour is bestowed, and that a wider interest would come into play that would remove the exemption that clause 35 provides. It is not a matter of massive importance, but if we are interested in sustaining the honours system, not least by ensuring that it is not brought into disrepute by speculative suggestions that it has been abused, the best way to do so is to make it possible to shine the light on what has happened, not as a matter of concession by a party involved but as a matter of public right secured by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Let me put a case to the right hon. Gentleman. It may be suggested to a Member of Parliament—I give no indication of which Member it might be, and I am not saying I have personal knowledge of the matter, nor am I denying it—that, for many years, an individual has performed a task for a particular club or sports organisation in the public interest, and has done a lot of good work for it. A number of recommendations are made to the Member of Parliament that lead him to believe that that person has done a lot of public good and should deserve an honour. Information is sent off about that person—he may be the head of a large household with a family of children and grandchildren—saying how good he is and that he deserves to be honoured.
<P>
That message is received by someone who claims to know something different. He then asks if anyone else knows about that individual's behaviour, which is not known to the family or to anyone else—perhaps about some of the club's money being improperly used. That information is relevant to the giving of the honour, and it may lead to a different decision being made. However, it is also about a matter that is many years old that the individual, who has otherwise lead a blameless life, might not want his family to know about.
<P>
That information is communicated, again quite properly, to the relevant authorities. No doubt, the person who recommended the honour would make a very proper and appropriate request to the Member of Parliament about why so-and-so was refused the honour—a request that he would decline to answer because he knows that if he passed on that information it would be unnecessarily damaging to a person who had otherwise led a blameless life, and cause great distress to his family. Should we enable that information to be released into the public arena? Again, arguments can be made for both sides. The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross has put one side of the argument. I shall give the other.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 would limit the exemption to information relating to the conferring of honours on a living individual. It would exclude from the scope of the exemption information relating to posthumous hours. The Crown does not generally confer honours on people who are not living, with the exception of some gallantry awards, such as VCs. In some circumstances, a person's life time may not be sufficient, because publication of information about the recipient after he has died may cause unnecessary distress to his family.
<P>
Personal confidentiality is important. I do not say that the right hon. Gentleman does not have a perfectly good point. He does, but the difficulty is trying to ensure a balance in those cases and circumstances when it might be right and proper to disclose such information and others when it might not be. The Bill has been drafted in recognition of the complexity of the matter; indeed, as far as it can, it reflects the status quo of the guidance set out in the White Paper on open government, published in 1993, which applied an exemption for honours material for 75 years.
<P>
It is important to note that clause 13 would apply to such information. It requires public authorities to consider the exercise of their discretion to disclose the information when the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption. That being said, the right hon. Gentleman has a point. The honours system has not always been as transparent as we would have liked and perhaps we should look at this again. I am reluctant to give any undertakings and I shall not do so.
<P>
The Government will consider the duration of the exemption in light of the comments of the Select Committee, the Royal Historical Society and the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on Public Records. Our aim is to provide access to as many honours records as possible, at the earliest possible date, bearing in mind questions of confidentiality. As I have said, questions of confidentiality relating to the personal circumstances of people who are not in the public eye could be quite difficult. At this point I do not know where I would draw the line. I can see that 75 years is too long in some cases and might be just about right in others. I have some difficulty with this but I will look at the length of time again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I find the Under-Secretary's answer rather beguiling and I am inclined not to press the amendment. I have listened to his plea about the embarrassment that it might cause to private individuals and his attempt to balance that against the wider public interest in sustaining the reputation of the system. I am heartened a little by his awareness of the difficulties and his willingness, although it falls short of an undertaking, to reconsider the matter is perfectly sufficient for my purposes. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I rise briefly to invite the Minister to clarify the purpose of the clause, particularly the intention in respect of the parallel set of regulations—the Aarhus convention regulations—under clause 73 to which the clause refers. Is he satisfied that the Aarhus regulations would be no less amenable to the public interest in disclosure than those contained in the Bill, or are they perhaps more open and generous? It would be interesting to hear how the Minister views that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify the clause. It provides that environmental information is exempt if the public authority is obliged to release the information requested in accordance with the regulations made under clause 73, or would be obliged to do so but for an exemption in the regulations. The regulations to be made under clause 73 will implement the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Aarhus convention on access to information, public participation in decision making, and access to justice in environmental matters—

On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> In answer to the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, I was mentioning that clause 37 covers information covered by the Aarhus convention on access to information. It may help if I give a little of the background.
<P>
The original area of disclosure in the public interest of environmental information came about in the Environmental Information Regulations 1999, which themselves implement an EC directive. The directive has within it various public interest tests which are broadly similar though they differ in particulars from the public interest tests under the Bill. Matters then moved on to the Aarhus convention, which will be enacted in this country by new regulations in due course. This also has public interest tests.
<P>
I think that I can give the right hon. Gentleman the information that he requires by referring to the structure of the Bill and reminding him that the provisions of clause 13 and the public interest test there none the less applies to clause 37. Therefore in the event of a matter not being obliged to be disclosed within the terms of the convention, which itself has public interest tests, it would none the less come within the public interest tests in the Bill by virtue of clause 13. Therefore, whichever route is used to test whether documents fall to be disclosed, there is a public interest test whose effect is broadly similar, but differs in the detail. I hope that that gives the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance.

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 151, in Clause 38, page 21, line 7, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Any request or part of a request for- information to which subsection (1) applies shall be treated as a request under section 7(2) of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the date on which the request was received under this Act shall be the date on which it was received for the purpose of that Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be brief, although not quite as brief as the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross in his wonderfully concise and short intervention at the end of the previous debate. I tabled the amendment purely for clarification and I hope for a helpful response from the Minister. The amendment relates to the time of response that will be appropriate and required by law when the Bill is enacted.
<P>
Clause 38(1) is clear, but can be challenged underclause 9(1) which allows 20 working days for a response. But, as I understand it—and I am no expert on the Data Protection Act 1998—if an applicant requested the same information under the 1998 Act—after all, to the same, commissioner, to whom there is a right of access under the Act—the time would be 40 days, under section 7(10) of that Act. So the two will seem slightly at odds with each other, and not in the best traditions of joined-up government. I hope that the amendment's solution will be that the 40 days should run from the moment of the first request, if needed—that is, a further 20 days I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will confirm that that is the intention, and it should not be 40 days with the clock ticking from the second application to the commissioner under the Data Protection Act. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees. I look forward to his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I think that I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that he needs by explaining that the Information Commissioner will police requests made not only under the Data Protection Act and the Bill, but it will not be necessary for those who seek information to say under which Act they seek it. Some applicants might seek information about themselves that is partly personal data under the Data Protection Act and partly wider material that will come under the Bill. It would be wholly wrong to require the public to specify under which statute they were making their requests. All that is necessary is that they apply to a public authority, which will determine whether the information must be given under either the Data Protection Act or the Bill. Therefore, applicants will need to make only one application. The time limit will depend on which Act applies, but that is a matter for the public authority, not the applicant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I had a horrible suspicion that, as soon as data protection was discussed, I would have to intervene. Has the Parliamentary Secretary given any thought to what his answer means for the many public authorities that must provide such information? How will they know under which Act they must provide information? Will such matters be covered in the guidance? I am thinking especially of doctors' and dentists' practices, which will clearly have enough to do simply dealing with such legislation, let alone considering the infinitely complex matter of which Act applies when a patient asks for information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman knows much about such matters, because he and I served on the Standing Committee that considered the Data Protection Bill. At present, bodies are obliged to release the information that it holds on a data subject on request under the Data Protection Act. The time line begins when the request is received—and, under the Bill, when the relevant fee has been received.
<P>
Clearly, if the information goes wider than that which bodies currently are obliged to disclose under the Data Protection Act, they may be advised to disclose it under the Bill. They will have to abide by the time limits that Parliament agrees, as set out in the Bill. The question of under which Act a body must provide the information is, in a sense, secondary. The primary question is whether or not they are obliged to disclose the information. We are putting the right to know on a statutory basis under that regime.
<P>
Public authorities have been obliged to disclose information for some time under the code of practice, although it does not contain sufficient enforcement powers to ensure that that right is readily available. Public authorities, especially the smaller ones that do not have a large administrative staff to provide the back-up necessary to get to grips with new regulations and duties, will benefit enormously from the guidance that the Information Commissioner provides about the interrelationship of the two Acts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hoped that I would be absolutely clear about the matter. I accept that the Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for Ryedale know much more about the Data Protection Act than I do. I confess that I have not read that Act, but I had better do so over the weekend. Am I wrong to think that, under the Data Protection Act, there is a right of access to the data that are exempt under the clause? If the Bill and the Act are at odds with each other, and the Parliamentary Secretary says that an application can be made under either, how will people proceed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Let me explain the matter to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. There are two concerns about the Data Protection Act interacting with the Bill. The first relates to information about which the applicant is the data subject. The Data Protection Act gives me, subject to certain limited exceptions, the right to know personal information that a public authority holds about me. That is why the Bill exempts information when the applicant is the data subject under clause 38(1). That exemption is total, because it is covered by a different statutory scheme.
<P>
The second matter is slightly more complex, and I am sure that we will come to it in the next group of amendments. When someone who is not the data subject applies for personal information, he or she is therefore affected by the Data Protection Act. It contains protections that the regime that we set up in the Bill must respect, as information about individuals is confidential and is not to be broadcast publicly. I hope that that explains the situation to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 21, line 8, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Subject to subsection (5A) below,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 149, in page 21, line 43, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) For the purposes of subsection (3), a disclosure of information shall not contravene any of the data protection principles or section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 merely because it identifies an individual, or relates to an identifiable individual, who is—
<P>
(a) a public official,
<P>
(b) a public contractor, or
<P>
(c) a representative of an organisation, acting in that capacity.
<P>
(5B) Subsection (SA) does not apply to information relating to the health, salary or disciplinary record of an individual.
<P>
(5C) In this section—
<P>
``public official'' means a Minister of the Crown, a Crown Servant or an employee or office-holder of a public authority or of an administration in the United Kingdom (within the meaning of section 26(2)), or an individual who is appointed by any of the above to any body;
<P>
``public contractor'' means an individual providing services under contract to a public authority or an individual employed by or providing services under contract to a public contractor in relation to such a contract;
<P>
``representative of an organisation'' means an individual who is communicating with a public authority on behalf of an organisation.'.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Amendment No. 149 is especially lengthy, for which I apologise.
<P>
As we begin this debate, I am even more acutely aware of my relative and absolute innocence when it comes to data protection. As one of the least technologically adept Members of the House, who still relies on the quill pen and carrier pigeon, I have always been apprehensive about data protection arising out of new technologies. I was relieved not to be asked to serve on the Standing Committee for that Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman will discover that large volumes of manual records will also be caught by the new provision.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am much reassured. The amendments pick up the points mentioned by the Minister when he responded to my previous amendment. Clause 38(2) exempts information about a third party if disclosure would contravene provisions in the Data Protection Act 1998. That Act makes no distinction between personal data about public officials acting in that capacity and personal data about their private lives. The former may be withheld when common sense dictates that doing so is inappropriate. The amendments are intended to ensure that information about public officials, public contractors and representatives of organisations when acting in that capacity is not withheld.
<P>
The Data Protection Act 1998 embodies a strong presumption that all information about identifiable individuals will be protected, including information that does not involve what would normally be regarded as private. That may include, for example, the name of the author of an official document, the identity of a Minister who took a certain decision and the names of those representing public authorities at a meeting. In future, such information may be withheld on data protection grounds. If there are other grounds for protecting such information, such as protecting the safety of someone at risk of attack or an authority's policy-making functions, there are appropriate exemptions elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>
Other freedom of information laws limit the scope for such confusion by drafting such exemptions more narrowly. Sometimes they refer expressly only to disclosures that involve an invasion of privacy or incorporate a statutory public interest test. That approach is adopted by the code that will be replaced by the Bill. However, the Government argue that the EU's data protection directive, on which the Data Protection Act 1998 is based, does not permit that. The Under-Secretary's amendment to clause 13 removes the Bill's public interest test from personal data.
<P>
The exemption for personal information in clause 38 provides that any information about an identifiable individual other than the applicant will be exempt if the disclosure contravenes any of the eight data protection principles in part 1 of schedule 1 of the 1998 Act; would breach section 10 of that Act, in relation to which matter will be crucial; or would reveal information that the subject of the information would not be allowed to see if he or she applied for it under the 1998 Act. The first of those restrictions is, perhaps, the most important.
<P>
The data protection principles, the statutory provisions and their interpretation occupy nearly seven full pages in the schedules of the Data Protection Act 1998.
<P>
[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot adjourn until the hon. Gentleman has finished speaking and the Adjournment has been proposed formally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am in a dilemma, as the amendment is complicated. I thought that we might adjourn as I got up to move it. However, I failed to catch the Whip's eye, and I thought that Committee members wanted me to begin.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. It is surely in order for the hon. Gentleman to say that he has moved his amendment, but engage in debate when the Committee next sits.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the convenience of the Committee, it is not possible to move an Adjournment while a Member is on his feet. As the hon. Gentleman points out, the Member could quickly move his amendment and return to debate when the Committee resumes its sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is not the most helpful intervention, but it is welcomed by all Committee members. Having moved my amendment, I hope to catch your eye at a later stage, Dr. Clark, to elaborate on some of the arguments.
<P>
Debate adjourned.—[Mr. Mike Hall.]
<P>
Adjourned accordingly at four minutes past Seven o'clock till Tuesday 1 February at half-past Ten o'clock.
