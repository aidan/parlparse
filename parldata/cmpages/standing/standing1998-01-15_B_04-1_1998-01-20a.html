<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 18, in page 1, line 22, after "proposed", insert "any new" [Mr. William Ross.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 20, in page 2, line 1, after "of", insert "a".
<P>
No. 21, in page 2, line 1, after "proposed", insert "new".
<P>
No. 171, in clause 10, page 6, line 16, after "proposed", insert "non-traditional".
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington):</B> As I was saying this morning, the amendments are an attempt by the hon. Members for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) and for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) to exempt traditional marches from the remit of the Parades Commission. They have argued that the Parades Commission should concern itself with new marches only.
<P>
There is an obvious difficulty with defining the term "traditional". For example, the statistics in the executive summary of the North report show that, in 1986, 1,731 parades were classified as loyalist marches. However, in 1995, 2,581 parades were classified as loyalist marches. That is a difference of 800 
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross </B>(East Londonderry): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It would make more sense if I completed my sentence. I will then allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene.
<P>
How do we define traditional marches? Are they those held in 1986 or those held in 1995? There are clear difficulties with the definition. This morning, the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) mentioned a march in his constituency, which he would not consider to be traditional. However, part of it went along the route of a traditional march.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The hon. Gentleman will recall the statistics I read out last week. To put it mildly, the police take a broad brush approach to the matter. Marches are loyalist, nationalist or other. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone pointed out, many people did not bother to give notice of a parade. In some years, rather more collecting takes place through the countryside than in others, and there is also the question of whether the police count a procession to and from a church as one and the same or as two difference ones. Are the morning and evening journeys to and from an Orange lodge to the bus take-up point considered to be one journey or two?
<P>
There are different ways of counting the number of parades, and is not the difference that the Minister mentioned more apparent than real? Under-reporting may account for some of it, or there may be rather more assembling. However, there is no way of knowing that unless one considers the police statistics in detail. However, until this year, the statistics were so broad brush as to be virtually meaningless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman confirms what I said. Defining a traditional march is not easy.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Not at the moment.
<P>
Traditional marches are not easy to define. North considered whether the commission should cover all or only some marches and concluded that the only fair way of dealing with the problem was to make provision for all marches. Otherwise, the commission will get into the realms of partiality, and we want the Bill to be fair to everyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Parades Commission is mentioned in Dr. North's report, which acknowledges that there are traditional parades. One of the criteria to be judged by the commission is
"the desirability of allowing a procession customarily held along a particular route to be held along that route."<P>

<P>
That is in Clause 7(6)(e). It is the definition of a traditional parade and is an acknowledgement that such parades can be so designated. The commission will have to designate them in making its determinations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Yes, but the North committee rejected the idea of making a distinction between traditional and other parades being considered by the commission. It came to the firm conclusion that all parades should be treated the same because although a concept such as traditional parades is easy to grasp, the detail of it is much more difficult to work with. Additionally, a traditional parade may have been acceptable in the past but may take on a new meaning in contemporary circumstances.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down spoke this morning about parades that were on a traditional route but were occurring every Friday night until midnight an obviously different context from when parades take place across the same route in the middle of the day. Demography, the scale of marches and the pattern of their conduct all may change and the Parades Commission may have to take such changes into account. For those reasons, we agree with the North report that making a distinction between traditional parades and other marches is impossible and that it would be partial to do so.
[Mr. Worthington]
<P>
I move on to amendments Nos. 18, 20 and 21. With all the weight of an Education Minister, I condemn them for their grammatical inaccuracies. They are not English [Interruption.] We are trying to raise standards and we expect the Ulster Unionists to be grammatical in their amendments. Even though they do not state it clearly, we know what the Unionists mean by their amendments. Their intention is clearly to exclude all traditional parades from the commission's remit.
<P>
Let me repeat yet again that the Bill's purpose is not to clamp down on parades. We recognise the important role that they play, particularly in the cultural life of the Protestant community. The Bill expressly requires the commission to take into account
"the desirability of allowing a procession customarily held along a particular route to be held along that route."<P>

<P>
However, sweeping exemptions of traditional parades as suggested in the amendments are neither practicable nor desirable. We want rather to ensure that the issue of parades can be placed on a new, consistent and wholly even-handed basis. We are confident that the North report provides such a foundation and that our approach is preferable to a fragmentary piecemeal approach that benefits one sort of parade over others. We therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There seems to be a problem with the acoustics in Committee today. The microphones are not picking up hon. Members as well as they should. Hansard writers have had some difficulty in hearing, so I ask all members of the Committee to speak up and direct their speeches to the Chair so that Hansard staff can hear, and to refrain from unnecessary sedentary interventions, which are also difficult for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> As always, Mr. Butterfill, we accept your strictures with good grace and in the spirit in which they are offered. We shall try to speak up. Perhaps the microphones are not low enough.
<P>
I am disappointed by the Minister's attitude. We made two suggestions: to exempt traditional parades from the ambit of the Bill, which would then cover only new parades, or, as the least of evils, to allow all parades to go ahead. That might constitute a way of dealing with processions and the problems that arise from them. I have listened carefully to the Minister. I do not think much of his argument, and we may return to the subject later.
<P>
The Minister mentioned grammar. A grammar book on the old Ulster-Scots language was recently published in Northern Ireland. I have studied the book and I hope that the Minister has done so, too. In a large part of the Province, expressions and phrases have been carried into English from the Ulster-Scots language. That is the only possible explanation for some of the expressions that one hears.

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that the phrase
"a particular proposed new public processions",
<P>
which we would create if we accepted the amendments, is grammatical in any language?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> That might be a typographical error. The meaning is clear. The Minister knows perfectly well that amendments that are not quite grammatically correct are often tabled. The Government could accept our sensible views and table an amendment on Report. Thus, the essence of the amendments would be included in the Bill, but not in such obscure and turgid legal language that the ordinary citizen could not understand it. I am sure that the ordinary citizen would understand the amendments.
<P>
I am disappointed by the Minister's persistence in following the road to trouble. I regret it, and hope that, between now and Report, the Government will have time to reconsider those matters seriously. To help to ensure that the Government have time, and with the intention of returning to the matter later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The long list covers a multitude of sins. The amendments would make the same series of changes throughout the Bill. I am prepared to bow to the Minister's superior detailed knowledge, given that he receives far more help than I do. That allows him to know how many mistakes I have made and to identify the provisions that I have missed to which the amendments should apply.
<P>
Clause 3 deals with the code of conduct; clause 4 covers procedural rules; clause 7 tackles the commissioner's power to impose conditions; clause 8 provides for the Secretary of State's review of the commission's decisions and clause 10 sets out the Secretary of State's power to prohibit processions.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some of the amendments apply to all those clauses they are an interesting mixture. I am complaining, not for the first time in Committee, about the commission changing from having an advisory role to being able to apply legal force or coercion. The amendments would return the commission to its previous role, and it has produced a large amount of documentation. If my understanding is correct, in a later proposal there is a sign that in certain circumstances the commission might accept the rules of an existing body, rather than applying its own. I am therefore curious about why it will not be satisfied with an advisory role.
<P>
As I said, I have four sheets of the amendment paper covered with my amendments. The trouble is, they do not mean very much in that form. They must be considered by referring to the Bill to discover what is intended. I have included most of the places in the Bill where these matters arise, although I may occasionally have missed a dot or a comma. For instance, amendment No. 19 states:
"leave out `issue determinations' and insert `offer advice to the Secretary of State'."
<P>
Once again, I believe that the Secretary of State or the police, if that is what the Minister wants should be given advice. The position of the commission might be redeemed, to some extent, in the eyes of the community, which believes that it, the commission exists to act against it.
<P>
There is a huge number of amendments before us, but if all the clauses were amended as I suggest, the Bill would be very much better. I have already quoted amendment No. 19 to clause 2 in respect of a proposed public procession. Amendment No. 22 to clause 3 states:
"leave out `a code' and insert `advice'";
<P>
amendment No. 23 to clause 3 states:
"leave out `Code of Conduct' and insert `advice of the Commission'."<P>

<P>
In such circumstances, people could go to the commission and say, "Your code of conduct is much to rigid. The situation in this town or village is unique; it would be much better if you modified your advice." However, if people are to be confronted with a code of conduct, written like the Commandments in tablets of stone, everyone will get stuck in a corner. People would run into all sorts of difficulties hither, thither and yonder. The commission is supposed to keep its code of conduct under review. What does that mean? Line 15 in clause 3(2)(b) states that the commission
[Mr. Ross]
"may from time to time revise the whole or any part of the Code of Conduct and issue the revised Code of Conduct."
<P>
In that case, people would have made their determinations or their plans based on the existing code of conduct and would then be confronted with a new code, which might be very different, depending on the pressure that had been exerted on the commission and on the Government. In those circumstances, the people who were organising the procession which might be a large one and had made all their arrangements would suddenly find themselves in an impossible situation. That is not good enough. The commission and the code should be a more flexible; instead of having that hard code, there should be a more flexible arrangement of advice that could be tailored to a particular situation, time and place.
<P>
We all know that as a situation develops the IRA and its fellow travellers will ensure that different circumstances will be created in different parts of the Province. We will see opposition mounted deliberately to cause the maximum trouble in areas in which there had been no trouble before.
<P>
Clause 4 refers to the procedural rules to be issued by the commission. The same arguments about flexibility could be made. It seems that the commission will issue another rigid set of rules when it would be possible to give people advice about how they should behave in particular circumstances. The circumstances will alter; what happened last year or the year before will not necessarily happen in 1998 or 1999. People always change their behaviour patterns and their attitudes, and therefore flexibility is needed.
<P>
The police can issue certain determinations and decisions, as can the Secretary of State and Ministers with responsibility for home affairs, whenever that is warranted by the conditions. However, the commission will have a set of rules that can be changed, presumably at any time and at short notice. It will be extremely foolish to go down that road. This morning, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) said that he wanted a certain amount of fluidity for the individuals who would examine particular situations. The same general principle should apply to the procedural rules. The rules and the code of conduct will have legal force. That is one of the bones of contention that we have with the Bill.
<P>
A change in the rules drove the Rev. Roy Magee out of the commission, and he has not yet been replaced by a man with similar views, or who would have similar influence with the general Protestant community. Perhaps the Government have found such an individual, but are keeping him carefully under wraps. I certainly hope so. The Rev. Magee knew the situation better than anyone else on the commission, and he decided that the change from advice to coercion was one that he could not stomach. He left the commission over that issue.
<P>
When we move from clause 4 to clause 7, we find the same series of problems, with provisions about conditions imposed by the commission. Ulster Unionist Members think that references to the imposition of conditions should be taken out and replaced with references to the giving of advice.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone tabled amendments Nos. 213 and 214. He intended that those should appear as part of a comprehensive change elsewhere: no doubt he will deal with that himself when he catches your eye, Mr. Butterfill. Throughout the Bill there is the change from the advisory capacity, from the arbitration view, to one where there is given legal authority, and criminals are made of people who only want to walk to church, unfurl their banner or whatever.
<P>
I notice that clause 7(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the conditions imposed under that subsection may include conditions as to the route of the procession".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is understandable why the Government would want that: changes to the route could be minimal or extremely large. However, the subsection continues that the commission can prohibit the procession "from entering any place". That is a wide power.
<P>
What happens if a lodge arrives home, as some have done in the last year, to discover that it is prevented from entering its Orange hall, or even getting close to it, because there is a violent mob in the street? Is that acceptable to the Committee and the Government? It is not acceptable to me.
<P>
How wide is that? It has certainly been interpreted widely in the past. Members of an Orange lodge may have arrived from the Twelfth, which may be many miles away. As happens in Dunloy all the time, they find the route to their hall blocked. They cannot enter their own property. I can think of nothing more indicative of the power of the gunmen in Northern Ireland today, the power of violence that prevents people from entering their own property.
<P>
In our experience the police usually turn up eventually and when they do, they do not say to these people, "Please desist from your violent activity and let these men enter their hall. Their wives have been in there all afternoon and have got their tea ready for them." What do they do? They tell the marchers that they cannot enter and must go home. They do not allow them to enter their own hall. Is that acceptable?
<P>
There is the other possibility, which is acceptable. The Government, the police or whoever, may say, "You have never been down that street before" which covers the point made by the hon. Member for South Down this morning "and we are not letting you down that street". That is fair enough. It is a decision to which people may object on occasion but we can live with it. But to be told that one cannot enter a place is very wide.
<P>
If it were any particular street where there might be some trouble, we could live with it. The violent would have had their way on that procession on that day and we would put up with it and talk to the police and the Government about it on a future date. But any place? It might not be just the Orange hall suppose the banner were to be unfurled in a field. It is quite common for a 12th of July procession to meet in a field. Those involved could be prevented from entering it under the Bill.
<P>
Can we be told exactly how the Government intend the measure to be used? Can we also be told how they intend to prevent unusual use which, in relation to entering villages to go to Orange halls which we own, would be quite wrongful use of the legislation? It is simply wrong for it to be written in that way. I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter; it is not what we believe it should be.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The rest of the amendments up to amendment No. 148 fall under the general thesis that the conditions should not be imposed, but that advice should be given. Clause 7(4) states:
"The Commission may, in accordance with the procedural rules, amend or revoke any determination issued under this section."
<P>
Amendment No. 145, which would delete those lines, is probing. The commission can amend or revoke determination after it is made, but there is no time limit. The commission may say, "This is Tuesday, and we have no objection to this procession taking place on Friday, Saturday or Sunday; it can go ahead." It may issue a determination on that basis.
<P>
On Thursday, Friday or Saturday, however, threats are made, and a concerned residents association is rapidly formed in that town or village. That residents association will go not to the commission, given the anger against the Secretary of State, but to the press. When the chairman and members of the commission read the papers on the Friday or Saturday morning, they will discover that there has been some wonderful meeting of concerned residents all 10 of them in some places, and all half dozen in another place at which it was decided that the procession should not go ahead. All sorts of mayhem, violence and confrontation are offered and the commission may then amend or revoke the determination that has been made.
<P>
That is astonishing. Such events are not just hypothetical; they have, in fact, happened on the day of the procession, whenever the mob has gathered. The commission, having already agreed that the procession is perfectly lawful and legal, is blocked by a mob in the streets.
<P>
The Committee will note that amendment No. 213, tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone, would delete only the words
"in accordance with the procedural rules".
<P>
My hon Friend will discuss that in this remarks.
<P>
The commission is given very wide powers in these circumstances. I do not believe that those powers should be in the hands of a quango, the members of which are dependent upon the Government for their posts. I would have thought that, if we really wanted something that was acceptable, the Government would give those people only the capacity to offer advice. The advice would be offered not only to the Secretary of State and to the people processing, but to objectors and above all to the police, who have to carry into effect the final decision.
<P>
Clause 7((5)(c) refers to
"what conditions should be imposed by a determination (or amended determination) issued under this section."
<P>
What is meant by that? The conditions are not limited in any way whatsoever. Do they mean that the procession can make its way down the street every half an hour, or that it cannot go down the street at all; that it must carry no banners or flags; play only certain tunes or that there should be only one band? Do they mean that there shall be no wearing of orange sashes, collarettes or Apprentice Boys' regalia? Will people do exactly as they are told? In such circumstances, the Protestant community will say, "Well, no independent body would be so stupid as to lay down such daft conditions. They have been demanded by somebody else. Who? The IRA."
<P>
The Government have been trying to get away from the question of who is the determinant, but they cannot, because that is who will be laying down the fierce conditions. Only last year, conditions were demanded by the IRA Sinn Fein in Bellaghy that were not in relation to an orange march at all. In the autumn, on Remembrance day, when the commemoration service was taking place, some groups objected to the banners of the Royal Air Force, the British Legion and the Royal Naval Association. They objected because the union flag was in the corner. That clearly exposes the thinking of those people. They object to the claim to sovereignty. Insofar as the claim to sovereignty is sustained and made by flying or carrying the union flag in any part of Northern Ireland, they object to it. The Minister should keep that well in the front of his mind in relation to this clause.
<P>
I have the most difficult problems with this element of the proposed legislation. Great powers are being given to the commission to impose conditions on what people may do when they are marching down the road. The commission could say that they cannot wear a band uniform, bowler hats, or whatever. All sorts of things could be included, some of which may appear a bit daft, but I have lived a long time in Northern Ireland and have seen what has been demanded and what has been yielded to. Nothing is too daft or too far fetched for me any more. I can think of very little that would not be demanded at one time or another.
<P>
Further down on page 5 of the Bill, clause 8 refers to the review of the determinations made by the commission which shall, on application by the Chief Constable, be reviewed by the Secretary of State. Clause 8(2) refers to the Secretary of State, who may "revoke the determination". That is covered by amendment No. 187, which would leave out those words and insert "ignore the advice". If we move from the coercive force that the Bill presently has to an advisory role, the Secretary of State could look at advice issued by the commission under clause 7 and simply ignore it. That is straightforward and I see no difficulty with the amendment. When that basic principle is accepted, far from being judge, jury and executioner, the commission will become an advisory body.
<P>
Amendment No. 188 would leave out clause 8(2)(b), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"amend the determination by amending or revoking any condition imposed by the determination or by adding any new condition".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, I believe that the power should, in the first instance, lie completely with the Secretary of State. The police could consider the situation and say, "We are not happy with the advice given to the Secretary of State. Here is the security situation and the background information which may not have been available to the commission. In the light of that, we think that you should do so and so." The Secretary of State would thus be made aware of all the circumstances surrounding a[Mr. Ross]
procession and would be in a much stronger position to say that she had considered the matter and would change the advice that had been given, impose a new condition or remove a particular piece of advice. That would be far more satisfactory.
<P>
Interestingly, clause 8(3)(b) contains the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"what amendments should be made to a determination".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have tabled an amendment on that subject which rather cuts across clause 8(2)(b). If, under subsection (2)(b), the Secretary of State has the power to amend or revoke
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any condition imposed by the determination"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or to add a new condition, I see no need for subsection (3)(b). It seems to restate what has been set down in subsection (2)(b).
<P>
Subsection (3) also states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Secretary of State shall have regard to the guidelines".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should have thought that we could leave it to our own God-given good sense. If the Secretary of State is given advice by the police and various other bodies and has listened to what the various contenders have had to say, she could reach a fair determination herself and give good reasons for it.
<P>
Amendment No. 190 to clause 8(3)(b) would leave out the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"revoke, amend or confirm a determination"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"ignore, accept in whole or part the advice".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, the commission's powers should be advisory only. The same issue arises in subsection (4). Amendment No. 193 would remove the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"before revoking, amending or confirming a determination"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"ignoring, or accepting in whole or part, advice from the Commission".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In such circumstances, that would be the sensible way to proceed.
<P>
On page 6 of the Bill, amendment No. 196 would replace "a determination" with "advice" in subsection (5); and amendment No. 197 would make the same change to subsection (6). Amendment No. 198 would remove the word "revoked" and amendment No. 199 would remove the word "determination" so that subsection (6) would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"rejected by the Secretary of State ... shall not issue any further advice under section 7".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have taken some care. I hope that I have not missed any uses of the words "determination" and so forth, but it is possible.
<P>
Subsection (7) also includes all that nonsense, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where any determination of the Commission is revoked, amended or confirmed under this section".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 200 would change that to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether their advice has been accepted, or rejected in whole or in part".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have tried to be as reasonable as I can in this series of amendments. I object to the present theory underlying the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I remember the cheers in the House when the poll tax went through, and I hope that I do not hear more cheers for the Bill than I heard then.
<P>
Amendment No. 168 refers to clause 10(7) and would leave out the words
"to revoke any previous determination made"<P>

<P>
and insert the phrase, "override any advice given". I have tried to change the language of my amendments somewhat, but I hope that the meaning of this amendment is clear and that the Committee will understand why I am trying to make such changes to the Bill.
<P>
The measures on page 14 of the Bill deal with the code of conduct and procedural rules. I am a little surprised because I thought that one of my amendments referred to the guidelines, but I have now discovered that those will be dealt with later in our proceedings. I must ask you, Mr. Butterfill, and the Clerk after the sitting has finished, what is happening. We are always learning in this place and, rather than look through "Erskine May", a useful short cut is to ask the Chairman and the Clerk, as they can usually give us good reasons why a certain procedure has been adopted when dealing with amendments.
<P>
If lines 34 and 35 were left out from schedule 2, reference to the code of conduct and the procedural rules would be removed. Under amendment No. 48, the words "Advice of the Commission" would replace the words "Code of Conduct". It is a probing amendment because I am trying to understand the background to the procedural rules. The general procedures and rules to be followed are set out not only in the Bill, but in previous legislation that goes back to at least 1908. It was changed in 1951 and subsequently in 1986-87. Various smaller changes were also made during that time.
<P>
During the past 90 years, the law has been framed in such a way that the individuals who took part in processions knew perfectly well what constituted acceptable behaviour and what did not. The truth is that 999 times out of 1,000 and probably even more times than that there was no problem and people did not need a set of detailed rules. They knew how to behave. They took part in processions or demonstrations and then returned home. The folk who objected strongly to them simply stayed at home and continued their day's work.
<P>
We know that 17 March is St. Patrick's day. However, having the name "Ross", I cannot do otherwise but look to another patron saint. As the Committee will appreciate, St. Andrew was supposed to have sprung from Clan Ross. Not all members of the Committee may know that, but I am sure that the Minister knows the tradition. That I would look to St. Andrew as he was perhaps a distant ancestor of mine rather than St. Patrick is not to denigrate the work that Patrick did in Ireland.
<P>
What happens on 17 March is divided between religious processions and the processions by members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians which have a strong religious flavour and which, usually, I recall, wind up at mass in the local chapel or the Roman Catholic church. They are very pleasant to watch; it is just a pity that St. Patrick chose 17 March rather than 17 May as the weather is normally better in May. There are two very different sorts of procession. Some, such as the Church of Ireland procession for St. Patrick at Saul in County Down to which I have never been are totally religious occasions. Of course, such occasions tend to be religious and political and people talk about Irish nationalism, and so forth. It is perfectly acceptable to the Protestant community that such processions take place. The honour of the patron saint of the island of Ireland is something that unites everyone. We have been very much indebted to the good man down the years; whether we think as much of the Christianity that we have sometimes seen exhibited in Ireland is another matter.
<P>
In all the long years during which those various religious, quasi-religious, political and quasi-political processions by the Ancient Order of Hibernians have taken place on 17 March, they have caused no one great concern. They did not need a code of conduct; they knew how to behave.
<P>
The various loyalist organisations did exactly the same. Band parades vary enormously in size and frequency. Some of them are very large; one such parade is that held in Garvagh. It is nothing to do with the loyalist order; it just happens to consist of Protestant, Unionist and Orange bands. It is held to raise cash for cancer, which it does successfully ever year. That parade has never needed a code of conduct or procedural rules. Those involved know how to go about things; the law was plain, and they had no difficulty in the wide world in making arrangements with the police, giving proper notice and carrying on with their parade.
<P>
I question the need for this wonderful code of conduct, which can and will be changed periodically in the light of experience. The Minister told us earlier that errors of judgment are likely to be made, which could lead to all sorts of problems. If so, it will be vital to make rapid changes but, as I said earlier, such rapid changes could render redundant arrangements already be made by other bodies and cause them immense difficulties.
<P>
As I said, I am grateful to the Minister for sending me the leaflets; I received them only yesterday and did not have time to read them before I left, but I will read them carefully because I am sure that we will be returning to the matter again and again. We are a long way from the finish in the matter. Before we are finished, I hope that the constant explanation that we have to give will be absorbed by the Government and that they will see the error of their ways and take our wise advice I think that wise is the operative word.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> We have had an extensive debate, although I appreciate that because of the grouping of amendments some of it has applied not just to the clause, but to other clauses as well. However, subject to progress on other clauses, I am minded not have a stand part debate and to use my powers under Standing Order No. 68. That means that I may be a little more lenient in interpreting the context of comments on the remaining amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I seek clarification, Mr. Butterfill. Amendments Nos. 213 and 214 apply to clause 7, and would be better considered under that clause than under other clauses.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The decision to group those amendments with the others was made because it was felt that they applied to the powers of the Commission and that the clause that is principally concerned with the principle of the commission's powers is clause 2. I appreciate that clause 7 defines the commission's powers in greater detail, but it is a difficult decision to say whether the amendments should have been dealt with separately. If was felt that the debate on the general principles would flow better if they were dealt with in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank you, Mr. Butterfill, for your explanation. May I take it that if amendments Nos. 213 and 214, which I believe are important, are rejected, the arguments about clause 7 will be prejudiced? I am not too worried about when the amendments are considered, provided that they do not prejudice amendment to clause 7.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> At this atage, we cannot give any undertakings about the other amendments, except to say that they will be duly considered when we come to clause 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
We are considering a large number of amendments on the specific powers of the commission, especially its power to make determinations. They apply to the commission's extensive powers to deal with not only its own procedure but the conduct of marches and the guidelines to make determinations.
<P>
We have great difficulty with the fact that the commission can make determinations on issues that do not relate to law and order or to public order, but fall completely outside those areas. We contend that once one veers away from law-and-order issues, one is going against the European convention on human rights. We argue that those who march to display their culture and religious affiliation are completely entitled so to do provided that they are marching peaceably and within the law.
<P>
We believe that to say that a march cannot take place, or should be rerouted, because people are carrying banners or playing a tune that others do not like, is a complete contravention of the European convention on human rights, article 11 of which states:
"Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests."
<P>
Article 10 states:
"Everybody has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers."
<P>
Article 14 tells us:
"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, associated with a national minority, property, birth or other status."
<P>
Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, states that it is unlawful for public authorities
"to discriminate, or aid, induce or incite another to discriminate in the discharge of functions relating to Northern Ireland against any person or class of persons on the ground of religious belief or political opinion."
<P>
If the issues in the Bill veer outside those of public order they contradict the European convention. The commissioners, we find, have wide powers. They can ban a procession indeed, they can impose such conditions as the commission considers necessary. The commissioners can do what they like; they are free to do anything. If they do not like something, they can impose conditions, which contravenes the European convention.
<P>
Various guidelines lay down what has to be done. Notice must be given to people in the vicinity. Various actions must be taken and if a person objects, he has to be dealt with. All these things have nothing to do with law and order because, under the convention, people have the right to march and to display their culture without objectors being entitled to impose conditions upon them. Will the Minister clarify the position? Does he disagree that the rules infringe the convention? If the Bill goes through the House of Commons and the commission tries to impose some of these rules on loyalist parades, I give him this assurance: it will be tried in that body as an infraction against the rights of the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Bill opens a door, and under it almost anything can be used to limit and reroute a parade. These procedures are ridiculous because, if the code of practice is not followed, a parade can be rerouted. Stipulations about places of worship state that even when a service is not taking place a hymn tune must be played when a parade passes a church. What can be the logic behind that? I do not accept that it is necessary. It seems ridiculous. Who is likely to object? The people in the graveyard will not rise up to do so. They will not hear the music. They may hear the final trump when they will be resurrected to life or damnation, but they will not hear the tone of a band passing the church.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> When we hold a service in my church on 17 March we usually hear the Ancient Order of Hibernians band passing. It causes no annoyance to anyone inside the thick walls of the church.
<P>
People might object in some circumstances for instance if a Lambeg drum was being played outside the church for hours; especially if it was a Catholic church. That would be different. However, even during a service a band walking past does not really annoy anybody, whether it is playing a hymn tune or a march. I think that that point is greatly exaggerated by people who object to parades and processions anyway. As my hon. Friend says, if there is no service, there is no one to be annoyed. Perhaps Labour Members consider a church to be a building, but my hon. Friend and I do not share that view. We think that the church is the people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention.
<P>
A further point that is made is that if a service is under way, respect should be shown. In general throughout Northern Ireland that happens, and bands do not play during a service. In fact, people who are listening to a boring sermon might be glad to listen to music as it passes; it might wake them up.
<P>
It says in the document that only hymn tunes should be played while passing war memorials. What kind of nonsense is that? Every November a grand parade takes place by the cenotaph, with bands moving back and forth playing marches, not hymn tunes. I am sure that if those who are commemorated by war memorials were to return, they would rejoice to hear a hymn tune or a march, and not want to be confined to the former.
<P>
Another piece of nonsense is that no sectarian tunes are to be played. I contend that there is no such thing as a sectarian tune. If a tune is sung with sectarian words it may well be objectionable, but music is not sectarian. The idea that people should have to stop playing a tune because someone else does not like it is nonsense. Such ideas seem to be in the code of conduct.
<P>
I noticed that the Minister found mirth in the idea that there is no such thing as a sectarian tune. I have listened to Republican bands, which have often played the very tunes that the Orange bands play. The repertoire of pipe music is fairly broad. The idea that it is sectarian is nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> My hon. Friend should not confine himself to discussing pipe tunes. Many of the bands are flute bands descendants of the old military regimental fife and drum bands. Practically every tune played by flute bands in Northern Ireland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom is a military march. One of my friends has a collection of 800 or more of those tunes, and he could give the Minister a first-class lecture on their origin.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. Such restrictions make us wary. Those of us from Northern Ireland who have been associated with quangos are familiar with such thinking. Many members of quangos are anti-Orange and anti-parades. They therefore devise stipulations with which marchers find it difficult to comply. The threat is clear: if the marchers do not agree to everything, they will be stopped or rerouted. That is madness.
<P>
I support the amendments. The commission should not have the power to make determinations on a march. Of course, if it wants to give advice, I am happy for it to do so. However, determinations on such criteria will fall outside the rights and freedoms that we enjoy as British citizens.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I shall briefly focus on amendment No. 19, although I appreciate that my points may have wider application. The amendment goes to the heart of my disquiet about the Bill. It encapsulates my main anxiety, and I hope that the Minister will deal with that when he replies.
<P>
The Bill bestows on the commission a legal and executive power. I have consistently quarrelled with that because the commission's role should be restricted to being purely advisory. My argument is based on two propositions. First, in the normal course of events, responsibility for public order should be a matter for the Chief Constable and for nobody else. That is the case for the overwhelming majority of non-contentious marches.
<P>
Secondly, in exceptional circumstances, such as the few parades that give rise to problems, the Secretary of State should intervene and take responsibility. I remember incurring the wrath of the previous Secretary of State when I said that his judgment erred over Drumcree in 1996. The Government should have taken a decision as soon as the scale of the potential trouble became apparent.
<P>
As the hon. Member for East Londonderry said, amendment No. 19 would remove the legal and executive role of the commission and would make it purely advisory. If I heard the Minister correctly this morning, he said that the Bill sought to take politics out of the parades issue. My fear is that without the amendment the Bill will inject its own brand of politics into it. By giving the commission legal and executive authority, the Bill creates the potential for conflict and confrontation between the commission and the Chief Constable, because if the Chief Constable is unhappy with a decision or a ruling made by the commission he can appeal to the Secretary of State to intervene.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would be a mistake to create the circumstances in which the Chief Constable might have to challenge the commission's decision, perhaps with some publicity. That could belittle the standing of both the Chief Constable and the commission, but it could be avoided if the Chief Constable was clearly in the driving seat, if he alone had retained his legal and executive authority and the role of the commission was purely advisory. When that greater power is given to the commission, there is a potential for public conflict and confrontation between it and the Chief Constable.
<P>
The argument can be taken a stage further because the Bill also creates the potential for conflict and confrontation between the Secretary of State and the commission. I refer to clause 10 to illustrate my point. As a result of the Government giving legal and executive authority to the commission, the Secretary of State, by exercising her powers in clause 10, could decide to prohibit some parades. That could create the same circumstances for public confrontation between the Secretary of State and the commission and could belittle the authority and standing of both.
<P>
The Government are making a mistake in giving legal and executive authority to the commission. There should be no such parallel authority within the structure. The overriding authority in each instance should be the Chief Constable or the Secretary of State. The role of the commission should be advisory, hence my support for amendment No. 19.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I want to return the Committee to the start of our debate on these amendments. The hon. Member for East Londonderry said that he would bow to my superior knowledge, although I may be less than precise in quoting what he said. That made me reflect on what he said in the previous debate that I was brainwashed by the Northern Ireland Office. However, the hon. Member for West Tyrone said that one cannot expect everything that is said in these debates to have great accuracy. Something in our discussions must have some effect. Those two statements cannot sit accurately side by side. The hon. Gentlemen should discuss with each other the role that they want me to play.
<P>
One of the North report's main recommendations was that the Parades Commission should take over from the police the power to make legally binding determinations on contentious parades. That is the fundamental issue that underpins the North report, as has been shown by what has flowed from the debate on the amendments.
<P>
Amendments No. 19, 45, 138, 139 to 148, 185 to 191, 193, 196 and 200 would effectively remove from the commission the power to make determinations and replace it with the power to give advice only. That is the nub of the debate. The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) set out the rationale for and the reasoning behind the amendments; but the North report was a qualitative assessment of the circumstances that prevailed in recent years in Northern Ireland and how best to deal with the resulting conflicts of interest within existing legislation. That had caused problems because of conflict in sections of the community about the application of those decision-making processes, which were sometimes reversed under pressure. The North report recommended a different approach. That is the reason for the Bill and for the amendments. The Government wanted to include different levels of qualitative decision making to ensure that we do not repeat the problems of the past.
<P>
As I understand it, the hon. Members for Basingstoke, for West Tyrone and for East Londonderry have said that the problems would be solved by giving the commission the power to give advice. Why did not the North report come to that conclusion? It did not do so because it recognised the importance of allocating to the commission powers to find ways round the problems that had existed in the past. If the power to make determinations is taken away from the commission, as is proposed by the amendments, no other body will have that power. The amendments remove a power, but do not give it to anyone else. That contradicts the statements of the hon. Members for Basingstoke, for West Tyrone and for East Londonderry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I shall clarify the issue. The commission will deal with all parades, not only contentious parades. That is an important point. There are thousands of ordinary parades on which the commission will have to make determinations. The practical difficulties of that are immense and have not been addressed. My amendment addresses the final point made by the Minister and proposes that the power to make determinatons should reside only with the Chief Constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Technically, that is not correct. Schedule 4 also includes powers under the Public Order Order to take away the Chief Constable's responsibility. There has been no reference to that point in the debate although we may cover it when we reach schedule 4. The hon. Gentleman dealt with one aspect of the matter but not the totality. We have to deal with the inaccuracies and we must try to understand the import of the amendments. The thrust of the amendments would take power away from one body, but would not allow it to reside elsewhere. That would create a dangerous and unacceptable vacuum. If that assessment[Mr. Ingram]
of the amendments is correct, it would contradict what Dr. North was trying to achieve in his report and what the Government are trying to do in the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 45, 138 and 147 would empower the commission to issue advice, but they do not explain to whom such advice would be offered. The assumption would be that it would be offered to the body empowered to make determinations, but the previous amendments do not specify who that body or individual should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Is the Minister satisfied with the situation created by the Bill, whereby the Secretary of State might be obliged, in some circumstances, to choose between the judgment of the commission and that of the Chief Constable? That is an unenviable position for the Secretary of State. Whatever decision she makes in those circumstances could have only an adverse effect on the standing and authority of the person or body she does not support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Powers reside with the Secretary of State at present. The hon. Member for Basingstoke refers to the decision taken in 1995 at Drumcree, which was then reversed. Judgments have to be made in such circumstances. The Bill seeks to avoid those circumstances, not provoke them. That clearly demands good will among everyone associated with parades, protests and counter demonstrations in Northern Ireland. They must recognise how the rest of the United Kingdom and international opinion views what happens at Drumcree or anywhere else where these contentious marches take place. There is a major conflict on the streets.
<P>
Whatever the cause of those major conflicts, the RUC are there in large numbers. The Army has to turn out in large numbers. We either have to ban a parade or allow it to proceed. Does that reflect well on Northern Ireland? Every hon. Member who has the best interests of Northern Ireland at heart should take account of those images and ask, "How do we avoid it?" The status quo is not the way to avoid it. That is what is being argued by trying to diminish the power of the commission by giving it an advisory role only.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> We are concerned about the image of Northern Ireland, but unlike the Government we recognise that those who are intent upon causing trouble are determined to do Northern Ireland's image the maximum damage. That body is the IRA and its fellow travellers. We on this Bench also believe that the best interests of Northern Ireland are served by remaining within this kingdom. This whole affair is part and parcel of that struggle with the IRA a fact that the Government are steadfastly refusing to accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> What the hon. Gentleman wants to be the case, and analyses from his perspective should be the case, unfortunately is not always accepted by a sizeable proportion of the community in Northern Ireland and hence conflict arises. His argument may carry a lot of weight and may be accurate, but that is not the reality of the situation.
<P>
We deal in Northern Ireland with contentious parades. Clearly the commission has the power to offer determinations in relation to any parade. But we should set our mind only to those parades where contention is likely, whether it is 15, 20 or slightly more, to see that we can avoid that happening again. What the hon. Gentleman may wish is not what is happening in reality. It is not all sweetness and light in Northern Ireland. There are major points of conflict. There are great divisions within communities and we must look for ways to resolve that. That is why Dr. North came to his conclusion. That is why he examined the matter in the way he did and came to the solutions that are set out in the Bill.
<P>
Amendments No. 148, 185 to 191, 193 and 196 to 198. Instead of empowering the Secretary of State to revoke the commission's determination, the amendments would empower her to ignore its advice. Whereas arguments have been advanced about trying to avoid points of conflict, simply ignoring advice could also be seen to bring forward a point of conflict. These amendments imply that the Secretary of State would have the power to make decisions on parades. If that is the intention, they do not achieve it. Simply putting in a power to ignore advice does not give the Secretary of State power to do something; it merely gives her the power to be negative rather than positive. That is why those amendments are not helpful.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry said that clause 8(2)(b) made clause 8(3)(b) redundant. I would argue that that is incorrect. Clause 8(2)(b) gives the Secretary of State the power to amend the commission's determination; while clause 8(3)(b) provides that when deciding whether to amend a determination,
"the Secretary of State shall have regard to the guidelines."
<P>
In other words, the Secretary of State should consider the same factors considered by the commission in coming to its determination. One subsection confers the power and the other defines how it should be exercised. Clause 8(3)(b) is not redundant but serves a specific purpose.
<P>
In establishing where the power rests and who will be making decisions about parades, the import of the Bill is that the commission must have new powers if the North recommendations are to be effective. That is why I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
I wish to deal now with amendments Nos. 22 to 32, 33 to 36, 213, 214, 168 and 169. The production by the Parades Commission of a code of conduct for parades was an important recommendation in the North report. A code of conduct should provide guidance to those who organise parades as well as regulating the conduct of participants. That approach has widespread support throughout Northern Ireland.
<P>
The set of procedures in such a code of conduct will have to be followed by the Parades Commission as well as by the RUC and organisers of parades another recommendation in the North report. A clearly defined code of conduct and set of procedures will assist everyone to understand the parameters within which both the Parades Commission and the organisers of parades will have to function. It will also assist those who are affected by the decisions and determinations of the Parades Commission.
<P>
The effect of amendments Nos. 22 to 32, 33 to 36, 213, 168 and 169 would be to replace the requirement for the commission to produce a specific code of conduct and procedural rules with the requirement simply to produce advice. However, in a sense, I fail to recognise the difference between them. What will the advice be if not comparable to what is laid down in the code of conduct and procedural rules? We were not told what the advice would be; only that some criticisms were made of the documents. I remind members of the Committee that these remain consultative documents.
<P>
I should like to ask the hon. Member for West Tyrone whether he consulted the Parades Commission. Has he provided the commission with the details of the critical points that he raised in Committee? He has three months in which to do that. If he was responsible in his criticisms of how the Parades Commission has gone about its business, he would have expressed his view and gained a better understanding of the commission's drafting of the code of conduct and procedural rules.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> If the Minister reads the legislation he will see that the draft rules will emerge only after the Bill becomes law, so there is no point in talking about them now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman misses a fundamental point. The reason that the rules were published, if I remember correctly, on 27 October well in advance of the Bill being considered in this place was to allow consultation and discussion of the way in which the Parades Commission would go about its business. That left plenty of time for those who were concerned about the application of the new rules. The hon. Gentleman should not wait for the Bill to become an Act before reacting to it. If the Bill does not become an Act, the hon. Gentleman's input to amend or improve in his view the code of conduct will not have been wasted. The views that he has expressed in the debate will be useful to those considering how to deal with this complex situation. However, I must tell the hon. Gentleman that, given the Government's majority, the Bill is likely to become an Act, although it still has to be considered in this Committee, on the Floor of the House and, if amended, in the other place. The hon. Gentleman could have taken a fair guess about what would happen to the Bill, but the benefit of the hon. Gentleman's wisdom might well have improved the Parades Commission's thinking on procedural rules and codes of guidance.
<P>
The amendments are not helpful. They would counteract the thrust of what Dr. North tried to achieve in his comprehensive report, on which the Bill has been largely based. This is an attempt to find new ways forward, different from those that have been tried which did not avoid the disastrous and damaging scenes that we have witnessed in recent years.
<P>
If hon. Members have doubts about the proposals, is it not worth setting them aside while proposing improvements? Let us seek a different way forward. If the law has not worked, let us find another way one based on mediation and consultation, and perhaps one that takes into account the concepts that were proposed by the European Commission of Human Rights, which would give rights to those who have not been given the right to lawful assembly, which, effectively, means the right to march.
<P>
Our proposals are about trying to create a different set of conditions in Northern Ireland conditions which people want to be improved for the betterment of everyone who lives in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I am interested to hear the Minister's comment that this is in a sense a trial run. I appreciate that we are spending much time considering legislation, but one of the problems is that what looks good on paper does not necessarily work in practice. Given his comments, can we take it that the Government will keep the proposals under review and, if they do not work, that there will be a willingness to consider either another proposal or a return to the previous position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If the current process in which all the main political parties in Northern Ireland are involved with the exception of two Unionist parties comes to a conclusion in May, a devolved assembly, which could consider such matters in its own right, might be created. Therefore, if the legislation was not working as envisaged, that new democratic body could set up a review to consider how to proceed.
<P>
I am not saying that this is a trial run in which we shall suck it and see. We believe that the proposals are much more substantial than that. There has been a detailed assessment of existing provisions and powers and we have sought ways to improve them.
<P>
I remind the Committee that we have inherited some of the proposals from the previous Administration. I would hazard a guess that if the previous Administration had continued in government, something similar would have been introduced. They would have built on the basis of the North report and it is a matter of regret that we did not have it in place for the 1997 marching season because we could have learnt so much.
<P>
Legislation, in any event, must be dynamic. If it is not working, it must be reconsidered and re-examined. It would be wrong for the Government to say that they had everything absolutely right. It is not something that any Government can say at any time certainly not on an issue as complex and difficult as this, when major serious divisions exist in the community in Northern Ireland.
<P>
This is more than a trial run. It is an important step forward, which we believe commands substantial support. That can be tested when the commission begins to make its determinations on the best knowledge on the ground. That is why we believe that the clause should stand as drafted without being amended by converting a power of determination to a power of advice. On that basis, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> One or two interesting points were raised by the Minister's remarks. He talked about the possibility of a devolved Administration in Northern Ireland. It seemed to me, and my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone, that the Minister was indicating that that body would have power over[Mr. William Ross]
parades and, therefore, over law and order. Is he seriously contemplating that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I did not put a time on it, but what is happening in the talks process is on an open agenda. Would that all the contentious issues could automatically be transferred over. It would be the best environment for Northern Ireland if the people themselves could deal with the complexity of the issues that have riven them over the years. The hon. Gentleman is probably correct in saying that matters relating to security and policing are issues that should not be transferred at an early stage. But we can always hope that the people of Northern Ireland will want a political structure that can deal with those issues, as indeed, they will be transferred to Scotland under the legislation that is currently proceeding through Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I am delighted to hear the Minister saying that those issues will be transferred to Scotland. Is he also going to suggest that the Government will accept the same system of government for Northern Ireland? Now he is shaking his head; so, he is saying that democracy is good enough for Scotland, but not for Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is not for me to decide what comes out of those talks, but a matter for the participants and then, more importantly, for the people of Northern Ireland. They will determine their democratic future not a Minister, and certainly not me in the role that I have been asked to undertake by the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I think that we are getting a bit far from the issue, but it seems that the Minister is saying that it is a completely open agenda, whereas the paper that we had a week ago suggests that it is very much a closed agenda that we can operate only in certain circumstances. If the Minister is saying that it is an open agenda, that raises all sorts of very interesting possibilities that will not be totally acceptable to the hon. Member for South Down.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, I do not want to stray into what my parliamentary colleagues are debating elsewhere at present. I want to consider again what the Minister has said and to look briefly at the code of conduct, which I touched on in my earlier remarks. It seems to me that the Government and the House have not yet faced up to the real cause of the violence that we have seen in recent years. We continually tell the Committee that the violence has nothing to do with a particular procession going down the road. It has to do with the overall assault on Northern Ireland's position in the United Kingdom. Let no member of the Committee doubt that the organisers of the confrontations are not ordinary citizens, but the thugs and gunmen who have plagued us for many years. Some of them, having served prison sentences, are now out on the streets organising such activities. Those are the people to whom my party is invited to talk. We will not talk to Sinn Fein face to face in the present talks in Northern Ireland, any more than the SDLP is prepared to talk to our people in the forum or Sinn Fein, for that matter. If the Minister or anyone else thinks that the Orange institution will go cap in hand to the IRA because that is what it boils down to and ask if it is all right to walk down the street, he can forget it. that is not going to happen and he had better get it through his head now. That issue as much as any other lies at the root of our concern about the Bill.
<P>
I have been glancing through the code of conduct. I read it for the first time the other day and had to go back over it to confirm that I had read what I thought I had. Some of it is amazing. For instance, on the first page, the introduction by the chairman of the Parades Commission states:
"The Commission's decision will be legally binding, but it is our fervent hope that we will have to exercise this function on only a very limited number of occasions."<P>

<P>
I am sorry to have to tell the Minister that that hope is very wide of the mark. We have said from the outset that there are as many contentious parades as the IRA may want and have the capacity to create in a given year or area. One thing is certain. After people have got rid of a procession from one street or town, a contentious parade will appear in the next one. That is the experience of many years, and there is no sign of it changing.
<P>
What are the areas to which the procedural rules refer? Are they geographical, cultural, religious or ethnic? The term "area" is not defined. Perhaps an exact description could be given.
<P>
The introduction mentions the commission's role in going out to acquire information about the factors detailed in the guidelines. It states that the commission will
"express an informal broad view of... an overall pattern of parades in contentious areas".<P>

<P>
I am sorry, but whenever the officers begin to acquire information they will find that it comes largely from people opposed to a procession or series of processions. The participants and organisers will not be particularly interested. They may write to the commission to say, "We have always held a procession here and intend to do it again this year." However, it is not difficult for the IRA to get 100 people to write or attend to say, "We are very much against it. We live close by, our relations live close by, and we are not very happy with the procession. We demand that they stop and we are now 51 per cent. of the population in the relevant street" however one defines the population "and have a majority. So the procession must stop." In those circumstances a procession that was not contentious a year before would immediately become so.
<P>
Paragraph 1.3 of the procedural rules states that where processions
"are contentious, a corresponding pattern of protest activity has developed."
<P>
It has been developed only by those who are intent on ensuring that parades become contentious and that confrontation occurs. The rules also state:
"Commissioners will be allocated to individual locations to consider the available information and form a preliminary view on the outcome."<P>

<P>
If problems arise in many areas, one commissioner may be left to come to an informal view on a problem. It is all very well to say that the commission will express an informal, broad view, but that view will be formed by the individual or the two individuals who go to the area.
<P>
Paragraph 1.4 of the booklet on procedural rules states that
"the Commission will aim to stimulate constructive early debate on parades".<P>

<P>
The chance of any debate being constructive is

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying a little from the amendments. They propose to remove the code of conduct and replace it with advice. He is straying to a detailed discussion of the contents of the draft code of conduct as set out for consultation. Such a discussion would be more appropriate in a debate on clause 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> It may be that your assessment is correct, Mr. Butterfill, but I am outlining good reasons from the contents of the booklet as to why the amendment should be accepted. If you wish me, Mr. Butterfill, to discuss the issue on clause 3, I will be happy to go over it again when we have even more time to consider it. None the less, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 2, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and publish the evidence that led to its conclusion".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we shall take the following amendments: No. 181, in clause 7, page 5, line 9, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and will publish the evidence upon which its decision is made".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 182, in clause 7, page 5, line 11, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and will publish the evidence upon which its decision was made".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> These are simple amendments. There may be fewer of them, but they are as important as the group that we have just debated. I am sure that the Minister has read them carefully and has been given advice about them. It will be clear to him that what we are getting at is open government.
<P>
The Government have again been put in the position where they have to convince people that the changes being made are acceptable and that they are based on solid foundations. Given the contentious nature of some decisions, people will be convinced only when they read all the evidence. The booklet on procedural rules shows that public and private evidence can be taken. Although the public evidence will be heard by the public who wish to listen to it, the written evidence will not necessarily be published [Interruption.] How is anyone to know, on the basis of half the story, whether a decision was correct? That is the point at issue.
<P>
The evidence may be strong enough to convince the commission, the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable either that a parade should not proceed or that it should be allowed to proceed and should be protected along the length of the route that it wishes to take regardless of the violence that may be directed against it. Those who are offended, either by the procession being stopped or by the procession being allowed to proceed, should be able to read the evidence that led the commission to reach its decision.
<P>
If there is a good reason why such evidence should not be in the public domain, we have not been told what it is. There is one possibility, which has already been mentioned: that the police, or other security forces, become aware of a major, sustained, murderous attack on the procession or on other people because the procession is taking place. In those circumstances, one could understand the commission's reluctance to publish.
<P>
Perhaps we will be told that a parade will be stopped in its tracks only on grounds of security. We know, from stories that we have heard, that the Orange institution was advised that if processions went ahead on July 12 last year, they might be subject to attack. Indeed, the Chief Constable has said that lives would have been lost if Drumcree processions had not been allowed to proceed.
<P>
That serves to illustrate the strong and dangerous emotions that are released in some people over processions in Northern Ireland, which is why I tabled amendment No. 10. Clause 2(2)(b) states that the commission may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"issue determinations in respect of particular proposed public processions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would add to that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and publish the evidence that led to its conclusion".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am asking for the evidence to be published not only if a procession is stopped, but if it is allowed to proceed. I cannot see any good reason for the Government to refuse to publish such evidence, except possibly for security reasons.
<P>
I assume that the only evidence to be withheld will be written evidence. I do not suppose that the Chief Constable or local police superintendents will go to the local gatherings and say, "We really cannot allow that parade because..." Surely they will not give oral evidence. Am I right to assume that the only written evidence will be that from the security forces the police and perhaps the Army? Why should not the written evidence be published as well as the oral evidence?
<P>
People who submit written evidence will presumably not be subject to the same cross-examination as people who submit oral evidence will be under the various codes that have been published. This is a matter of real substance, and it needs to be addressed. We need to be told why the Government are taking the view that some types of evidence should be released into the public domain and subject to cross-examination whereas other elements of that evidence should not be. I hope that the Minister will explain that.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 7 and amendment No. 181 relate to a similar clause. Clause 7(6)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any disruption to the life of the community which the procession may cause"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would want evidence of the nature of that disruption. Some disruption to community life has occurred because of extremely well-organised boycotts of some Protestant businesses. That was widespread and very damaging to the commercial life of people and towns. Great anger was expressed when a procession was stopped, or allowed to proceed. If a Sinn Fein[Mr. Ross]
procession were allowed to proceed through a Unionist-loyalist area, no doubt there would be grave concern, and disruption to the life of the community. I assume that the Government commission intends to publish the oral evidence and to cross-examine those who give it, while not cross-examining people who give written evidence, or even publishing it. There is a sort of Star Chamber court in which allegations can be made and people asked questions in the public domain, which can be published, while others can make statements or allegations that are not subject to any form of challenge. The commissioners may accept these at face value and act upon them. They might say that in giving evidence I, for example, had put a reasonable point of view which had convinced them. They might then say that they received a letter the next day refuting everything that I had said. Perhaps the writer had been sitting in the hall there could have been 100 people present, listening to the oral evidence. Tame lawyers would be called to make a case, and write to the commission. The commission would not ask questions; there would be no question of cross-examining written evidence. The commission would read the letter and decide that it was clear that that fellow Ross was a liar and would not accept his evidence because the letter had convinced them not to. They would forget what he said, and would prevent the procession from proceeding.
<P>
The police might have a point of view; a superintendent might decide to submit written evidence to the commission. If he did, there would be no good reason for him to turn up to express the police view in public. The commissioners might say, "Superintendent, we heard what so-and-so said a few minutes ago. What you now state appears to be at variance with what this member of the public told us. He lives here and knows the people in question and has told us that there will not be any disruption." The organiser, or a participant or onlooker, might wish simply to go up the street to watch the procession, and the commission might say, "John Doe has given evidence in favour of the procession. We are writing to tell you that the evidence is not accepted and that you may not cross-examine the police officer."
<P>
Amendment No. 182 relates to the impact that a procession might have on community relationships. If there is a two-edged sword anywhere in the Bill it is in clause 7(6)(c) which refers to
"any impact which the procession may have on relationships within the community".<P>

<P>
Let us suppose that I have a close, friendly relationship with a neighbour. We may rely on each other for baby-sitters I am past that stage now, but some people are not he may need to borrow my tractor, or I may need some help from him. I do not think that the mere fact that I have taken part in an Orange procession in the local town will disturb those good relations. It has not done so in the past and I do not see why it should in future. He is likely to meet me the next day and say, "Willie, you're a damned Orangeman", or words to that effect, "and you shouldn't have been there." I will say, "Get lost, you know where I stand", and that will be the end of it.
<P>
The Committee should not be under any illusions about the extent of give and take about such matters among most people in Northern Ireland. My hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone was describing the camaraderie that exists between members of various bands in some parts of the country. That is not publicised, of course, but it is known about. In terms of football supporters, some people in my part of the world think that Liverpool is the bee's knees while others take a very different view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> What about Glasgow Rangers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> There are some Rangers supporters there, but the hon. Gentleman would be surprised to know how many people support Liverpool and Celtic. I support Coleraine when I go to a match, which is only once every three or four years. That is safer because at least it is the local team. I had to go to watch my son play in the rugby schools cup on Saturday, and a bit of a hash they made of it, I confess, for his team only drew when they should have won, but I hope that they correct that tomorrow.
<P>
People misunderstand the willingness of folk to rub along together, even if there are a few rough edges here and there. We manage. I have lived through periods of great tension, and it never really affected the normal, helpful, commercial and economic relationships that I enjoy with many of my Roman Catholic neighbours and I have many of them. Some of them were involved in things of which I did not approve. Anything short of terrorism was as acceptable even fairly cut-throat tactics in political life were seen as acceptable but we managed to live happily together for many years.
<P>
The commission is supposed to reach decisions on the basis of secret evidence that it will never publish about what impact a procession may have on relationships within the community. With all respect, that is impossible for any outsider to judge. Those who want to stop a procession and those who want it to go ahead can put a spin on it the issue of spin doctors is relevant to the Conservative and Labour parties at present. If half of what we read in the papers is true, God help the Government. I do not believe half of it, but many people are intent on selling newspapers and that is why some of the stories are floated. The idea of a Prime Minister and a Chancellor of the Exchequer with daggers drawn at dawn is beyond belief, even to someone such as me.
<P>
The whole concept of keeping any part of the evidence secret is wrong. The most pernicious lie is the half truth. If the Bill is passed as drafted, it will be seen as a half truth. The Government should seriously and favourably consider publishing all the evidence, so that people will know where they stand. After all, this is an open Government, an Administration who want everything to be clear and above board, who want to get rid of sleaze and corruption and who want to ensure that all details are made plain for the world to see. However, in the sensitive and dangerous area of Northern Ireland, there is a desire to hide some of the information on which highly contentious decisions are taken. That should not be acceptable to anyone in Parliament; it is not acceptable to me.
<P>
If I am to give evidence and be questioned about it, I shall answer the questions as honestly as I can. However, I may find the next day, the next week or the next month that someone has written contradicting what I said and has not been subjected to the same measure of cross-examination as I have, or to any sort of examination. If a person whose evidence I have neither read nor heard produces a set of contentions which lead the commission to ban a procession in which I have an interest, that is a very serious matter and neither the Minister nor the Government should get away with it. The police will certainly hop on that bandwagon. If the police have good security reasons for an action, they should tell the Secretary of State because it is she who should use her override powers rather than putting matters in the hands of the commission.
<P>
We cannot allow the commission to be blamed for taking secret, security evidence from the police and acting upon it. The Secretary of State is in a position to be given that evidence or information and to act upon it. These small amendments are matters of real substance and issues concerning the general community lie behind them. There are matters that need to be dealt with and can be dealt with by the Government giving an undertaking to publish all the evidence on which a decision taken by the commission is based. No doubt if people wanted to tell the commission that some of the written evidence that it has been offered is false, the opportunity would exist to do so. The amendments are simple but important and the Minister, being a fair man, will recognise the force of my argument and accept them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): Initially, I did not think that the hon. Member for East Londonderry had a very telling position on the amendment, but I listened to what he said and he persuaded me that I should think carefully about what the amendments specifically amendment No. 10 propose.
<P>
When I first saw the amendments, I thought that what the hon. Gentleman wanted to achieve was covered by clause 4, which refers to the commission issuing procedural rules. Clause 4(1)(a) states that the commission will issue procedural rules
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in exercising the functions mentioned in section 2(2)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 2(2)(b) contains the specific phrase to which the hon. Gentleman wishes to attach the words in amendment No. 10. Assuming that no other amendments are accepted, the clause would state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"issue determinations in respect of particular opposed public processions and publish the evidence that led to its conclusion."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 2(2) is covered by the procedural rules set out in clause 4. Clause 4(2)(c) states that in particular the procedural rules may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"require notice of specified determinations of the Commission made in the exercise of those functions to be published in such form and manner as may be specified."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I think that I am right in interpreting that the functions in that provision refer to those functions itemised under clause 2(2). No doubt the Minister will confirm whether that is correct.
<P>
Initially, I could not support the amendment of the hon. Member for East Londonderry because I thought that the matter was taken care of in a later provision. However, I now realise that he was asking for something different, which hinges on the word "may", not the word "shall". It would place the provision in a stronger position than under clause 4(2)(c).
<P>
I think that the Minister must carefully consider the provision to see whether it gives the commission powers under its procedural rules to fulfil the aim and thrust of what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve with his amendment. Alternatively, he should accept the amendment or at least tell the Committee that he will go away, think about it and find a suitable form of words to achieve the same aim.
<P>
I now turn to the draft procedural rules for consultation, paragraph 5.2 of which refers to the commission determining its decision and states:
"That decision will be taken by a majority vote. It will be the aim of the Commission, where possible, to make its decision five working days in advance of the notified date of a parade and to provide written notification of that decision, and the basis for it".
<P>
The basis for the decision seems to be that of providing evidence of how the determination was reached. It is not as good as the commission publishing all the evidence, but at least it is making an attempt to do so. I suspect that it follows on from the recommendations of the North report, under which the commission is to give reasons for its decision that are transparent in the community and that will enable both parties to say, "Yes, the issue has been dealt with properly and all the evidence on which the decision was based has been sifted and tested."
<P>
I shall certainly be making representations to the commission because the wording in the draft rules, such as
"It will be the aim of the Commission, where possible"
<P>
needs to be firmed up, otherwise the commission will be let off the hook. The rules should clearly state that the commission will, within five working days in advance of the notified date
"provide notification of that decision, and the basis for it".
<P>
Such a provision could also take in the suggestion of the hon. Member for East Londonderry and state that the commission must provide the evidence that it used to reach such a decision.
<P>
The amendment is sensible. It is in the spirit of the Bill and can be followed through in later clauses as well as in the procedural rules when an attempt has been made to go a reasonable way towards what the hon. Gentleman is requesting. Too many "mays" appear in the Bill; they do not strengthen its provisions. Although the Committee is not in control of the matter, we should ask the commission to firm up its procedural rules to make it clear that the basis of its decisions will be published within a certain time. We want the rules to contain all the evidence to enable all communities, particularly those parties on each side of the fence, to see clearly that fairness and reasonableness have been achieved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This has been a useful debate. In many ways there has been over-examination of the detail, forgetting what the debate is really about. I shall deal first with the points made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. He said that he hoped to impose a stricture on the commission to publish its[Mr. Ingram]
position five working days in advance of any determination on any parade. What would happen if one more day on the part of the commision and those with whom it was consulting produced a result which took the heat out of the situation? That would be a problem. If that stricture was there it would be denied the opportunity to continue seeking a resolution to it. Clearly, by putting the timescale into the rules of procedure the commission showed a clear willingness and determination to try to give as much information in advance of the date of the parade as possible so that all the due processes could come into play.
<P>
Following North's recommendations, we want the commission to make determinations which satisfy those who want to march in parades and those who protest against them and to take the heat out of the situation. That is what we are trying to achieve with the Bill. Those are difficult and delicate problems for the commission. If we are too prescriptive, we may inhibit its capacity to get a resolution. That seems contrary to what I know the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve.
<P>
I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraph 3.4 of the procedural rules which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"All evidence, both written and oral, will be treated as confidential" 
<P>
I will come to the question of publication and the arguments against that 
<P>
"and only for the use of the Commission, its staff and Authorised Officers. The Commission, however, reserves the right to express unattributed general views heard in evidence but only as part of its explanation of a decision in any final determination."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is an indication that the commission is prepared to take that which is unattributed and given in confidence and say that it was a seminal piece of evidence which precipitated the determination. Again, that will be difficult for the commission to deliver. It will have to gain the support of everyone associated with a particular contentious parade. That is a matter to which it has obviously given consideration. If there is a view it will publish it in a way that it considers fit, but importantly, in the context of the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, it is its responsibility to explain publicly the reasons for its determination on a particular parade. It must be open in that sense. It must set forth its decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister referred to paragraph 3.4, which refers to "all evidence" which is in heavy type. But this document was written by the commission and is out for consultation. It is not cast in tablets of stone and could be amended. I can see the argument for saying that if the evidence of named individuals eventually got into the public domain it could go against them. I understand that in the context of Northern Ireland. But in terms of publishing a determination [Interruption.]. I lost my thread there. According to the rules, when publishing its determination the commission should give the basis for it. Evidence of a general nature for example, from the majority of people or 60 per cent. of those who oppose the parade would give weight to the commission's explanation of the reasons for its conclusion. I hope that the Minister will not rule that out and that paragraph 3.4 of the procedural rules does not preclude a sensible and logical explanation of the commission's determinations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My reading of both the Bill and of the rules of procedure does not preclude that. Before that long intervention, I was trying to explain that difficult and fine judgments will have to be made throughout the whole process of examining the issues relating to a contentious parade.
<P>
I want to turn to the issue of the publication of evidence. The hon. Member for the North-East Cambridgeshire has been convinced by the arguments in his own interpretation and in the explanation of the hon. Member for East Londonderry about the publication of evidence. However, evidence might be published that was not confidential and did not come from the RUC or the security forces, but was from a sensitive source, for example from someone substantial within the community who was prepared to tell the commission, with good authority, what would happen if a parade were to go ahead or not. Such evidence might be important and might help the commission come to a particular decision, but if it were published and people were identified, is it not likely that they would be at risk, especially if they were giving evidence against others in their community? That is especially the case given the nature of society in Northern Ireland; we have witnessed over the past few days that people are willing to shoot or murder other people because of their religious affiliations. Evidence, if given confidentially, might help the commission to come to a determination that would be in the best interests of all concerned. That matter must be taken into consideration.
<P>
The publication of evidence in its own right is undoubtedly a sound principle, but Northern Ireland is not a fair, free and open society. People put themselves at risk daily, by being brave and by arguing for change and for a different approach. Sadly, many of them lose their lives as a consequence. I do not say that that would inevitably occur in relation to parades and their associated counter-demonstrations, but there is always that possibility. If there is an insistence that publication must take place, on whose conscience would the consequences be? If the worst happened, I would not want that on my conscience.
<P>
The Parades Commission has been given a difficult job; it will undertake its work in a fair and equitable way and will try to reach determinations that satisfy both sides of a particular debate. It will try to take the heat out of individual circumstances. The publication of evidence is secondary to the commission's main objective. The determination is important, not the evidence itself. The commission will be judged on its determinations about events, not the scrutiny or the over-scrutiny perhaps with tragic consequences of those who give evidence. For those reasons I am against the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> If the Minister reads the Hansard report I am sure that he will conclude that what I said in my long intervention was what he has just said.
<P>
There seems to be a problem over the word "evidence". I do not suggest that evidence should be published naming the individual source in detail. However, if the commission were to state that it had made a determination because of the weight of evidence, because most people said that there would be a riot on the day, that would be the publication of evidence, although there would be no individual identification. I do not think that the Minister and I are far apart on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That raises a problem. We are not far apart, but the amendments were tabled by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, not the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. The commission has to explain its decisions on specific parades. It may wish to use the sort of argument that the hon. Gentleman outlined. However, a majority opinion is not necessarily a right opinion. Other qualitative judgments must be made on the basis of the origin of the advice, and the amount of knowledge. One person could be set against a hundred and yet have greater knowledge and speak for a larger portion of the community in his or her assessment of the likely outcome. The commission will have to judge such matters when explaining its decisions.
<P>
I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, because our views on the matter are not far apart. I also hope that I have convinced the hon. Member for East Londonderry of the strength of the case against the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> That is all very interesting. When the Minister reads his remarks, he will realise that he admitted that the only reason for prohibiting protests is violence or the threat of violence by terrorist organisations against procession holders. That confirms what the people of Northern Ireland have known for a long time.
<P>
If evidence is produced to show that a procession will be attacked by the most violent means bombs, gunfire, stones and petrol bombs and the commission decides to ban it, nothing is more likely to ensure that the same threats are made elsewhere. That follows as naturally asnight follows day. As the Minister knows, such threats were made against the 12 July processions. What measures have been taken since then by the Government, the police and the army to ensure the arrest and trial of the individuals who made such threats? What has been done to remove their capacity to wage war? What has happened to decommissioning terrorist weapons? I am appalled by the Minister's admissions.
<P>
An unnamed individual can claim, "If this decision goes ahead, I can tell you what will happen the most dreadful violence and the most awful confrontation in the streets." The commissioner will ascertain from the police that some trouble occurred the previous year and decide that the individual is telling the truth. On that basis the procession will be banned. Yet again, violence will have won. The Minister suggested that that would satisfy most people; it will satisfy no one except those who are wedded to violence to achieve their ends.
<P>
I shall withdraw the amendments only in the vain hope hope springs eternal in the human breast that the Government will reconsider and publish the evidence, so that the world can see how many rabbits there are in the Government when they are confronted by terrorism. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that now is a suitable time to adjourn for dinner. The Division that we expected in the House at seven o'clock has not taken place. However, there may be other Divisions during the time allotted for dinner. Therefore, I propose that we return at 8.30 pm. However, we shall add 15 minutes for each additional Division. We shall return at 8.30 pm if there is one Division, and at 8.45 pm if there are two Divisions.
<P>
<H5>7.5 pm</H5>

Sitting suspended.
