                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would give Parliament a chance to approve the Secretary of
State’s mandate to the board, which would be a good thing. It
would give Parliament the opportunity to debate the contents of the
mandate and therefore provide greater democratic legitimacy in terms of
both the objectives and the money attendant to the objectives. It would
help Parliament to hold the Secretary of State and the board to account
for their performance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000022">&#160;</a>

                           </div>good thing—not something that the board, the Secretary of State
or the Department of Health should be concerned
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is a probing amendment. The Government want to emphasise democratic
accountability, and we are testing how far they want to go with that.
There are questions about the accountability of the board that have
already been debated, but how will Parliament hold the board to
account? We are proposing a method by which we would be able to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
would the board be responsible to Parliament for the performance and
management of the NHS? The amendment is another vehicle by which that
could be achieved. Previously, it has been the Secretary of State
directly who has given instructions, but as his accountability for the
management has been so seriously loosened, would it not be right for
Parliament to have a greater role in holding the board to account? If
the Secretary of State lets loose control of the board and the board
becomes more autonomous, we ought to take every opportunity we can to
hold the board to account. The amendment provides an opportunity to do
so. I should like to hear the Minister’s
views.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000025">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I noted the hon. Lady’s comment that this
is a probing amendment; I shall respond to her in that light. Given the
brevity of her comments, I shall keep mine equally succinct, so that we
can, hopefully, make some progress today. We seem to have been going at
a relatively leisurely pace so
far.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Lady said, amendment 111 proposes that the Secretary of
State’s mandate to the NHS commissioning board should be subject
to approval by Parliament. I welcome the opportunity to highlight once
more how the Bill will strengthen accountability and parliamentary
scrutiny. The mandate will set out what the Government expect from the
board on behalf of the taxpayer. That will comprise progress against
outcomes specified by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and
objectives in relation to its core functions. For the first time, those
objectives will be developed transparently through public consultation.
The mandate may be changed only by agreement or in exceptional
circumstances, and any changes must be notified and explained to
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
the first time, there will be transparency about what has been
achieved. The board must not only publish its plan for how it intends
to meet the requirements in the mandate, but report at the end of each
year on how it has performed. Then the Department of Health must set
out its own assessment of the board’s performance and lay that
before
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
represents an unprecedented step change in accountability to Parliament
and to the public for how taxpayers’ money is used by the NHS
and what is delivered in return. In future, there will be far greater
opportunities for parliamentary scrutiny, and I have no doubt that the
Health Committee will want to consider whether it would like to have a
role in scrutinising the
mandate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
it is not necessary to take the extra step proposed by the amendment.
Setting national priorities and outcome objectives is a core
responsibility of the elected Government of the day. Parliament can and

			Column number: 437<a class="bkMark" name="Column437">&#160;</a>
                           </div>should hold Ministers to account for how they do
that, but that is not the same as requiring separate parliamentary
approval for every
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Parliament
will continue to have the opportunity to scrutinise ministerial
decisions through questions and debates—and, for the first time,
the Secretary of State will have to publish an annual report on the
performance of the health service in England and lay it before
Parliament. All the measures that I have set out enhance considerably
not only the transparency of the process but the accountability to
Parliament, for the reasons that I have given. For that reason, I trust
that the shadow Minister will consider that she has fully probed the
matter and will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000031">&#160;</a>

the essential point is that the issue of health is of huge importance

amendment would provide an opportunity for an annual debate in which
all Members of Parliament could be involved in discussing the

the amendment. However, I hear what the Minister says and I beg to ask

purpose of the amendment is to require the board to have regard to the
treatment and prevention of both physical and mental illness in
carrying out its functions. This is another probing amendment, which we
have been asked to put before the Committee because of concern among
mental health organisations about the fact that health is mentioned in
the clause only in respect of physical health, whereas it ought to
refer to both physical and mental
health.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000035">&#160;</a>

wording “physical and mental health” is used—for

about consistency. I understand what he says about section 275 of the

3A(1)(a) in clause 10. The question is why that clause talks about
mental and physical health, but other clauses talk only about physical
health. I am sure that the civil servants have heard what I have said

from them? If the coalition Government are to be consistent in what

My hon. Friend makes a good point. Would he agree that the problem with
the amendment is that it is far too prescriptive? It prescribes a
limited number of organisations from which the board should seek
representations, but a huge number of patient groups may operate in any
one area. So, as with other amendments, this one is far too
prescriptive. The general spirit of the Bill already encompasses the
need to engage, and that is
sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000050">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree. There is a danger of being too
prescriptive when there are many such organisations. Indeed, the
national commissioning board should also pay heed to Members of
Parliament should it write to them. I raised that point when I asked
some of our witnesses whether they felt that representations from
Members of Parliament were significant. They said that they
were.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000051">&#160;</a>

the national commissioning board must refer to representations made by
a whole variety of bodies and individuals. To return to our experience

bodies, individuals and organisations were not listened to, or had no
real channel through which to communicate their

discharging its duty to exercise its functions, with a view to securing
continuous improvement in the quality of certain services. I agree with
the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury about the important
role that HealthWatch will play in the new NHS architecture, and about
the importance of the NHS commissioning board having regard to the
views of HealthWatch and local authorities. I do not believe, however,
that the amendment is necessary to achieve that policy intention. I

clause 166 will insert new section 45A into the Health and Social Care
Act 2008, and it will provide for HealthWatch England to exercise the
functions of providing information and advice to the NHS commissioning
board about the views of people who use health and social care
services, and of other members of the public, on both their needs and
experiences of services. HealthWatch England will also provide the NHS
commissioning board with information and advice on the views of local
HealthWatch organisations and others on the standards of services and
how they could be improved. I want to emphasise that that applies not
only to local HealthWatch organisations, but to others as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000055">&#160;</a>

writing when HealthWatch England provides it with advice and
information. Local healthwatch organisations will also have the
function of producing reports and making recommendations to
commissioners of services in relation to health and social care
services and how they could or ought to be improved. As part of their
role in addressing concerns about quality of care, local healthwatch
organisations will also be able to enter and view the premises of
health and social care service providers. That function will be carried
forward from the local involvement networks, and a duty will be placed
on providers to allow entry to their
premises.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000056">&#160;</a>

and recommendations to NHS bodies, including the NHS commissioning
board, on matters relating to the health service. The reports are not
binding, but their subject has to respond in writing to the

expect that to continue under the new
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000057">&#160;</a>

made by the hon. Member for Stafford. There is an obligation to respond
to the national HealthWatch, but suppose that, in future, a local
healthwatch writes to the NHS commissioning board alerting it of
something going wrong in the local health system. Is there an
obligation under the legislation not for that to be received, but for
it to be responded to by the board? In other words, could the board
simply park the information? We all wish to avoid

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have already discussed on a number of occasions the nature of the duty
to seek to improve quality and how it will be pursued. Proposed new
section 13D(4) makes specific reference to a document to be published
by the Secretary of State, which we intend to refer to as the NHS
outcomes framework, and to the NICE quality standards. The views of
patients, carers and clinicians are an integral part of the way in
which NICE develops its quality standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The NHS
commissioning board will draw on those standards in setting the
commissioning outcomes framework, against which the performance of
consortia will be assessed, and in developing the commissioning
guidelines to which the consortia must have regard when commissioning
services. The commissioning board will have a specific duty to consult
HealthWatch England on that guidance. That is the
means by which the duty

therefore, the most effective point at which HealthWatch can
contribute.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that I
have been able to demonstrate that consultation and engagement are
hard-wired into the new system. As to my hon. Friend’s point
about the relationship between the local healthwatch and the NHS
commissioning board, the local healthwatch has a route through
HealthWatch England, as I have just outlined, to raise concerns and to
ensure that they are responded
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000064">&#160;</a>

the Minister said, and I apologise if I have got it wrong. I got the
impression that there was an obligation to respond to HealthWatch when
it raised general matters of service delivery, but if we had a specific
episode, as in Staffordshire, and HealthWatch took it on itself to
write to the NHS commissioning board because it thought it should alert
everybody, could the board simply park that information, which would be
regrettable, or would it be under an obligation to respond, which would
be desirable?<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000065">&#160;</a>

clarification. The local healthwatch will be able to scrutinise local

say that he has not allayed my fears. The hon. Member for Central
Suffolk and North Ipswich says that there are many different patient

that everyone will, I hope, understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000068">&#160;</a>

engage the public, we have to keep pathways clear, and people have to

through the Bill line by line, and there is some confusion about

Committee for the hon. Lady, just to make things absolutely clear.
Through HealthWatch England, the local healthwatch can report to the
board, which would then have to take any concerns into account and
respond to them. A very clear chain is set out in the legislation:
local healthwatch, national Healthwatch, the NHS commissioning
board—it could not be clearer. That provides a clear route by
which concerns can be dealt with through the structures in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000071">&#160;</a>

is the point of proposed new section 13D(4)(a) and (b)? I am
quite sure that there are other clauses—I would be able to find
them if I was little faster on my feet—in which the Minister
could find an obscure route whereby the board would have to pay
attention to the Secretary of the State or NICE; I am sure that that is
in the Bill. However, we should make it clear to one and all that
responsibility for improving quality of service is placed on the board,
but that it has to learn from these other important
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000073">&#160;</a>

commissioning of services. There is continuing debate about what that

be referable to the Secretary of State through the overview and
scrutiny committees, and whether that means, for example, that the A
and E of my hospital, the Whittington hospital, could not be referred
to the Secretary of State through overview and scrutiny because it will
not be a designated service. We need to have at least a little more
control over the board than the legislation currently allows. If we

good—I am so pleased. How will I, as a housewife in Holloway,
have some effect on whether the A and E of the Whittington
hospital is to be closed if it is not a designated service and I cannot
even get my overview and scrutiny board to refer it to the Secretary of
State? How can I ensure that those services are designated, so that I
can save my A and E department? That is the question.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000117">&#160;</a>

there is a duty for the board to promote public involvement, it does
not stack up to much. Where will the public and patient voice be heard
by the board? Each and every one of these amendments seeks to
strengthen the accountability of the board. If the Minister does not
agree with them, perhaps he could tell us where he thinks public
involvement is and how the public can exercise some power over the
national commissioning board. We cannot see that sufficiently strongly,
and we do not think that it gets anywhere near the rhetoric.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000118">&#160;</a>

these amendments is to ensure that we hear from non-professionals in

the position. A lot of this is not relevant to Northern Ireland, but I
shall make a point on an issue that people have brought to my
attention. I declare an interest as a type 2 diabetic. Diabetes is a
very important factor in my life, as it is in the lives of many others.
Information has been sent through to me.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000129">&#160;</a>

happen as a result of this NHS reform in England and Wales will
ultimately make its way to Northern Ireland and will set the guidelines
for what we do in the future; I suspect that that is how it will work.
The hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury has just commented on
the duties to seek advice. Diabetes UK has asked me to underline that
it would wish for there to be duties to involve rather than duties to
seek advice. That relates to multidisciplinary professional
applications—in other words, more
involvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000130">&#160;</a>

the Minister indicate whether he is prepared and willing to accept
having involvement, rather than advice? That would strengthen the
legislation and give those involved with Diabetes UK—I have used
that organisation as an example—and many other sectors the
opportunity to feel that the legislation has been strengthened and is
better for them as a result of the wording and terminology. That is a
big point, which I ask the Minister to respond

the hon. Member for Strangford, who mentioned diabetes patients. A
number of organisations have concerns about and an interest in the
whole area of patient and public involvement. There was an interesting
discussion about the difference between patients and the public. In
amendment 134, the public are defined as<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>That encompasses
patients and the public as one and the same. However, I entirely agree
that it is important to discuss exactly what
“involvement” means.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A key
principle of the Bill is that “there should be no decision about
me without me.” The Government are very much bearing that in
mind. I agree with what the hon. Member for Islington South and
Finsbury said about hearing from non-professionals. A lady who is
tragically suffering from ovarian cancer gave evidence. I asked her
specifically about whether she wanted to be involved in giving advice
on her care after she had had her treatment. What she said was
interesting—although, obviously, she was concentrating on her
treatment and her recovery.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, many
other patients, particularly those suffering from longer-term
conditions, such as diabetes—I am particularly interested in
those suffering from mental health conditions—have an interest
in the matter and often access services for a long time. They
understand the services and want to be involved in commissioning
decisions—perhaps at the commissioning board level but, more
importantly, I suspect, at the commissioning consortia
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would be interested to hear from Ministers what
“involvement” actually means. We use the word
“involvement,” and some of the charities and those
involved have spoken to Ministers and their officials about exactly
what that means. Whether there will be guidance or best practice on
involvement, it would be helpful for those charities to know what the
situation
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000138">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall make my point quickly, as it has been made
in part already. The housewife from Holloway—the hon. Member for
Islington South and Finsbury—and the Ministers all want to
promote further public involvement. The question is whether the
amendments technically do that. I sensed the dawning recognition on the
part of the hon. Lady that her amendments were almost
redundant.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
patients are necessarily members of the public, the public invariably
and occasionally will be patients at times. If we look at the
definition in amendment 134 of
“Public”—<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

the other amendments, I see that the one other question has been raised
by other Members. I am interested in what the Minister will say. If the
definition of “Public” which I put into amendment 134 is
the same as the definition of “patient”, and if there is
legislation to show that patients and public are the same, then the
amendment is unnecessary and we will take the obvious
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000145">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
it is important to ensure that the definition of
“patient” is not only those who are currently ill and
receiving treatment, but also those within a certain area who might in
future receive treatment. If we are all together on that, I do not need
to press the point further, but I think it is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000146">&#160;</a>

whether, in a year’s time, Sir David Nicholson—much
though he is admired in all parts of the House—will still be in
charge? Many similar issues are not specified in the Bill, although we
have the opportunity to do so. Government Committee members are voting
down all the Opposition amendments, even the sensible
ones—although I would like to think they are all
sensible—as a matter of course and not as a matter of principle.
I appeal to them to give some thought to their
tactics.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000152">&#160;</a>

scrutinising legislation is to think, “Well, we are all people
of good will and we all know what we want. We are sure any gaps in the
legislation or anything that might be interpreted in the wrong way will
always be interpreted in the right way.” We all want to believe
that that will be the case, but it is our job to ensure that we are

fundamentally misguided. The national health service was in a much
better state when we handed it on to the Government than it was when we
inherited it. It is this Government’s duty to build on our
achievements. Maybe it is not perfect; there is much more work to be
done, but it is wrong for the Government to turn the national health
service upside down. As more people hear about the legislation and
understand it more, they are getting increasingly alarmed. We are
reaching the stage where we have the national health service on one
side and the Government on the other. It can be

around, and we want to engage the public and local authorities. Many

authorities are on the ground and are run by local politicians, they

proper consultation takes place. We simply ask for the board to do the

designated services would be appointed, and when.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000166">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister can relax, as amendment 116 is a probing one. There is a
concern that there might be a hiatus in public involvement between the
end of the local involvement networks and the introduction of
HealthWatch England. Many people involved in LINks are concerned that
there might be a period, between the phasing out of the one body and
the phasing in of the other, when the public voice will not be heard.
Given that that will be a time of great change, it might be
particularly important to ensure that the public continue to be
listened to. I would like to hear how the Minister plans to address
that
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
117 is again about public involvement, and would ensure that when the
public are involved and consulted, particular arrangements are made for
people with impairments and disabilities. Older people, and people with
learning disabilities, communication difficulties, visual impairments
and hearing difficulties, are often heavier users of the NHS than
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although it
is always important to ensure that everyone is involved, it is perhaps
particularly important in relation to the national health service that
particular arrangements are made for people with disabilities. Given
the Equality Act 2010 stricture that there be no substantial
discrimination in the public sector, it is vital that the NHS
commissioning board, along with all other parts of the new NHS
structure, is accessible to such people. I just want to hear what the
Minister has to say about this largely probing
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
turn to amendment 136. Consultation is not sufficient by itself. We do
not simply consult, tick a box, say we have consulted and go away. The
Government place great emphasis on outcomes and not processes. The same
applies to democracy. We do not just listen to what people say; I hope
we pay some attention to it. We show whether we have learned from it
and whether we agree to it. We need to ensure that the board has regard
to achieving something as a result of listening to people, and is not
just going through the process. That is the purpose of the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not proud of the wording of amendment 137; I appreciate that it is
clunky and not in the clear King’s English of which I approve so
strongly. However, it is important. Essentially, it means that the
local authority overview and scrutiny committees, or their
alternatives, should be consulted by the board, along with individuals,
when making commissioning arrangements and decisions. It would not just
be individuals; it could be local authorities that, again, will hold a
bank of wisdom and knowledge from which it is important for the board
to learn.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have gone
through the issues as fast as I can, and I hope in sufficient detail.
There are a number of amendments of varying importance. Depending on
what the Minister says, I might seek the Chair’s indulgence to
vote on one or
two.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000178">&#160;</a>

patients. As the Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and

pleased that she has acknowledged that there is an attempt, as she puts
it, to engage the public. I would say there is much more than an
attempt; at the very core of the legislation is the process of better
listening to patients and their experience and involving patient
groups, and taking that on board in the commissioning of services. That
has to be a good thing, and lies at the heart of the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000182">&#160;</a>

whether the hon. Lady will clarify a point in her concluding remarks.
She is keen to talk about the need for greater consultation, and I have
made the case that that is already in the legislation. In addition,
genuine patient involvement is already emerging in many hospitals and
GPs’ surgeries. Through the collision of patient and clinician
involvement there is an open discussion about potential treatments,
which is happening with the choose and book system. It is also
enshrined in the very nature of the patient consultation, which is,
quite rightly, beginning to change and take shape and allows patients
to have much more involvement in decision
making.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady was earlier at pains to say that the emphasis on patient
choice is not necessarily a good thing. If she values the voice of
patients, genuine consultation, and patient feedback, could she explain
that inconsistency? She attacked patient choice, but she is now saying
that it is important to involve patients. I do not follow her logic or
her train of
thought.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000184">&#160;</a>

about “persons with professional expertise”. I take the
point raised by the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury, which
is that we all think we are good at involving people, even if there are
probably more talented people out there. Proposed new sections 13F and
13G talk about patients being directly involved, which is what we want,
rather than just people with professional expertise. The amendment
seems to be a recipe for removing patients from the board’s
activities by involving another set of professionals.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000186">&#160;</a>

point is about professional expertise. Organisations such as Rethink
have told me that they would like reassurance on whether such expertise
would include the full range of health and social care professionals.
They want to be able to get professional expertise from all such
people. Such clarification would be
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000189">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I would like to address amendment 168
by raising an incident which happened in my area some years ago and
highlights one of the problems with the current system. The building of
a new-build hospital, the University hospital of North Staffordshire,
involved the tremendous reconfiguration of removing some 250
to 300 acute beds. We were all very grateful for the welcome provision
of a much-needed new hospital, but the finance was constrained by the
amount available under the private finance
initiative.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finance
was the fundamental driving factor, nothing else, because incorrect and
out-of-date population figures were used in the proposal. The error
meant that the region was given a first-rate hospital that
under-provided acute beds for an ageing and growing population; some
may disagree with that. That reduction in the provision of acute beds
in the region’s health economy was tied up in the provision of a
wonderful new facility, which shows that the consultation was
inadequate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that there will be similar projects in future, although not under
private finance arrangements—certainly not under the
arrangements that were made in this particular case, and in many other
cases across the country, which were too expensive. We must be careful,
if we are to have such new provisions, that the public are not misled
by wonderful new facilities that require major
reconfigurations with serious long-term consequences. Such consequences
might be felt for 100 years; the University hospital of North
Staffordshire replaced a hospital that was built more than 100 years
ago. I would like to bring that to the Minister’s
attention.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000192">&#160;</a>

I have sympathy for the aims of amendment 168. I am not in sympathy
with some of the other amendments in the group, but as far as I can
see, the hon. Lady’s point is covered by proposed new section
13L on page 18. I would like the Minister’s reassurance that in
the case of new builds or massive physical reconfigurations, there will
be proper consultation, unlike what happened in north Staffordshire a
few years ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000193">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
my mind, amendment 133 is not necessary. There is no need for an
additional duty on the board to promote involvement in commissioning
decisions. As some of my hon. Friends have said, that is already in the
Bill under proposed new section 13L. The new section will place a duty
on the board to make arrangements to ensure that patients, and others
who may need to access health services, are involved in the planning of
commissioning decisions about those services, and in proposals for
substantial changes to those services. The amendment is not necessary
for consortia either, as they will be covered by the same duty of
involvement in proposed new section 14P, which reflects section 242 of
the 2006 Act. The board will hold them to account in fulfilling that
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
duty in 13F—the proposed new section to which the amendment
pertains—is intended to cover something different, which is
shared decision making and individual involvement in decisions about
people’s personal health care. As I have said, we have discussed
the importance of people being at the heart of decisions about the
provision of health and care services. Throughout the Bill, we have
made that clear by describing “people” as both patients
and individuals who may use health and social care services. It is
therefore not necessary to define “public” in the Bill,
because everyone is a potential user of health and social care
services. I therefore ask the hon. Lady to consider withdrawing
amendment 134, and I hope that has allayed her
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000196">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The effect of amendment 135 would be to single out
particular types of experts from whom the board would be required to
obtain advice in order for it to discharge its functions effectively.
That would involve those with professional expertise in patient and
public involvement, and review and scrutiny. Specifying the type of
advice that the board should seek not only overrides its autonomy, but
will invite perfectly valid criticisms that one group is being
prioritised over another. Proposed new section 13G to the 2006 Act will
require the board to make arrangements to ensure that it obtains
appropriate advice from people with clinical professional expertise, in
order to perform its functions

                           </strong> Absolutely. I can reassure my hon. Friend on that
point, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough was
reassured by the point that I made prior to the intervention. We have
not sought to specify in the Bill exactly what professional advice the
commissioning board should take because we believe that that is for the
board to decide. We do not want to be either restrictive or
prescriptive, and I hope the Committee shares that view.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000200">&#160;</a>

the valuable role that scrutiny plays in providing transparency,
accountability and local challenge. That is why we listened, and
responded to the consultation responses by giving local authorities
flexibility on how to discharge the scrutiny function, while retaining
the separation between executive and scrutiny functions by preventing
delegation to the health and well-being board. The proposal that the
board should be under a duty to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 454<a class="bkMark" name="Column454">&#160;</a>
                           </div>seek the advice of those with professional expertise in review and
scrutiny would blur the lines between executive and scrutiny, and
compromise the ability of oversight and scrutiny functions to be
critical of the board in the future. I am therefore not persuaded by
amendment
135.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000201">&#160;</a>

my mind, amendment 168 is unnecessary. It proposes a new duty, in a new
section 13KA, to require the board to ensure that there is a proper
consultation on any reconfiguration involving more than one consortium.
As I have said, consortia will be under a legal obligation to make
arrangements to involve members of the public on major changes to
services resulting from their commissioning plans, and the board will
hold them to account for that. We fully support the involvement of
local people in shaping their local health and social care services. We
know the importance of that and have already covered it by placing a
duty on the commissioning board in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000202">&#160;</a>

will publish guidance to consortia on public involvement. Consortia
will be able to request additional advice and assistance from the board
on those matters, and could ask it to perform functions on their
behalf. Consortia will also be required to consult local authorities on
any substantial changes to designated services. The scrutiny powers in
relation to the services will be held by each local authority. We
intend to provide scope through regulations for them to exercise those
jointly, if necessary, but that would be for their
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000203">&#160;</a>

116 would require the NHS commissioning board continuously to involve
and consult the public on commissioning planning and major service
development. Adding the word “continuously” is not
necessary. The proposed new sections 13F and 13L of the 2006 Act set
out clearly the requirements on the board to make arrangements to

                           </strong> I am listening carefully to the Minister and
understand where he is going. I suspect that it is in a slightly
different direction from the question that I asked, which I suspect is
my fault. The question that the probing amendments are intended to
address is what happens at the end of LINks and the beginning of
healthwatch. Will there be a period when the public will not be
sufficiently consulted? That is the reason for the word
“continuously” and that is the question we want
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000208">&#160;</a>

117 would require that the NHS commissioning board make
“reasonable adjustments” to involve and consult people
with disabilities and impairments. I understand the importance of the
issue to all members of the Committee. The amendment is supported by
Mencap and hon. Members will sympathise with its intention. However,
applying “reasonable adjustments” might narrow the
clause’s focus to a specific group—in this case, people
with impairments and disabilities. Proposed new section 13F sets out
requirements for the NHS commissioning board to reduce inequalities and
promote patient involvement in decisions about the provision of health
services, and to enable patients to exercise choices. In practice, that
means that the commissioning board might issue guidance to
commissioning consortia—following consultation with the relevant
groups of patients and members of the public—on improving
outcomes of care for specific groups of individuals in relation to, for
example, access
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition, the board will be subject to the public sector inequality
duty in the Equality Act 2010, which will require it, when exercising
all its functions—including making arrangements for patient and
public involvement —to have regard to the need to eliminate
discrimination on the grounds of disability, and to advance equality
of opportunity for that group. I hope that provides
reassurance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000211">&#160;</a>

136 would place a duty on the NHS commissioning board to consider

necessary. Meaningful consultation is about involving the public and
letting them know the results and action being taken forward from those

decisions and plans. If the board ignored the results of those
arrangements, it would not be fulfilling that duty. The public will be
able to find out more about the results of patient and public
involvement in the board’s annual report, which must be laid
before Parliament. Proposed new section 13P(2) places a duty on the
board to report how effectively it discharges its duties on public
involvement and consultation. That will strengthen the position and
will help to hold the board to account. The board will determine how it
will do that when it publishes an annual report setting out the extent
to which it has met and given effect to the proposals for that year, as
set out in its business plan. As I have said, the amendment is
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000213">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
137 aims to ensure that the NHS commissioning board is covered by local
government scrutiny functions. As I have said, the Government recognise
the valuable role that scrutiny plays in providing transparency and
accountability. Local authorities will have flexibility on how they
discharge the scrutiny function, while retaining the separation between
executive and scrutiny functions by preventing delegation to the health
and well-being boards. I am happy to confirm that paragraphs (c), (d)
and (f) of clause 175(2) will ensure that the current regulation-making
powers on scrutiny cover relevant NHS bodies. Paragraph 129 to
schedule 4 inserts a definition of “NHS body,”
and it includes the NHS commissioning board. That therefore enables us
to ensure that the commissioning board is covered by scrutiny powers in
the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000215">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
detail of which providers are covered will be set out in regulations.
The intention is to extend the regulations to cover all providers of
NHS-funded services, significantly extending the scrutiny powers
available to local authorities, so that scrutiny can follow the public.
Taken together, the changes ensure that the regulation-making powers
apply to the new architecture, covering GP consortia and the
commissioning board, and significantly extend them so that scrutiny can
cover all providers of NHS-funded
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000216">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Alongside
the extension of scrutiny, the flexibility provided to local
authorities can help ensure that local people can shape scrutiny to
meet their needs and accommodate structures. My hon. Friends will agree
that form should follow function, not the other way around, and in
giving local authorities this flexibility, we can ensure that is the
case. I do not, therefore, think that the amendments would add value to
the clauses, which already do such things. I would therefore urge my
hon. Friends to reject the amendments if the hon. Lady decides to press
them to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000217">&#160;</a>

amendments if that is the Committee’s wish, but I need prior
notice of that if I am to consider whether it would enhance debate in
the Committee or the progress of the Bill. If there is a move to have

Members may not be surprised to hear that I will not press my

with proper consultation over significant reconfigurations. If you will
allow me, Mr Hancock, I will put that amendment to a vote. I understand
that I did not give notice of that, and I will obviously leave it to
your discretion to decide whether I am allowed to proceed. However, the
issue is important. This large Bill, which is of such profound
importance, is being pushed through its different stages very quickly,
and different aspects of it come out as we go along, so we have to run
very fast to keep up. The importance of democratic accountability in
significant reconfigurations becomes increasingly important in the
light of some of the things that we learn as the Committee

decision is being made, may I engage in passing with the hon. Member
for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich on patient choice? He asked how I
could, on the one hand, make disparaging remarks about patient choice,
but wanted, on the other hand, patients to be involved. To be fair, I
said that, for many of us, it would be ideal if we could sit down with
our GP, get proper advice and information and make decisions about our
health care. My difficulty is that not everyone is in that situation;
people may be too ill, they may have a mental condition, they may have
complex needs or they may not have English as a first language. When it
comes to equality of access, we have to be mindful of such
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11030359000220">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If the hon.
Gentleman believes that patient choice or patient involvement simply
mean sitting down with a GP and making a decision about care and that
that is sufficient, I would respectfully say that he has been misled.
To draw an analogy, McDonald’s is not a democracy just because
people can chose which burger they want; there is much more to patient
involvement than simply shopping for the right treatment. We need the
patient voice to be heard, not only at a time of crisis, when people
need to speak to their doctors, but more generally. Just so that we
understand each other, let me say that I am not against patient
involvement or patient choice,
