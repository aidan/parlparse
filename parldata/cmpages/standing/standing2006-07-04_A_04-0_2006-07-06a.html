pleasant it is to see you once again in the Chair, Mr. Gale? The sun is

is.</div><a name="0607073000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we rose for
lunch, not that I had any, I was in the middle of a quotation. Lord

change its behaviour as a result of the addition of these
words&#148;.</div><a name="0607073000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is only proper
that I should conclude the quotation, which is</div>
<a name="0607073000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and so the amendment would have no
practical effect.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of

<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 110</div><a name="0607073000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was speaking to amendment No.
9, which would place an obligation on the commission to act in a fair
and reasonable manner. The amendment has some history. Paragraph 161 of
the Joint Committee report on the Bill
said:</div><a name="0607073000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under
current charities legislation, there is no specific objective set out
for the Charity Commission to act proportionately and reasonably, but
such a requirement is placed on all public bodies by common
law.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers rested
their case in the House of Lords on that responsibility. The National
Council for Voluntary Organisations and other organisations gave
evidence that they were not satisfied with that, and the right hon.
Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) said effectively on Second Reading
that he was not satisfied with it. He said
that</div><a name="0607073000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;proportionate&#146;
appears in the measure. However, &#145;fairly&#146; and
&#145;reasonably&#146; do not.&#148;</div>
<a name="0607073000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">He thought that one out of three
was not bad; I think that he was being generous. However, I suppose
that getting one out of three votes in a general election that one wins
is not bad. He went on to say
that</div><a name="0607073000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;given the genuine
concerns that were expressed in another place and the continuing need
to reassure especially the smaller charities that they will not face
some sort of Big Brother Charity Commission with extensive new powers
at its disposal, I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends might be
able to go a little further.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,
26 June 2006; Vol. 448, c.
49.]</div><a name="0607073000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that in mind,
I tabled amendment No. 9. I thought that it would be right to give the
Minister the opportunity to satisfy his right hon. Friend by accepting
the
amendment.</div><a name="0607073000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000518"></a>The
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Edward Miliband):</b>
Through
you.</div><a name="0607073000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000519"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Through me, yes. I am sure that that would be just
as good as tabling it
himself.</div><a name="0607073000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
organisations, such as the Association for Charities, have emphasised
small charities&#146; need for reassurance because of the additional
powers and responsibilities that the Bill will give the commission.
They point to the strength of feeling expressed across the political
spectrum in another place for the inclusion of such a measure as mine,
and they think that it is appropriate to introduce
one.</div><a name="0607073000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall refer
directly to what happened in another place. Lord Phillips of Sudbury
said that it was</div>
<a name="0607073000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;probably the most important
recommendation which the Government declined to
accept.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23
February 2005; Vol. 669, c.
298.]</div><a name="0607073000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">My noble Friend
Lord Swinfen and Lady Howe of Idlicote queried the provision&#146;s
omission of the words &#147;fairly&#148; and
&#147;reasonably&#148;. The Minister, Lord Bassam,
said:</div><a name="0607073000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
clear that this qualifier means that the commission must have regard to
these principles&#148;.</div> <a name="0607073000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
assured Lord Phillips that the words &#147;fairly&#148; and
&#147;reasonably&#148;</div><a name="0607073000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;add
nothing to the legal duties which the commission is already under. We
have no doubt that the commission is under a duty in administrative law
to use its powers reasonably.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House
of Lords,</i> 12 October 2005; Vol. 674, c. 334-5.]</div>
<a name="0607073000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 111</div>However, that was not the view of the High Court judge in the Little
Gidding case to which the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)
referred, because the judge said that he would not take into account
whether the commission had acted fairly and reasonably. The Minister
shakes his head. Perhaps he has further information about the
decision-making process in the Little Gidding case.</div>
<a name="0607073000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the contention of the
Association for Charities, with which I see no reason to disagree, that
had the Charities Act 1993, or indeed any other legislation, placed
that duty on the commission, the judge would have been obliged to take
it into account. That is why I move the amendment.</div>
<a name="0607073000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 10 covers a
different area. The commission, in performing its function, should
distinguish between its regulatory role, advisory role and
investigatory and remedial role. The latter is sometimes called its
policing role&#151;indeed, its policing and judge and jury role. By
proposing the amendment, I merely follow the precedent set by the Lord
Chancellor in the reforms that he has initiated in another place.
Clearly, there is, or there has been, a great deal of confusion about
the activities of the commission in those different areas. The strategy
unit said that</div> <a name="0607073000034"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
blurring of boundaries between the Commission&#146;s advisory and
regulatory roles continues to cause confusion among charities and other
key stakeholders.&#148;</div> <a name="0607073000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
went on to
say:</div><a name="0607073000036"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nor does
the Commission have the resources to sustain an advisory capacity as
extensive as the statutory phrasing...suggests. It should retain
an advisory role, but this should be more precisely
defined.&#148;</div>
<a name="0607073000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 20 of the draft Bill went
in exactly the opposite direction. It allowed the commission to give
advice not only to trustees but to any employees of a charity, and even
unsolicited. Like any good quango, that is what it is doing. However,
the consequence, according to a large number
of&#151;</div><a name="0607073000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607073000520"></a><b class="B">Peter
Bottomley</b> (Worthing, West) (Con): For clarity, are we
referring to clause 20 of the present Bill?</div>
<a name="0607073000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000521"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> No, we are referring to clause 20 of the draft
Bill, and I am sorry to say that I do not know which clause it is in
the current Bill. I do not suppose that it is far from clause 20,
however.</div> <a name="0607073000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Joint
Committee wrote:</div>
<a name="0607073000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Charities&#151;particularly
small charities&#151;were unclear whether they were being advised to
do something by the Commission or directed. The result was that, to be
on the safe side, they treated advice as if it was direction. This was
significantly eroding the autonomy of the sector and increasing the
degree of regulation.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
NCVO, quoted in the Joint Committee&#146;s report, weighed in in
support, saying that</div> <a name="0607073000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
would not want to see spontaneous, citizen-led activity stifled by a
regulatory regime which actually, when it gave advice, implied that you
could or could not do certain things which had the force of statute
when it did not&#148;.</div><a name="0607073000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of Charitable Foundations is also quoted. It feared that
the powers in the Bill might</div>
<a name="0607073000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;end up blurring the boundaries
between the Charity Commission&#146;s advisory and regulatory roles
even more than to date&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 112</div><a name="0607073000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was then a discussion about
whether the responsibilities should be separated either by taking the
advisory role outside the commission, or by retaining it within the
commission and separated by a Chinese wall. After some considerable
intellectual and consultative argy-bargy, which is covered in
paragraphs 201 to 205 of the report, the Joint Committee, supported by
the Select Committee on Public Accounts, which found that the
commission&#146;s advice and support is generally well regarded,
concluded that</div><a name="0607073000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Charity Commission should take steps to differentiate between its
advisory and regulatory functions and make clear in all its
communications the distinction between advice and
instructions.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government accepted the conclusion. It was their reason for rejecting
this and similar amendments in another place. Baroness Howe nonetheless
felt:</div> <a name="0607073000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We can
see a more powerful Charity Commission emerging... To have the
same body regulating with those very strong powers and advising on what
must be done is dangerous.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 10 February 2005; Vol. 669, c.
GC172.]</div><a name="0607073000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">But Baroness Scotland
said that</div> <a name="0607073000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government
and the Charity Commission wholeheartedly agree with the
principles&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0607073000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">and&#151;</div><a name="0607073000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;believe
that it is more appropriate to leave its implementation to management
action&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 28 June
2005; Vol. 673, c. 192.]</div><a name="0607073000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
course of action seems perfectly sensible. The problem is that it has
not happened; the Baroness made her statement last year, yet the letter
to me about the performance of the Charity Commission in respect of
that small charity after a visit in August last year, after the
Baroness made that commitment, shows exactly that confusion between
regulation and policing. I
quote:</div><a name="0607073000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
trustees of the charity were advised that they must review their
procedure for the award of such gifts, to ensure that they fulfil a
charitable purpose and in particular to consider introducing standard
criteria...The advice which we gave was that, without making an
assessment of need, they could not ensure that the giving of gifts was
achieving the object of the
charity&#148;.</div><a name="0607073000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is exactly
the confusing message that my amendment seeks to clarify. I thought
that the promise was to make things clear; having
&#147;advice&#148;, &#147;ensure&#148;, &#147;must&#148;
and so on in the same sentence does not do so. If it really was advice,
the trustees would have been told that they &#147;should&#148;
review their procedure for the award of such gifts. It is simple to get
the issue right, but the commission did not do so, even after all those
assurances, promises and recommendations.</div>

save time if the Minister hears from my hon. Friend and me at the same
time.</div> <a name="0607073000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
has opened up an interesting area. The relevant clause is clause
24&#151;&#147;Power to give advice and
guidance&#148;&#151;although the issue may turn up elsewhere as
well. The advice referred to is with a capital A, because it relies on
an application from a</div>
<a name="0607073000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;charity trustee or a trustee for a
charity&#148;,</div> <a name="0607073000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">although I am
not sure about the difference between the two. The clause goes on to
say that if that advice were relied on, the trustee would not be open
to a fault 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 113</div>being found with their behaviour as long as the Charity Commission had
the relevant information. I have summed that up reasonably
well.</div> <a name="0607073000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">That advice is
different from the ordinary advice with a small &#147;a&#148; given
by the Charity Commission; I hope that that will not be interfered
with. If the Charity Commission feels that it can say in any
communication, &#147;You must do this because it is a regulation and
we require it&#148;, or, &#147;This is our advice and you must have
a pretty good reason to do other than take it&#148;&#151;I leave
aside the commission&#146;s investigatory or remedial
role&#151;there will be a clear division in respect of what it can
do.</div> <a name="0607073000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 25 is
entitled &#147;Power to determine membership of charity&#148;. Will
the Minister, now or later, clarify whether determining membership of a
charity means to end membership, or whether someone can be a member if
they have been disqualified from the charity itself? The word
&#147;determine&#148; has a number of meanings, and it would be
interesting to know which one it bears in this
case.</div><a name="0607073000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my
final point will mean that it will not be necessary to have a clause
stand part debate. Will the Minister clarify something, preferably
soon? If the Charity Commission, by regulation or by giving advice,
said that an organisation that had been a charity was no longer to be
one under the provisions of the Bill, and if that organisation did not
bring itself into compliance with the new definition of
&#147;charity&#148;, would that organisation&#146;s assets have
to be passed to another charity, or could they stay with the
organisation in its non-charitable
status?</div><a name="0607073000055"></a>

been entertaining and interesting and the amendments cover a range of
issues. I start with amendment No. 67, which stands in the name of the
hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood). I remind the Committee
that the amendment is essentially about the need to take account of
beneficiaries&#146; and users&#146; interests in the performance of
the commission&#146;s
functions.</div><a name="0607073000481"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="0607073000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment&#151;dare I say it&#151;follows the Cheltenham principle.
The sentiment behind it is perfectly reasonable, but the Government
consider it unnecessary because it will not add to the existing law.
The current law is set out in the Charities Act 1993, which describes
the relationship between what the commission does and its impact on
beneficiaries. The Act states
that</div><a name="0607073000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It shall
be the general object of the Commissioners so to act in the case of any
charity...as best to promote and make effective the work of the
charity in meeting the needs designated by its
trusts&#148;.</div><a name="0607073000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
phrase</div><a name="0607073000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the needs
designated by its
trusts&#148;</div><a name="0607073000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">means the needs of
the beneficiaries.</div> <a name="0607073000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the Bill itself sets outs the interests of the beneficiaries.
The fourth objective requires the commission to promote the effective
use of charitable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 114</div>resources, which will result in charities being able to help their
beneficiaries in the most effective way, and the fifth objective
requires the commission to enhance the accountability of charities to
beneficiaries. If the amendment is about the need to have regard to the
interests of beneficiaries, we believe that the Bill already does
so.</div><a name="0607073000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also a
difficulty with the amendment in that it would require the commission
to act in a way that</div>
<a name="0607073000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;maximises the benefit
to...beneficiaries&#148;.</div><a name="0607073000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would take the commission into an area of decision making that is
properly a matter for trustees, because decisions about how a charity
carries out its purposes&#151;how it operates its activities and how
it identifies beneficiaries and seeks to meet their needs&#151;are
part of administration, not a role for the commission. Proposed new
section 1E of the 1993 Act, as inserted by the clause, is clear on
that. It states
that:</div><a name="0607073000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;nothing in this Act
authorises the Commission...to exercise functions corresponding to
those of a charity trustee in relation to a charity,
or...otherwise to be directly involved in the administration of a
charity.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the intention
of the amendment is that regard is be had to beneficiaries&#146;
interests, we think that the amendment is unnecessary, because that
requirement is already set out in the 1993 Act and is supplemented by
the Bill. Maximisation goes beyond the responsibilities of the
commission.</div>
<a name="0607073000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607073000524"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): On the commission&#146;s
carrying out of the roles of trustees, I think that the Minister is
slightly misled by the legislation. Although the commission itself
never performs precisely that role, it certainly appoints people to
such roles&#151;in the form of receivers and managers. That has been
the crux of many of the cases presented by the Association for
Charities. The exercise of powers equivalent to those of trustees is
clearly a consequence of the commission&#146;s actions. There are
many consequences. If great legal expertise is required to determine
what the current law is, it is desirable and necessary to amend the
Bill to remove the doubt and make the law more accessible to those who
administer
charities.</div><a name="0607073000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000525"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The problem is with the word
&#147;maximisation&#148; or &#147;maximises.&#148; The hon.
Gentleman is right that it is in the commission&#146;s power to
appoint receiver managers to run charities that have run into trouble,
but the commission does not prescribe the balance between the different
interests that charities might have.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The hon. Gentleman is asking, from
a sedentary position, where the amendment says
&#147;maximisation&#148;. It
states</div><a name="0607073000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So far
as is reasonably practicable the Commission must, in performing its
functions, act in a way which maximises the benefit to the users and
beneficiaries of charities&#146; services and
activities.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that satisfies him and I hope that he will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="0607073000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
me to the amendments standing in the names of the hon. Member for
Cheltenham and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) on
fairness and reasonableness. It is important to be clear on those
issues. Let me start with the case that has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 115</div>already been mentioned&#151;the Little Gidding Trust case. My
understanding reflects what Lord Bassam said in another place. Lord
Bassam was correct. There was agreement between the Attorney-General
and the judge in the case to set aside the question of reasonableness
so that the specific merits of the case could be considered and a
judgment made on its merits. It is not that the judge said that
reasonableness was not something that he should consider; there was
simply an agreement to set aside the question of reasonableness to
shorten the time that the case would take so that specific
consideration could be given to the case&#146;s merits. That was what
was done and the judgment was made.</div>
<a name="0607073000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can be
certain that all public bodies are under an obligation to show fairness
and reasonableness&#151;the basis of the Government&#146;s argument
that the amendment is unnecessary&#151;because of a principle: not
the Cheltenham principle, but the Wednesbury principle. The Wednesbury
principle, which dates from 1948, states that public bodies are
required to be reasonable in the decisions that they make. It is the
criteria used by the court when a judicial review case is taken to
it&#151;it is the basis on which public bodies are taken to judicial
review. For the benefit of Committee Members, the Wednesbury principle
of unreasonableness is used to determine whether the decision taken was
one that no reasonable person could have come to.</div>
<a name="0607073000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without question, therefore,
reasonableness is in the body of law and is an obligation on public
bodies. As for why it should not be included in the Bill when doing so
would make everyone feel happy and meet the Cheltenham principle, there
is a good reason for that, which
is&#151;</div><a name="0607073000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000526"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> You do not want
to.</div><a name="0607073000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000527"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Which is that we do not want to.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> That is one of the good reasons. The
other, even better, reason is that if we put it in the Bill in this
case, it would send a signal to the courts that where the demand for
fairness and reasonableness is not in the legislation, there is an
implication of a lower standard for other public bodies. For every
public bodythat exists, we would have to put fairness and
reasonableness requirements in every piece of legislation concerned
with that public body. I do not think that the Committee would consider
that a good use of
time.</div><a name="0607073000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I happen to have
experience of that. I sat next to my colleague, the other Parliamentary
Secretary, Cabinet Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-East (Mr. McFadden), when he took the Legislative and Regulatory
Reform Bill through the House of Commons. Again, there was a request to
put reasonableness into the Bill, and the same debate arose.</div>
<a name="0607073000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am in favour of fairness and
reasonableness, which are important. To reassure hon. Members so that
they have no sleepless nights thinking about whether the commission is
under a duty of fairness and reasonableness, I will make one more
comment. The commission&#146;s strategy and review document,
&#147;Charity working at the heart of society&#148;,
states:</div><a name="0607073000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any actions we
take will be proportionate, fair and reasonable&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 116</div><a name="0607073000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear that the commission recognises
that it is under that obligation. It is a duty on all public bodies. I
hope that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="0607073000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000528"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I was about to say that the Minister dealt jolly
well with &#147;reasonably&#148; but what about
&#147;fairly&#148;? We have not heard much about that.</div>
<a name="0607073000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commitment from the Charity
Commission goes some way toward meeting my concern, but is the failure
to fulfil that commitment something on which an appeal can be made to
the tribunal, a complaint can be made to the independent complaints
reviewer, or the commission can, in due course, be taken to the
parliamentary
ombudsman?</div><a name="0607073000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000529"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman asks me
that question, and I am happy to respond. The Bill refers to the fact
that the criteria for the tribunal considering a case is similar to
that used for judicial review in the courts. Reasonableness is
therefore clearly applicable. As soon as I find the reference, I shall
furnish the hon. Gentleman with the details. I hope that I have dealt
with fairness and reasonableness. The fact that the commission
mentioned it in its document creates an onus on it to act reasonably,
which is something that the courts can take into
account.</div><a name="0607073000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
10 covers the commission&#146;s regulatory, advisory and
investigatory roles. We are again sympathetic to the motivations behind
the amendment. The Joint Committee recommended that the commission
should take steps to differentiate advisory and regulatory functions.
The Government endorsed that recommendation. The commission accepted it
and has embarked on a review of its operations. As I understand it, the
commission is already putting the recommendation into practice. To take
the example of recently published guidance, the commission has begun to
rewrite all its guidance in clearer language that helps to
differentiate those passages that describe what is required of trustees
by law and those that set out what is expected of them as a matter of
good practice.</div><a name="0607073000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance will explain that, when the word &#147;must&#148; is used,
it shows a specific legal or regulatory requirement affecting trustees
or a charity and trustees must comply with that requirement. Sections
that contain a legal or regulatory requirement are clearly identified.
When &#147;should&#148; is used, it indicates items that are
regarded by the commissioners as minimum good practice, but for which
there is no specific legal requirement. Trustees are advised that they
should follow the good practice guidance unless there is a good reason
not to do so.</div><a name="0607073000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
Better Regulation Task Force report, &#147;Better Regulation for
Civil Society&#148;, it was acknowledged that the commission had
made</div><a name="0607073000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an important move
towards greater clarity with the publication of their new guide for
trustees, which separates legally binding obligations on trustees from
guidance on how they should fulfil their role.&#148;</div>
<a name="0607073000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report makes a further recommendation
about extending that approach to all its written advice to charities,
and the commission fully intends to take that work forward.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 117</div><a name="0607073000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we agree with the
sentiments behind the amendment, it attempts to draw a distinction
between the different functions of the commission. The truth is that
the regulatory role can encompass a range of activities, including
investigation and the giving of remedial advice. Let us consider what
the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) said earlier about
the commission giving advice to organisations to help bring themselves
back within the framework of regulation of charity law and public
benefit. In the performance of the commission&#146;s functions it is
hard to draw the very clear distinction between its different duties
that the hon. Gentleman
seeks.</div><a name="0607073000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
sympathetic to the sentiments behind the amendment. The commission has
started to respond to the Joint Committee and intends to go
significantly further. However, putting such a provision in the Bill in
the way in which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight proposes is
sensible.</div><a name="0607073000084"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000530"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for what he has
said. I take it that failure to comply with the obligations will be
&#147;tribunalisable.&#148; There must be a clear understanding
that advice is advice and that failure to take advice is not in itself
an offence. The consequence of failing to take advice may be an offence
and the consequence of failure to observe guidance may be an
offence&#151;I use the word in a broad sense&#151;but just because
someone does not want to do what the Charity Commission advises is not
a reason for it to come down with a heavy
hand.</div><a name="0607073000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000531"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sentiments;
he used the phrase &#147;heavy hand&#148;, and I was about to use
the same phrase. There should be no excuse or alibi for heavy-handed
behaviour towards those who do not follow the commission&#146;s
advice; I agree with him on that. Those are presumably some of the
steps that the Joint Committee encouraged the Charity Commission to
take, and which it seems happy to
take.</div><a name="0607073000482"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="0607073000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise the
sentiment behind amendmentNo. 76, but I found the remarks made
by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, in defending his amendment, slightly
odd. If I may say so, he is confusing the Charity Commission&#146;s
role as regulator with some other role that it might play. He cited the
example of organisations that are dominated by those in twin sets and
pearls. I am sure that we can think of some political parties that,
certainly until recently, had that reputation&#151;indeed, in some of
our minds, they still do. None of us would propose that the Electoral
Commission should have responsibility for intervening in the activities
of such an organisation and ensuring that the twin set and pearls
brigade opened itself up to much greater diversity; that is a matter
for the organisation. I make a similar point in relation to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s speech, in which he identified precisely that sort
of characteristic in certain
charities.</div><a name="0607073000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, the substance of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is
actually slightly different to what he said in his speech. He talked
about new and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 118</div>developing charities in a diverse range of communities. We are
sympathetic to that, but we do not think that that needs to be in the
Bill. Let me say something briefly about what the commission is doing
in that respect. It has developed contacts with a broad range of
communities, especially those brought together by a shared ethnic
background or faith. It has a network of 65 organisations from across
the sector, created with targeted recruitment in Asian, Afro-Caribbean,
Jewish and Muslim communities, which reflects the sector&#146;s
diversity, income and location. The commission provides advice in other
languages and provides a translation service for customers. Also, it is
listening, through a particular project, to faith-based charities and
has hosted seminars in Hindu and Muslim
communities.</div><a name="0607073000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth saying that the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 obliges
public authorities such as the commission to promote racial equality in
the way that they act towards their staff, develop policies and improve
their services. The commission must produce a race equality scheme,
setting out its action plans with meaningful and measurable targets. It
must produce a similar scheme for disability and, as set out in the
Equality Act 2006, gender equality. Whatever the Charity Bill says, as
a public authority, the commission will have responsibilities imposed
on it through other pieces of equality
legislation.</div><a name="0607073000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000532"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am somewhat reassured by what the Minister
says, and especially by his reference to other legislation, but he is
wrong to say that the amendment pushes the commission beyond its remit.
Its remit is not the same as that of the Electoral Commission, which is
a purely regulatory body. Among the general functions of the
commission, No. 6 is &#147;Giving information or advice&#148;. The
first of its objectives is the public confidence objective, which
is</div> <a name="0607073000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to increase public
trust and
confidence&#148;.</div><a name="0607073000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">That clearly
takes the commission into the area of giving encouragement and advice,
and trying to develop the sector beyond providing simple
regulation&#151;a point eloquently made by the hon. Member for Isle
of Wight.</div>
<a name="0607073000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000533"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That is why I distinguish between the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s speech supporting his amendment and his amendment
itself. I actually agree with him about his amendment, but in his
speech, he somehow gave the impression that it was the Charity
Commission&#146;s job to ensure diversity within particular
organisations and to break up the twin set and pearls brigade; I wanted
to correct that, because I just do not think that that is the
commission&#146;s job. It is true that it has functions that go
beyond those of the Electoral Commission. As I said, it is fulfilling
its functions well in relation to diversity&#151;indeed, it is under
an obligation to do so&#151;but it is not the commission&#146;s job
to tamper with the existing structure of organisations. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment does not suggest that it is, but I
thought&#151;I may be wrong&#151;that he implied that in his
speech. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="0607073000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000534"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> The Minister has not explained why he is
willing to have innovation written into the Bill, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 119</div>but not what the hon. Member for Cheltenham suggested. Perhaps we will
leave it on one side for those people who want to read the words. Does
the Minister have a note, or will he say a word about my last point?
</div><a name="0607073000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000535"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr. Gale. I should have
responded to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. It is an important
point for the Committee to register.</div>
<a name="0607073000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process of becoming a
charity is a one-way street. I would not say that there is no going
back, but it is hard to go back. We are dealing with two situations.
First, a charity or an organisation is institutionally incapable for
some reason or other of fulfilling the test of a charity. Secondly, it
does not for whatever reason comply with the requirements of a charity.
In the second case, it is the commission&#146;s job to work with the
charity to ensure that it can return to meeting the tests of charitable
status.</div> <a name="0607073000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a
charitable trust ceases to be charitable and it cannot institutionally
become charitable, it is then for the commission to alter the
trust&#146;s purposes by scheme in accordance with the cy-pr&#232;s rule,
which we will come to, so that the new purposes on which the assets are
held continue to be charitable. Again, the issue is about a return to
charitable status, but it may require more extreme or draconian
action.</div> <a name="0607073000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand the situation from talking to the Charity Commission, there
are very few if any recent examples of cases in which it has not been
possible to conduct that process co-operatively. We should not give the
impression that the commission seizes assets in dawn raids; the process
is undertaken co-operatively. Sometimes, the situation will simply be
that the original purposes for which the charity was set up have been
fulfilled, but assets remain and they need to be transferred to another
purpose. The commission will work with the trustees to do so. I hope
that answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div>
<a name="0607073000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000536"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> We should leave it like that for the time
being. We can accept that when it is possible to return a charity to
compliance, and when a charity&#146;s purpose can be modified so that
the assets can be used for something charitable, there is no problem.
The problem occurs with a change, perhaps following a change in the law
as we propose, when purposes that are presumed to be charitable now are
no longer charitable, but people want to continue, and assets have been
given to them for the original charitable purpose. That worries me, and
if the Minister does not have a straightforward answer, he might wish
to return to the issue on Report.</div>
<a name="0607073000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000537"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am not convinced that there is a
straightforward answer. However, with respect, I should like to correct
the hon. Gentleman. All purposes that are charitable now will remain so
after the passage of the Bill. That is an important part of the Bill.
The 12 purposes set out in clause 2 and the 13th catch-all category
cover all existing charitable purposes. The scenario he envisages will
not arise.</div>
<a name="0607073000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607073000538"></a><b class="B">Helen
Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): I had thought that this
issue would come up later when we considered the clauses on endowment
funds and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 120</div>changing the purposes for which property had originally been given.
However, the type of incident described by the hon. Member for
Worthing, West might be understood more clearly with the following
example. I remember an occasion when funds were given for the sons of
cobblers in Leicestershire. Particular monies were given for that
purpose, but now of course, there are not many sons of cobblers in
Leicestershire and they are no more needy than any other group in the
community. That is the kind of problem to which the hon. Gentleman
refers.</div>
<a name="0607073000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000539"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend&#151;she
raises an important point. I gather that there has been an issue on
almshouses, which were originally set up to house destitute people. In
certain cases the Charity Commission has worked with almshouses in
order to vary their purposes through cy-pr&#232;s, so that they remain
charitable but can also use their assets to the full. I suspect that
the same practice would arise in relation to the cobblers. We shall
reach the clauses on cy-pr&#232;s later, if we ever make progress. They
allow charities to vary their purposes and they are directly about this
issue.</div><a name="0607073000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000540"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It might be more appropriate to address the issue
that I wish to mention when we come to the cy-pr&#232;s provisions, but the
Minister may be able to obtain some information in advance. I
understand that learning the use of weaponry used to be a charitable
purpose, because it was felt to be beneficial to the defence of the
country, which was itself charitable. There were charitable shooting
clubs. Will the Minister tell us what happened to the assets of such
shooting clubs when the commission decided that that activity was no
longer
charitable?</div><a name="0607073000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000541"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am going to make two points which I
hope I shall not have to make again. The first is that interventions
are becoming longer and longer and longer. There is a case for a
slightly longer intervention if it saves an even longer speech later,
but interventions should be just that. Secondly, will hon. Members
please stick to the amendments under
discussion.</div>
<a name="0607073000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000542"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale. What were the amendments?
The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question was that it was
concluded that there had been a mistake in the original licensing of
such clubs, and therefore that particular class of clubs has been
allowed to keep its assets. To be fair to the Charity
Commission&#151;it would seem that I am its champion in the
Committee&#151;it showed a flexible, reasonable approach in
concluding that there has been an oversight in the original licensing
practices, so that the clubs were able to keep their assets. With that
I
conclude.</div><a name="0607073000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000543"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I thank the Minister for many of his comments on
the three amendments that have been tabled in my name. On amendment No.
76, I am reassured by the Minister&#146;s statements and I beg leave
to withdraw it. On amendments Nos. 67 and 103, I still believe that
there is a pretty fundamental principle at stake. The Minister seemed
to object to the use of the word &#147;maximises&#148; in amendment
No. 67, on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 121</div>ground that it would elevate one group of stakeholders over the
interests of others. In the context of charities, however, it seems to
me that it is quite right to elevate the rights of a particular group
of stakeholders, because charities exist for the very purpose of
benefiting their beneficiaries. I appreciate, however, that there might
be a technical legal difficulty with the amendment and I am content to
withdraw it.</div><a name="0607073000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
criticism does not apply to amendment No. 103. That amendment simply
repeats the injunction to act fairly and reasonably and requires the
commission to have regard to the interests of charity beneficiaries.
The legal technical argument that the Minister made against amendment
No. 67 does not apply to amendment No. 103. He made a defence against
the inclusion of the words &#147;fairly and
reasonably&#148;&#151;or at least of
&#147;reasonably&#148;&#151;and referred to the Little Gidding
trust case, in which the judge was able to set aside consideration of
the reasonableness of the commission&#146;s actions in order to
consider the merits of the case. That judgment might have been
reasonable in that particular case, but the mere possibility that a
judge could set aside reasonableness in that way concerns
me.</div><a name="0607073000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div> <a name="0607073000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
quoted the commission&#146;s documents in defence of its intention to
act reasonably, but we have seen that there is considerable disquiet in
certain parts of the sector about whether the commission always acts
reasonably in practice. It is one thing to say, &#147;This exists
particularly in statute if you follow the legal trail through various
pieces of legislation,&#148; but it is quite another to be able
simply to refer to the aims and objectives of the regulatory body and
say that a clear and transparent obligation set down in statute
instructs the commission to act fairly, reasonably and with regard to
the interests of charity beneficiaries.</div>
<a name="0607073000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that those things
are eminently reasonable and obviously in the interests of the
charity&#146;s beneficiaries, who are the principal stakeholders and
should be the people whose interests the whole framework exists to
benefit. It would be reasonable to put the measures into the Bill, and
I shall not withdraw amendment No. 103. I beg leave to move
it.</div><a name="0607073000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000544"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. It does not work like that. Let me
explain to the Committee, for everybody&#146;s benefit, that when you
debate a group of amendments, you move only the lead amendment. None of
the other amendments has yet been moved, nor would they normally be. If
any Member wishes to move an amendment that is grouped and is not the
lead amendment, they are required to give notice to the Chair in
advance. The Chair will then decide whether he or she will accept that
motion.</div> <a name="0607073000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is clearly unaware of that, so if he seeks leave to withdraw
amendment No. 67, exceptionally, I will then call amendment No. 103
formally, but it will be the last time that I do
so.</div><a name="0607073000110"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000559"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It will not surprise the Committee to know that
I have already decided that we shall not debate clause stand part. If
anyone has anything to say, they had better say it, with one
caveat&#151;they had better say it in order; otherwise I shall stop
them.</div><a name="0607073000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000560"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 12, in
clause 7, page 7, line 43, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5) The Commission
has power to award compensation when a complaint is upheld against its
actions.&#148;.&#146;.</div><a name="0607073000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall refer briefly to amendments Nos. 14 and 16, which would give the
tribunal the same
powers.</div><a name="0607073000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Charity
Commission has its own complaints procedure and the tribunal, which we
will discuss later, will be only a process for determining legal
challenges to the activities of the commission. It will not be a place
for determining whether the commission has mistakenly gone down the
wrong road, has been guilty of maladministration or has handled things
in an unfortunate manner. Those decisions will remain within the remit
of the commission and its independent complaints reviewer and, in due
course, of the parliamentary
ombudsman.</div><a name="0607073000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">My noble
Friend, Lord Swinfen proposed in another place to set the independent
complaints reviewer on a statutory footing. He said that that would
create</div><a name="0607073000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a truly
independent mechanism for charities, trustees andothers to
challenge the Charity Commission when it is apparently guilty of
maladministration or acting unfairly, unreasonably and
disproportionately&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 12 October 2005; Vol. 674, c. 379.].</div>
<a name="0607073000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">He supported that assertion by pointing
out that the independent complaints reviewer is forbidden to recommend
to the commission the payment of compensation. The independent
complaints reviewer can, I understand, recommend the making of a
consolatory payment&#151;that is, a payment for distress or possibly
for inconvenience caused by the commission&#146;s conduct. I am told,
however, that the reviewer cannot make awards of compensation for
financial loss. The amendment would permit it to do so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 123</div><a name="0607073000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment fits into the
larger picture in that a number of cases go to the ombudsman from time
to time, and the ombudsman must consider whether the respondent, which
is the commission, has acted&#151;I suppose one might say&#151;even
fairly reasonably within its terms of reference. However, in cases in
which the commission is not entitled to make a payment of compensation,
it cannot consider making such a payment, so it is not possible to take
the commission to the parliamentary ombudsman when it makes no such
payment&#151;although it can be taken to the ombudsman for failure to
make a consolatory payment.</div>
<a name="0607073000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned that the absence
of power to pay compensation filters through to the ombudsman. The
ombudsman can require compensation when maladministration has been
demonstrated, but injustice does not always follow maladministration.
Sometimes it does, and sometimes it does not, but the ombudsman can
require compensation only when there is a finding of maladministration.
Anyway, why should one have to go to the ombudsman for compensation? It
might be that the commission would admit that there had been
maladministration, but would not admit&#151;because it is not
entitled to do so&#151;to an obligation to pay compensation. It would
be perverse if one had to go to the ombudsman to say, &#147;Well, the
commission admits maladministration, but only you can award us
compensation.&#148; That is why I tabled the
amendment.</div>
<a name="0607073000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000561"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I think that the amendment comprehensively fails
the Cheltenham principle in that, although it might express a desirable
objective of some sort, it does not seem to me to be necessary or
necessarily harmless. It puzzles me on three counts. First, there seem
to be a lot of other bodies, quite apart from the ombudsman, who could
more appropriately award compensation if complaints were upheld against
the Charity Commission than the commission itself. The Bill provides
for the charity tribunal, and there is also the independent complaints
reviewer and the courts. Secondly, it would be a uniquely charitable
act to award compensation against oneself, as in effect the amendment
would require the commission to do.</div>
<a name="0607073000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a more serious level, there
is an obvious risk of conflict of interest that would offer a field day
for lawyers who might wish subsequently to challenge a compensation
award. Finally, it is a bit odd for a regulator to award compensation.
I am not sure what the precedents are for that. I know that Ofwat can
fine water companies, although it seems extraordinarily reluctant to do
so most of the time, but the idea that it can pay them is not a
precedent that I would want to set. The amendment is rather
mistaken.</div><a name="0607073000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607073000562"></a><b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman and I can
find a common cause on the amendment. Did he also note that the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight rightly said that compensatory payments were
likely to be more than consolatory payments had been in the past? The
proposal seems to be an uncosted commitment by the Conservative party.
Is not making uncosted commitments normally the role of the Liberal
Democrats?</div><a name="0607073000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000563"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman caught me to make a political
point just before I sat down.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 124</div><a name="0607073000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000564"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> The argument can go further than the case made
by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight. Let us remember the
Thomas Coram Foundation, which was given many valuable objects by its
creators. It became, in effect, a museum as well as a child care and
family support organisation. The trustees wanted to separate off the
art and, all bar one of them, came to an agreement. The Charity
Commission agreed with the majority of the trustees and the dissenting
trustee then went to the Law Officers and a Law Officer interfered. I
think that it was the Solicitor-General , although I am open to
correction.</div><a name="0607073000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
difficult to imagine that a Law Officer would get something wrong or
unnecessarily cause expense to people in respect of the power of
consolatory payment or compensation payment, but would the Government
feel able to make a payment of either compensation to put the trustees
back to where they were in respect of the costs to which they were put?
The Minister might want to mull over that with his
advisers.</div><a name="0607073000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000565"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Member for Worthing, West always seems
to ask a difficult question just before I am about to stand up. I shall
consider it further. It does not sound like a good idea, but I shall
find more justification for why that is
so.</div><a name="0607073000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission
already has the power in common with other Departments to pay
compensation for losses suffered by members of the public or
organisations as a result of maladministration in its work. As members
of the Committee have said, the public or organisations can pursue
complaints about maladministration through the commission&#146;s
internal complaints procedure, the independent complaint reviewer and
the parliamentary ombudsman. As the hon. Member for Isle of Wight said,
the independent complaint reviewer has the power to recommend a
consolatory payment in recognition of the anxiety and distress caused
by maladministration. It is worth saying that the commission has never
yet refused a recommendation from the ICR to make a consolatory
payment.</div><a name="0607073000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Complainants
are not required to use the ICR service and can seek referral to the
parliamentary ombudsman. There are no restrictions on the ombudsman in
terms of recommending compensation for actual financial loss, save that
she would have to be satisfied that a quantified loss resulted from
maladministration on the commission&#146;s part. Overall, the
amendment would not be necessary. Guidelines and the powers already
exist for the commission to take such action and there are a set of
established complaint mechanisms under clause 8 to make it happen. I
hope, on that basis, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000566"></a>Mr.

assurance that the commission has the power to pay compensation. That
was not my understanding and, on the basis of that assurance, I beg to

Horwood:</b> I am extremely grateful to you,Mr. Gale,
not least for the instructive and tolerant way in which you are guiding
us through this minefield. You are obviously acting in an advisory,
rather than a regulatory, capacity in that.</div>
<a name="0607073000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">My proposed amendment No. 85 is
designed to raise a matter that I raised on Second Reading. That is
about the ability of decisions effectively not made by the commission
to be referred to a body, such as the tribunal, as well as those
decisions that are made. As a general principle, it addresses the
question of whether or not commission inaction, as well as commission
action, may have consequences.</div>
<a name="0607073000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case that I raised on Second
Reading was that of an Alzheimer&#146;s organisation or an
organisation that purported to support Alzheimer&#146;s research,
which was called the Alzheimer&#146;s Foundation. Appropriate and
speedy action was taken by the advertising standards authority and by
journalists in investigating and bringing to public attention the
undesirable activities of that organisation.</div>
<a name="0607073000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately, the one body that
did not see fit to act until political pressure was brought on it, was
the Charity Commission. That would have been an occasion when, instead
of troubling Ministers with the matter or having to raise it through
the media, it would have been worthwhile, appropriate and convenient
for the Alzheimer&#146;s Society&#151;which was the legitimate and
worthwhile charity that was threatened by the activities of that
organisation&#151;to have immediately referred the
commission&#146;s decision not to act to the
tribunal.</div><a name="0607073000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my
reading of the schedule that sets out the various circumstances in
which decisions and, in some cases, decisions not to act can be
referred to the tribunal, it would not have been possible to do that
under the Bill. I hope that we will see our way to include that in the
Bill.</div> <a name="0607073000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.86
is different. It addresses many of the matters raised in the
Association for Charities&#146; document &#147;Power without
Accountability&#148;. The amendment refers not only to decisions made
but to</div><a name="0607073000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any decision or
activity consequent to any decisions, orders or directions of the
Commission&#148;</div>

the hon. Member for Worthing, West. Schedule 1D gives the detailed
table of decisions which can be referred to the tribunal. Later on, I
am proposing amendments Nos. 81 and 82 to that very schedule in order
to produce new possibilities for referring specific decisions or
activities to the tribunal.</div>
<a name="0607073000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I was seeking to do in
those amendments to clause 8 was to confer a general responsibility and
possibility on complainants to be able to refer decisions not made or
activities consequent to decisions made to the tribunal as a general
rule without having to be dependent on finding them in schedule
4.</div>
<a name="0607073000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000572"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I hesitate to try and help the hon. Member for
Worthing, West as I might get this wrong, but I think that the relevant
provision is in section 1C. The long table that we will be talking
about later starts on page 94. Column 1 is essentially a list of all
the different commission decisions that can be referred to the
tribunal. If the hon. Gentleman is looking for a list of decisions that
can be taken to the tribunal, he should look at the
table.</div><a name="0607073000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000573"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am particularly grateful to the Minister for
that intervention, which is exactly
right.</div><a name="0607073000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was discussing
how it might work in practice. We will consider amendments Nos. 81 and
82 later, but I shall refer to them briefly, because they explain how
it might work and how what appears to be a broad, sweeping permission
to bring cases to the tribunal will actually be a very practical
one&#151;for instance, a decision to continue with the appointment of
a receiver and manager on the basis that the activities of the current
receiver and manager consequent on the decision to appoint another
might be brought before the charity tribunal. The displaced trustees of
the charity in question might feel that the receiver and manager was
running up excessive costs or was not administering the charity in the
best interests of its stakeholders. I cannot see in the table in
schedule 4 the decision to appoint that receiver and manager in the
first place. That is an example of how a general amendment might enable
people to bring appropriate complaints before the
tribunal.</div><a name="0607073000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
are serious for the charities concerned; they are not legal minutiae.
One case in the booklet issued by the Association for Charities
particularly alarmed me and illustrated the need for such amendments.
PALS, or the Protection of Animal Life Society, was a small animal
welfare charity established near Salisbury in 1984. It grew during 15
years to become a significant local charity, but it did something that
in an ideal world it would have been advised not to; it based the
charitable premises on the founder&#146;s private land.</div>
<a name="0607073000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">That attracted the interest of
the Charity Commission, and a process was set in train. As far as I can
tell from this document&#151;I understand that its factual accuracy
has not been significantly challenged by the commission or anyone
else&#151;no serious breach of charity law was ever found.
Nevertheless, a process was instigated that led to the removal of the
founder as a trustee, the freezing of the charity&#146;s bank account
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 128</div>ultimately the winding up of PALS as an independent charity. The
consequences were extremely serious for the charity concerned. It
happened despite a petition from 1,000 local supporters of the charity
and the involvement of the local MP.</div>
<a name="0607073000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Association for
Charities&#146; conclusion is pretty strongly
worded:</div><a name="0607073000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is clear that
the Commission found no substantial breaches or any intent to breach
charity law or regulation. The fact is that charity law as interpreted
by the Commission is so complex there can hardly be a charity in the
land which does not occasionally commit minor technical breaches. The
Commission could not find even a half decent excuse to destroy this
charity. But it sacked the key person at the centre of PALS&#146;
success, &#145;supervised&#146; the appointment of incompetent
replacement trustees who destroyed it, and then connived in disposing
of the remnants to a big
charity.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording is
extremely strong, and I am sure that the commission and its
representatives might contest it. One might think that it is an
over-excited response to an administrative issue.</div>
<a name="0607073000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other hand, the founder
of the charity was represented by Bates, Wells and Braithwaite, which
in my view is the country&#146;s leading charity law firm. It
includes such eminent and learned Friends as Lord Phillips of Sudbury.
The firm wrote to the Charity Commission in September 1998 to say that
the PALS case had been handled in a way that it
considered</div><a name="0607073000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to have been
profoundly
unsatisfactory.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">A few
days later it wrote to the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr.
Swayne), saying:</div>
<a name="0607073000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under the Charities Act
1993, the Charity Commission had an extraordinary latitude and
draconian powers which...are not checked or qualified by any
prescribed due procedure or meaningful accountability. This has led to
heavy-handedness, unfairness and serious miscalculation on the part of
the Commission in this case...We very definitely think it is a
case which may be used to illustrate the need to ensure that the
Commission is statutorily obliged to act in accordance with the general
principles of fairness and natural justice in accordance with a
prescribed and open procedure and that there is an effective,
independent and affordable appeal
procedure.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some ways, the Bill already takes account of that matter. The
establishment of the charity tribunal is a welcome step. It is one of
the ways that it seeks to address the general rule of having some kind
of transparent court of appeal against charity commission decisions. It
is one of the reasons that we support the Bill in general.
Nevertheless, that particular case would not have been easy to refer to
the tribunal, unless the Bill is amended in the way that I suggest. The
sense of injustice that permeates that report&#151;and which is
present in some smaller charities, some of which have been subject to
Charity Commission decisions and their consequences&#151;is something
that it is in the commission&#146;s interests to address.</div>
<a name="0607073000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the commission were to have a
proper process which resulted in consequences or the actions being
challenged and gives the commission the opportunity to justify them in
some way&#151;what Bates, Wellsand Braithwaite called a
&#147;prescribed and open procedure&#148;&#151;that would enable
them to avoid ever having to be presented with a document like this
ever again. They would have that open and prescribed procedure and
would be able to justify and hopefully be almost acquitted by the
tribunal, if they were acting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 129</div>in the right. I am therefore keen to promote amendment No.86 for that
reason.</div><a name="0607073000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
69 repeats the principle of amendment No. 85. Therefore, I will not
spend a great deal of time on it. However, the significant phrase
within it is:</div><a name="0607073000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;decisions,
orders or directions not made by the Commission which could reasonably
have been made by the Commission.&#148;</div>
<a name="0607073000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 87 closes what
might be a loophole. I would be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s views on that. There are large numbers of provisions
in the Bill which address, or give the right of appeal against, Charity
Commission decisions. However, the commission is not the only body
corporate that can act under the Bill. The Secretary of State himself
has powers, some of which are by order and regulation and which could
presumably be challenged in this place and elsewhere. There are some
powers, for example, the decision to appoint, set remuneration for and
even sack, a member of the Charity Commission itself.</div>
<a name="0607073000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot see anywhere in the
Bill&#151;but perhaps the Minister may enlighten me if I am
wrong&#151;where that type of decision could be challenged on any of
the bases that we have discussed in the debate so far. It would be good
if the Secretary of State&#146;s decisions were also subject to the
Bill&#146;s appeal procedure and the processes of the charity
tribunal. I beg leave to move the amendment in my
name.</div><a name="0607073000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000574"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I strongly support the thrust of the amendments
tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. That is why I have tabled
amendmentNo. 19, which seeks to achieve the same thing by a
different route and which I give notice that I wish to move at whatever
time is appropriate.</div><a name="0607073000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was appalled to read the Association for Charities&#146; report. I
cannot believe that a public body has behaved in such an irresponsible
way. One that is so open to criticism and appears to adopt the most
reprehensible tactics in dealing with members of the public and members
who are trying to do their best&#151;a very small group of
people.</div><a name="0607073000485"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="0607073000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">To my knowledge,
and as the hon. Member for Cheltenham said, none of the report has been
substantially challenged by either the Charity Commission or the Home
Office. I am amazed that such behaviour has been tolerated in a public
body. The hon. Gentleman quoted the letter to my hon. Friend the Member
for New Forest, West. It bears repeating that the letter was not
written by the Association for Charities, nor by an irritated trustee
and nor by someone who went into the marketplace in Salisbury, gave
money and then found that the money was being wasted by the appointees
of the Charity Commission. The letter was written by a reputable firm
of charity lawyers who described the commission as having extraordinary
latitude and draconian powers, as having behaved with heavy handedness
and unfairness, and as having made serious
miscalculations.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 130</div><a name="0607073000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission appointed trustees
for the charity who came and went on an almost monthly basis. It then
handed over what remained of the charity&#146;s assets to another
charity that did not appear to have identical objectives&#151;the
National Canine Defence League. That is a perfectly reputable charity
that focuses on the needs of dogs, but PALS focused on the needs of a
far wider range of animals. The commission tried to bully Lorraine
Drake, using what seems the absolutely perverse excuse that the
buildings of the charity, which were mobile buildings, were on her
land. It bullied her into entering into a lease with the charity for
that land&#151;a move for which there was no legal
justification.</div><a name="0607073000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that the tribunal may have been set up as a result of such a case.
However, I believe that the hon. Member for Cheltenham is absolutely
right in saying that there should be a general mechanism of appeal,
because the alternative is to go to the High Court&#151;an option
that the tribunal is meant to prevent. The tribunal was established
because charities cannot afford to go to the High Court; charities that
spend money going to the High Court are spending money that could be
better spent on animals, young people, or the elderly and vulnerable,
or the other beneficiaries of the charity. I strongly believe that any
decision or non-decision of the charity should be appealable to the
tribunal. That is why I tabled amendment No.
19.</div><a name="0607073000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000575"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> Just for the record, I am not going to take

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000576"></a>Edward

with it this time.</div><a name="0607073000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the Association for Charities report, I do not want to enter into the
details of the case that has been mentioned. However, to set some
context for the Committee, it is worth pointing out that the PALS case
went to the independent complaints reviewer, which, as I understand it,
did not uphold the case made by the Association for Charities. That is
not to say that the document does not have its merits. I have not read
it, but I shall endeavour to do so, and I am sure that it has merit,
but the case is not one of a public body operating without any
constraint. Indeed, the case was taken to the ICR, which found in
favour of the
commission.</div><a name="0607073000187"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000577"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It is of course a fact that the ICR has a contract
with the Charity Commission to perform that service. Will the Minister
say whether it is still the case, or indeed whether it was ever the
case, that that contract involved an upper limit of &#163;5,000 on
compensation?</div><a name="0607073000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000578"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> It is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s turn to ask me
questions to which I do not know the answer. To my knowledge, the
contract does not involve that, but I shall endeavour to find out. I
think it is unfair to the independent complaints reviewer to suggest
that it is influenced by its contract with the Charity Commission to
find in favour of the commission, but I can find the answer for the
Committee. I suspect that there are many cases in which the independent

<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 131</div>complaints reviewer has not found in favour of the commission and it
will want to protect its independence and reputation. Although the hon.
Gentleman did not intend to do so, I think that he has slightly
impugned the reputation of the ICR, which I suspect goes about its job
diligently.</div><a name="0607073000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
deal with the amendments by first informing the Committee of the
principles of our approach to the establishment of the charity
tribunal. I will set out the context of the amendments and explain why
we do not believe that they are sensible while, on first blush, some of
them may seem to be making a reasonable case. There are three things
worth saying about the new body. First, it is an appellate body in line
with the accepted practices of the workings of tribunals, including
employment tribunals and those covering the Land Registry. Within the
rules and procedures of tribunals that are set out by the Tribunals
Service, they operate in an accepted way. They are bodies to which
appeal can be made if it were felt that a wrong decision had been made
by a public
body.</div><a name="0607073000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
decisions that tribunals consider are always&#151;and not only in the
case of the proposed charity tribunal&#151;legal, not administrative.
For example, the decision whether an organisation should be charitable
and whether the charity commissioners made a correct judgment is a
subject for the charity tribunal. However, the slow processing of an
application form and whether that was negligent is not. Members of the
Committee might wonder whether the charity tribunal will have enough to
do. I suggest that they look at column 1 of the table under schedule 4.
The table runs to eight pages and, by my count, deals with about 50
different classes of
decisions.</div><a name="0607073000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">A wide range
of legal decisions is made by the commission that the tribunal will be
entitled to consider, including whether an institution is put on the
register of charities, decisions that are made about trustees,
inquiries into charities and, indeed&#151; to answer the hon. Member
for Cheltenham&#151;the appointment of receiver-managers referred to
on page 95 of the Bill at column 1. It is
headed:</div><a name="0607073000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Order
made by the Commission under section 18(1) of this Act in relation to a
charity&#148;</div><a name="0607073000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">and includes
decisions made on an interim or receiver-manager
basis.</div><a name="0607073000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000579"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I have two brief questions for the Minister.
First, he suggests that only formal legal decisions are subjected to
the tribunal&#146;s review. However, page 94 refers to a decision
simply &#147;to institute an inquiry&#148;. That does not sound
like a legal decision to me. He seems to be putting a more restrictive
construction on schedule 4 than I thought was the
case.</div><a name="0607073000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I am
aware that the decision to appoint a receiver-manager is referred to
under the schedule, but we are dealing with when even the initial
decision might have been reasonable. However, the consequences of the
actions of the receiver-manager once appointed do not seem to be open
to challenge under the Bill, as drafted. If the Parliamentary Secretary
were willing to reassure me that he would make sufficient changes to
the table at some stage to allow for that, I might be
sympathetic.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 132</div><a name="0607073000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000580"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I cannot give the hon.
Gentleman reassurance on that point. The commission is operating its
legal or quasi-judicial function by making decisions, such as
instituting an inquiry, although that is referred to as a legal
decision. Indeed, it is covered in the table and considered to be a
legal decision. I cannot reassure him about the receiver-manager. He
highlighted the distinction that I am trying to draw and that all
tribunals follow between a legal decision and a challenge to a legal
decision, which is absolutely appropriate, and questions of
administration by the Charity Commission or persons that it appoints.
That is not a matter for tribunals. Tribunals make a ruling on a legal
decision made by a public body. That is not just true in this area; it
is true in respect of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the
Land Registry, which I cited, and the land tribunals, which I
understand operate in the same way. However, complaints about the
practice of administration of the body are for its internal complaints
procedures, the independent complaints reviewer, or the parliamentary
ombudsman&#151;they are not for the
tribunal.</div><a name="0607073000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000581"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary.
However, I have said that amendments Nos. 81 and 82 give examples of
how the activities I am talking about, which he has just
mentioned&#151;for example, the decision about whether to continue
with the appointment&#151;could be brought before the tribunal in a
way that fits with that legal
structure.</div><a name="0607073000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
deals not just with a decision to do something, but the decision not to
do something. That principle is already conceded in the schedule, so I
cannot see the problem with extending it expressly to the decision to
continue, for instance, with the appointment of a receiver-manager
where the issue at hand, if not the legal principle, is the continuing
activity being undertaken by that
receiver-manager.</div><a name="0607073000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000582"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am trying to follow the hon. Member for
Cheltenham as best I can. Like the hon. Member for Isle of Wight in his
amendments, he is crossing the divide between legal decisions made by
the Charity Commission that are correctly challengeable in the tribunal
and administrative decisions, which are a different type of practice
and are not legal decisions in the same
way.</div><a name="0607073000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Cheltenham cited an example from the Alzheimer&#146;s Society,
relating to a terrible delay in something happening and said that the
commission had been negligent. That is not a legal decision that is
challengeable in the tribunal. He may have been right about the case he
mentioned&#151;I do not know the details&#151;but such a case
should properly be taken to the complaints procedure, the ICR and the
parliamentary ombudsman. That is not just true in respect of the
Charity Commission tribunal, but across the
board.</div><a name="0607073000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000583"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I think that the Parliamentary Secretary is
wrong. A delay was not the issue in the case relating to the
Alzheimer&#146;s Foundation; the issue was the decision not to
institute an inquiry. Decisions to institute an inquiry are dealt with
under the schedule, so they must count as legal decisions. The schedule
also deals with decisions to do something and not to do something, so
the negative also applies in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 133</div>principle. However, that does not apply in the case that I mentioned.
There is no problem of legal principle in including, as is suggested in
amendment No. 85, something to allow a decision not to be made, as well
as allowing it to be made. That principle is already conceded in detail
in the schedule.</div><a name="0607073000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already tried to explain&#151;perhaps not very well&#151;that the
decision does not have to be a judgment on the conduct of the
administration. The decision in respect of the case that I have
mentioned would be the decision to continue with the appointment, which
would be a legal decision by the Charity Commission that may be based
on evidence from the ongoing activities. The legal decision that the
Parliamentary Secretary seeks would be the one under consideration.
Perhaps he will clarify whether the decision to appoint or not to
appoint is a legal
decision.</div><a name="0607073000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000584"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I will consider the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point on decisions not to institute an inquiry. However, his amendment
has a far broader scope than a specific decision not to institute an
inquiry. Amendment No. 69 refers
to</div><a name="0607073000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such appeals and
applications as may be made to the Tribunal, in respect of decisions,
orders or direction not made by the Commission which could reasonably
have been made by the
Commission&#148;.</div><a name="0607073000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">That covers a
range of administrative decisions that the commission could have made.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary
position, &#147;decisions, orders or direction&#148;, but that
covers a wide range of possible decisions, orders or directions that
the commission could or could not have made. It certainly goes into the
sphere of the administrative practice of the commission, which is why
we do not accept either that amendment or amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000585"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I refer the Minister to proposed new section
2A(4) of the 1993 Act, which clause 8 will insert. It
states:</div><a name="0607073000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine...such
appeals and applications as may be made to the Tribunal in accordance
with Schedule 1C to this Act, or any other enactment, in respect of
decisions, orders, or directions of the
Commission&#148;.</div><a name="0607073000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
merely repeats the positive wording of the existing
provision.</div><a name="0607073000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000586"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting and
important point, to which I shall endeavour to return soon.</div>
<a name="0607073000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">More generally, amendment No. 85
suffers from the problem that it takes the tribunal into the heart of
the administrative, rather than simply the legal, principles of the
commission. My point is that a significant delay in the
commission&#146;s work is obviously wrong and reprehensible, but not
a matter on which the tribunal should
adjudicate.</div><a name="0607073000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000587"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am extremely grateful to the Minister for
giving way yet again, but the word &#147;delay&#148; was his and
not mine. The example that I quoted was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 134</div>one of a decision not to instigate an inquiry, which is simply the
negative of legal principles that are already enshrined in the
schedule.</div>
<a name="0607073000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000588"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My understanding of amendment No. 85 is that it
would go down precisely that
road.</div><a name="0607073000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me move on to
amendment No. 86, which takes us to the implications of a decision, not
simply whether it was right or wrong. In our view&#151;this has long
been accepted for tribunals&#151;that should not be a matter for the
tribunal. The tribunal decides whether a decision was right or wrong;
it does not then consider the implications of a decision. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will not press amendment No. 86, at
least.</div><a name="0607073000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">A similar
argument applies to amendment No. 87 on decisions made by Ministers,
because it would take the tribunal into territory which would, in a
sense, be unprecedented. The hon. Gentleman made a point about the
appointment of charity commissioners, but I do not believe that it is
the intention of Parliament that a ministerial decision to appoint
charity commissioners should be taken to the charity tribunal. If
Parliament wishes to ensure oversight of Ministers&#146; decisions,
it can do so in many different ways, but that is not a matter for a
tribunal that is ruling on the Charity Commission&#146;s decisions,
just as a ministerial decision made under the Act that set up the
employment tribunal should not be taken to the employment tribunal
itself. On that basis, I hope that he will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="0607073000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 19, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, presents
two problems, the first of which might be an accident, because it would
mean that the commission would no longer be the respondent to an
appeal. I am sure that that is an oversight in the drafting of the
amendment, but its effect would be to omit paragraph 1(3) of new
schedule 1C to the 1993 Act, which
states:</div><a name="0607073000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commission shall be the respondent to such an
appeal.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
the hon. Gentleman did not intend that, because it would mean that the
commission would no longer have an obligation to appear and respond in
person to an
appeal.</div><a name="0607073000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The substance
of the amendment has the same problem as the amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Cheltenham. It would extend the charity tribunal from
its locus of more than 50 classes of decision into all areas, including
administrative areas. The Government have explained why that would not
be sensible.</div><a name="0607073000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
some sympathy with the notion expressed in another place that the table
in schedule 4 looks incredibly complex. When one becomes familiar with
it and realises that the challengeable decisions are listed in column
1, it begins to look less complex. The key question is whether the
guidance for people who want to go to the charity tribunal will make
clear which procedures can and cannot be taken to it. I have made
inquiries, and I am satisfied that the commission plans to issue
guidance that is more straightforward than what is in the Bill. It is
fair to say that in most cases, we would expect people who are
considering whether to take a case to the charity tribunal to consult
not the original legislation, but the
guidance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000589"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I cannot be sure, but I think that the reason why
the amendment would omit sub-paragraph (3) is that the amendment is
designed to give the power to request a determination and to give the
tribunal the power to make a judgment, on a general point of law where
there may be no respondent. Where there is a respondent, clearly it
would have to be the commission; otherwise, there would be no point in
appealing. To be honest, I cannot remember whether this is a drafting
error, but I know that I intended that there should be a power to
request the tribunal to make a decision, and therefore effectively to
give guidance on what the law is, even in the absence of a decision
from the
commission.</div><a name="0607073000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000590"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am not sure that I completely understood that
intervention, but that might be more to do with me than with the hon.
Gentleman. I take him to mean that he did not intend the omission of
sub-paragraph (3) to have the effect of preventing the commission from
being a respondent, and I accept that
entirely.</div><a name="0607073000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
amendment No. 69. I said that the first principle that we are applying
to the charity tribunal is that it will be an appellate body&#151;it
will deal with appeals against decisions. That is the general rule that
we are following. Opening an inquiry, which the hon. Gentleman cited in
relation to the Alzheimer&#146;s Foundation, is an incredibly serious
matter. The other reason why we are concerned about the amendment is
that it would essentially substitute the tribunal&#146;s decision for
the original executive decision-making power of the commission, so that
all decisions not to open inquiries into the 150,000 charities in
Britain could be
taken&#151;</div><a name="0607073000219"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000592"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but that
would be the effect of the amendment. It would mean that decisions not
to open inquiries&#151;not that many inquiries take place each year;
I believe that the number is in the hundreds&#151;would leave the
charity tribunal open to challenge from anyone who wanted an inquiry
into a particular
charity.</div><a name="0607073000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000593"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I think that the Minister&#146;s later remarks
answered my point somewhat. He said that there could be thousands of
challenges, but obviously common sense must intrude into the process at
some point. The decision not to instigate an inquiry is taken only in
response to an appeal to instigate an inquiry. The amendment would not
completely open the floodgates. It is only when an inquiry is
requested, as the Alzheimer&#146;s Society did in the case of the
Alzheimer&#146;s Foundation. I cannot believe that a floodgate would
be opened that would lead to an unmanageable work load. As I keep
saying, there are plenty of other examples in the schedule of decisions
not made being subject to review by the tribunal. I cannot see what is
so different about this particular class of
decision.</div><a name="0607073000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000594"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The difference is that the decision in question
would be one of sufficient gravity that it would call into question the
nature of the charity and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 136</div>the institution. Therefore, there is a danger of the floodgates being
opened to all types of complaints against institutions. The amendment
is dangerous in the breadth of what it proposes. With that information,
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="0607073000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000595"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. I
will withdraw the amendment. However, I shall do so in the hope that
the Minister, having found himself a little ill at ease in answering
some of the questions that were put to him, will consider examining the
schedule and making appropriate amendments in due course under the
powers that are conferred in the Bill to address these serious
issues.</div><a name="0607073000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general
principles that he has stated do not hold water. If other decisions are
in the schedule, both being and not being made and in both cases being
open to challenge, and if such a serious matter&#151;the phrase he
used was &#147;of sufficient gravity&#148;&#151;as the decision
to instigate an inquiry can be included in the positive, I cannot
understand why it, like those other decisions, cannot be included in
the negative as well. That seems a perfectly logical and reasonable
thing to do.</div> <a name="0607073000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that the other amendments in the group, which have not been moved
and therefore cannot be withdrawn&#151;I am learning Mr.
Gale&#151;take us into the field of administration. There is nothing
to suggest that in the amendments. They allow a particular class of
decision&#151;to appoint a receiver manager&#151;to be revisited
and reopened. That does not mean that the administration has to be
reviewed as a matter of legal principle. It simply allows the decision
to continue with the appointment of receiver manager to be challenged.
That seems a reasonable and legally justifiable step to take. With that
expectation and hope, I withdraw the amendment in my
name.</div><a name="0607073000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by

<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 137</div><a name="0607073000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000599"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I referred to amendments Nos. 15 and 16 in our
discussion on amendment No. 12. The Joint Committee, chaired by the
right hon. Member for Darlington, recommended that the tribunal should
have power to award compensation and/or costs against the Charity
Commission. The Bill only provides for the award of costs. The Joint
Committee&#146;s recommendation was supported by, for example, the
Association for Charities, which pointed out the substantial costs that
could accrue to charities as a result of incorrect legal decisions. We
have already heard about
maladministration.</div><a name="0607073000487"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="0607073000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 15
takes us into slightly different territory: the possibility of costs
being awarded against charities. Proposed new section 2B(6) of the 1993
Act in clause 8
says:</div><a name="0607073000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the
Tribunal considers that any party to proceedings before it has acted
vexatiously, frivolously or unreasonably, the Tribunal may order that
party to pay to any other party to the proceedings the whole or part of
the costs incurred by that other party in connection with the
proceedings.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
do not intend to encourage anyone to appeal to the tribunal
vexatiously, frivolously or unreasonably, each of those things is a
matter of judgment&#151;particularly &#147;unreasonably&#148;. As
far as I can see, there are only three parties on the side of a charity
that could meet an award of costs.</div>
<a name="0607073000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, that could mean an
insurance company with which the charity has an insurance arrangement,
although it is difficult to get insurance against behaving vexatiously.
Secondly, such a party could be trustees of the charity. We do not want
to make people fear that their trusteeship should lead to them losing
their house, or something of that kind, perhaps because of a decision,
for which they had a distant responsibility, taken on the
recommendation of well-paid or, more likely, not very well-paid
officials. Thirdly, the charity could bear responsibility for paying
such costs. The costs may not be substantial, but there is no bar to
representation before the tribunal. In many cases, there is an
unbalanced relationship between the appellant and the respondent in
such a tribunal, because the charity only has its money and the Charity
Commission has lots of public money and may have retained solicitors
and possibly even barristers to represent it and may be seeking those
costs. There is a danger that such a decision may either bankrupt or
reduce substantially the asset base of the
charity.</div><a name="0607073000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to encourage people to behave vexatiously or frivolously, but what is
unreasonable to one person is often reasonable to another. I do not
know whether we are talking about Wednesbury unreasonableness or pure
common or garden unreasonableness, with which we are all confronted
from time to time in life, but I should not like a charity to be run
out of town as a result of a decision taken by the tribunal because the
tribunal did not have the responsibility, as this amendment proposes,
to have regard to the need of the charity to continue to meet its
objectives and, by implication, to retain a reasonable proportion of
its
assets.</div><a name="0607073000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000600"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I sympathise with much of what the hon. Member
for Isle of Wight said. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 138</div>impressed by the new concept of common or garden reasonableness. I am
not sure how easy it would be to define that in law, but I am sure that
Bates, Wells and Braithwaite would charge a healthy fee to find
out.</div><a name="0607073000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendments Nos.
78 and 83 have similar aims to those tabled by the hon. Gentleman, but
they would achieve them differently, by omitting Clause
8(5)&#151;</div><a name="0607073000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Tribunal may award costs only in accordance with subsections (6) and
(7)&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0607073000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
restricts the extent to which costs may be awarded. Amendment No. 83 is
a consequent amendment to No. 78. Although I should like those to be
considered, I am broadly sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments and am happy to support
them.</div><a name="0607073000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000601"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> On a point of order. I should have given notice of
my intention to speak on amendment No.
15.</div><a name="0607073000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000602"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> This is an important matter and an important
part of the clause. Amendments Nos. 14 and 16 in a sense go together,
because they both concern compensation. The Government believe that the
tribunal should be able to award costs against the commission, and that
is the position taken in the Bill. The problem, which has been
mentioned in relation to earlier amendments, is that although the
amendments would widen the scope of the tribunal and give it the remit
to consider compensation claims, compensation is not a matter for
tribunals. The tribunal makes alegal finding. Compensation is
a matter for the independent complaints reviewer, which has the power
to recommend a consolatory payment, or for the parliamentary ombudsman,
who can recommend any level of redress if the complainant has evidence
that he or she has experienced quantifiable financial loss, or
inconvenience, or
worry.</div><a name="0607073000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
sympathise with the motivation for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment, the tribunal makes a finding of legal fact and can award
costs against either party, depending on how they have acted, in the
manner set out in subsections (6) and (7). However, questions of
compensation for financial loss and other matters are not questions for
the
tribunal.</div><a name="0607073000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000603"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am having difficulty working out whether the
Minister means a tribunal in the sense of a tribunal as referred to in
the Bill, and also whether, when he talks about the way the tribunal
system works, he means the tribunal system in the context of the Bill,
or tribunals more generally. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] He is talking about
the Bill. I was going to say that other tribunals, such as employment
tribunals, can make compensation payments. If he means tribunals as
referred to in the Bill, that is why we are proposing the amendment,
because we want to change the system in the Bill, although doubtless
the Minister will tell us more about why we should
not.</div><a name="0607073000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000604"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My understanding is that, in the case of
tribunals dealing with appeals against public bodies, the practice is
not for compensation to be awarded by the tribunal but for compensation
to go through the independent complaints reviewer and the parliamentary
ombudsman.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 139</div><a name="0607073000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607073000605"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): If the tribunal rules
in one direction and compensation is then awarded by the parliamentary
ombudsman, does the parliamentary ombudsman have the power to force
that compensation to be
paid?</div><a name="0607073000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000606"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The parliamentary ombudsman does not have the
power to force compensation to be paid, but the commission will almost
always accept the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s recommendation. If
the recommendation were not accepted, there would have to be a report
to the Select Committee on Public Administration. Acceptance is not
compulsory, but I think that I am right to say that in custom and in
practice the commission always accepts the ombudsman&#146;s
advice.</div><a name="0607073000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000607"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> But the only way in which we could
guarantee payment of compensation would be by allowing the tribunal to
award it. We have seen cases in which the parliamentary ombudsman has
said that the Government have to do something about pensions and the
Government have totally rejected that recommendation. The only way to
ensure that compensation will be paid would be to provide for that in
the Bill.</div>
<a name="0607073000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000608"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
Nevertheless, we have an assurance that the commission follows the
recommendations of the independent complaints reviewer&#151;that is
its record, and follows the advice of the parliamentary ombudsman. That
is how the system works for public bodies, and it is a perfectly
reasonable way
forward.</div><a name="0607073000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000609"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary seems to be falling
into the trap of confusing the exact two issues that he complained were
being confused by the hon. Member for Cheltenham and me earlier. I am
talking about, on the one hand, the administrative issues, which go
before the independent complaints reviewer and the ombudsman, and on
the other, the legal issues, which go before the tribunal.</div>
<a name="0607073000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that legal issues can
go to the independent complaints reviewer, but it seems absurd that,
having gone to all the trouble of getting a tribunal decision, someone
would have to go to someone else, to start, presumably, with a blank
sheet. I accept that that blank sheet would contain the decision, but
the compensation would then have to be assessed. That seems to build an
unnecessary hoop into the
system.</div><a name="0607073000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000610"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am not sure about a hoop. The parliamentary
ombudsman and the independent complaints reviewer have experience in
such matters of financial loss, in working out the effect of any
maladministration and in making a judgement. If we were to do this, we
would give the tribunal a new set of responsibilities as regards
quantifying the extent of financial loss and so on. I do not accept
that there is a new hoop; it is either an additional responsibility for
the tribunal or it builds on existing responsibilities for the
ombudsman and the independent complaints
reviewer.</div><a name="0607073000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move on to
amendment No. 78, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham.
It would widen 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 140</div>the powers of the tribunal&#151;not, on this occasion, to provide
compensation, but to provide costs. As I understand it, its effect
would be to do so in all circumstances, not only those in which either
party had acted unreasonably, vexatiously or frivolously. Again, we can
be sympathetic to the intentions behind the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment, because we do not want a Goliath Charity Commission against
a David complainant.</div>
<a name="0607073000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I caution the Committee
against turning things into a lawyer&#146;s paradise. Some would say
that about employment tribunals, although I could not possibly comment.
We want the process to be a simple and straightforward one, in which
people can go to tribunals, get easy means of redress and represent
themselves. We do not want to create lots of business for Bates, Wells
and Braithwaite and other firms, worthy though the individuals working
for them may be.</div> <a name="0607073000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a danger that in giving such a broad allowance for costs,
essentially the same as that of any court of law, we would open up the
process&#151;on both sides, to be fair&#151;to large legal costs.
The point applies equally to the Charity Commission. At the moment, the
commission will have to pay its own costs unless it can show that the
other side has acted frivolously, unreasonably or vexatiously. If we
accepted the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, the Charity Commission
could run up big legal costs, if it was confident of victory, and
charge them to the other side. That might also cause dangers and
threats to the charities
concerned.</div><a name="0607073000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the sentiment behind the amendment, and it is important that as we
scrutinise how the tribunal works in practice, we ensure that it has
proper means of redress. The overall principle is supported on both
sides: going to the High Court as the only route of redress against the
commission is not sufficient. There needs to be an easy means of
redress. Let us not try to turn the tribunal into another version of
the High Court. That is my fear about the amendment and, on that basis,
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press it to a
Division.</div><a name="0607073000488"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="0607073000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">That takes me to
amendment No. 15. It is a reasonable proposition of the hon. Member for
Isle of Wight, but I fear that there is a danger. It is qualifying the
awarding of costs in cases when a charity is considered to have acted
vexatiously and unreasonably. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
motivation. He does not want lots of worthy charities facing huge costs
as a result of a tribunal case. However, the proposal would open up the
tribunal system to vexatious individuals who will want to take a case.
In a sense, they would be assured that the charity itself will have a
degree of protection, even if the individuals within it were acting in
a vexatious way. Let us be honest:the test of vexatiousness,
frivolousness or unreasonableness is pretty stern. The Wednesbury test
concerns unreasonable action that no reasonable person would have
followed. It is not simply that someone is adjudicated to be on the
wrong side of an argument. Unreasonableness is a much sterner test than
that. The gap between being wrong and being unreasonable is very
wide.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000611"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I entirely understand the Minister&#146;s
argument. Sitting in this room, it makes perfect sense. However, it
tends to err on the side of the Charity Commission. Let us suppose that
a small charity thought that some wrong had been done. In reality, it
would challenge the decision, go to the tribunal and make its case.
Then comes the problem. It might think that the Charity Commission
would employ solicitors and barristers who run up huge fees and
bankrupt it, as a result of which it would not risk going to the
tribunal.</div><a name="0607073000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000612"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I completely understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. It is a judgment call that we have to make in
such circumstances. I assure the Committee that a review has to take
place within five years of the workings of the Act, but it is
incredibly important for the Government to keep under close watch the
way in which the tribunal system starts to unfold and work. I have
considered setting a timetable for a specific review of the tribunal,
but that is probably not sensible because it would be better for there
to be a real obligation and pledge on behalf of the Government to
scrutinise the way in which the system works and not to set an
arbitrary time limit on it. If big issues of access of justice,
however, were raised, we would need to think again and find ways in
which we can solve the
difficulty.</div><a name="0607073000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come now

that other party in connection with the
proceedings.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal
Democrat amendment would
add:</div><a name="0607073000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or the decision,
direction or order of the Commission which is the subject of such
proceedings.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
another sense in which recompense for any financial loss incurred is
being introduced. I have explained why we think that that is an
appropriate role for the ICR and the parliamentary ombudsman.</div>
<a name="0607073000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that deals with the
amendments before us, and that they will be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000613"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I do not propose to withdraw amendment No. 14,
because I think that the Parliamentary Secretary&#146;s answer is
bizarre. He is saying that a legal matter for which the appellant might
already have gone through the Charity Commission&#146;s complaints
procedure and to the independent case reviewer might then go to the
tribunal and be successful. Because of the effect of that earlier legal
decision, the charity might have incurred losses. He is saying that it
should then retrace its steps and return to the commission and the
parliamentary
ombudsman.</div><a name="0607073000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, that
would essentially mean explaining quite a bit of the case again,
because it would mean explaining why the appellant made the losses.
Secondly and more tellingly, going to the parliamentary ombudsman
assumes maladministration. Not all legal errors are maladministration.
Some are quite simply the result of getting it wrong, which is not
maladministration. Knowing the law and getting it wrong might be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 142</div>maladministration, but if the law is genuinely unclear and the tribunal
decides what the law is, that is not maladministration.</div>
<a name="0607073000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">So why on earth go to the
ombudsman for compensation? Is the Minister saying&#151;perhaps he
is&#151;that the ombudsman would have the power to provide
compensation in a case that was not
maladministration?</div><a name="0607073000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000614"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That is where the ICR comes
in.</div><a name="0607073000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000615"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The ICR probably decided in the first place that
it was not a mistake in law. If an employment tribunal can offer
compensation, I do not see why the charity tribunal should not. To
recount a personal anecdote, I became aware of a recent employment
tribunal case by virtue of my membership of the House. It took two and
a half days to hear the case and about 10 minutes to agree the
compensation. That seems to be a sensible way of proceeding. Of course
the amendment would give the tribunal a new power; the tribunal is new.
That is not a very good argument, and I intend to press the
amendment.</div><a name="0607073000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">On access to
justice, the Minister was much more conciliatory. He said that he had
considered a timetable for specific review of the tribunal&#146;s
judgments, he said that a big issue of access to justice would make the
Government think again and, most tellingly, he said to my
hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) that it is a
matter of judgment. It is a matter of judgment. I would like charities
to feel that if they think the commission has behaved unlawfully, they
can go to the tribunal without serious risk of their assets. For that
reason, I shall press the
amendment.</div><a name="0607073000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000650"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Amendment No. 17 is one of the most important
amendments to the Bill. The National Council of Voluntary Organisations
felt that the issue of right of access to justice was one of the two
most important issues requiring amendment when the Bill was debated in
another place in June 2005. Unless there is a cost provision to enable
smaller charities in particular to have access, the tribunal will be
seriously underused. Indeed, many charities will not have access to it.
Lord Phillips of Sudbury used two telling expressions. He
said:</div> <a name="0607073000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our law
is cluttered with tribunals that afford theoretical remedy to agreed
citizens&#151;&#148;</div><a name="0607073000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">it says
&#147;agreed&#148; in the Lords <i class="I">Hansard</i>, but it is meant to
be
&#147;aggrieved&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0607073000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but
are inaccessible because they are so expensive to
access.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 12
October 2005;Vol. 674, c.
350.]</div><a name="0607073000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">In sharp contradistinction
to what the Minister said a moment ago, although not out of any intent,
Lord Phillips also said that if one keeps the lawyers out, one keeps
common sense in. I know that the Minister does not intend to turn the
tribunal into an alternative High Court of Justice, but sadly,
employment tribunals, and for all I know, many others quickly get
stacked up with lawyers who use up far too much time, far too much
energy, and in particular, far too much money.</div>
<a name="0607073000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister may feel that
providing a little money to help the charity that wishes to appeal
against a decision of the commission will encourage the lawyers.
However, my view is that it will encourage decisions to be made on a
level playing field on important legal
issues.</div><a name="0607073000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission
does not have unlimited resources&#151;we do not know what resources
it will have&#151;but it will want to put the best defence that it
can in any case at tribunal and it may have to make a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 145</div>judgment mid-year to spend more on representation and less on public
benefit tests. The problem is that it has the capacity to spend a good
deal of money on representation, while the appellants do not. The
creation of a suitors fund was recommended by the Prime
Minister&#146;s strategy unit in 2002. I feel strongly that we have
to provide some means by which the small appellant can get to the
tribunal.</div><a name="0607073000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Bassam said in another place that he accepts
that</div><a name="0607073000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;even small expenses
may be beyond some small
charities.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that.
He also
said:</div><a name="0607073000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Attorney-General will present cases at his own expense, so the
consideration should not trouble us too much, but I accept the point
that there may be difficulties for smaller
charities.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 28
June 2005; Vol. 673, c. 215.]</div><a name="0607073000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Attorney-General is likely to get involved in very few cases before the
charity tribunal. Indeed, the Minister in the other place accepts that,
because I think that he suggested that an alternative source of funding
could be the legal aid fund in exceptional cases. Again, we are talking
about exceptional cases.</div>
<a name="0607073000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The legal aid fund is no more
generously provided for than many other good causes. That is not a
criticism of the Government. My noble Friend Lord Swinfen said on 12
October 2005 that the Minister in the other place opposed the amendment
in question</div><a name="0607073000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on the
grounds that the Legal Services Commission will be able to grant
exceptional funding in certain cases, usually public interest or test
cases.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">He continued
that</div><a name="0607073000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the noble Lord, Lord
Phillips, who is an extremely eminent charity lawyer, replied that he
was unaware of the legal authority of the Legal Services Commission and
that the general position has been that legal aid is unavailable to
charities.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 12
October 2005; Vol. 674, c.
351.]</div><a name="0607073000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if such funding is
available, there is not much of it. We need a suitors fund so people
have the opportunity to appeal. I am not suggesting that that should
involve a huge amount of money and I am not even suggesting an amount
of money, unlike the hon. Member for Cheltenham, although I hope that
the sum involved would be near to the one in amendment No 80, and I
hope that there would be a fund to allow access to justice for the
small charities that deserve
it.</div><a name="0607073000333"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000651"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I agree with the hon. Member for Isle of Wight
that this is one of the most important amendments that we are
considering today. I remember, long ago, back in 2002, when I worked as
a mere grubbing consultant advising charities on their fundraising
strategy, that there was the possibility of a Cabinet Office strategy
unit report on the voluntary sector. That report eventually resulted in
this Bill. However, years later, we are still trying to get it on the
statute book. That report recommended the creation of a suitors fund.
That suggestion was supported widely by charities, including the NCVO,
and many of our noble friends in another place, including Lord Phillips
of Sudbury, whose opinions I always value and often agree
with.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 146</div><a name="0607073000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight said, the response by Lord Bassam of Brighton in the House of
Lords was wildly unrealistic. The idea that small charities would have
the confidence to take on the possible costs of taking a case to the
tribunal and that, if they had limited funds or their funds were
stretched in that year, they would have to rely on the intervention of
the Attorney-General or prove that their case was exceptional to the
satisfaction of a legal aid body, is hopelessly
unrealistic.</div>
<a name="0607073000491"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="0607073000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The suggestion
has had widespread support. It is unfortunate that it got lost on the
way to another place, and there is a possibility that that was a result
of the Treasury being rather worried that it was some kind of blank
cheque. The reason for the slight difference between our amendment No.
80 and Conservative amendment No. 17 is that we insert some reference
to the value of the fund.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000653"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Absolutely. We always like to cost our proposals
and to have them fully examined from a financial point of view. That is
certainly the responsible thing to do. It is a serious point; if the
reason for the opposition to the idea was the Treasury&#146;s worry
that the fund might be a blank cheque and an open-ended pot of money
for charities to bring every complaint possible, I am sure that all
members of the Committee and most Members of the House would be open to
whatever methodologies or processes that the Government wish to propose
that would enable that to happen. I caution the Minister not to dismiss
the idea too frivolously. It was in the original strategy unit report
and, as I have said, has been widely supported in the sector. There is
obvious justice and reason behind its inclusion in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="0607073000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000654"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> This fund would allay, to a large extent, some of
the fears that I previously referred to, and it all goes back to the
classic case. Most charities are small. The fund is irrelevant to big
charities as they have all sorts of departments and can arrange their
affairs rather like big business&#151;big business has no problems
with anything and has departments for this, that and the other. Small
businesses cannot take remedy because they do not have the time or the
money, and the fund at least helps with the money side of the
situation. They need only a relatively small amount at least to have
the injustice heard. There is a lot to recommend the idea, and I hope
that the Minister can take it on board.</div>
<a name="0607073000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000655"></a>Peter

might explain, too, whether the idea was that a suitor had to be the
charity itself, an individual trustee, or an outsider with an interest
in what the trust ought to be doing. He will not be surprised that I
have more than one brother-in-law. The one I have in mind is Dr. George
Reid, who is a trustee of the Alleyn&#146;s estate. He went to the
High Court&#151;not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 147</div>at a cost of &#163;30,000&#151;and received an honourable mention in
the Charity Commission&#146;s report 15 or 20 years ago. He had the
sort of case that it was proper to have taken, about a failure to get
agreement among the trustees, and would clearly have been regarded as a
suitor. That may or may not have been a suitable case, but the
interesting question is where the limitation comes in and where would
it have been if the strategy unit&#146;s approach had been taken
forward. If the Minister is going to resist the amendments, he could
explain to the Committee whether that is being done purely on the
grounds of cost, whether he thinks they are unnecessary or whether
there is some other reason of which we have not
thought.</div><a name="0607073000340"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000658"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I may have got that slightly wrong.
</div><a name="0607073000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I do not think
that the strategy unit simply recommended a suitors fund. As I
understand it&#151;I shall check on this point&#151;it saw it as an
alternative to the tribunal and a way of funding people to go to the
High Court. We can be sympathetic to the intentions behind the
amendments, but the problem is essentially raised because the
Conservative amendment is open ended while the amendment tabled by the
hon. Member for Cheltenham is limited. In neither case is there any
sense of the criteria that would be used for who is eligible and who is
not. Therefore, one faces a problem with the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight&#146;s amendment. The costs are potentially unlimited and it
could be a lawyers&#146; charter. I am not saying that it would be
one, but it could be. I admire the hon. Member for Cheltenham&#146;s
fiscal responsibility&#151;that is a new-found thing for the Liberal
Democrats&#151;but he does not answer the question as to who would
get that &#163;100,000, who one would turn away and how one would
judge that point.</div>
<a name="0607073000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said all that, I am in a
charitable mood and understand the intentions behind the proposal and I
do not want to dismiss it out of hand. I know that the question of the
suitors fund has been long standing. I will take the issue away and
come back on Report. I do not make any promises on that point because
it is difficult. The example of employers tribunals and issues of legal
aid are informative in that respect but I will take the issue away and
consider
it.</div><a name="0607073000345"></a>

Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 148</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">Notwithstanding the provisions of this Part, the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration shall have power pursuant
to section 5(1) of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 (c. 13)
(matters subject to investigation) and Schedule 2 to that Act
(Departments etc subject to investigation) to investigate any action
taken by, or on behalf of, the
Commission.&#148;&#146;.</div>
<a name="0607073000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000662"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Amendment No. 79 is a probing one that challenges
the rather extraordinary proposed section 2D, which is one of the
amendments to the 1993 Act, and on page 10 of the Bill. Having set up a
panoply of commission and appeal processes and the opportunity of all
the types of processes that we have been discussing at inordinate
length today, it creates another provision that adds intervention by
the Attorney-General on top of that. I would love to hear the
Government&#146;s justification for
that.</div><a name="0607073000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000663"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> My amendment No. 18 tries to avoid doubt, which is
always a dangerous thing to do. It occurs to me that the parliamentary
commissioner may be capable of resolving issues that might otherwise go
to the tribunal. I say that with a sense of inquiry. Is the Minister
sure that any issue that is reasonably likely to be raised can either
go through the complaints procedure to the parliamentary commissioner
or to the tribunal? If that is the case, would it be beneficial for the
parliamentary commissioner to be able to look at questions of law as
well as those of
administration?</div><a name="0607073000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000664"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> First, could the Minister explain whether under
the proposed section 2D(4)(a) and (b), the Attorney-General&#146;s
power to intervene&#151;which I welcome&#151;extends to being able
to order a discontinuation of an action or is it a matter of helping
the tribunal in one sense or another? Second, does the Minister regard
this as a suitable occasion to say whether&#151;although this goes
slightly beyond the clause&#151;if the Charity Commission causes a
High Court action to be taken against a charity, the Attorney-General
has the power to order that kind of action to be
discontinued?</div><a name="0607073000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000665"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Member for Worthing, West is continuing
his enviable record of asking difficult questions&#151;I preferred
his last intervention to this one. Let me provide an explanation on
those two points. The first amendment seeks to remove the
Attorney-General&#146;s right to intervene in any proceeding. That is
in the Bill because the Attorney-General has a unique&#151;some might
say slightly odd&#151;and important position in charity law. He is
the protector of charity on behalf of the Crown. It is important to be
clear about that.</div>
<a name="0607073000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those powers for the
Attorney-General to intervene do not mean that he represents either
party in the dispute, but that he is supposed to have a non-adversarial
role, essentially as a friend of the court, in representing the
interests of the beneficiary. That is a long-standing feature of the
law in this area. It is not about the Attorney-General somehow moving
in on the case in an adversarial way; the role is that of a
non-adversarial friend of the court. I believe that it is widely
acknowledged to be a perfectly sensible idea 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 149</div>that he should represent a beneficial interest of the charity and that
the tribunal can take his views into account.</div>
<a name="0607073000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer one question that was
put to me by the hon. Member for Worthing, West, I am pretty sure that
the Attorney-General cannot overturn the tribunal&#146;s decisions. I
shall have to come back to him later about his second brain
teaser.</div>
<a name="0607073000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move to amendment No. 18,
which was tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. Let me be clear
on this. As I explained earlier, the tribunal considers legal
decisions, and the ombudsman has the power to investigate cases of
maladministration. I understand that the hon. Gentleman wants to be
assured that that is the case, and I can assure him that it is. The
danger of his amendment is that it seems to open up a case in which a
legal decision is being considered by the tribunal, to being considered
by the ombudsman at the same time. That would be slightly odd, because
one wants the tribunal to be able to take its course and for any claim
of maladministration then to be made, but not for those processes to
run in parallel.</div>
<a name="0607073000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000666"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> The Minister said that he might come back to a
question that I asked. I am perfectly happy to wait until our debates
on clause 38, especially if we get to consider amendment No. 122, which
might be helpful to his
advisers.</div><a name="0607073000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000667"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am most grateful. I give
way.</div><a name="0607073000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000668"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It is certainly not my intention that cases should
be considered in parallel or consecutively bythe tribunal and
the ombudsman. My concerns are partly to do with the position of the
independent complaints reviewer. I understand that the parliamentary
ombudsman can consider cases only if domestic remedies have been
exhausted. I assume that the work of the independent complaints
reviewer is considered to be a domestic remedy for that purpose, and
that one would therefore first have to go through the complaints
procedure and then the independent complaints reviewer. The Minister
shakes his head, so it seems that that is not the case.</div>
<a name="0607073000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the case, however, that a
large number of complaints that have been to the ombudsman have been
rejected as being out of the ombudsman&#146;s jurisdiction. The
figures that I have concerning cases since 1993 are that out of 102
cases, 63 have been rejected as being out of jurisdiction. It might be
that those were all legal cases or that they were complaints about
charities that should never have gone to the ombudsman; the ombudsman
does not know, although the latter is assumed. Where an easier and
simpler remedy than the tribunal is available, which I think that going
through the ombudsman might be, it should be available despite the fact
that the tribunal is
available.</div><a name="0607073000360"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000669"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I think that that was the longest intervention
in world history, Mr. Gale.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 150</div><a name="0607073000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000670"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I was thinking of it as a
speech.</div><a name="0607073000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000671"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I shall enter it into the &#147;Guinness Book
of Records&#148;.</div> <a name="0607073000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to clear up one point. There is the internal complaints
procedure of the commission, there is the independent complaints
reviewer, and there is the ombudsman. It is true that an individual
must go through the internal complaints procedure of the commission,
but I understand that they also have the option of going to the ICR or
the parliamentary ombudsman. I do not have an answer on the specific
figures that the hon. Gentleman cites, but I suspect that all the cases
concern legal decisions that can now go to the tribunal; I hope that
the tribunal will help in that respect. I hope that that answers his
question
sufficiently.</div><a name="0607073000492"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="0607073000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can now answer
the hon. Member for Worthing, West, because inspiration has struck. The
Attorney-General has no power to order the discontinuation of a case
before the tribunal or the High Court. Discontinuation will be a matter
for the party bringing the proceedings; otherwise, the tribunal or High
Court could of course order the case to be
dismissed.</div><a name="0607073000365"></a>

Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply on
amendment No. 79. He made an important statement about the interest of
beneficiaries and the beneficial interest. I am tempted to quote an
earlier assertion of his back at him. He said that specific provisions
in the Bill reflecting the interests of beneficiaries might somehow
unbalance the legal processes or the workings of institutions such as
the commission and the tribunal, which we discussed today. If that is
the role of the Attorney-General in the Bill, and if the
Attorney-General will be minded to intervene on behalf of the
beneficial interest of charities, and not in other ways, then on
reflection I am content to withdraw my amendment, and to let the clause
survive.</div> <a name="0607073000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I

what can and cannot be presented to the tribunal, who can make the

The costs incurred in the course of the appointment of a receiver and
manager may sometimes hugely exceed those expected, even by the charity
commissioner, at the time of appointment.</div>
<a name="0607073000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are major issues at stake.
The Charity Commission is an extremely powerful body and it is right
that we should address in detail the decisions that it makes. Amendment
No. 81 covers the appointment
of</div><a name="0607073000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a receiver and manager
in respect of the property and affairs of the
charity&#148;,</div><a name="0607073000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is a
decision analogous to others set out in the schedule. The mention of
the</div><a name="0607073000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;continued appointment
of a receiver and
manager&#148;</div><a name="0607073000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">in amendment No.
82 carries no suggestion of drawing the tribunal into the matter of
administration, covering merely the whether the continued appointment
is appropriate. Evidence might be brought to bear from the consequences
of that continued appointment, and that is as it should be. That would
surely apply also to any of the other matters listed in the
schedule&#151;it is difficult to see how they could be discussed
without reference to their consequences.</div>
<a name="0607073000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give you notice that I shall
want to move amendment No. 82 when I may, Mr. Gale. The amendments
contain important detail and I hope that they avoid the legal
difficulties on the grounds of which the Minister objected to earlier
amendments.</div><a name="0607073000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000689"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I would like to support the amendments. Judging by
the information that I have been given, I do not think that there can
be a more serious decision affecting a charity than the appointment of
a receiver and what we now hope to call an interim
manager.</div><a name="0607073000399"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000690"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> To short-circuit the discussion, amendment No.
81 simply duplicates an existing provision in the Bill. It is rather
opaque, so I shall set it out for the Committee. It is on page 95,
column 1 and relates to an
order</div><a name="0607073000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;made by the
Commission under section 18(1) of this Act in relation to a
charity.&#148;</div><a name="0607073000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is precisely
about the appointment of a receiver-manager. I thought that I would
short-circuit what would no doubt have been an eloquent speech by the
hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="0607073000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000691"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am grateful, and I am sure the Committee is
equally grateful that it will be deprived of my eloquence on amendment
No. 81.</div><a name="0607073000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 82 the matter to consider is not only the appointment of a
receiver-manager but the decisions that follow it, if decisions they
be. I assume that the commission has a duty to take care of the assets
of charities, but in a case that has been brought to my attention the
continued appointment of an interim manager for the Cancer Care
Foundation led to expenditure of &#163;325,000 in about eight months
by PricewaterhouseCoopers and additional &#163;300,000 costs to the
charity&#146;s trading company. That is a considerable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 154</div>amount of money even to what appears to be a charity with a certain
amount of money in the bank. It had &#163;800,000 but was forced by
the decision of the Charity Commission to spend &#163;325,000 of
it.</div> <a name="0607073000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may well be
that there was a good case for the appointment of a receiver-manager,
but I am inclined to ask whether there is a process for deciding
whether there was a good case for the continuation of that appointment.
That is why I intend to support amendment No. 82. I also ask whether
there is a good case for better monitoring of the expenditure of the
receiver-manager at the charity&#146;s expense. If a charity has
&#163;800,000 in the bank and donors are bringing in &#163;50,000 a
month, as I believe they were for the benefit of the hospices supported
by the Cancer Care Foundation, one has to ask why that money was not
going out to the hospices supported by the Cancer Care Foundation, one
has to ask why that money was not going out to the hospices and whether
the donors were receiving good value for the &#163;325,000 that
PricewaterhouseCoopers billed the charity.</div>
<a name="0607073000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, there may be a good
case for the appointment and the continuation. However, the question is
whether the decision is legally right and whether the expenditure
should be undertaken without proper
review.</div><a name="0607073000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000692"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> Will the Minister make clear whether there is a
difference in law, or in the Bill, between references in column 2 to
&#147;trustees&#148; and the amendment&#146;s mention
of</div> <a name="0607073000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any person whose
powers or duties as a trustee are performed&#148;?</div>
<a name="0607073000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">For me, there is an ambiguity, which I am
sure is clear to experts, about whether column 2 refers to the
majority, all or two of the trustees, or whether a single trustee could
be counted as the
&#147;trustees&#148;.</div><a name="0607073000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000693"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Member for Worthing, West is keeping up
his fine record of asking difficult questions. I shall endeavour to
come back to him on that
point.</div><a name="0607073000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have already
dealt with why amendment No. 81 is unnecessary; I assure the Committee
that what it requires is already in the Bill, albeit rather implicitly.
On amendment No. 82, there is a distinction that is difficult to draw,
but it is nevertheless there. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight put it
well in talking about the decisions taken by the interim manager.
However, that is a question of the conduct of the charity.</div>
<a name="0607073000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would not suggest that the
charity tribunal intervene in the decisions made by the charity
trustees or persons acting in lieu of the charity
trustees&#151;namely, the interim manager. I do not think that the
hon. Member for Cheltenham would support the idea that the charity
tribunal should have jurisdiction over what the trustees do.</div>
<a name="0607073000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">The interim
manager is appointed in lieu of trustees. I appreciate that the
distinction between the original appointment of the interim manager,
which is a legal decision, and the question of conduct and decisions
made by the manager, may be hard to discern. However, there is a
distinction and it is right to hold to it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 155</div><a name="0607073000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Charity Commission has a duty
to conduct periodic reviews of receiver managers and what they are
doing, and&#151;this may offer last-minute reassurance to the hon.
Gentleman&#151;if, on review, the commission decides not to end a
receiver manager&#146;s appointment, that decision can be taken to
the charity tribunal. In other words, there is an appeal against the
Charity Commission&#146;s decision to continue with the interim
manager after a periodic review.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000694"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Could the Minister tell the Committee to whom the
receiver manager owes a
duty?</div><a name="0607073000414"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000695"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> As I understand it, the receiver manager is
acting on behalf of the beneficiaries of the
charity.</div><a name="0607073000415"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000696"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister has made a critically important
statement. The intention seems to be entirely in line with the
amendment and with many of the concerns that we have raised today. The
practice may not quite be there yet in that he talks about a periodic
review, but if I interpret correctly what he said it seems to be
entirely at the discretion of the commission, and it apparently has no
obligation to do it at a particular time. However, it seems to be
within the Minister&#146;s powers to make regulations or orders
directing the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 156</div>commission to conduct periodic reviews, or to amend the table in order
to have reviews at specific timetabled periods, or some other
mechanism. We seem to be nine tenths of the way to agreement.</div>
<a name="0607073000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister can assure me
that he will pursue that one last remaining issue of the timetable of
the periodic review, assure me that it is a genuine opportunity to
challenge the continued appointment of a receiver and manager, then I
would be very reassured indeed.</div>
<a name="0607073000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000697"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I must be careful. It is not for the Minister to
tell the commission how often the periodic review should be. However,
in the interest of harmony, I shall endeavour to return later and tell
the Committee how often the periodic reviews should happen, and the
basis of their determination. I hope therefore that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="0607073000418"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607073000698"></a>Martin
