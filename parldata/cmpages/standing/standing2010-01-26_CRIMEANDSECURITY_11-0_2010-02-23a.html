Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): Welcome back to the Chair,
Mr. Cook.</div>
<a name="10022365000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
adjourned for the February recess, the Committee was debating
provisions on gang injunctions. Clause 35 amends the Policing and Crime
Act 2009, which created gang injunctions for adults, so that the
references to powers of remand in schedule 5 to that Act relate only to
persons aged 18 or over. I seek clarification from the Minister. What
is the thought process regarding how children might be treated if they
breach one of the gang orders?</div>
<a name="10022365000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the intent behind the clause, but the question remains whether, if
there has been a breach of an injunction, a young person may need to be
taken into protective custody, to ensure that they do not become the
victim of reprisal or gang violence. Do the Government intend to rely
on other legislation on protective custody and referral to secure
accommodation, using child protection or child welfare provisions? If
an injunction has been breached by someone under the age of 18 and
there is a feeling of threat or risk to the community, and remand in
custody would have been deemed appropriate if that individual was aged
18 or over, how will the community be protected? The amendment to
schedule 5 to the 2009 Act does not appear to address that, so I seek
clarification on the thought process behind the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>clause, to understand more clearly how it is intended to operate to
protect both individuals and the community if an order is breached.
What regime might apply to children when, if they had been an adult,
remand might have been
appropriate?</div><a name="10022365000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000305"></a>The
Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr.
David Hanson):</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the clause
amends schedule 5 to the 2009 Act so that the court cannot remand 14 to
17-year-olds in custody. As the Committee knows, we have under
legislation allowed county courts to remand adults into custody, and
that power is familiar and is used. We have looked at how we deal with
14 to 17-year-olds. The usual process for dealing with injunctions and
breaches is relatively fast, generally taking place within 24 hours. I
hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman. Although I understand what he
says, in most cases the hearings will take place almost immediately, so
the risk is very limited. It is therefore not proportionate for the
court to have a power to remand, because we are trying to avoid
bringing young people into custody. Remanding into custody would mean
immediate custody. The breach can be examined by the court and the
circumstances considered. There could be an element of risk, but given
that the matter will normally be dealt within 24 hours, that would not
be the case. I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman, but if it does
not I will happily listen to his concerns again.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000306"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 168, in
clause 36, page 67, line 19, leave
out from &#145;must&#146; to end of line 20 and insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;receive a report from the relevant youth
offending team in respect of the person and take such report into
consideration.&#146;.</div><a name="10022365000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000307"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 169, in
clause 36, page 67, line 25, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;, and the court shall
state its reasons why it is so satisfied that a detention order is
necessary.&#146;.</div><a name="10022365000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000308"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause sets out the powers of the court
on breach of injunction by a person under the age of 18 in receipt of a
gang injunction. There are some detailed matters relating to the
general operation of the clause that we will discuss under clause stand
part, but amendments 168 and 169 are designed to make specific
provision for a report from the relevant youth offending team before
any court decision is made on a breach of an injunction. Amendment 169
would require the court to state the reasons why it believes that a
detention order is necessary, if that be the case based on the facts
and circumstances presented to the court.</div>
<a name="10022365000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
for the amendment is that there is a requirement to consult a youth
offending team under paragraph 4 of new schedule 5A to the Policing and
Crime Act 2009 and to consider any representations. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>seems possible to interpret the provisions of that paragraph in such a
way that there is no actual requirement to receive a report, which
would be the case if we were looking at a criminal case before the
youth court. The relevant youth service would provide a report in
relation to that young person, which would facilitate the
court&#146;s consideration of what sanction or order may be
appropriate, based on the facts and circumstances of an individual
case.</div>
<a name="10022365000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its
briefing notes on the Bill, the Standing Committee for Youth Justice
states:</div><a name="10022365000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that these Orders are in effect criminal sanctions and that
therefore the full protections of the youth justice sentencing process
should be applied. For example, there is no proposal that any form of
pre-sentence report should be provided before the court imposes one of
these Orders, nor a requirement that the judge should give reasons for
sentencing to custody as they would be required to do in criminal
court.&#148;</div>
<a name="10022365000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 36 inserts new
schedule 5A into the Policing and Crime Act 2009 with the intention of
mirroring provisions that might otherwise be available to a court under
normal criminal sanctions. That has been one of the problems with the
application of those types of injunction to young people: the relevant
flexibility, sanctions and provisions do not currently reside in the
civil court structure. The intention, therefore, is to import those
sorts of concepts via new schedule 5A, to facilitate an appropriate
disposal if an order is breached.</div>
<a name="10022365000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">There would
be a normal requirement for a court to use its powers appropriately and
to demonstrate compliance with a range of other measures, including the
European convention on human rights and the UN convention on the rights
of the child. The lack of a requirement on the court to state publicly
why it believes that a detention order is appropriate raises the
question how the court would be able to demonstrate its compliance with
the relevant provisions.</div>
<a name="10022365000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">A detention
order will require the secure estate to provide a separate regime for
those children&#151;one that is distinct from the regime applied to
children detained by the criminal courts. That is certainly the view of
the Standing Committee for Youth Justice. Has the Minister considered
that in the context of the use of the powers and court sanctions for
breach of an order? Does he agree that, if there is a court sanction
and the court is compelled to state publicly that a detention order is
appropriate, a separate regime would be needed for children subject to
sanctions under these civil orders? Or would young people sentenced to
a criminal order and those in breach of a civil order both go to youth
custody?</div>
<a name="10022365000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
interrelationship between the criminal and the civil systems is
technically difficult and raises a number of problems, which is why the
Government have taken their time in producing proposals on gang
injunctions relating to young people. Relevant approaches need to be
appropriately brought together to ensure there is no disconnect between
the criminal system and the civil system, as enhanced by provisions
imported in new schedule 5A.</div>
<a name="10022365000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
further limited points. Does rehabilitation need to be a factor in the
court&#146;s consideration of advice that it receives from the YOT
and its decision on whether detention is appropriate? That is why
the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>amendment states the court&#146;s need to comply with its obligations
in its consideration of why detention is necessary. In its briefing,
Justice states
that</div><a name="10022365000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;short-term
custody for children and young people of 14-17 inclusive normally
includes a rehabilitative element, ie it is a detention and training
order, not merely a detention order&#151;whereas these orders are
purely punitive (detention
alone).&#148;</div><a name="10022365000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is Justice&#146;s interpretation of provisions in new schedule 5A.
Whether a detention order, as phrased in new schedule 5A, is a
detention and training order or simply a detention order may be
relevant to the court&#146;s consideration of whether to make such an
order. We may get into debates about whether the intention is to punish
or protect. The European Court of Human Rights has sensitivities on the
nature of the orders and the fact that they need to be seen to be
preventive rather than punitive to comply with relevant
legislation.</div>
<a name="10022365000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
importing provisions and melding two separate systems together into
what might be characterised as a hybrid order in the context of the
gang injunctions. It is important to understand clearly the factors
that the court would need to consider and what it is required to state,
to ensure that the requirements of relevant human rights legislation
and convention obligations in relation to children are met. The
amendments are designed to probe the Minister on that point&#151;to
discover whether the matter has been considered but what the amendments
propose has been judged to be not necessary. Perhaps they would add
something to ensure that the orders&#151;in particular, the
provisions relating to breach&#151;properly reflect relevant
legislation. The orders will be open to challenge if the relevant
measures that might otherwise apply to a sanction given by a youth
court on a criminal matter are not appropriately
addressed.</div><a name="10022365000275"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000309"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman.
This provision relating to breach of an order would be the last resort,
as has been stated in all of our debates on the matter to date, both on
the Floor of the House and in Committee. We do not want a breach in the
first place, but, if there is one, detention should be the last resort.
If a breach occurs and a detention order of some sort is put in place,
the injunction will have failed in its purpose, which is to ensure that
individuals are not involved in and are removed from gangs. We have
regimes for that, so it needs to be made clear that the provision
relating to breach is the last resort and its use would signal a
failure.</div><a name="10022365000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some sympathy with the points made by the hon. Gentleman, which
are fair. We can look at how we can strengthen the provisions. The
judge is already required under the legislation to consider
representations made by the YOT, but that could be strengthened by a
written report. I have no problems with that; it is a sensible
suggestion. I am happy to look at that amendment, to test it and proof
it, and perhaps to return to it on Report, if the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw it
today.</div><a name="10022365000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
anticipate that a judge handing down a detention order will give his or
her reasons for doing so. However, as with the amendment on the YOT
report, I think that the principle of amendment 169 is helpful. It
could strengthen the provisions and may offer clarification. I have no
problems with that. I hope, however, that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw that amendment, too, so that we can test it using our great
powers of legal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>support, to ensure that it would not have unintended outcomes.
Nevertheless, it is helpful and I am happy to consider
it.</div><a name="10022365000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked fair and legitimate questions about whether there
will be a separate regime. We intend to discuss the type of regime with
the Youth Justice Board, which is responsible for establishments in
which an individual will be detained. We want to ensure that all the
board&#146;s experience is brought to bear on the regime, which will
be drawn up in accordance with the needs of the individual child or
young person, and of the types and groups of young people brought in. I
must emphasise that that work has not been done to the extent that the
hon. Gentleman might wish. The provisions are intended not to be
breached. We do not want to see people going into
detention.</div><a name="10022365000044"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000310"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I understand what the Minister says. If an
order is issued, one would hope that it will be effective and that an
individual will desist from following a particular path. However, we
have to contemplate orders being breached. If, ultimately, everything
has not worked out and detention is thought to be appropriate, will
there be a training element attached, as is the case with normal youth
custody? It would be a missed opportunity if the period of detention
were not used to address the behavioural or other problems that had led
to a
breach.</div><a name="10022365000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000311"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The detention for breach is entirely separate from
a detention for conviction for a general criminal offence, so the
regime would not be the same as that under normal youth justice. We
have not come to any conclusions about the type of regime, but we are
going to discuss it with the Youth Justice Board. I hope that there
will not be breaches. Part of the logic of the clauses, which the
Government have discussed internally, is that if we only had lesser
sanctions than the ultimate sanction of detention, there would probably
be further breaches. The fact that there is an ultimate sanction of
detention for breach means that an individual young person will know
that they face a serious consequence if they breach an injunction. We
have discussed the implications of that with the Department for
Children, Schools and Families and the Ministry of Justice, but we have
to have an ultimate sanction; otherwise, we water down the whole
purpose of the
injunction.</div><a name="10022365000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
all of the legislation is compliant with the European convention on
human rights and the United Nations convention on the rights of the
child. As ever, that could be tested in a court or by both parties, but
we believe that it is
compliant.</div><a name="10022365000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000312"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On decision, I am interested to note that the
Minister has had discussions with his colleagues in the DCSF and other
Departments. Is he prepared to consider giving young people in these
situations some quite specific support? If a young person who is in a
gang goes into some form of youth custody, their gang membership may be
hardened because of the other people who may be in that establishment.
There might need to be a separate regime to protect that young person
if the intention of the order is to prevent a pattern of behaviour that
has become ingrained through gang membership. Is that line of thinking
being developed?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div><a name="10022365000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000313"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> If we reach the stage where the young person is
detained, the whole thing has failed. If they are detained, we need to
make sure that when they are returned to the community, they do not go
back into a gang, and we do not want them to be involved in a gang in
any youth justice facility either. Regimes drawn up by the Youth
Justice Board to manage gangs in existing facilities are already in
place, because it is not uncommon for gangs to form in prison or for
members of rival gangs to find themselves in prison. Strategies are in
place to ensure that we manage that now and the system under the Bill
will be no
different.</div><a name="10022365000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether
there is an entirely separate regime has not yet been considered. The
Youth Justice Board will reflect on the matter, but how we manage
individuals if the new system fails and they end up in prison is
crucial if we are to succeed in turning their lives around. I hope that
that helps the hon. Gentleman. I will happily look at bringing back on
Report a revised version of his amendment&#151;or perhaps even the
same version&#151;to strengthen the provisions and to ensure that
those objectives are
met.</div><a name="10022365000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000314"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
constructive response to the amendments. I will not press them to a
vote. I hope that he will take legal advice and give the amendments
appropriate consideration in the light of the need for clarification to
mitigate any risk of challenge. I understand that that risk cannot be
completely avoided. I was interested to hear what he said about the
regime that might operate should detention prove necessary because all
other interventions have failed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10022365000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000315"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have a few more general points to make on
the clause and the interrelationship between the gang injunction
provisions and the ordinary use of the criminal law.</div>
<a name="10022365000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with
antisocial behaviour orders and other orders, there might be overlap
between the criminal law and the preventive order. If a gang injunction
is issued at the same time as some other form of criminal sanction is
imposed, how will the concurrent jurisdictions of the civil and
criminal courts work? We did not explore this potential conflict when
gang injunctions were introduced for adults. It is pertinent,
therefore, that we explore the impact of gang injunctions on young
people, particularly as the powers have yet to be tested and there is
no experience of their use in relation to adults, let alone in relation
to
children.</div><a name="10022365000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
would happen if an act constituted a breach of not only a young
person&#146;s gang injunction but of the criminal law? Which would
have primacy? Gang injunctions are intended to be dealt with by the
civil courts, but if an action breached the criminal law a case would
have to be proven before a criminal court. We understand what would
happen if a gang injunction were issued on a stand-alone basis, with no
extraneous criminal procedures, but if there were that
interrelationship between the civil and the criminal, how would the
process work? It would perhaps be easier to prove a breach of an
injunction on the balance of probabilities. Would that impede or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>assist a criminal case? We are talking about two different courts and
regimes: the civil and the criminal. Is it intended that the criminal
route would take
primacy?</div><a name="10022365000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has previously said that criminal prosecutions would be
preferred to the use of civil orders. Such factors would be tested in
the pilot operations that the Minister has, I think, already mentioned,
but, because of the range of new provisions that the Bill seeks to
import into civil proceedings, the role of the district judge might
also need to be considered. A district judge might not be familiar with
using such powers to deal with a breach. How does the Minister intend
to work with the judiciary, on further training on the powers, for
example?</div><a name="10022365000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is the potential for double jeopardy. Is there any perceived risk in
the same facts and circumstances being connected to both a criminal
sanction and a breach? Antisocial behaviour orders and some of the
other orders that the Government have introduced have been criminal
sanctions, breaches of which trigger a criminal offence. We now have a
civil breach and a criminal sanction sitting alongside each other, and
they cannot be dealt with by the same court at the same time, although
magistrates might be given a dual mandate. In essence, the approach is
modelled on the traditional contempt of court approach in the civil
courts.</div><a name="10022365000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
additional factor is that a breach of a civil order&#151;a gang
injunction&#151;would appear to be not a criminal breach but a civil
one. How does the Minister contemplate the information being recorded?
Would it be flagged up on the police national computer, for example?
How might the interrelationship between the civil and the criminal
work, and what disclosure might be necessary in relation to, for
example, Criminal Records Bureau checks? This is a complex area of law,
melding concepts from the criminal law into the civil system. My
comments are intended to check and to understand better how the
Government intend the new approach, which is a new view on how
quasi-criminal sanctions can be used in a more purely civil setting, to
operate. Therefore, it would be helpful to hear how the Minister
expects the interrelationship between the two regimes to operate in
practice.</div><a name="10022365000276"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000316"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes valid points and it is
reasonable to test them in Committee. Self-evidently, if there were
civil and criminal proceedings against an individual, both courts would
know what was happening. That would be normal practice. It is not
unusual, and it happens now. Whatever the system might be, it would
ensure that both courts knew that an individual was before
them.</div>
<a name="10022365000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman gave an example of a concurrent breach of an order and a
criminal offence. We would expect the breach to be dealt with
relatively speedily and that the criminal offence would be understood
at the time of the breach and would be taken into account by the
judiciary accordingly. The activity on the breach would probably be
dealt with quicker than the criminal offence, and when the criminal
offence was dealt with that breach would be taken into
account.</div>
<a name="10022365000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I might be
missing the challenge, but I do not think there is a problem with the
two systems working side by side. We need to ensure that we give
guidance to the judiciary. We need to ensure that in both civil and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>criminal courts individuals are aware of the Bill&#146;s provisions.
As the hon. Gentleman is aware, a pilot will operate in a relatively
small number of areas initially. If problems are identified, we can
rectify them in due
course.</div><a name="10022365000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000317"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister says about the
desire to deal with breaches of the orders speedily. He will appreciate
that the criminal courts might deal with separate breaches of the
criminal law for which concurrent, rather than consecutive, sentences
may be handed down. Let us suppose that a multiple breach of the civil
order is considered first and detention is thought to be appropriate
because of the seriousness and, sadly, the nature of what occurred? The
court dealing thereafter with the criminal offence might also wish to
impose some form of detention. Would there be some linkage? If both
matters are being considered by the same court, a judge may give a
sentence of a year for each offence, to be served concurrently, but
that concurrence is not available to the criminal court at that latter
stage.</div>
<a name="10022365000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000318"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> We are in danger of micro-managing the outcomes of
the judicial system. I say that with the utmost respect to the hon.
Gentleman. We are giving legal powers to impose a gang injunction.
Breaches under the gang injunction could lead to detention if they are
sufficiently repetitive or serious. A range of other matters could be
considered in parallel by different courts or by the same court. I
cannot determine the outcome today. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s valid
points may need to be reflected upon, but I cannot give him the
definite answers that he seeks based on a range of potential
circumstances.</div>
<a name="10022365000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Offences
would not be recorded on the police national computer as matter of
course, although individual forces may record them for enforcement
purposes. An offence would not automatically be uncovered by a CRB
check, but it might come to light in an enhanced CRB check, depending
on the nature of the breach and the comments of magistrates or judges
who dealt with it. Breach hearings could be postponed. All sorts of
things could happen. Perhaps this is the place to test the consequences
of the activities of a particular judge, but I cannot clarify those
issues to the extent that the hon. Gentleman wishes. I hope he will
ultimately accept the clause as
proposed.</div><a name="10022365000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000319"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I shall speak on the requirement for family
circumstances to be taken into account before making an ASBO. We
recognise the sense of the provision, given inter-generational
deprivation and sometimes the abuse of children in the home. While not
justified or condoned, behavioural issues may arise when a young person
is in a very disjointed and unstructured family setting. It is
interesting to note the comments of Joyce Moseley, chief executive of
Catch22, the young people&#146;s charity, on these provisions. She
said:</div>
<a name="10022365000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
our experience, parents do want help when it comes to improving their
children&#146;s behaviour. If there is now to be a process of
mandatory assessment of parenting needs, then these 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div>assessments must be followed up with targeted support to help parents
develop the skills necessary to make a real difference to their
children&#146;s behaviour.&#148;</div>
<a name="10022365000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That fastens on an
important point about the requirement to report on family
circumstances. Is it a report to aid the court when granting an ASBO
and the conditions to be attached to it? That may be relevant in
determining what is appropriate in making of one of these orders. Is it
intended, through parenting orders or some other means, to provide
preventive support, to try to break a pattern of behaviour that has
triggered the interest of the court and other agencies?</div>
<a name="10022365000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Catch22 has
said it would like the following included in parenting assessments:
housing situation, financial situation and debt, family breakdown,
conflict and bereavement, worklessness and/or long working hours
leaving insufficient care of children, mental health in the family, and
drug and/or alcohol dependency in the family. I would not like to see a
list set out in the Bill, but clause 37 recognises that the Secretary
of State would issue regulations in respect of the provisions. The
helpful suggestions made by Catch22 would be relevant when considering
subsequent regulations.</div>
<a name="10022365000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
look at earlier intervention for young people who may be displaying
delinquency or behavioural issues. Whole family approaches and
interventions are relevant for examining the causal factors behind a
young person&#146;s behaviour. Therefore, it is sensible to have the
formal requirement of a report when considering an ASBO. The question
is what happens then and what further interventions may be provided to
assist that young person and the family situation. As we have said in
debate on other injunctions, the hope is to prevent breaches from
taking place. The purpose of an order should not be, as some may see
it, to criminalise a young person and get them before the courts in a
different way. It needs to be preventive to be effective, to stop
offending and provide relief for families and communities. We will come
to that in relation to ASBOs in a broader sense in the next
clause.</div>
<a name="10022365000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful to understand how the Under-Secretary sees clause 37 operating
in practice. There is sense in it, but the question is how it will be
applied. Does he see it as a mechanism for facilitating wider
interventions, or would it simply be limited to informing the court
when it makes decisions on granting an ASBO and the conditions attached
to
it?</div><a name="10022365000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000320"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Alan Campbell):</b> It is, as ever, a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook.</div>
<a name="10022365000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the hon. Member for Hornchurch for his helpful comments. I also pay
tribute to the work of Joyce Moseley and Catch22; we should listen
carefully to her wise
words.</div><a name="10022365000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
37 requires agencies considering applying for an ASBO against a 10 to
15-year-old to prepare a report on his or her family circumstances for
the court. The purpose of that, to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question, is for the court to be fully apprised of the young
person&#146;s background before making a decision on whether to grant
an ASBO. Moreover and crucially&#151;this  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>is linked to our future deliberations&#151;the court must also
consider whether to grant a parenting order alongside the ASBO. The
report will help in reaching that
decision.</div><a name="10022365000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman talked about the reasons why young people might behave
in an antisocial way. It is suggested that it is often the result of a
chaotic home life. The reality is that some parents want support for
their children, but do not know how to ask for it or are not sure what
is available. The assessment would, therefore, inform the agencies
dealing with the young person and the family of the problems, and
enable the agencies to find the means of addressing them. If we did not
have the clause&#151;if we did not take this further step, and there
was no legislative aspect&#151;it could not be guaranteed that
practitioners would obtain information about family circumstances, and
the situation would not further improve. They might miss important
information about a young person&#146;s home circumstances when they
decide to issue an ASBO. That is why we are introducing the
provisions.</div><a name="10022365000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman rightly points out that it is important that we
intervene at an early stage to nip in the bud antisocial behaviour. If
it escalates, it is a problem not only for the individual and the
family, but for the wider community. An assessment is a vital part of
the process. I strongly believe that we should be challenging parents
to do more to prevent their children from getting involved in
antisocial behaviour and offending. The reality, however, is that we
need to support them to do more. There is evidence that when that
happens, it often has a positive effect. The difference between the
current situation and what we are suggesting is that agencies would
require it to happen. We would, therefore, catch the minority of
individuals who currently may fall outside the system.</div>
<a name="10022365000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
broad support of Catch22, as well as that of the Magistrates
Association. A broad range of antisocial behaviour practitioners

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000321"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We come to the question of mandatory
parenting orders on breach of an ASBO. As has been highlighted in
preceding debates, the issue of antisocial behaviour is pertinent.
According to the National Audit Office, the cost to Government agencies
of responding to reports of antisocial behaviour in England and Wales
is approximately &#163;3.5 billion a year. In 2008-09, 3.7
million incidents of antisocial behaviour were recorded by the police
in England and Wales, equivalent to more than 10,000 every day. On
average, 70 per cent. of the population perceive high levels of
antisocial behaviour in their area, with the young and the less
well-off being disproportionately affected, so I understand why the
Government are proposing the measures. The question is whether they
will be effective and what difference they will make should they be
brought into effect.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div><a name="10022365000277"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="10022365000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
of us in the Committee are acutely aware of the impact antisocial
behaviour can have on communities, families and individuals. It was
brought into focus by the terrible case of Fiona Pilkington, a mother
who killed herself and her daughter Francesca because of intimidation
and the pressures of antisocial behaviour, feeling that there was no
response in the community to deal with it appropriately. It is
disturbing to hear the reports from the inquest into their deaths. The
family suffered 10 years of bullying and intimidation from a gang of
teenagers who congregated outside their home in Leicestershire and
hurled missiles, shouted verbal abuse and committed other unspeakable
acts.</div>
<a name="10022365000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
the case raises is how that was allowed to happen. I appreciate that
the case goes wider than the clause, which deals with mandatory
parenting orders, but it provides a context for trying to break
patterns of offending. Will imposing mandatory parenting orders on the
breach of an ASBO, as contemplated in the clause, be effective
considering the nature of ASBOs? Is it simply too late in the day to
change patterns of behaviour at that stage?</div>
<a name="10022365000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
questions about the effectiveness of ASBOs as a means of preventing
antisocial behaviour, as the Under-Secretary is aware, given that we
have previously debated the level of breaches. Between June 2000 and
December 2007, 54 per cent. of ASBOs were breached. The breach rate for
10 to 17-year-olds is even higher&#151;around 64 per cent. Research
by the Library indicates that on average each ASBO in England and Wales
has been breached 4.1 times. Nearly three quarters of breached ASBOs
have been breached more than once, with the overall breach rate of
ASBOs by juveniles running at 64 per cent., as I
said.</div><a name="10022365000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are proposing a mechanism to try to involve parents in a
mandatory format at the latter stage, once an ASBO has been breached.
Despite questions about the effectiveness of ASBOs, it is interesting
to hear Ministers claim that the proposals would help to prevent young
people from being sucked into a life of crime. However, the number of
parenting orders each year under the proposals could, in fact, be just
a handful. Figures in the regulatory impact assessment of the Bill
published by the Home Office show that because ASBOs have fallen out of
favour and fewer and fewer are being issued, there were just 126
breaches of ASBOs by 10 to 15-year-olds in 2007&#151;the latest year
for which figures are available.</div>
<a name="10022365000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
seem, therefore, that the mandatory parenting orders that would be
covered by the provision will be very few and far between, particularly
considering that discounts would need to be applied for multiple
breaches. Some of the 126 breaches of ASBOs are likely to be multiple
breaches, so that will reduce the number even further. Presumably,
further discounts would need to be applied to take account of young
people in local authority care and the fact that the courts have the
right not to issue a parenting order in exceptional circumstances. It
is perhaps hardly surprising, therefore, that the RIA acknowledges that
the number of cases when a mandatory order, as set out in clause 38,
would apply is &#147;small&#148;. Even then, the effectiveness of
the measure in changing behaviour is questionable, given that patterns
of behaviour will have been well established if a young person has
received an ASBO and has then breached it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div><a name="10022365000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
also knows that parenting orders are available on the initial grant of
an ASBO, under provisions in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. In
deciding whether a parenting order on the issuance of an ASBO is
appropriate, the court has to take account of various grounds of
suitability, and some guidance is provided by the Youth Justice Board
in its briefing note on parenting contracts and
orders:</div><a name="10022365000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
suitability of a parent or guardian for a parenting order is normally
determined by an assessment process carried out by a practitioner from
a YOT. If the assessments provide evidence that parents could be
supported to positively influence their child&#146;s behaviour and
the parents are not willing to engage with support voluntarily it will
usually be appropriate to recommend a parenting order to the court. The
recommendation should take into consideration the potential needs of
both the parents or guardians and the child and the likely
effectiveness in terms of changing their
behaviour.&#148;</div><a name="10022365000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is a requirement on the issuance of an antisocial behaviour order
to consider suitability for a parenting order at that point, and the
youth offending team deems the parents not &#147;suitable&#148;,
who will be left in relation to the mandatory requirement that will be
triggered on the breach? The court will have already considered on the
grant of the order whether a parent is suitable and whether a parenting
order is likely to be effective. If the order is then breached, will
the case fall into the exceptional circumstances category? How will
that operate? How many parents will be caught by the provision if the
youth offending team has already determined that a parent is
unsuitable? If the team determines that the parent is unsuitable at the
time the ASBO is granted, what changes between the granting of the ASBO
and its breaching? I genuinely struggle to see how the provision adds
effectiveness if there is already a process for assessing the
effectiveness of a parenting
order.</div><a name="10022365000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also worth looking at the profile of young people who breach their
ASBOs. A December 2004 study by the Youth Justice Board identified the
majority of young people entering custody as a result of breaching an
ASBO as prolific offenders, with 43 young people who received custody
for such a breach having a total of 1,779 offences between them. One of
the problems in youth offending at the moment is prolific offenders.
Would a mandatory parenting order be effective for the category of
young people who breach their
ASBOs?</div><a name="10022365000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
only has to look at the appalling case of James Moore. He received an
ASBO and multiple control and supervision orders, which he breached,
yet little seemed to be done about it. Sadly, he went on to kill
16-year-old army cadet Joseph Lappin by stabbing him through the heart
with a 4-inch blade, at a youth club in Everton, Liverpool. That
appalling case is instructive, and perhaps puts into context the likely
effectiveness of the orders, which will also have been considered
earlier in the process. Moore had breached his ASBO 10 times, there had
been 41 individual complaints against him, and he had also breached
further referral orders several times. It comes down to what should
happen on the breach of an ASBO.</div>
<a name="10022365000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,
there appear to be no meaningful consequences for multiple breaches. At
the Labour party conference last October, when the Prime Minister
trailed the orders contained in the Bill and in particular in clause
37, he said
that</div><a name="10022365000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
have said that every time a young person breaches an ASBO, there will
be an order, not just on them but on their parents, and if that is
broken they will pay the price.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div><a name="10022365000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">What does the Minister
understand by &#147;paying the price&#148;? We are talking about
the breach of an ASBO triggering a mandatory parenting order. Is that
the price the Prime Minister was
contemplating?</div><a name="10022365000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister expand on what the regulatory impact assessment says about
the sanctions for a breach of an ASBO? The RIA says that they range
from a fine or community order to up to two years in youth custody,
although in practice that will be reserved only for the most serious
and exceptional circumstances. I entirely understand the desire not to
put young people in custody too hastily, but what are regarded as the
most serious and exceptional cases? Something appears to be going wrong
if a breach of an order on multiple occasions does not appear to
trigger a meaningful sanction that protects the community and gets the
young person to change their
behaviour.</div><a name="10022365000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also the question of the relevance the order would have for children
already in local authority care. The sad reality is that a
disproportionately high number of young offenders come from the care
system. More than a quarter of young men and nearly half of young women
in juvenile prisons have spent time in care. Those who have experienced
a sustained period in care are more than twice as likely to offend as
other young people. Does the Minister feel that the measure would add
anything? Would it place further responsibilities on local authorities
that might be failing in their support for young people who have been
issued with an ASBO and then go on to breach it? My reading is that a
mandatory parenting order does not apply to a local authority or to
that sort of arrangement, so another category of young people breaching
their ASBOs would fall outside the provisions of the
clause.</div><a name="10022365000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parenting
orders are already available on the issuance of an ASBO. Why did the
Minister not consider making it mandatory for a parent whose child has
received an ASBO to be given a parenting order at that stage? That
might allow earlier intervention. If an ASBO has been granted,
something quite serious has occurred, so why was it decided to make the
mandatory parenting order requirement sit at the time of the breach,
rather than when the ASBO was issued? It is interesting to note that,
according to the RIA, take-up of parenting orders on the granting of an
ASBO is very low, for a variety of reasons: up to 2007, only 128
compulsory parenting orders were made. Can the Minister explain why
that was? It is germane to our understanding of the number of orders
that would be granted in relation to a breach of an ASBO.</div>
<a name="10022365000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">It appears
that mandatory parenting orders will not be a mainstream response. On
what evidence that parenting orders will be effective at such a late
stage in a developed pattern of delinquent behaviour does the Minister
rely? Of the Youth Justice Board&#146;s budget of &#163;97 million
from 2008-11, how much has been spent or is committed to be spent on
each parenting order? The RIA gives a figure of about &#163;2,000,
but are the orders intended to come out of that same budget? I assume
that they are, given the wording in the
RIA.</div>
<a name="10022365000278"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="10022365000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
much does the Minister expect to be spent on mandatory parenting orders
each year? We assume that it will be a fairly low figure, given that
only a few will be handed out, but how many does he expect to be
issued? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>What has been the experience of the operation of section 9 of the Crime
and Disorder Act 1998 with regard to the court stating the reason for
not issuing a parenting order? That applies when a young person has
committed an offence; there is a separate regime for the granting of a
parenting order in those circumstances as well.</div>
<a name="10022365000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">ASBOs are
sometimes issued contemporaneously with a criminal order, and a
criminal breach sanction may be handed down as well. What are the
parallels? What will the relationship be between the clause&#146;s
provisions and section 9? It is highly likely that there will be
circumstances in which an ASBO is breached and section 9 would apply,
because there will have been a criminal sanction. Which regime would
apply? I assume that it would be the sanction for breach of an
ASBO.</div><a name="10022365000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is strange that subsection (2) suggests that a breach of an ASBO is
regarded as more serious than a criminal offence. It requires a
mandatory parenting order on the breach of an ASBO, but not when there
has been a breach of the law. Is my analysis right? What thinking has
gone into making the mandatory requirement sit on the breach of an ASBO
rather than also applying it to a criminal breach that would trigger a
section 9
provision?</div><a name="10022365000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am trying to understand how the provision will make a significant
difference to dealing with the problem of antisocial behaviour, which
has a material impact on the lives of so many people in our
constituencies up and down the country. Various claims have been made
that the provision will make a difference, but I am left with the
impression, from the evidence provided to date, that it will apply only
in a small handful of cases. The provision will, therefore, have a
limited effect at best, rather than being a positive step forward in
dealing with the broad spread of antisocial behaviour relating to young
people. That needs to be significantly addressed, because of the
problems to which I have
alluded.</div><a name="10022365000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000322"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight
concerns that still exist in some areas about antisocial behaviour. It
is his job to do that, but he seems to gloss over the progress that has
been made in many areas, not least due to the work of local agencies,
the police and the many brave residents who make a stand against
antisocial behaviour in their area. The latest British crime survey
shows that figures relating to perceptions of antisocial behaviour
being a major problem in some areas are still too high, but they are
coming down. We are working hard, particularly with the worst affected
areas where perceptions are still too high. That is why we need to
ensure not only that partners have legislative powers, but that they
are using them and that the powers are
effective.</div><a name="10022365000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will outline the thinking behind the proposals, and I hope that will
address the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns. He talked about breaking
persistent offending and the behaviour that underpins it. Our
contention is that parents have a crucial role to play. Many parents
engage in the process and have a beneficial effect, but the reality is
that not every parent is held to
account.</div><a name="10022365000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out that, in many cases, young people
who get ASBOs breach them. He was also right to reflect on the fact
that ASBOs seem to be synonymous with young people and antisocial
behaviour when, in fact, around half of those that are issued do not go
to young people, but to older people. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div>do not defend breaches of ASBOs, and I certainly do not defend the
indefensible in some of the cases that he highlighted. There is,
however, an underlying point, namely that ASBOs are part of a process.
Nobody has ever said that they are the be-all and end-all, or that they
should necessarily be the first intervention. They are part of a
process. Breaching an ASBO says more about the people who breach them
than about the ASBOs themselves. It is important that there is an
escalatory approach and, if a breach does occur, that the people
involved in the process, including the courts, hold the individual, and
if necessary, the parents, to
account.</div><a name="10022365000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
cite very often&#151;because it is true&#151;an authoritative
report from the NAO about the use of antisocial behaviour powers. On
the first intervention, around two thirds of individuals change their
behaviour and by the third intervention, 93 per cent. have changed.
From that, we can work out that 7 per cent. do not change. We have to
ensure that every power and influence we have is brought to bear, and
that includes holding parents to account.</div>
<a name="10022365000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will set
out briefly the current situation and what clause 38 would do. The
clause would require the court to make a parenting order when a 10 to
15-year-old breaches an ASBO. It is already a requirement that the
court must consider making a parenting order when placing an ASBO on a
young person. The requirement ensures that the presumption is that a
parenting order would be in the interests of preventing further
antisocial acts by the young person. Therefore, the big difference for
the hon. Gentleman is that we want to move from may to must, to make
sure that parents are involved, although many of them already are. They
can play a vital role in preventing their children from offending or
reoffending.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000323"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister says but the key
point is the time when the mandatory requirement takes place. He is
right to say that parents need to be involved in the actions of their
children, and to be held to account. The question is why that occurs or
is mandated only upon breach, rather than on the grant of the ASBO or
the committing of a criminal
offence.</div><a name="10022365000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000324"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I was about to come to that point. I return to a
phrase I have already used today&#151;our determination to support
parents but also to challenge them to accept their full
responsibilities. Parents often seek help and we will seek to provide
it. However, some are unwilling or unable to do so. The hon. Gentleman
talks about the point at which we seek to intervene, as if there were
no intervention at earlier stages. I would like to think that there is
involvement of parents at the earliest stages. I have been out in my
constituency with local police and my local authority on a scheme
called Child Safe, which entails going around, particularly on Friday
and Saturday nights during term-time, taking alcohol off young people
and then taking them home. From seeing the reaction of some parents, I
know that intervention is sufficient to prevent their children from
getting involved not only with alcohol but with the antisocial
behaviour that sometimes follows. The approach does not always work
with all the young people who are picked up, so there is a need to
escalate to the point when it becomes mandatory for the parents to be
held to account.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div><a name="10022365000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to see
the proposals as a process in which people are held to account
throughout. When they are not willing to be involved voluntarily, we
should mandate them. That is where the provision comes in. The hon.
Gentleman talks about engaging parents and changing behaviour. I would
go so far as to say&#151;though I have no evidence to back it
up&#151;that the cases when parents do not get involved may be those
relating to the worst and most persistent offenders. The chaos of the
household that leads the child to antisocial behaviour may also be
reflected in the unwillingness of the parents to engage in the process
or show much interest in what their children are doing. I cannot point
to the evidence, but that is my gut
reaction.</div>
<a name="10022365000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000325"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I respect everything the Minister says. My
concern, as I have previously indicated, is that very few parenting
orders under the existing arrangements appear to be issued in relation
to the grant of an ASBO. It would be helpful to understand what factors
lead to that, because it may affect the operation of the clause.
Equally, it would be helpful to understand how many parenting orders a
year the Minister expects to fall within the ambit of the
clause.</div>
<a name="10022365000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000326"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman pre-empts my comments.
The nub of the issue is who will be caught by the provisions, without
which there would be no legal consequence for parents of children aged
10 to 15 who breached an ASBO. Under the status quo, antisocial
behaviour practitioners would continue to rely on the current system
for making the parents of young people with ASBOs take responsibility
for their children&#146;s behaviour. That is entirely voluntary.
Shifting from that voluntary system to our present proposals is the
important
step.</div><a name="10022365000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have mentioned, it is not a matter of involving parents at a late
stage, as the hon. Gentleman said. The Youth Justice Board advises us
that about 85 per cent. of parents are willing to engage with the
authorities, but there is little leverage to compel unwilling parents
to co-operate. That is the point, I think, behind the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question. It is about making that minority get
involved in the process, because, as the law stands, that cannot be
done. The provisions are about bringing them into the system and
holding them to account.</div>
<a name="10022365000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000327"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister probably knows that section 9 of
the Crime and Disorder Act 1998
states:</div><a name="10022365000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
a person under the age of 16 is convicted of an offence, the court by
or before which he is so convicted...if it is satisfied that the
relevant condition is fulfilled, shall make a parenting order;
and...if it is not so satisfied, shall state in open court that it
is not and why it is
not.&#148;</div><a name="10022365000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore
it appears that there is compulsion and an ability to make parenting
orders. The breach of an ASBO is effectively a criminal offence, so the
section 9 regime would operate. The Minister is obviously highlighting
deficiencies in the operation of section 9, which it appears already
provides a mechanism to impose a parenting order if that is thought
appropriate.</div><a name="10022365000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000328"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am saying that we want to ensure that we have
a comprehensive system in which the issue is taken up and in which it
is not the case that individual 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>cases are looked at in isolation and the mandatory element is not taken
up by the court. My understanding is that section 9 will not apply to
criminal breaches of ASBOs and that new section 8A will. We are thus
seeking to change the situation.</div>
<a name="10022365000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
hon. Gentleman is reading into that the idea that we are not content
that the current system is clear enough or, most important, that it is
used sufficiently, and that is what is behind the provisions. We want
to ensure that parents are involved at an early stage and bring a
positive influence to procedures, and we accept that in the vast
majority of cases they are involved in that way. We hope that is one
reason why young people change their behaviour.</div>
<a name="10022365000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
accept that in a small minority of cases&#151;about 15 per cent.,
according to the Youth Justice Board&#151;parents do not willingly
get involved, and we want to ensure that the system catches them. It is
a matter of giving leverage with respect to the most difficult parents,
to ensure that they accept their
responsibilities.</div>
<a name="10022365000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000329"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I note everything that the Minister says, but
he has not responded to the specific question about how many parenting
orders he would expect to be issued per year. Would it be five, 10 or
20? Can he give any suggestion, so that we can assess the likely
effectiveness of the clause?</div>
<a name="10022365000279"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="10022365000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000330"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> That follows from the remarks I have just made:
the provisions are designed to hold to account the minority of parents
who are not engaged in the process. We are not talking about hundreds
of instances, but about the worst cases in which breaches occur. Many
ASBOs are effective and are never breached. Many parents get involved
in the process, but we are concerned about a minority of cases. I
cannot give the hon. Gentleman a definitive answer. I shall try to find
a closer answer.</div>
<a name="10022365000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about relatively few cases, because we do not see the problem
as a wide one. It is about engaging the minority of parents who, as the
law stands, do not engage voluntarily where the law is not strong
enough to ensure that that is what they must do. The provision is about
providing the tools to ensure that parents who require support to
manage their children&#146;s behaviour, or who refuse to engage with
authority, get the help they need. Implicit in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s comments is the question whether there are resources
to ensure that that happens. The resources are there at a local level
through family intervention projects and the many ways in which
engagement can already take place, and we expect them to be widely
used.</div>
<a name="10022365000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
hon. Gentleman asked about local authorities where children are in
care. Many such children are the most complex and often tragic cases,
which is why they are with the local authority in the first place. We
expect that local authorities acting as the parent or guardian would
not only accept that responsibility and engage, but would bring all
their resources and expertise to try to change the behaviour of
children. They may have more influence and resources than some parents
have&#151;or at least believe they have&#151;to come to terms with
the behaviour of the child involved.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div><a name="10022365000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
with those comments the hon. Gentleman understands the
Government&#146;s position. We seek to ensure that parents are
engaged and to move beyond just allowing them to be brought into the
system, to actually ensuring that they are in the system, because at
the end of the day they have a crucial and positive role to play. That
is good for their children and good for the wider community. I commend
the clause.</div>

<a name="10022365000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 88
seeks to prevent the Secretary of State from adding to the range of
categories covered by the licence things that the Secretary of State
might deem to be appropriate to be included by order. I can see the
advantage for Government in doing that, because they want to be able,
from time to time, to extend the range of activities. Broadly speaking,
I am against that. I do not like giving delegated powers to the

know perfectly well that parliamentary control over secondary

checked but I do not know. No doubt the Minister knows off-hand.
Whether it is or it is not, if it is negative it will never be debated;
if it is affirmative it is not amendable. It is objectionable on both
counts, so I am against it and I hope that the Committee is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000337"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> That is one thing, but the extent of those
powers needs clarification; &#147;such other activities&#148; needs
to be clarified. I probe that matter in the hope that the Minister will
clarify it, and we can clearly see exactly the other actions upon which
he&#151;or perhaps she at a later date&#151;would want to act.
Without such clarification, it is difficult to know whether we can
support the clause. I thank my right hon. and learned Friend for
tabling the amendments, and I await the Minister&#146;s
clarification.</div><a name="10022365000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000338"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b><b class="B"> </b>Clause 39 provides for the regulation of
vehicle immobilisation businesses by the Security Industry Authority
and, via new section 4A(2)(c), for business licensing to be extended to
other licensable sectors by means of separate designation by the
Secretary of State. The right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham and I have served together on a number of Committees, and
he is entirely consistent in his opposition to the approach and to its
underlying principles. I doubt whether I will assuage his long-held
view.</div><a name="10022365000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
confirm that the affirmative rather than the negative procedure will be
used. We have no plans to introduce business licensing to other sectors
of the private security industry, but we consider it sensible to leave
open that possibility. Failings in another sector of the private
security industry might mean that regulation is needed at business
level in the same way as has been identified in the vehicle
immobilisation sector, so we do not want to rule that out. However, as
the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, if we went about the matter
in another way and were seeking to take action on that, it would
require primary legislation, which it is not always possible to
access.</div>
<a name="10022365000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is useful
that the Bill is on the stocks, and we have deliberately moved vehicle
immobilisation into it, not least because it is a big problem in many
of our constituencies. Primary legislation might not always be
available if we wished to move
further.</div><a name="10022365000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also possible that regulation at business level could become the
most appropriate way to regulate a sector or sectors of a particular
industry, rather than regulation at individual level. We simply do not
want to rule out that possibility, or miss the opportunity should we
have it. I shall give the right hon. and learned Gentleman an example,
which I think has already been acknowledged. We are considering the
activities of bailiffs. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will
probably know from his postbag that some of their practices are almost
as despicable, if not as despicable, as those of some of the
wheel-clamping companies. Were we seeking to move on that
behaviour&#151;for which I think we would have public
support&#151;we would want to be able to do so at the first
opportunity. That is why, despite the right hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s opposition to the underlying principle, we support
having the power available to the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="10022365000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000339"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> May I respond, Mr. Cook? I understand why
Governments do this; they always do it. We did it when we were in
office, and will doubtless do it when we get into office again. I would
be much happier with the affirmative procedure if the time for debate
were longer&#151;it is usually 90 minutes&#151;and if the motion
were amendable. If motions were amendable, I would not have a great 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>deal of complaint about the affirmative procedure, but they are not and
that is why I constantly complain. I agree that there are advantages in
using a statutory instrument rather than primary
legislation&#151;that speaks for itself&#151;but it is the absence
of amendability that I find so
offensive.</div><a name="10022365000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not press the amendment to a vote, because I do not believe that
I have the support of big battalions on it, but this is an opportunity
once again to complain and to say that the secondary process would be a
lot more acceptable if motions were amendable.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000342"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Amendment 171 is technical and probing. I
wish to better understand the ambit of the clause. The insertion of new
section 4A in the Private Security Industry Act 2001 provides for the
licensing of businesses. As I understand it, employees fall outwith
subsection (4). My reading is that a licensed business is a licensable
activity and that employees of that business should not have to go
through the same arrangements as a business and provide registration.
They do, however, have to meet requirements in relation to their
individual
activities.</div><a name="10022365000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seek clarification of the relationship between the rights of employees
and those of agents. It is possible that someone may not be an
employee&#151;they may be self-employed&#151;but may be engaged by
a business as an agent. The regulated business may rely upon an agency
and its activities may be carried out by that individual. This probing
amendment seeks to understand how agency and self-employed contractors
providing services on behalf of a business are captured by new section
4A.</div><a name="10022365000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that if one has a licensable business, the provision is not
intended to capture employees. Employees conducting activities must
have the appropriate Security Industry Authority licence, so the
provision is trying to avoid duplication. An agent, however, is not an
employee in strict legal terminology; in other words, an agent is not
employed and may have a contract for services rather than for
employment. However, they act in the capacity of an employee, albeit
through a separate contractual arrangement, and fall outwith the
definition of subsection (4). Is that the intention? Might the concept
of agency need to be considered further in relation to self-employed
persons employed by a regulated business? They would not have to
register as a business in their own right if they were covered by
regulations. Is there a risk of duplication? Will the Minister reflect
upon the
matter?</div><a name="10022365000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10022365000343"></a><b class="B">Tony

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000344"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> That is a rather disparaging way of
putting
it.</div><a name="10022365000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000345"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> With great (c)lan, I hasten to add.</div>
<a name="10022365000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether we can establish the casus belli of the issue. It would be
helpful to
recap.</div><a name="10022365000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Aeons
ago, it seems, when the Committee took evidence&#151;Bill Committees
now do so as though we were Select Committees&#151;the president of
the AA gave evidence. I cannot recall whether you chaired that session,
Mr. Cook, or whether it was Sir Nicholas. I asked Edmund
King what the AA would like to see in the Bill. Lo and behold, no
sooner had he given his shopping list than the Minister, like
Cinderella at Christmas, produced a list that I think it would be fair
to say&#151;I do not know other colleagues&#146;
position&#151;met most, if not all, the points of concern raised by
the AA and others among us about wheel-clamping and the public mischief
caused by it
hitherto.</div><a name="10022365000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="10022365000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the back of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch, one question is still outstanding about how such companies
might be controlled, although it might just be my misunderstanding. I
think the Government have dealt with wheel-clamping per se, but what is
their position on people who place what look like parking tickets or
demands for fines on vehicles? They are effectively obtaining pecuniary
advantage by deception, as they are giving the impression that the
ticket is a statutory demand when it is not.</div>
<a name="10022365000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the AA
and others gave evidence, they said that practice would still be a
public curse, because there was a danger that what we were doing would
only cause wheel-clamping to be displaced by the placing of alleged
financial demands on vehicles and the chasing up of such demands. I
have had correspondence from constituents, as I am sure have other
colleagues from all parties, who have been persistently chased by
companies wishing to extract purported fines from them. Only when they
have asked in return, &#147;What is your statutory justification for
seeking to extract this money from me?&#148; have the companies
eventually gone away, but not all people do so. As far as I am
concerned, that is the only serious issue left in relation to the
measures, given the Minister&#146;s helpful concessions earlier in
our
proceedings.</div><a name="10022365000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000346"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have been rather tolerant with the hon.
Gentleman. Wonder was the inspirational motive behind his contribution,
but we all wonder. Personally, I was wondering what his speech had to
do with amendments 171 and 172, but doubtless the Minister will tell
us.</div>
<a name="10022365000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000347"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I have been called many things, but Cinderella
at Christmas, or Cinderella&#146;s fairy godmother, is not one of
them. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> We will leave the ugly
sisters out of it.</div>
<a name="10022365000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">You will tell
me if I am out of order, Mr. Cook. The hon. Member for
Banbury raises an alternative to what we are trying to do in the Bill:
what would happen if the wheel-clampers decided to use ticketing as a
way to avoid the provisions? We have discussed a range of issues,
including that one, with the Department for Transport. We are not blind
to the fact that those who want to persist in practices such as those
we are outlawing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>might look for other ways to do so. The Government would, I am sure,
want to take action in such circumstances, but the provisions concern
wheel-clamping specifically.</div>
<a name="10022365000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
we seek to make have widespread support in general, including from some
people in the wheel-clamping sector. They want the sector to be better
regulated. They do not want cowboys to be part of it. I know that later
we will debate whether there should be a wheel-clamping sector at all,
but if we are to have one, some in the industry would welcome what we
are doing, because we are seeking not to displace such
behaviour&#151;ticketing might be a way of responding to
that&#151;but to change it.</div>
<a name="10022365000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000348"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Ticketing is unenforceable, which is why they have
resorted to wheel-clamping.</div>
<a name="10022365000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000349"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Absolutely. The right hon. and learned Gentleman
is correct that enforcement is much easier if a wheel clamp is put on a
car and removed only when the money has been paid, especially if it is
the extortionate fees currently charged. It is much more difficult with
ticketing.</div>
<a name="10022365000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general
point that worries the hon. Member for Banbury is whether people will
try to use an easy option. As in many aspects of the security industry,
we are seeking to drive out not just the cowboys but those who act on
the other side of legality. The Government do not believe there will be
an easy option and will take action if one becomes evident. This may
not be the last time we need to return to tackling those who seek an
unacceptable regime for controlling
parking.</div><a name="10022365000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10022365000350"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Oaten</b> (Winchester) (LD): In that last remark, is the
Minister not highlighting the difficulty with the Government&#146;s
approach? He is acknowledging that the issue will probably have to be
revisited, because industry will find a way round the licensing scheme.
The fact that the Minister said that industry welcomes it suggests that
it thinks the scheme is a soft
touch.</div><a name="10022365000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000351"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> No, I am happy to say that is not what I
intended to say. I am sorry if my words gave the hon. Gentleman that
impression. The measure is about getting rid of practices widely
regarded as unacceptable. It is not about knowingly entering a new
regime with the expectation that there will be displacement. That is
precisely the point I am making. We do not expect those consequences.
In response to the hon. Member for Banbury, I am saying that were there
to be unintended consequences, any Government would seek to rectify
them. I certainly do not believe that the industry accepts the scheme
because it thinks it will be easy to evade. There are more in the
industry against what we are doing because evasion is not easy. As in
many sectors, there are people who want to work in a properly regulated
industry and to drive out the cowboys who bring it into disrepute, as
well as causing harm to the public. I refute what the hon. Member for
Winchester said, although I am sorry if I gave him that
impression.</div>
<a name="10022365000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me return
to the amendment. Subsections (4) to (7) of new section 4A limit the
business licence requirement to those responsible for control of, or
decisions of, businesses carrying out the licensable activity. That is
very much about the controlling minds that we want to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>reach&#151;those who set the regime that many people find
unacceptable. Subsections (4) and (5) together exclude from the
business licensing requirement individuals carrying out vehicle
immobilisation activity on behalf of another. Subsection (5) provides
examples of particular cases where that is so, for example, subsection
(5)(a) covers employees acting on behalf of their
employer.</div><a name="10022365000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
171 would exclude agents as well as employees from the business licence
requirement, but we believe that is unnecessary given the drafting of
the clause, as subsections (4) and (5) apply when a person acts on
behalf of another. We believe that is covered by what we are
suggesting.</div><a name="10022365000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
172 would remove the particular arrangements for contractors set out in
subsections (6) and (7) which have the effect of ensuring that where an
individual is employed by another individual who is a subcontractor,
only the main contractor is liable, as we do not want the employing
subcontractor to be liable in those circumstances.</div>
<a name="10022365000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
explain clearly why that should be the case. A main contractor might be
retained to manage a firm or shop&#146;s parking area, with complete
discretion to apply his own business policies, such as the size of
release fees or what signs they would use
currently.</div><a name="10022365000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000352"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I was just reflecting on what the Minister said. I
think that he said that subsection (4) covers agents because of the
phrase</div>
<a name="10022365000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;carries out an
activity...on behalf of another person&#148;,</div>
<a name="10022365000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">but then I go to
subsection (5), which defines the meaning to be attached to subsection
(4). The central question I ask the Minister is this: is subsection (5)
an exhaustive interpretation of subsection (4), because if it is it
does not cover agency? It might not be an exhaustive definition of
subsection (4), so in other words subsection (4) is then
capable of carrying the agency point. We need to know whether or not
subsection (5) is an exhaustive definition of subsection (4)
activities.</div><a name="10022365000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000353"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. and learned
Gentleman. It is not an exhaustive list, but a number of examples, so
our view is that it would include agents. I will go away and reflect on
that point, because if we need to be more prescriptive I am happy to
consider that point. That comes to the nub of the amendments and why we
believe them to be unnecessary. We are not seeking to have individual
responses to the different ways the industry might be organised in
particular areas. We are trying to ensure through the business
licensing requirement that we regulate the business practices of every
vehicle immobilisation business, whatever their business model. We are
seeking to avoid a situation in which people will move to a different
business model to get around the kind of regulations we are looking at.
Our general approach is to ensure that we focus on those who ultimately
decide on the practices in an area, meaning the businesses themselves,
so we are confident that that is the best way to proceed and will be
most effective. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Hornchurch
will not press his amendment.</div>
<a name="10022365000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000354"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
response and for his being prepared to reflect on the comments made on
the interrelationship between subsection (4) and subsection
(5), which obviously have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>to be read together for their interpretation. However, the carve-out at
the bottom of subsection (5) states that it will not cover situations
in which a person is</div>
<a name="10022365000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;acting pursuant
to a contract for the supply of
services&#148;.</div><a name="10022365000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that that might undermine some of the things he said about
agency and that there might be unintended consequences. However, I
fully recognise, particularly in that area, the need to ensure that
people do not try to abuse the provision, and I can see circumstances
in which that might be the case and in which people will try to test
the operation of those provisions. Therefore, in the light of his
helpful response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="10022365000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="10022365000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000355"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I beg to move amendment 90, in

&#145;two&#146;.</div><a name="10022365000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
135, in clause 39, page 80, leave out
lines 19 to
25.</div><a name="10022365000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000357"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> The amendments relate to the penalties available to
the court in the event of breach. We are dealing with both magistrates
courts and Crown courts. As far as magistrates courts are concerned,
which are dealt with in subsection 8(a), I am seeking to prevent the
penalty of imprisonment being available. You look puzzled,
Mr. Cook, so I hope that I have got this right. I thought
you were about to say I was out of
order.</div><a name="10022365000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000358"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Please carry
on.</div><a name="10022365000281"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="10022365000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000359"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> So far as the Crown court is concerned, that is
dealt with by subsection (8)(b). The present draft enables the Crown
court to impose a term of imprisonment of up to five years and of up to
12 months in the case of the magistrates court. The general proposition
has to be that prison is imposed only in the absolute minimum of
circumstances. The prison population is far too high. When I was
Prisons Minister at the back end of the 1980s, the prison population
was 40,000. Only 20 years or so later, it is now more than 80,000. As
one who practises in the criminal courts, I know perfectly well that
large numbers of people who are in prison should not be there. It is
not necessary to include the power of imprisonment as a penalty for
every class of offences that is enacted by
Parliament.</div><a name="10022365000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
a magistrates court be able to send a person to prison at all for this
kind of offence? I think the answer is no. If it is a really gross
matter then let it go to the Crown court, but if it is a matter that
should be dealt with by the magistrates court then prison is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>appropriate, so I am against this so far as the magistrates court is
concerned. I have tried to strike it out altogether. I feel the same
about the Crown court. I do not think this is the class of offence for
which people should be sent to prison. But if I am wrong about that,
for goodness&#146; sake, two years as a maximum is quite enough. Five
years is quite ludicrous for this kind of thing, especially when it is
backed by the ability to impose a fine. This is simply part of a
general mentality of including prison whenever an offence is
created.</div>
<a name="10022365000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not
be doing this. Indeed, it is contrary to overall Government policy,
which says that prison should be a matter of last resort. I agree with
that. It is also contrary to the approach taken by the superior courts,
which constantly make the point that prison should be the penalty of
last resort. I hope that the Government will give serious attention to
this. We send all the wrong signals when we impose terms of
imprisonment for offences that are not of the class to carry a term of
imprisonment as a penalty. That is all I want to say about the matter.
I am fed up with terms of imprisonment being in legislation with which
I am asked to
deal.</div><a name="10022365000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000360"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend makes a number
of extremely valid points. I have some sympathy with his views. Sending
someone to prison for an offence such as this should be considered only
in extreme circumstances. I see no need to have five years; two years
should be the maximum. This is a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I would
not agree with everything my right hon. and learned Friend said but we
need flexibility to deal with such a case, particularly if it is a
persistent offence. I do not think that the possibility of using a
custodial sentence should be taken away completely, but the
Under-Secretary should reassure the public and the Committee that such
a sentence would be used only in the most extreme cases. The sentence
should be proportionate to the crime, rather than a five year sentence.
I find it hard to see how that could ever be
applicable.</div><a name="10022365000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000361"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The hon. Gentleman has just highlighted the
dilemma we face. He is quite right to draw attention to the issue of
whether or not the penalties are appropriate, but of course there is a
need for penalties, because we are talking about people who, in
breaching licences, can be guilty of carrying out pretty terrible
practices. That is the
dilemma.</div><a name="10022365000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to try to set out why we have got to this position, because it is
important to remember that this work will be part of the work of the
Security Industry Authority, whose actions will be governed by statute.
The clause as drafted provides that a person who commits an offence
under new section 4A of the Private Security Industry Act 2001 would be
liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
six months, or to a fine up to the statutory maximum of &#163;5,000,
or to both. On conviction on indictment, an offender would be liable to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to an unlimited
fine, or to both.</div>
<a name="10022365000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 90
to 93, and amendment 135, would have the effect of removing the option
of imprisonment in either court. Amendment 137 would have the effect of
reducing the maximum term of imprisonment on conviction on indictment
from five years to two years. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>We are asking the SIA to be the providers of the licences for businesses
and they are, of course, subject to the 2001 Act. The clause, as
currently drafted, provides for penalties directly in line with those
in section 5 of the 2001 Act for the offence of using unlicensed
security
operatives.</div><a name="10022365000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can have a debate about the repercussions of the clause on the
wheel-clamping industry and on the type of practices that people find
abhorrent, but of course in other areas that the SIA regulates there
are some terrible practices which, particularly where security is
involved, can often have awful consequences. So we should not in any
way underestimate the damage that could be done if we were to take too
light a view of the type of work that is regulated in the
clause.</div>
<a name="10022365000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
provisions apply in section 6 of the 2001 Act to the offence
of using unlicensed wheel-clampers as committed by the occupiers of
premises. In a sense, I think that we are coming at this issue from the
other end of the spectrum to the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham, because we see no reason not to have the
option of imprisonment as a sentence for businesses that commit such an
offence. I accept, however, that he is arguing about the length of the
sentence, rather than whether or not there should be a
sentence.</div>
<a name="10022365000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to
place on record our view that, although we support the option of
imprisonment for people who break the law in this area, many cases will
not warrant imprisonment. Offences against the business licence
requirement and the terms of licences are serious, but we would want to
leave such offences to the discretion of the court. We believe that
imprisonment is a necessary option for the worst offences, and that is
consistent with current provisions applicable to the employment of
unlicensed
wheel-clampers.</div><a name="10022365000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
penalties are therefore consistent with those in section 5 of the 2001
Act for the offence of using unlicensed security operatives. We believe
that the offences that might be committed in this sector are as serious
as those that might be committed in other sectors. Therefore, we do not
see any reason to vary those penalties simply for vehicle
immobilisation businesses. We have talked to others in Government about
whether or not there should be a lesser sentence. We could not decide
what the criteria should be for reducing the sentence from five to two
years, other than that there would be a lesser sentence. There did not
seem to be any real criteria or comparison to explain why two years
would be more acceptable or more proportionate, except that a two-year
sentence suggests that the offence is less serious than a five-year
sentence would suggest.</div>
<a name="10022365000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may offer
some comfort to the right hon. and learned Gentleman to learn that
there is debate&#151;not only within parties but within government,
and indeed outside government&#151;about whether or not long prison
sentences are the way to go, so the length of sentencing and the
penalties are kept under review. At some point in future we might
return to
that.</div><a name="10022365000194"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000362"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I am listening carefully to the
Under-Secretary, and he is explaining the position very clearly.
However, I am not certain why we need a prescribed period, if it is up
to the courts to decide the sentence in proportion to the crime. Why
not let the courts make a decision based on the offence? Why prescribe
two, five or any number of years?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div><a name="10022365000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000363"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> We are talking about five, because that is what
is in section 5 of the 2001 Act. The legislation is already there;
Parliament has already decided whether, in similar areas that are
licensed by the Security Industry Authority, it is appropriate to
imprison someone, and what an appropriate sentence would be. Our
question would be the opposite of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s. We would
not ask why wheel-clamping should be included in the list, but why it
should be dealt with differently. What is it about wheel-clamping that
makes it worthy of a lesser sentence? The courts might take the view
that what is available to them is a maximum of five years&#146;
imprisonment and an unlimited fine, but that they will impose a lesser
sentence or perhaps no period of imprisonment. The option should,
however, be available to them, and we see no reason to deviate from a
route that has already been laid down. That is why, unfortunately, we
cannot support the
amendments.</div><a name="10022365000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000364"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> With your permission, Mr. Cook, I would
like to make three observations. The first is that the Under-Secretary
began his comments by saying that he and I were approaching the matter
in rather different ways. He is right. He said that the proper approach
is to ask why wheel-clamping should not attract a prison sentence. I
ask a different question: why should it? It is perfectly true that that
is a difference of approach. The Under-Secretary&#146;s approach
raises the presumption that wheel-clamping should attract a prison
sentence; I raise the presumption that it should not. That is a
fundamental difference between us. I strongly believe that the prisons
are overflowing, packed with people who should not be there, and that
one reason is that people are constantly saying that a whole range of
activities should attract a prison sentence when they simply should
not. I regard the Under-Secretary&#146;s presumption as a heresy with
which I strongly
disagree.</div><a name="10022365000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I am offering a compromise. I am not usually a compromising man on this
issue. The compromise is something like this: we drop the prison
sentence for the magistrates court&#151;only relatively minor cases
will be triable by that court if there is an alternative of trying on
indictment&#151;and we confine prison to trial on indictment in the
Crown court. That is a compromise. At that point, we have to determine
only the term. I am strongly in favour of two years over five, which in
this context means 12 months, unless I am wrong. That is a substantial
sentence for wheel-clamping; I certainly do not want to serve 12 months
for any offence, far less for wheel-clamping. I should have thought
that, in reality, a penalty inside of 12 months was perfectly adequate.
Even if I was wrong about that and I settled for five years, provided
that the compromise was accepted, justice would perhaps be met, because
in those circumstances the prosecution authority would send cases
involving repeated offences to the Crown court. That is what concerns
my hon. Friend the Member for Romford, and I suspect the
Under-Secretary also. His position is therefore guarded and so too is
mine&#151;hence the
compromise.</div><a name="10022365000282"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

last point is made in response to the Minister&#146;s least
attractive argument, which is that as the 2001 Act already commits the
heresy we should commit it again. I have always thought that that was
an absolutely rubbish argument: the fact that previous legislation
imposes sentences of imprisonment, where that is not necessary, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>is not a good reason for going on committing the sin. I commend my very
modest compromise to the Minister, and hope that he may feel able at
least to reflect on it before

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000365"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am always happy to reflect on such things, but
I must return to the fundamental point that we are trying to deal with
vehicle immobilisation in the context of the SIA and the 2001 Act. If
vehicle immobilisation were brought into that framework the penalties
would already be laid down. I shall reflect on the matter but, as I
suggested towards the conclusion of my previous remarks, there is
debate in Government anyway about the appropriateness and length of
sentences, so the right hon. and learned Gentleman might get what he
wants from a different
route.</div><a name="10022365000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000366"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> It is very gracious of the Minister. I recognise
that the undertaking was not full-hearted, but it was none the less
generous as far as it went, and I shall be interested to see whether,
in June or July, the roles will be reversed, and the Labour party will
be arguing against imprisonment, in circumstances in which the
Conservative Front Bench may argue in its favour. That would be an
interesting contrast, which I shall not be intimately involved in,
anyway, in this House. On that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10022365000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000367"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000369"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> This is me with my libertarian hat on again; I try
to wear it the whole time, as a matter of fact.</div>
<a name="10022365000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am against
absolute offences. I think that the courts should always be careful to
convict only when it is just to do so. Parliament is far too swift to
create absolute or strict offences. In tabling the amendments, I have
tried to do two things, which relate to the new subsection
1A(b) that clause 39(3) would insert into section 6 of the
2001 Act. Amendments 138 and 139 would mean that subsection
1A(b) stated: &#147;the carrying out of those activities involves
that other person to the knowledge of the occupier engaging in conduct
licensable under section 4A in respect of which he is not
the holder of a licence under that section and the occupier is aware of
that fact&#148;.</div>
<a name="10022365000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee sees the justice of that. It is important that the
occupier should be liable only for those activities of which he is
aware, to the extent that he is aware that they are licensable. If the
occupier is not aware that the activities are licensable, it seems
jolly unfair that he should be subject to criminal penalties.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div><a name="10022365000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">That takes me
to the second point. It is right that the occupier should be convicted
only in the event that he or she knows that the person carrying out the
activities is not the holder of a licence. To put the thing the other
way round, is it fair that the occupier should be held liable in law
when they do not know that the person does not hold the
licence?</div>
<a name="10022365000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000370"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> Surely the occupier has some responsibility to
establish those facts when they choose to contract out to someone who
takes on the work on their
behalf.</div><a name="10022365000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000371"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> They may have a responsibility, but what if they are
deceived? There is a limit to what occupiers can do, especially if they
are people of fairly modest circumstances, and one must recognise that
they might be deceived. It is perfectly fair to say that the occupier
perhaps should act in that way, but what if they are lied to? Then the
question relates to whether they should be held liable in the criminal
court for receiving that lie and not taking it further.</div>
<a name="10022365000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
dilemma, and it arises in an awful lot of cases. For example, someone
who receives stolen goods may well ask the person who brings them,
&#147;Do you own it?&#148; and get the reply &#147;Of course I
do&#148;; but he is being lied to. That is the sort of issue that
arises.</div>
<a name="10022365000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those
cases, the prosecution should be under a duty to establish the
necessary knowledge, first, that the activities are licensed, and
secondly that the person carrying out those activities did not possess
a licence. That is what the Crown should be obliged to
prove.</div>
<a name="10022365000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000372"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Amendments 138 and 139 would separately require
that for someone to be guilty of an offence under proposed new section
4B(3)&#151;the offence of allowing an unlicensed wheel-clamping
business to work on their premises&#151;the occupier of those
premises must know that the business is carrying out licensable
activities without being licensed. We believe that what the amendments
seek to achieve is already provided for in the 2001 Act. Proposed new
section 4B(3) will insert the new offence into section 6 of the 2001
Act as subsection (1A). However, section 6(2) of the 2001 Act already
provides a defence for the occupier which is
either</div><a name="10022365000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
he did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for
suspecting...that the individual in question was not the holder of
a
licence&#148;,</div><a name="10022365000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
that he took &#147;all reasonable steps&#148; to ensure that the
individual did not carry out licensable activities when he did not hold
a licence.</div>
<a name="10022365000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that there is sufficient scope in the current Act for a person in the
situation described by the right hon. and learned Gentleman to have a
defence and claim either that they had no grounds for suspicion and did
not know, or that they had taken all reasonable steps under the
circumstances. What the amendment seeks to achieve is already covered
by the 2001 Act.</div>
<a name="10022365000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
140 and 141 would amend proposed new section 4B(6), which provides for
the prosecution and punishment of offences committed by unincorporated
associations under the 2001 Act. New section 4B(6) is intended to cover
situations where, for example, a group of wheel-clampers acts as a body
but without any separate legal status as such. It would make both the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>unincorporated association and specified members of it liable to
prosecution for offences relating to business licensing. Under new
section 4B(6), the relevant authority, such as a partner or officer,
could be prosecuted if the offence was
committed</div>
<a name="10022365000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with the
consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the
part
of&#148;</div><a name="10022365000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
individual
concerned.</div><a name="10022365000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
140 would add the word &#147;wilful&#148; before
&#147;connivance&#148;, which would suggest the intention to do
something. Our view is that connivance is tacit permission and already
implies an act of will, whether through a deliberate action or by
deliberately disregarding something. The amendment would raise the
threshold for prosecution and, for reasons that we cannot see, would
make it more difficult to prove an
offence.</div><a name="10022365000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
141 would remove the possibility of prosecution for an offence
attributable to neglect by the individual. Again, that would raise the
threshold for liability for prosecution, so that intention rather than
negligence would be required for an individual to be prosecuted. We
believe that there could be cases where individuals fail to act where
there is a breach of the law by the group of individuals they are
working with. Proving intention may be impossible, but that does not
mean that people should not be held criminally responsible when
appropriate, such as when they have not taken appropriate care to avoid
using unlicensed
operatives.</div><a name="10022365000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
143 would amend proposed new section 4B(3) to create an offence in
which an occupier fails to display a notice as described in the
amendment. I understand the good intentions behind the amendment, but,
as I am sure we will come on to discuss, we have deliberately set out
not to put the licensing requirements in the Bill, but to set them out
in secondary regulations. I assure the Committee that notices will
figure largely not only in that set of requirements, but in our
deliberations.</div>
<a name="10022365000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations will cover, at the necessary level of detail, not just
signage but matters such as maximum release fees, time limits on
removing vehicles, methods of payment, and information&#151;a
discussion we had during the evidence sessions&#151;as well as
warning signs, size, design, contents and positioning. Those issues, as
well as signage, will be addressed in the regulations. Not putting the
regulations in the Bill gives us an opportunity for the important next
stage, which is to have a consultation with stakeholders to ensure that
we get the regulations right and that we can amend them, if necessary,
through statutory legislation. From time to time, we may need to add
things to the regulations.</div>
<a name="10022365000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the intent of the amendments, but I hope that by setting out our
intentions with regard to the regulations and referring to what already
exists in the 2001 Act, we have addressed the concerns raised by the
right hon. and learned Gentleman.</div>
<a name="10022365000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000373"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Mr. Cook, I now understand why you were
looking a bit puzzled when I first rose to my feet. The lead amendment,
as the Minister rightly pointed out, is amendment 143 and I was not in
fact referring to amendment 143 when I made my preliminary remarks, I
was referring to the other amendments. Now I understand why you looked
so puzzled.</div>
<a name="10022365000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have three
sets of observations. First, as regards the notices covered by
amendment 143&#151;I am jolly glad to hear that the Minister will
deal with this subsequently&#151;my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>recollection of the evidence session is that one of the problems
relating to wheel-clamping is that, when a person comes to find his or
her vehicle clamped, they have not got a clue how to get it
unclamped.</div>
<a name="10022365000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000374"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I&#146;ve been
there.</div>
<a name="10022365000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000375"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> As you say, Mr. Cook, you have been there
yourself. It is very important that the details&#151;the telephone
number and so on&#151;of the clamper should be made public so that
the person can achieve a speedy release. I am in favour of
that.</div>
<a name="10022365000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point that the Minister dealt with was with regard to my amendment
seeking to insert &#147;wilful&#148; before the word
&#147;connivance&#148; and striking out &#147;attributable
to...neglect&#148;. He said, quite rightly, that I was trying to
raise the barrier&#151;and yes, I am. Why do I want to raise the
barrier? I am against criminal offences unless they are absolutely
essential. Contrary to the Minister&#146;s position, my presumption
leads me to ask why we should make this a criminal offence, not why we
are not making it a criminal offence.</div>
<a name="10022365000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The word
&#147;connivance&#148; as it stands is capable of passive
acquiescence as well as active intervention. I would like to see the
word &#147;wilful&#148; in the phrase, because it suggests a higher
level of culpability. That is the reason. As regards striking out
&#147;attributable to any neglect&#148;, I do not want, as a
general proposition, to see neglect amounting to a criminal offence.
Sometimes it is negligent; however, whether it should be criminal seems
to me to be a quite different issue. So, yes, I want to lower the bar
and the Minister wants to raise the bar. There is that between us and
in the end it is a matter for the Committee. I am not going to press
the matter to a vote, but I am not in favour of having what is pretty
much a strict offence.</div>
<a name="10022365000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point
concerns drafting in general. The Minister may well be right&#151;I
accept his word about this&#151;when he says that what he was trying
to achieve with regard to amendments 138 and 139 is covered by the 2001
Act. That actually makes a general point about drafting. Where offences
are spatchcocked into an existing Bill, it is actually quite difficult
to follow. It is better by far to redraft the entire relevant clause
into the amending Act, because otherwise there is constant
cross-referencing and one fails to see things.</div>
<a name="10022365000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have raised
that point about drafting before. I am glad that the Minister has
pointed out that the 2001 Act provides for an offence, but he will
recognise, I think, that anyone reading the draft, which is an
amendment, would not have a clue of that fact. That is a lacuna in our
drafting process. It is not the fault of the Minister, but it is a
fault of those of us who have been involved in the way that Parliament
performs.</div>
<a name="10022365000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000377"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I will be brief. The question, it seems to me, is
whether we should have a licensing regime for wheel-clamping or
prohibit it. On balance, I am in favour of prohibiting it. I remember
that during the evidence session, the Minister&#151;I think that it
was this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>Minister, but it might have been his right hon. Friend&#151;said,
&#147;Well, ultimately we might have to ban the whole thing, but in
the meantime, let&#146;s try an industry-led solution.&#148; That
is an understandable position, but I am bound to say that, considering
it broadly, I had some difficulty seeing why we should allow
wheel-clamping on private property. On the whole, it seems a thoroughly
undesirable activity, and I am personally in favour of banning
it.</div>
<a name="10022365000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10022365000378"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): Does the
right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that ultimately, it should be up
to the primary landowner to screen off their land if they do not want
vehicles on it, or to put up a barrier and a proper access system if
they want to allow vehicles, whether or not they charge for it? We
could get rid of the legislation if they took those simple
steps.</div><a name="10022365000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000379"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> That might be possible in most urban contexts, but
it is not possible in a rural context. I have a small parcel of land
adjoining my house. Anybody can come and park there. I could not fence
it off in any way, because it is too extensive. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s proposal might be appropriate for pubs, car parks
adjoining houses and so on, but it is not appropriate to the rural
context, where the extent of the land is often far too great to allow
for that approach. However, there is good sense in it with regard to
the urban context.</div>
<a name="10022365000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I seek
compromise. I always do. A nice way forward would be something like
this. We could keep the licensing regime in place, but we could also
include a prohibition with a delayed implementation date that could
take effect only with the affirmative resolution of the House. Of
course, it would be an amendable resolution. What would then happen is
that we would have a licensing regime, which the Minister will agree
with the industry and so on, so that companies can go on conducting
their business provided that they comply with the terms of the
agreement. Behind all of that would be a ban, which would not come into
effect unless implemented and would not be implemented provided that
the industry did what it said it would. It would be the ultimate
deterrent and a jolly good
compromise.</div><a name="10022365000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000380"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> I want to speak to new clause 3, which seeks to go
further than the Government&#146;s proposals. The question is whether
we believe that the industry can regulate itself under a licensing
scheme or whether we need some new form of control over wheel-clamping.
New clause 3 suggests that the process of vehicle immobilisation should
be the responsibility of a public body. That is not to say, of course,
that private companies could not be involved in delivery, but the
regulation and the management would be run by public bodies, which
could then contract out the
work.</div><a name="10022365000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 also seeks to remove the practice of linking financial
incentives to the amount of clamping done. In essence, it would
strengthen what the Government are doing with the licensing regime but
take the matter out of the hands of the private sector and put it into
those of public bodies to manage and oversee. We think that that is the
most appropriate way to handle an issue that has clearly got out of
control in the past four or five years.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div><a name="10022365000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
system is not working. The Government recognise that, which is why they
are proposing the changes. There has been an enormous increase in the
number of private companies operating in the area, including a 58 per
cent. increase in the past year; 2,100 private clamping
firms now operate. We know from our mailbags as constituency MPs that
the number of companies that are charging based on incentives in
relation to how much clamping takes place is increasing. In some cases,
companies provide a &#163;50 commission per clamp for the individuals
who do the clamping. Some companies have been setting targets of five
clamps a day. Some companies offer a free clamping service because they
will ensure that they make up their money through the amount of
clamping charges that they put in
place.</div><a name="10022365000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing system does not have an adequate right of appeal. That is why
so many of our constituents ask us to take up their cases against the
private companies. There is no system for genuine cases to be able to
appeal. We also know from our mailbags that the charges being put in
place are astronomical. The highest one that we found evidence of was
the &#163;314 that a disabled motorist had to pay to prevent her car
from being towed away, even though her disabled badge was on display.
There are endless examples; I am sure that we all have
them.</div><a name="10022365000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
recent snow in my constituency brought the most bizarre cases of
individuals who had to abandon their cars because they literally could
not drive any further, only to discover that they had a clamp within 24
hours. I have three such constituents and I have not been able to win
the case for any of them. I have not been able to get any justification
for that from the private sector, from which the most appalling letters
have been written back to me, basically dismissing me and my
constituents out of
hand.</div><a name="10022365000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
that leads me to take the view that it is time to get much tougher on
the industry. The proposed licensing scheme is not adequate to deal
with the severity of the problem and the practices in which the
industry is involved. Obviously, as a Liberal, I do not like new laws;
I prefer to see whether industries can self-regulate. That is my
starting process, but the industry has had a chance to self-regulate.
There are codes that the British Parking Association has in its
guidelines, but they are being ignored by the industry. The codes on
maximum fees are being ignored by companies, and the licensing scheme,
in my judgment, will not be much more than an extension of the codes
that currently operate. I have very little confidence that the industry
will abide by that licensing
scheme.</div><a name="10022365000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the AA gave evidence at one of our hearings, the head of the AA
expressed concern about the licensing scheme and said that when a
licence is issued, that could just be a licence to print money. The
AA&#146;s concern was that once a company has the licence, it will
feel free to do as it wishes. It would almost be like a badge of honour
to have the licence, but with regard to enforcement and whether the
licence and the conditions that go with it, which we do not know about
yet, would have any policing, the AA did not feel confident that that
would take place. It also raised the concern that a company whose
licence was revoked because it failed to meet its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>criteria would just rebrand and rename itself as another company. We
know that that happens in all sorts of
situations.</div><a name="10022365000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
there is concern that the licensing scheme will not be adequate and
will not deal with the concerns. Surely we now have enough evidence
that the industry has lost its right to regulate itself and that it is
time to bring such a sensitive matter, which can impact on individuals
enormously given the figures involved, into the public
sector&#151;into a public body&#151;so that it can regulate and
manage it and do away with the bad practice and the practice whereby
individuals are, bluntly, making commission and profit on the back of
something that should be regulated in a sensible and measured way. That
is why we feel strongly enough about new clause 3 to seek to divide the
Committee unless the Minister can give us very strong reassurances that
the licensing scheme will be
effective.</div><a name="10022365000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000381"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> As I read new clause 3, the hon. Gentleman
would be looking for local authorities to take over the responsibility.
Why does he believe that that would be a better way of addressing
things than a regulatory scheme in relation to the activities of those
who, once they are regulated, should comply? Why does he see local
authorities as the way forward in this
regard?</div><a name="10022365000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000382"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> I am grateful for the intervention. Let us take the
example of the three constituents who were snowed in and whose cars
were clamped. I have greater confidence that those constituents and I,
as their Member of Parliament, would have a fair hearing by arguing
that case through a public body than the way in which I was dismissed
by the private sector. There is more chance that the industry could be
managed if public bodies were overseeing it. I am not arguing that
private companies should not be able to deliver the service, but that
it should be under the control of, and contracted by, public
authorities rather than operating as it does currently, which is with
no control at
all.</div><a name="10022365000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000383"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> There is some consensus about the issue. All of
us know of a huge number of constituents who have been done by cowboy
clampers, and we all understand how angry people are when that happens.
It is right that the Government are attempting to deal with the matter.
However, much tougher action needs to be taken and I shall be seeking
assurances from the Minister that under secondary legislation and,
indeed, in the Bill measures will be effective in dealing with the
widespread problem throughout the
country.</div><a name="10022365000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 30 would make provision for a code of conduct. It is essential.
A code of conduct has to be enforceable under the Bill. The Liberal
Democrat spokesman referred to giving local government control over
such matters, but I am not convinced that that is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div>the solution. We took evidence earlier from Councillor Shona Johnstone
from the Local Government Association. She was clear that the possible
cost implications on local government need to be considered. I
appreciate and sympathise with the point of the hon. Member for
Winchester that, if constituents go to their Member of Parliament or
local councillors, they are likely to receive a response, whereas they
do not from private companies, such as LBS Enforcement Ltd in my
constituency. Like me, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch has
suffered from South East Clamping. Cowboy clamping demands huge sums
from constituents. Of course, it is much harder to deal with a private
company than it is with local government, but I must say to the hon.
Member for Winchester that, if we allow local government to enforce all
types of things to do with the private sector, where will that end? We
must have laws that deal directly with the issue and are directly
accountable rather than go through a public body in such a
way.</div><a name="10022365000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not support local government taking control over such things,
apart from the arguments regarding cost implications, finance and the
manpower needed to enforce such a law were it to be introduced. I wish
to give one or two examples because it is worth stating the extent of
the problem. We all suffer from it. I draw attention to a lady in my
constituency, Joan Orchard. She is a disabled, retired lady and was
clamped and fined &#163;280 by LBS Enforcement. She did not have the
money in her account; she was forced to use a credit card with
additional charges. She was told that it was contracted to work only
until 5.30 pm. The clamping had occurred at 7.30 pm. Suffice to say
that she appealed, but did not get anywhere. In any circumstance, that
is a breach of the
system.</div><a name="10022365000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
heard useful evidence about such matters in our earlier sessions. I
made notes about three issues that need to be taken on board. I hope
that signage will be enforced strongly under secondary legislation.
That should apply to ticketing, too. There also needs to be a code of
conduct. I want the Minister to take those matters into account under
the Bill, as well as in the secondary
legislation.</div><a name="10022365000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10022365000384"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> First, I shall cover the comments of the right
hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham. A delayed ban
is an interesting prospect. I suppose that it goes back to our earlier
discussion about whether we have faith in the Bill. Well, we would not
be discussing it in Committee if we did not. We expect it to work, but
there has been a pattern whereby we licensed individuals involved in
wheel clamping and we are now moving to
businesses.</div><a name="10022365000284"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1
