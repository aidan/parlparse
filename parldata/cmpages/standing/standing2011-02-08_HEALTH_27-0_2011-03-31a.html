are that there is a lack of protection for patients’

provide assurance to doctors and patients that any data collection will

confidentiality plays an essential role in the relationship between
health professionals and their patients. We do not want significant
damage to be caused to health care as a result of the trust between
patients and doctors being eroded. Fears that their data may be shared
with others, including central Government, may result in patients
withholding important information. That may not only affect their
health, but have implications for the wider health
service.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000042">&#160;</a>

standards in the NHS? Those documents include the NHS code of practice
on confidentiality, the care record guarantee and guidance for health
care professionals from their regulatory bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000043">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 659
has the same effect as amendment 656, but refers to clause
238. The clause appears to enable the Secretary of State or the board
to authorise the collection of data without reference to any
information governance controls or explanation as to why new powers to
collect data are necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000044">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In addition,
data can be collected for an extremely broad purpose—that is, in
connection with the provision of health services. The clause appears to
run contrary to a number of Data Protection Act 1998 requirements,
including the requirements that data should be obtained for a specified
purpose and that any disclosure must be lawful in a broader sense and
respect other legal restrictions on disclosure—for example, the
common duty of
confidentiality.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
once the data are collected, it is not clear how long they will be
retained or whether they will be transferred to third parties. The BMA
expressed the view that removing the rights of patients and health care
professionals in relation to the control of sensitive information is
likely to fall foul of article 8 of the European convention on human
rights.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000046">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I take this opportunity to address concerns that
come through in a series of amendments that the hon. Lady and other
Opposition Members have tabled to this part of the Bill. In a way, the
points she has raised touch on the thread of that concern, which the
BMA has been aired with the Government and, I suspect, the Opposition.
We are certainly listening to these points and we are sensitive to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">The
intention behind the amendments is right. This is about preserving
patient and service user confidentiality, which I am sure Members on
both sides of the Committee want to continue. We would certainly not
want to see the Information Centre breaching confidentiality by
publishing information about individual patients or service users.
Subsection 243(1), which will be amended later, makes it clear that
that is prohibited. Re-establishing the Information Centre in primary
legislation presents an opportunity to ensure that the provisions are
as strong as they need to be, and that was the basis on which we
drafted the
clauses.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Benefits
can be gained from bringing information together for analysis, and in
determining the role of the Information Centre we have carefully
considered the safeguards that need to apply. It has for a long time
been necessary to collect information that identifies individuals for a
range of purposes, including tracking outcomes of care and treatment,
medical research and public health analysis. Names and addresses are
never needed, but other information such as a unique identifier, date
of birth and postcode often are. Without those details, it is not
possible to link information about the same individual obtained from
different sources or at different
times.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
important purposes are already supported under regulations made under
section 251 of the National Health Service Act 2006. They include
purposes carried out by the existing Information Centre, and also by 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1213<a class="bkMark" name="Column1213">&#160;</a>
                           </div>many other bodies. Without the powers in the Bill, the Information
Centre would have to continue working under the arrangements in the
2006 Act to obtain the Secretary of State’s permission to do as
the Secretary of State directed, which is nonsensical. The Government
believe that bringing the collection and linking of information
together in one place will enable strong controls to be put in place to
safeguard information and reduce the number of flows of confidential
information around the system, therefore strengthening confidentiality
management
overall.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000050">&#160;</a>

its procedures for requests, and has powers and duties to give advice

to the issue, we will continue to consider whether the requirements are
sufficient to provide the transparency that is

following our proceedings might have. That is why I cannot give you a

published in January 2011: “A new pathway for the regulation and
governance of health research.” It recommended the establishment
of national safe havens or honest brokers be taken forward urgently.
The report referred also to the 2008 data-sharing review published by
the Information Commissioner and the director of the Wellcome Trust,
which had made similar

create such an honest broker role in statute for the first time. The
provisions would empower it to collect confidential and identifiable
information, and to link information from different sources and over
time, but the Information Centre will not be permitted to disclose

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
651 seeks to prevent the Information Centre from collecting anything
other than de-identified information without the explicit consent of
the individual concerned. Amendment 656 seeks to achieve the same goal
by specifying an information standard that would impose the same
requirements as the common law in respect of confidentiality. Amendment
659 again seeks to achieve the goal of constraining what the
Information Centre collects by limiting what directions the Secretary
of State and the NHS commissioning board may provide. As I have
explained, the amendments would prevent the Information Centre from
having the central role of honest broker in the data collection and
linkage, and that strengthens the approach to confidentiality across
the system. I stress that this is about strengthening confidentiality
across the system. The Bill, as drafted, prohibits the Information
Centre from publishing information that identifies individual service
users. Indeed, in many cases that information will be confidential and
publication would be
unlawful.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
will shortly discuss Government amendments to clause 243, and ancillary
amendments to clauses 238 and 239. They will further limit the
circumstances in which the Information Centre can be directed, or
choose to disseminate, any identifiable patient or service user
information it collects, with confidentiality restrictions that are
stronger and less flexible than those that are currently imposed by
common law. Information, if used effectively, can provide enormous
public benefits, and the Government are clear that it is essential that
we free information from the organisational silos where it currently
sits. We also believe, however, that that needs to be more tightly
controlled than it has been in the past. For those reasons, and with
that explanation and those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Lady will
feel able to withdraw her amendments. If she does not, I will urge my
colleagues to oppose
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000057">&#160;</a>

does not want to amend the Bill today, but he may want to amend the

the Committee is to be satisfied with the answer that we have heard
today and that he is not prepared to address the issue properly. It

the Committee. The intention, and the way in which the clauses are
drafted, is very clear: common law still applies, the existing data
protection law still applies, the Human Rights Act 1998 still applies
and the Bill imposes greater controls than have hitherto applied. To

be surprising if the intention behind it was not to give

657 seeks to ensure that health professionals are appropriately
consulted when information standards are prepared. Hon. Members are
right that when appropriate, the Information Centre should consult
health professionals. However, the amendment goes too far in suggesting
that health professionals should be consulted on all information
standards, and that those preparing a standard should have regard to
the advice of health professionals, regardless of its relevance to
those health professionals. In addition, I was surprised to see no
mention of patients in the amendment. Clearly, if the hon. Lady is
concerned about whether the consultation powers in clause 235 are
sufficient, that aspect should have been tested too. I am more than
happy to give the necessary assurances on that as well.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000070">&#160;</a>

that it is the Health and Social Care Information Centre, not just the
health information centre. Information standards will come in many
shapes and sizes, and will include social care or technical IT
standards that are of no interest to health professionals, at least not
in most cases. The intention is to consult all those who have an
interest, but it is important to remember that health professionals are
only one of a number of groups—including patients—that
may have an interest, and that it may well be a different group whose
voice should be listened to in respect of a particular standard. Clause
235 already places a clear requirement on both the Secretary of State
and the NHS commissioning board to consult relevant persons before
publishing an information standard.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000071">&#160;</a>

of Health code of practice, the national information governance care

confidentiality requirements regarding consent and so on that should be

I will be asking questions later about the implications of the
proposals for patient confidentiality, as well as about how the data
will be used and who will request it. There are concerns about whether
funding will be available to bring about the necessary change and
fulfil the Government’s aspirations. The Government’s
plans pose a huge technical challenge that we believe will entail
substantial costs. We would like to know whether they have assessed how
much it is likely to cost and where the money is likely to come from.

records will be achieved and how quickly he thinks it will
happen?<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000080">&#160;</a>

seek some clarity on the funding of two important information sources.
The first is the general lifestyle survey. It has been carried out
every year on behalf of a number of Departments by the Office for
National Statistics, which has done a good job but whose funding seems
to have been withdrawn by the NHS Information Centre.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The GLS
provides information on a wide variety of topics, particularly public
health. It is one of the most detailed research exercises of its kind,
involving 15,000 households, and has run almost continuously
since 1971. It provides data that are comparable year on year, so the
information is particularly vital to measuring long-term trends. It has
been reported that the NHS Information Centre has decided to axe its
contribution of £300,000, meaning that the survey will end. I
understand that the head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Michael
Scholar, has written to the Health Secretary to object. Sir Michael has
said publicly:<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
ONS, who, following extensive consultation with the users of their
statistics, have just completed their post-budget cuts business plan,
have no funds available to make up this shortfall without damaging
their own vital economic and social statistics. The decision by the NHS
Information Centre will, therefore, result in the immediate
discontinuation of long-established National Statistics on smoking,
drinking, health conditions and use of health services…The
Statistics Authority is concerned that the abrupt discontinuation of a
time series on topics as central to public policy as smoking prevalence
and alcohol consumption will seriously undermine the UK’s
ability to monitor key trends affecting public
health.”<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000228">&#160;</a>

is a concerning statement. Given that we are discussing a policy
initiative that is supposed to be in line with the Government’s

                        <p class="tabbed">The survey,
which the respected National Centre for Social Research has carried out
annually since 1983, is perhaps the most important piece of ongoing
independent research in its field. It provides comparable year-on-year
data from an extensive research base. The cynical might ask, as they
did yesterday, what are the Government afraid of from year-on-year
extensive research? Are they expecting differences between the service
provided by the NHS now and that provided before?<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At its best
the survey is perhaps the only independent barometer of satisfaction
with the NHS, and certainly the only measure that goes back 25 years.
The removal of funding looks suspiciously like a deliberate attempt to
ensure that there is no way to measure satisfaction with the NHS before
and after the Government’s reorganisation. That is a central
point, particularly in the light of the reports today in <em>The
Times</em> that the Prime Minister is putting the brake on NHS reforms.
The Government have said a lot about the need for information to be
more widely used and freely available—we agree—so why are
they doing this?

was raised in the evidence to the inquiry, and in particular in the
medical press, about standardised mortality ratios, and I want to
highlight that as an area that should be looked into. It is not that
they are not needed—there is a clear requirement for more
accurate information to be produced on such matters—but I ask
that, whatever the outcome of the Bill, the Health and Social Care
Information Centre makes it a priority to ensure that the sort of
statistics produced on mortality ratios are more and more accurate and
become leaders in international best practice. I say that because there
has been some controversy over the figure originally produced for the
Mid Staffordshire trust, which suggested that between 400 and 1,200
excess deaths had occurred. The way that the information was first
produced and then reported gave rise to concern. Without the work of
Cure the NHS, led by Julie Bailey, the problems would perhaps never
have been brought to the public’s
attention.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000098">&#160;</a>

publication of the standardised mortality ratio launched the initial
investigation. Clearly, those statistics play an important role in
monitoring the NHS. If they are going to be used, they must be refined
more. Is it intended that the Health and Social Care Information Centre
will engage in the sort of research that will ensure that we have
world-leading statistical indicators that will enable the public and

hon. Members have explored some of the issues that spin from it. I am
grateful to the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury for
listing a host of areas where we share a common aspiration. That is
helpful. She is right that we set out those aspirations in the

Lady rightly said, for far to long we have had systems that hoard
information rather than share it and often that hoarding has not been
in the public interest. We are therefore determined to make sure that
far more information is freely available for comparison, so that people
can make informed judgments about the performance of the NHS as a whole
and of adult social care, and can make choices about their own
treatment options. That is at the heart of the
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000101">&#160;</a>

this stage no decisions have been made on the funding, and certainly
none to withdraw it. It is therefore not entirely clear why the

decision to withdraw funding. Discussions on the Information

to prevent the Secretary of State from having any influence the next.

greater freedom to the Information Centre than about the involvement of
the Secretary of State.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000118">&#160;</a>

understanding what Opposition is about, I will explain that our role,
as we understand it, is to hold the Government to account and to ask
difficult questions. It is not to set out an alternative Bill;
unfortunately, we are not in a position to do that. We have simply to
probe the legislation that the Minister is trying to pilot
through the House, unless and until the Prime Minister puts the brakes

explain the clause. Clearly, we are not against the need to promote
effective, efficient and economic use of resources in the provision of
health services, but we are concerned that it sounds somewhat bland and
we want to know exactly what is meant by it. If he gives us more

                        <p class="tabbed">Establishing
the Information Centre as a statutory body, no longer subject to the
whim of the Secretary of State, puts it on a far firmer footing. It is
only by virtue of that step that we are having any of these debates
about information governance in the first place. Although I can
reassure the hon. Lady and other hon. Members that the Government have
no intention of interfering in the centre’s day-to-day work,
there will be matters on which it is entirely appropriate for the
Secretary of State or the board to issue guidance to which the
Information Centre should be obliged to have regard. For example, the
Secretary of State remains accountable to this House for the governance
of the centre; he will need to issue guidance on corporate governance
requirements and have the centre take heed. Similarly, the NHS
commissioning board may issue guidance on promoting patient involvement
or innovation, to which the centre should also have
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
let me draw Members’ attention to the deletion of subsection
(1)(d). One of the centre’s key functions, as envisaged in the
White Paper, was to reduce the burden of data collections. The hon.
Lady asked earlier about the appropriate use of resources and how we
make sure that the centre conducts its functions appropriately, and the
provisions are part of how we do that. The Information Centre has
functions relating to the collection, analysis and publication of
information. Giving it a general duty to promote the effective,
efficient and economic use of resources in performing those functions
seems an eminently sensible step. The language may be bland, but the
intention is important for the clause and the Bill. To suggest that the
centre’s advice should not have regard to effectiveness,
efficiency and economy when it advises those seeking to collect
information is surely not the right approach, and I am sure that it is
not what the hon. Lady
intends.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
primary role of the Information Centre is to collect and publish
information for everyone to access and use. Information that the
Information Centre collects and cannot publish is set out under clause
243 and includes, as I am sure we would all expect, information that
might indentify individual patients or service users. 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>Amendments 675 and 676 clarify that directions made under clause 238 and
requests made under clause 239 cannot specify that information should
be collected and disseminated as an alternative to publication, other
than in limited circumstances set out in clause 243. The amendments
also clarify that the restrictions on disseminating information imposed
under clause 243 should not interfere with the right of any other
lawful authority to disseminate under other legislative
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The key point
is that the measure is a further tightening of the requirements to
protect confidential patient information, which is dealt with in clause
243. The amendments necessarily tighten that in ways I hope will
reassure many of those who have raised concerns about this part of the
Bill. When we discuss clause 243, we will look at the circumstances
where it should be possible for a direction or a request to specify
that information might be disseminated and not published, and the
circumstances where the Information Centre should have discretion to
disseminate non-identifiable information that it cannot
publish.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000143">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is worth
noting that we are putting the Information Centre on a firmer footing,
based in primary legislation, which enables us to discuss these
important provisions and set them in legislation that is stronger than
common law. It is important to many hon. Members and to those who are
following our proceedings to ensure that there are appropriate
constraints on how powers are used. I hope that the amendments will
receive the Committee’s

purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is no change to the

proxy is required unless subject to current exceptions. Again, it is an
attempt to ensure that the public can be confident that the current
laws of confidentiality will continue to apply under the new system
that the Government want to introduce under the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
allows any person to request the Information Centre to establish
systems for the collection, analysis, publication and dissemination of
information. That includes mandatory requests from Monitor, the Care
Quality Commission, NICE and any other person specified in subsequent
regulations. The clause provides extremely wide powers on information
sharing, and concerns have been raised that there is no reference to
patient confidentiality or information governance controls on
information sharing. The explanatory notes state in paragraph 1356 on
page 229 that a request from a private person or body must satisfy
existing regulations under section 251 of the National Health Service
Act 2006. What is the definition of a “private body
or person”, and why does that requirement not apply to all
requests made to the Information Centre? Perhaps the Minister will
explain that, because it is a potential lacuna, and we are worried
about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000153">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
is a fundamental point regarding the protection of patient
confidentiality. Patient information must remain subject to appropriate
safeguards to protect confidentiality and to maintain public trust in a
confidential health service. The liberal use of identifiable data
described in the clause threatens the therapeutic relationship between
doctors and patients, and we seek specific reassurance. When read cold,
the clause seems very permissive, and is
worrying.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000154">&#160;</a>

It is worth saying at the start that the Bill does not need to set out
new requirements for information governance controls, because they are
already required under data protection, human rights and
confidentiality law. The Bill includes explicit provisions to set
information standards, which will require consultation, and cover
information governance. That will become legally binding on health and
social care
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000157">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
660 raises issues that are already covered to some degree in clause
234. The amendment would prevent the Information Centre from accepting
a request to collect anything when there is a barrier in law, and we
accept that that should be the case when there are statutory
prohibitions on data sharing—for example, on gender reassignment
cases. As I explained, however, that would prevent the Information
Centre from having a central role as honest broker for data collection
and linkage that strengthens the approach to confidentiality across the
system that the Government believe is desirable. It is essential to
marry that role with the appropriate

have set out the arrangements in some detail, and we will return to

put on record my concerns about this clause and preceding and
subsequent clauses, and the unintended consequences that might result.
Information is power. We heard from the Minister that data that are
collected can sometimes be too abundant, but limitations on the data
that we collect, how they are analysed and how they are disseminated
can have profound consequences. For example, if data had not been
available during the 1980s, publication of the Black report would have
been the first time that issues such as health inequalities,
socio-economic inequalities and the difference between different groups
of the population, especially the north-south health divide, were
raised.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members should
consider the effects of limiting the collection, analysis and
dissemination of information. Members will also remember how that
report was held up and published in quite disgraceful circumstances. I
wanted to put that on record and to raise my concern that the Secretary
of State and the information centre must have regard to the
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000193">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The way in
which this Bill has been presented suggests that the Secretary of State
is removing political control from the NHS and its business. That is a
key way in which he is having a direct influence over the data that
will be collected, which, in turn, will affect policy for the NHS and
what lies
beyond.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000194">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>I have a number of questions that follow on
from points made by my hon. Friends. The establishment of the
Information Centre is an excellent idea in principle and I endorse
everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and
Finsbury said earlier on about the intentions behind it. However, what
consideration have the Government given to the fact that the work of
the Information Centre might be hamstrung as the centre becomes
inundated with the requests that will flow as a result of the framing
of the clause, which refers to the ability of any person to make a
request for information? That suggests that the Government want to be
open and transparent about information and allow as many individuals in
our society to request information, and, in principle, I support that.
None the less, as my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham East and
Saddleworth said, information in health care has the power to influence
policy, unnecessarily create alarm on occasion and cause decisions to
be made at all levels in the NHS that may not necessarily be borne out
by further scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
consideration have the Government given to the fact that there may be
many, many requests for information and the centre, with its limited
resources, may not always be able to determine what the impact of
providing such information might be? What analysis have the Government
undertaken to determine what proportion of the requests they anticipate
will come from commercial sources? As someone who has worked in
commercial health care in some fashion, I imagine that there will be
myriad requests for information from commercial companies and entities.
There may be many good reasons for them wanting that information, but
there could be some less desirable ones, too.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000196">&#160;</a>

the centre can charge at commercial rates for anything it chooses to
provide. What provisions are in the Bill to limit the extent to which

last point is in relation to the remark made by the Minister a moment
ago. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and
Finsbury, he suggested that in the event of an information request from
a commercial entity, the backstop by which the Government would stop
that information going into the public domain is the Secretary of
State. Although at one level it is an excellent backstop to have the
ultimate wicket keeper in the Secretary of State, in a world where we
have many requests, is it realistic to expect the Secretary of State or
even the Department of Health to be able to intervene repeatedly? Is it
not more likely that the Information Centre will have to make more of
those decisions itself, with the concomitant risks that I have
described?<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000198">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the hon. Gentleman has demonstrated, clause
239 requires us to read across other clauses, particularly clauses 244
and 240, to understand what is intended. That would go some way to
allay, or even remove completely, the concerns of the hon. Member for
Oldham East and Saddleworth about the quality and range of data that we
have been
collecting.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Both in the
information revolution consultation, to which we will be responding
shortly, but also through our actions, we have expressed our intention
to ensure that much more information is readily comparable across three
different domains. We have published our plans for a public health
outcomes framework and we will shortly be publishing the first ever
outcomes framework for adult social care. Last year, we published the
first ever NHS outcomes framework.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Each of those
frameworks begins the process of designing new data collections that
are more attuned to measuring outcomes in the systems for which the
Department of Health is responsible. To deal specifically with the
questions put by the hon. Member for Pontypridd, in the first instance,
the clause needs to be looked at in the context of clause 244, which
requires the publication of a register of all collections that are
undertaken. That will provide increased transparency: when collections
have not been disseminated in any way, it will be apparent. Members and
others following our proceedings will be able to ask why certain
information was not released. That is a new enhancement of
transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 240,
which also relates to clause 39, is where charges for that particular
purpose come into play. Clause 240 relates to supplementary matters
about the publication of procedures, with regard to when requests can
be made under clause 239. By setting out clearly in advance the basis
on which such decisions will be made, the provisions deal, in some
degree, with the hon. Gentleman’s concern about a deluge of
requests and how they will be judged. It will be set out in a
transparent way at the outset. There is also provision in this part of
the Bill for reasonable charges. Clause 250 covers commercial charges
and clause 240 refers to reasonable charges.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
addresses some of the concerns raised. I have a piece of paper that was
the inspiration for the question I have already answered, so I will not
rehearse 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1231<a class="bkMark" name="Column1231">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that again. These three clauses—we are about to come to the other
two—interlock, providing greater transparency and the safeguard
of not overloading the system with trivial or inappropriate
requests.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000202">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That answers some of the questions I asked. My
final question: does the Minister anticipate that the charging regime
laid out in the regulations will be designed simply to cover the costs
of the provision of that information, or does he anticipate that the
Information Centre will at some point make a
profit?<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000203">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The Information Centre will be able to make
reasonable profits from charging for its services, but these services
are unlikely to include the sale of information. The information that
the centre will be able to release will generally be published without
charge, so it will not interact with freedom of information or the
reuse of public sector information regulations. Instead, services may
include advice or guidance, support for data quality improvements and
so on. The Information Centre will also be expected to publish
procedures that cover charges. Again, therefore, there will be greater
transparency from the outset as to how those charges are framed in the
first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the hon. Gentleman asked for an estimate of the proportion of
information from commercial sources, but there is no estimate at this
stage. Because there will be requirements for publishing reports,
accounts and so on as time goes forward, that information will be
clearly in the public domain. As I have already said, we expect that
most requests will come from public bodies involved in health and
social care and mostly from the Secretary of State and from the NHS
commissioning
board.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> Does the Minister anticipate, therefore, that once
the Information Centre is set up, the NHS will no longer need to buy in
lots of information from other sources, as it has done over recent
years from, for example, Dr Foster Intelligence? That has obviously
become a profitable business as a result of NHS information. Will the
provision obviate the need to employ a body such as, but not
necessarily, Dr Foster
Intelligence?<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000206">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for the invitation to speculate,
but I will resist the temptation to answer that speculative,
hypothetical question at this stage. The Bill provides for a range of
scenarios, but it also sets out considerable safeguards for those
scenarios. I will not speculate as to whether commercial sources of
data will be used. In some cases, they may be necessary, because that
may be the only way to obtain the relevant
information.<a class="bkMark" name="1104016000207">&#160;</a>
