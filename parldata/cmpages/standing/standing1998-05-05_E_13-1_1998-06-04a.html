</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. In your absence this morning we debated the effect of capital allowances on the strength of the small and medium-sized sectors of the economy. The Paymaster General and his colleague withheld from the Committee the news that interest rates have been increased for the sixth time since the Government came to power, on the day that the permanent secretary has resigned from the Treasury amid accusations that the economy is being run into the ground by the Grosvenor house gang. Given that a further interest rate rise could well be imminent this evening, will he ensure that future rate rises are communicated immediately so that our deliberations on the economy might take them into account?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am afraid that that is not a point of order. The timing of announcements by the Bank of England is not a matter for the Chair. However, I have noted the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): On an important point of order, Mr. Butterfill. May we please remove our jackets?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Members may do so.
<H4><center>Clause 85 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Non-resident insurance companies: tax  representatives </center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 197, in page 68, leave out lines 15 to 23 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2) In this section `overseas insurer' means a person who is not resident in the United Kingdom who carries on a business which consists of or includes the effecting and carrying out of 
<P>
(a) policies of life insurance;
<P>
(b) contracts for life annuities; or
<P>
(c) capital redemption policies.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 70, in page 68, line 42, leave out "is" and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as, when he took out the policy".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 71, in page 69, line 9, leave out "residence" and insert "business".
<P>
No. 72, in page 69, lien 37, after "person" insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"having a substantial business connection with the overseas insurer who has agreed to act in that capacity".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> This clause will require certain overseas insurers to have a tax representative in the United Kingdom, Section 552A(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 defines an overseas insurer. The clause will potentially apply section 552A to all non-resident insurers who carry on a business that effects and carries out policies of life insurance, contracts for life annuities or capital redemption policies. As the proposed new subsection (4) shows, the clause will not alter the section's intended scope because the conditions that must be satisfied before the section would apply to a particular non-resident insurer will not be changed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. With the Committee's approval, it would be advisable to allow a wide debate rather than to take stand part separately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): On a point or order, Mr. Butterfill. Will you clarify whether there will be a separate debate on amendment No. 191?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can confirm that there will be a separate debate on amendent No. 191.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I would like to move the amendments that are tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was about to make a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No, Mr. Butterfill, I should like to speak to amendments Nos. 71 and 72.
<P>
There is some disquiet in industry about the clause. The chartered Institute of Taxation, for example, has pointed out that the clause contradicts clause 15, which we debated earlier in respect of air passenger duty. Clause 15 will relax some of the measures that apply to fiscal representatives of air passenger duty. However, the burdens that have been relaxed in clause 15 are being imposed on insurance company business. The Association of International Life Offices in correspondence with the Financial Secretary said that the provision is discriminatory, excessive and represents a barrier to the provision of insurance services in the United kingdom. It also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The proposed measures cannot be a reasonable and proportionate way of protecting the Exchequer,"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the clause is unreasonable and disproportionate.
<P>
The three amendments tabled by myself and my hon. Friends would mitigate some of the burden that the measure imposes on industry. Amendment No. 70 would add the requirement that the policy-holder was a United Kingdom resident when the policy was taken out. That would tackle the most difficult aspect of the clause the requirement that a non-UK life insurance company which sells a policy abroad to a non-UK resident is expected to report the occurrence of a chargeable event to the Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom if the policy-holder subsequently becomes a UK resident. How can the insurer be expected to know that? The amendment would impose the requirement only when a non-UK life insurance company sold the policy to someone who was a UK resident when the[Mr. Gibb]
policy was taken out rather than when the policy matures and a chargeable event occurs.
<P>
If the Government will not accept the amendment, how do they expect an overseas insurer to track the residence of all their policy-holders all over the world who may decide to retire to Bognor Regis? They are welcome to retire to Bognor Regis because it is a pleasant place to which to retire, but it would be difficult for a Tokyo life insurance company in Tokyo to track all the non-residents to whom they sell policies and who live all over the world. The provision is unenforceable and, therefore, bad law.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 would replace the words "fixed place of residence" in new section 552A(7)(a) with the words "fixed place of business". We tabled the amendment because there is no concept in English law of "fixed place of residence". It is likely that the tax representative will be someone in the United Kingdom who has a business in the United Kingdom. It is unlikely that my mother would be asked to be the representative of an overseas life insurance company.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie </B>(Kirkcaldy): that is a relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We shall come to that in a minute. However, it is more likely that a business person in the United Kingdom would be asked to be the representative. So why cannot the phrase, "place of business" be used with the accompanying definitions that have been established in case law and practice?
<P>
If the Government cannot accept the amendment, will the Minister answer the following questions, which were also raised by the Law Society? First, what does "fixed place of residence" mean? It is a brand new phrase in English law. Secondly, why is a new form of words being employed when perfectly acceptable phrases such as "fixed place of business" could be used instead? Thirdly, is the phrase employed elsewhere in United Kingdom legislation?
<P>
Amendment No. 72 would introduce an element of sense into the clause, which in new section 552A(9(g) provides the Inland Revenue with the power to make regulations more regulations to appoint someone as the tax representative of an overseas insurer. The Revenue could introduce regulations and pick someone from the street. Even you, Mr. Butterfill, could be appointed to be the representative of the Timbuktu life insurance company. It would be sensible to change the wording so that the representative, at the very least, is able to consent to the appointment. Would it not be better if that person had some business connection with the overseas insurer? That should be clear in primary legislation and not left to the Inland Revenue to introduce in secondary legislation.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept not only amendment No. 72, but amendments Nos. 70 and 71.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells):</B> In addition to my hon. Friends detailed points about the practicality of the clause, I have a more general question about its compatibility with article 59 of the treaty of Rome. I raised this matter in a point of order last week on the grounds that it would be wrong for the Committee to proceed with a clause in the knowledge that it was unenforceable and possibly unlawful. If there is a conflict with the treaty of Rome, which is, of course, superior to any national law, the matter will be subject to judicial review. It would not be right for the Committee to collude in legislation knowing that the conflict exists and that a counsel's opinion has concluded that it would fall and be unenforceable.
<P>
Article 59 provides for fundamental freedoms, including the freedom to provide cross-border services. It prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality and extends to measures that may not be obviously discriminatory but which result in an unnecessary burden or restriction on the cross-border provision of services. The clause puts obligations on non-resident insurance companies but not on United Kingdom insurance companies. Those obligations are onerous and expensive. Foreign insurance companies will have to keep detailed records and report accordingly. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) drew attention to the practical difficulties that will arise if the clause is implemented.
<P>
Article 59 of the treaty of Rome has direct effect. It does not come into force just because UK legislation is in place and it does not require a member state to do something. It has direct applicability and gives rise to rights and obligations. Those affected by the legislation can appeal ultimately to the European Court of Justice on the grounds that their rights have been infringed. It is easy to see that a foreign insurance company will regard the clause as conflicting with the rights that it enjoys under treaty law, which ranks above primary legislation passed by this House or any other national Parliament.
<P>
The Paymaster General should respond to that serious concern. The amendment does not deal with the issue. All that the Government amendment does is to define better what a non-resident insurer is. It merely provides a different definition. Although I do not want to inhibit my hon. Friends from raising other detailed concerns, especially those relating to the terms of the amendment, I believe that my essential point requires an early response from the Paymaster General.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn (Guildford):</B> I am sorry that the Paymaster General has not risen immediately to answer my right hon. Friend's important point because he must have expected that issue to be raised. However, perhaps if we speak about our wider concerns, it will give the Paymaster General chance to answer that vital point.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has already said, clause 85 could not provide a better example of the way in which power has gone to the Government's head. It shows their imperial ambition to impose tax law on every insurance company in the world. They started off by trying to target those insurance companies that are involved in the insurance business in this country, but then realised that there was a conundrum in the clause's original wording. They have now made its scope so wide that it is unenforceable.
<P>
Speaking now to amendment No. 72, it is especially worrying that the clause would give the board the power to go after individuals in this country whom it suspects are involved in tax avoidance. If the board were to decide that an insurance company was surreptitiously carrying on business and had not appointed an agent so as to become liable for tax on that business, the clause would enable the Revenue to appoint anyone as the nominated agent of that insurer. That is why amendment No. 72 says that the person who is appointed must have, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a substantial business connection with the overseas insurer".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Without proof of that, there is a danger that the board could decide to nominate someone without any evidence that it was the right person. I look forward to hearing the Paymaster General's comments on that.
<P>
Given the scope of clause 85, there is a wider point. If it is deemed acceptable by the Government that the board should have powers to appoint an agent in order to prevent tax avoidance in relation to non-resident insurance policies, why have the Government not adopted the same principle in respect of non-resident trusts? The rules that they have introduced for non-resident trusts do not go that far. If the Government were to adopt the same principle for trusts, the board would be able to nominate an agent in respect of the liabilities and procedures of any overseas trust that had a connection with someone in this country. Why do the Government favour one regime for non-resident insurance policies and another for non-resident trusts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) has made an important point; the Government seem to want to extend the scope of UK tax law potentially to cover all insurance companies in the world. It might be worth reflecting on the problem, which the UK and all countries will face as a result of the globalisation of commerce, of the trading of goods and services through new media, such as the internet. It seems indicative of the knee-jerk reaction that one can expect to the revenue loss that may arise as goods and services are increasingly traded directly to individuals worldwide through new media.
<P>
The first instinct will be to try to spread the net so that it catches such transactions wherever in the world they are set up, and however they are done. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton pointed out that widening the net would create unenforceable laws. Presumably, after a period during which the United Kingdom and other countries in the western world will seek to protect their revenue bases in that way Governments will realise that the procedure is ultimately futile. The British Government and the Governments of other advanced western countries will have to consider other ways of protecting the revenue base against the effects of the increasing globalisation of commerce and of trades in services.
<P>
I hope that the Paymaster General will at least acknowledge that there is an issue there. Some weeks ago in a European Standing Committee I had an interesting exchange on that theme with the Economic Secretary, who recognised the issue and accepted that it would be a challenge for all Governments. The challenge may occur at a fairly banal level, in that people can order things via the internet for direct delivery to their door from companies in to cite a current example the Channel islands, or it may occur at a more exalted level, in that insurance policies might be sold via similar media. An important issue is involved, and the knee-jerk reaction of saying, "Expand the law to cover everyone in the world," is not, as my hon. Friends have said, a plausible response in the long run.
<P>
I have two questions for the Paymaster General. The first is about his reply to the questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked about the peculiar new phrase, "a fixed place of residence", which is contained in the clause. Are the Government seeking to introduce a new concept in tax law? If so, how does that phrase interface with the well-known phrase, "resident and ordinarily resident"? Is being resident in a fixed place different from being resident and from being ordinarily resident?
<P>
Secondly, will the fiscal representatives who will be appointed under the clause be liable for payments of tax and for supplying the information that is required by law to the Inland Revenue? I understand the analogy that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made with clause 15, in which the Government introduced the idea of fiscal representatives who are not personally liable for the payment of tax. Neither the Bill nor the explanatory notes make it clear whether the representatives who will be appointed under clause 85 will be liable for that tax.
<P>
Mr. Butterfill, you said that there would be a separate debate on amendment No. 191, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) has already entered into that territory. Is it convenient to continue that discussion? I suspect not, so I shall resume my seat and look forward to making my points about that amendment later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> When we come to amendment No. 191, we shall debate the matters that have already been raised in that context.
<P>
I shall deal with the precise points that the Opposition raised about the amendments. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton compared the clause with clause 15, which deals with airline passenger duty. I must say that we are dealing with insurance companies, not with airlines, and that there is at least a measure of difference between the two. It is more appropriate to compare the clause with the insurance premium tax provisions, and it is an established fact that non-UK insurers who are liable to IPT have not generally experienced the same difficulties as overseas airlines in finding persons to act as their representatives. We are seeking to find suitable people whom we or the Inland Revenue can appoint. We do not expect insurers affected by the clause to have any particular difficulties. It was a good attempt and a fair try, but not a good analogy.
<P>
On the question of place of residence without getting into the ordinary residential definition that the Inland Revenue applies for tax purposes we accept that insurers can be expected to act only on information in their possession. That is the wider point. As long as the insurer Acts on the basis of that information, it and its representatives will be treated as complying with their legal obligations. I know that that does not relate to the hon. Gentleman's immediate point, but it relates to[Mr. Geoffrey Robinson]
the third point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. We do not expect people to be omniscient; we expect people to behave in accordance with the tax laws. If they do so to the best of their ability and knowledge, we have no quarrel with them.
<P>
As for the place of residence, we need to know it so that we can serve notice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am addressing the point that the hon. Gentleman raised. An individual representative needs a UK address as a fixed place of residence. Such requirements are necessary to ensure that the representative whether an individual or a company has a UK address to which documents can be served. It is as simple as that. If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene now, I shall willingly give him my attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster quickly ran through the concept of "best of knowledge and ability". I think that he said that a tax representative would be regarded as having complied with his obligations if he had disclosed information to the best of his knowledge and ability. Is he saying that a tax representative appointed by a foreign insurer, who is not fully informed by his appointing insurer, has none the less discharged his responsibilities and cannot be held liable by the Revenue if there is any shortfall in the information that he has disclosed as a result of non-disclosure to him by his principal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I do not want to get into the precise nature of that relationship or the indemnities that might apply they may exist, but I do not know. The essential point is whether insurers will be liable for tax as a result of clause 85. They will not; it is not their job to pay the tax. The all-enclosing relationship that Opposition Members seek to portray does not exist.
<P>
I have seen some of the consultative documents issued by the Conservative Government. One such document published in November 1996 before the Conservatives were kicked out in 1997 followed consultation that aimed to ensure that non-residents who returned to this country, or overseas companies that sold life insurance policies to residents, paid the appropriate tax on redemption and when the chargeable gain arose. That seems perfectly fair and reasonable and in the interests of everyone in the country. Although I have not read the whole consultation document on the idea of having tax representatives, I am told that precisely that recommendation was made. Fortunately, the Conservative party had no further responsibility for such matters thereafter, but the recommendation found favour with us.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This is a small point, which I hope will be helpful to the Paymaster General. I believe that he said that the insurer would not be responsible for the payment of the tax. I think that he meant to say that the tax representative would not be responsible for the payment of tax. Will he confirm that for the record?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think I could say both. The tax representative exists only as the insurer. We want companies to comply. We may even introduce limited sanctions to ensure that that happens. The spirit behind the clause is that of encouraging best pracice, honesty and openness in this sector. This is clearly a booming industry about £1.75 billion of life insurance premiums are paid abroad every year. It is proper that when in government the Opposition highlighted and consulted on the problem. However, as they are now deprived of the fruits of office, they are unable to do anything about it. I shall not go into the previous Government's record of whether they did anything about anything, but the consultation documents were clear. I believe that we have acted properly.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells raised the European aspect. I fear that we will return to that later, so I shall not go into great detail now. We do not believe that the clause is contrary to European law. Insurers based in member states with professional secrecy laws would have a problem. We will take steps in the regulations to deal with those problems. However, we will discuss that later when we reach amendment No. 191.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Other non-UK insurers remain free to do business in the UK on a services basis, but they are under the same obligations as UK insurers to report the gains of their UK policy holders to the Inland Revenue. It is as simple as that. We want all insurers to comply with that obligation. The requirement for certain non-UK insurers to have a representative reflects the fact that the Inland Revenue needs to have in place effective arrangements to ensure that both UK and foreign insurers comply with UK rules. I think that that deals with the specific issues raised by the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I raised two specific points with the Paymaster General. Let me explain them in more detail. First, on page 69 of the Bill, new section 552A(6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the overseas insurer must nominate to the Board a person to be his tax representative."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No test is required to show that that person has a connection with the insurer. Subsection (9)(a) states that the board must provide through regulations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the making of a nomination by an overseas insurer of a person to be his tax representative".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, nothing spells out that there should be, or is going to be, a business connection between that individual and the insurer. It is conceivable and, I would argue, almost unconstitutional that an individual may be nominated by an overseas insurer not in a serious and diligent way but in a rather casual way. The board, for its own reasons, could decide that that individual would serve its purpose very well as the resident representative.
<P>
There is a compelling argument in favour of amendment No. 72. The Bill should state that there must be a substantial business connection between the insurer and the individual. I should like the Paymaster General to explain why that connection is not included in the Bill.
<P>
My second point is that if it is correct to have a mechanism for non-resident insurance companies and their policies, why is it not correct to have a mechanism for non-resident trusts and their investments whre they have beneficiaries in this country? If there is a legal bar to the one, there must be a legal bar to the other; if there is no legal bar, the two areas must be treated consistently, given that this clause and later clauses deal with tax avoidance by those who are resident in this country but who put their assets overseas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Let me spell out clearly what will happen. The Inland Revenue will appoint a tax representative only when it has been established beyond doubt that the non-UK insurer does not intend to comply with the legislation. That is the first principle worth noting. The obligation on the insurer to appoint a representative would be without any effect if the Inland Revenue had to obtain the consent of the representative when it wished to appoint.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> What?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall repeat it, although the amendment is strange and not entirely understandable.
<P>
The obligation on the insurer to appoint a representative would be without any effect if the Inland Revenue had to obtain the consent of the representative when it wanted to appoint. In other words, the situation could arise in which no one agreed to be a representative, in which case the whole provision would become inoperable. I am surprised that no Opposition Member spoke to the amendment to make that point. Indeed, I thought that "agreed" was the key word and that the amendment was a wrecking amendment, which could make the whole clause and appointment inoperable.
<P>
The regulations will make it clear that the Inland Revenue would be able to appoint only a person who had a sufficiently close economic connection with the insurer to be able reasonably to obtain information about policy holders from the insurer. There will be time for consultation on the detail of the regulations before they become law. There is a strong commitment to consultation, and although we shall not reach that stage before next year, I cannot believe that the matter cannot be satisfactorily resolved, given good will on both sides.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am still waiting for the Paymaster General's prepared response to my other point, but on this point, will he please explain why this very important condition, which I am delighted to hear is promised at least in regulations, should not appear in the Bill? Without that protection, there is a problem and a potential threat to individuals in this country. Without that protection, they could be unfairly and injuriously taxed, under the Bill's provisions, by a Government who lack the beneficence and good intentions that are claimed by the Paymaster General for the Administration that he represents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am sure that that question will be discussed, negotiated and consulted on before the regulations are settled. I wish to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Revenue is approaching the matter in exactly the spirit that he would wish, and that we are sure that we shall reach an agreement that is in line with his wish to protect the interests of people who are taking on responsible positions in relation to the provision of information that they can reasonably be deemed to have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I can only imagine that there is a difference in understanding between us. The implication of what the Paymaster General says is that a person who is appointed as a tax representative will be someone who has a business connection with the insurer perhaps an agent or someone running a local office. Our concern is that an insurer who does not have any such connected person in the UK must have a tax representative.
<P>
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford is concerned that a firm of chartered accountants or solicitors might suddenly find itself appointed by the Inland Revenue to be the tax representative of a company for whom it may have acted and with which it has a professional relationship, but not a business connection. Can the Paymaster General reassure us that the only person who will be appointed as tax representative is someone who has a substantive business connection with a company, not a professional person advising the insurer?
<P>
I do not believe that the Paymaster General has adequately explained the meaning of the term "fixed place of residence" or explained why amendment No. 71, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which substitutes the word "business" for the word "residence", is unacceptable. He seems to be saying that a person who is a tax representative needs to have an address for service in the United Kingdom. That is a very different matter, and the need for such an address could be included in the Bill. We have had no explanation of what a fixed place of residence is, and it is not clear why "a fixed place of business" is not a better phrase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> My general reaction to the amendment is that it is over-prescriptive. Why should the word "business" be used only in that limited sense? The implication, presumably, is that a self-employed business man is involved. The matter is open to negotiation and consultation, and we have a year in which to do that. Our phrase, which uses the word "residence", leaves the matter open.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was unfortunately deprecatory about his mother. We do not want to say who the person should or should not be that should be worked out in the normal way through co-operative consultation. There is little point in the amendment, which the hon. Gentleman would realise if he studied it more closely.
<P>
The provisions in clause 85 deal with the supply of third party information. That relates to non-resident trusts and to non-resident insurers, which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton discussed. The clause is intended to get non-UK insurers to provide information.
<P>
The provisions in clause 84 seek to establish the charges to tax and who is taxable, which are completely different matters involving totally different provisions. If the hon. Gentleman reflects on the matter for a moment, he will appreciate the difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am astonished by this exchange, which leaves me more concerned about the matter than I was previously. I thought that the Government wanted to seek the consent of the person who will be appointed as the tax representative, but we have just heard that the Government do not necessarily want to obtain the tax representative's consent. That is where my mother comes in and I do not deprecate her: she would make a very good tax representative. However, I would like her to consent to the appointment, which should not be imposed on her by the Government. One cannot consult on that matter, because it is part of the Bill; it is not contained in draft regulations, which we have not seen anyway. Once the proposal has passed through the Committee and the House, it will be the law and beyond the scope of consultation.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General say who the Government are likely to appoint as tax representatives without seeking their consent?

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There is a danger of getting into semantics over the question of consent.
<P>
We cannot accept the amendment because if a company could not appoint someone, it would have an easy way of getting out of compliance with that aspect of tax law. That is why we cannot accept the Opposition amendments, although the Opposition may not have understood that point. Moreover, that decision should be taken by the companies that want to do business. The sector is growing rapidly £1.75 billion a year in premium is involved. Major companies are involved, and it is up to them to come forward with the right sort of people, who will agree to do the work. That is an essential condition for a company to continue to sell products such as insurance to residents of this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am concerned on behalf of firms of accountants in my constituency, which may have previously given advice to insurance companies that are based overseas and had some kind of relationship with them. A policy holder of that insurance company might land up as a resident in this country, and the company would have to abide by the clause and nominate a person to be its tax representative. Without thinking about the matter, it might nominate the firm of accountants in my constituency as its tax representative, although that firm might have no desire to take on that role. It might have advised the company on a completely different issue previously and it might feel that it had been plucked out of the blue.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General give an assurance that professional firms in this country will not be obliged to take on that role unless they have given their consent? It would not be sufficient for the overseas insurer to have nominated them or to have had some connection in the past; the connection will have to have been a substantial business connection. If the Paymaster General can give that assurance, what objection does he have to putting it in the Bill?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> It is not necessary to put that assurance in the Bill if it will be in regulations. Many matters will be dealt with in regulations and I stated clearly that they will be subject to a long period of consultation. Opposition Members are trying to make a point out of nothing. In my long experience of dealing with professional organisations, I have never found them unwilling to undertake any operation that earns a good turn and complies with British law.
<P>
If we were to state in the Bill that the representative could simply refuse and we had no further powers, the whole point of this part of the Bill would become inoperable. I am sure that the hon. Member for Guildford can see that. If we can deal with the real world in which honest, law-abiding citizens are anxious to work together to make the law of the country operable and effective, there will be no problem. The hon. Gentleman has every assurance he needs if he is serious about the matter, as I think he is, and there will be a substantial period of consultation before the regulations become effective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We have made some serious points which are now on the record. We are not satisfied with the Paymaster General's response, but in view of the time, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> In fact, the hon. Gentleman's amendments have not been moved, although they have been spoken to, so it is not necessary for them to be withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 191, in page 68, line 16, leave out "United Kingdom" and insert "European Union".
<P>
We have already had a canter round the amendment during discussion of a previous composite amendment and clause stand part debate. The purpose of the amendment is to probe the extent to which the Government have researched the concerns that have been expressed by the AILO, supported by eminent counsel's opinion, that the requirements of the clause, insofar as they discriminate between United Kingdom resident insurers and insurers elsewhere in the European Union, conflicts with European Union law.
<P>
The Financial Secretary has had some correspondence with the AILO, but sadly had to inform it that heavy diary commitments prevented her from attending a meeting with it. She has had the benefit, as has the Inland Revenue, of a copy of counsels' opinion. The Opposition have also seen that opinion, which appears to be categoric in its view that an appeal to the European Court against the enforceability of the clause would succeed. We must assume that the Government have obtained their own opinion from yet more eminent counsel which suggests that the case is otherwise. I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would tell us what steps the Government have taken to assure themselves and, in turn, the Committee that the clause would be effective and not subject to a successful challenge in the European Court.
<P>
The amendment proposes a way out of the problem that has been identified by substituting "European Union" for "United Kingdom". As the Paymaster General knows, Opposition Members are always anxious to encourage constructive aspects of the European Union, such as the creation of a single market for goods and services. The United Kingdom might be expected to benefit significantly from the creation and development of a single market for insurance in particular. It therefore seems strange that the Government should introduce legislation that seeks to discriminate between insurers based in the UK and those based elsewhere in EU.
<P>
Can the Paymaster General tell us whether there is evidence of revenue loss as a result of business being written by insurers based in the EU rather than outside it? We can all envisage cases where policies might be written by insurers based in tax havens beyond the EU. Does he have any hard evidence to suggest that insurers based in France, Germany or Luxembourg are involved in practices that result in a significant loss of revenue to the UK Treasury? Has he considered the possibility that a tax representative might be based in the EU rather than the UK? Are the Government sufficiently confident about our EU partners' judicial processes to feel that a tax representative based in France or Germany might be adequate for their purposes?
<P>
We seek reassurance that the Government have been fully and properly advised, and that they have taken into account counsel's opinion, which the AILO has taken the trouble to obtain and to provide. The Government must realise that provisions that discriminate between UK and other EU insurers will inevitably lead to conflict with our EU partners in a field where the UK would normally expect to benefit by smooth relationships and the gradual improvement of the single market's operation, whether or not such provisions are successfully challenged in the European Court. Such conflict is not in the best interests of the UK and its insurance industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall take up two specific points that the hon. Gentleman made when moving the amendment.
<P>
The clause does not discriminate between UK and non-resident insurers, who are equally obliged to provide the same information. Although such assessments are difficult to make in advance, significant costs will be incurred. At the current rate at which business is growing, costs could run to tens of millions of pounds by 2000, and could reach £100 million per year by 2001.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Are the Paymaster General's figures an estimate of the loss from EU-based insurers or from all overseas insurers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think that the figure is an estimate of the loss from EU-based insurers. Clearly, it is a significant and growing factor, which the previous Government examined. It had to be tackled and the Government are finding a way to do so.
<P>
In the light of comments made by the right hon. Member for Wells, I shall make clear to the Committee the legal position with regard to the clause and in particular with regard to the view one might take of amendment No. 191.
<P>
The clause is part of the Government's response to tax avoidance and tax evasion. It imposes an obligation on certain non-UK life insurers to have a representative who is based in the UK. The measure affects life insurers that are not resident in the UK but which have a significant amount of business with persons resident here, other than through a UK branch or agency. This is commonly called services basis business. It will be well known to some Opposition Members.
<P>
The representative of the insurer will be responsible for providing the Inland Revenue with information about the gains policyholders make on their policies. The insurers themselves are already under an obligation to provide this information in relation to UK policyholders in the same way that UK-based insurers do. In the main, however, they do not comply. In 1996, the Inland Revenue invited many of them to mend their ways but they failed to do so. That was around the time of the consultation process. It came up with the idea of a tax representative which, I think, found favour with the previous Administration.
<P>
The amount of insurance that UK residents are purchasing overseas is increasing all the time and so is the amount of tax at risk. The latest available estimate is that at least £1.75 billion was paid in life assurance premiums to non-resident insurers in 1996. That came largely from European Union sources. The Inland Revenue believes that only a small minority of insurance gains from overseas policies are included on the tax returns of policyholders. Some policyholders may not realise that they need to report the gain. Others choose an insurer outside the UK precisely because they wish to keep concealed from the Revenue not only the gain on the policy but also the existence of the funds used to pay the premiums. This measure therefore addresses a significant problem.
<P>
Not surprisingly, some life insurers affected by the clause are opposing it. However, we think it is only right that non-UK insurers should comply with our legal provisions if they want to provide insurance on a service basis. We consider that the requirement for a non-UK insurer to have a UK-based representative is an effective and appropriate way of ensuring that the insurer does comply. However, we will include in the regulations an exception where it would be necessary for a company to break applicable existing secrecy legislation of a member state in order to meet our information requirements. That is within the power provided in new section 552A(9)(j). We will, as is our practice, consult widely on the regulations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> There are two points to consider. The last point made by the Paymaster General is potentially important. If I understand him correctly, he is saying that where an insurer is based in a country with secrecy laws that would make the provision of the information illegal in that country, that insurer will not be expected to provide the information. I am not an expert but, broadly translated, to do the terrible things mentioned by the Paymaster General, one simply goes to a Luxembourg or Swiss life insurance company. If that is the case, what is the point of the clause? Clearly people whose intent is malevolent will have an easy route out of the Government's net. How will the Paymaster General protect the revenue by doing that?
<P>
I accept that the Paymaster General has made a moral and practical case, but he has not addressed the problem of the legal opinion that has been delivered to the[Mr. Hammond]
Government by AILO. Does the Treasury have counsel's opinion of equivalent status that says the opposite of the counsel's opinion supplied to them and the Inland Revenue by AILO? If they do not, persisting with the clause when counsel's opinion is that it will be struck down in the European Court seems bizarre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes one valid point. There will be a tendency for business to move to more favourable countries. That is self-evident. On the other hand, there is also a tendency for greater openness and harmonised policies throughout the European Union. The trend in member states is to close down such arrangements. That is clear from recent statements of the competition commissioner and from other statements that have been made. It is in the UK's interests to seek to achieve evenness and openness. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, who apologises for being absent today owing to having to attend a meeting of ECOFIN, will confirm that the European Union is of the same opinion.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Will the Paymaster General speak up a little? Hansard is experiencing occasional difficulty in hearing him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I apologise. I must address my remarks more to you, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
All the trends are in support of our view; if temporary exceptions have to be made, we must accept that. We should not, though, try to move from the general direction of policy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made a precise point about counsel's opinion. The line that we are taking under the clause is consistent with our approach internationally, especially in Europe. Our policy objective is to promote the exchange of information and to address obstacles posed by banking secrecy laws. As long as secrecy laws are in place, we have no choice but to operate within the existing framework while pursuing our long-term policy objectives.
<P>
Ensuring that insurance companies are not prohibited from providing services in the UK by exempting them from the requirement to appoint a tax representative in the UK recognises the fact that, legally, we cannot override the legislation of another member state. That does not mean that we condone secrecy, we recognise that promoting exchange of information on the international stage raises some extremely difficult issues for states, which we cannot eliminate overnight or on our own.
<P>
We actively support the exchange of information, but this is a long-term goal. In Europe, we must approach these issues within the constraints of the single market and the EC treaty. That does not mean that we cannot and should not pursue the exchange of information particularly in the insurance sector with our European partners. As such, this measure is an interim approach that recognises the existing legal position while we pursue our wider policy objectives.
<P>
Our approach under the clause is not inconsistent with the code of conduct, which aims to eliminate harmful business tax measures. Professional secrecy laws therefore fall outside the terms of the code. Mitigating the likelihood of a legal challenge to the tax representatives legislation makes sense and does not undermine our wider policy objective of promoting exchange of information in principle. This is a very sensitive and complex issue. I hope that my explanation assists hon. Members.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made a related point about counsel's opinion. We could increase the public sector borrowing requirement by £100 million a year if we took counsel's opinion on everything deemed remotely appropriate. Our legal advisers have carefully considered the opinion that the AILO has provided, so we do not feel that we have to consult counsel at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for his efforts to defend the clause, but he has not answered the full charge that we made. He gave us all sorts of reasons why the Inland Revenue wants more information about British taxpayers. The executive arm of any constitution always wants more information on taxpayers and others there is nothing new in that. At issue is whether the powers are practical and enforceable and whether they conflict with treaty obligations. I instanced counsel's opinion, which has been sent to me and other members of the Committee by Ernst and Young. It clearly and unambiguously concludes that the Bill conflicts with article 59 of the treaty. The Paymaster General tells us that he has been given a different legal opinion, which is that that is not so. I think that he owes us further explanation as to why counsel's opinion, which I briefly summarised, is incorrect. It might also help the Committee if he were to publish his counsel's opinion, which would be in accordance with the general principle of open government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My right hon. Friend refers to counsel's opinion obtained by the Treasury. I think that the Paymaster General said that, to save money, he had not sought counsel's opinion. Does my right hon. Friend agree that, if the failure to obtain counsel's opinion means the Government will go to the European Court to defend the clause, it will be a case of saving the pennies and losing the pounds? Such a course will cost probably 100,000 times what counsel's opinion would cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The counsel's opinion that we have obtained is that the Government will be immediately vulnerable to judicial review and all that that implies. Ultimately, the matter could go all the way to the European Court of Justice. It would save everyone a great deal of time and expense if the contrary opinion, which purports to show that the position that I quoted is incorrect, was explained to us. Whether that opinion can be obtained from a Treasury-appointed QC or internal Treasury lawyers is of secondary importance; the opinion must be tested publicly. The Government's document, "Your Right to Know" a hilarious title in retrospect which contained a foreword by the Prime Minister, promised that all kinds of things that were previously secret would in future be known to the public. This matter is of clear public importance and relevance far beyond this Committee, and I would be grateful if the Paymaster General were to give a slightly fuller answer.
<P>
The opinion that we have been given is that the article ensuring the provision of cross-border services without hindrance can be breached in a number of cases. In other words, Governments will be able to provide justification for introducing measures that apparently breach article 59. A great deal of case law exists on the subject, and it is not clear from what the Paymaster General has said that his aim to raise more tax from UK taxpayers is legitimate. The counsel that I quoted gave a good example of a case in Luxembourg, in which the ruling went against the national Government on similar grounds.
<P>
The Paymaster General seemed to come close to saying that the treaty aim of ensuring adequate fiscal supervision could override the purported aims of article 59. That is not so. The primary obligation is not on the insuring company but on the policyholder to disclose his or her tax affairs. The Inland Revenue has awesome and practically dictatorial powers to ensure that such information is extracted. A provision also exists to allow the British Government to exchange information with overseas fiscal authorities. That is clean different from an obligation on all non-resident insurance companies to have a fiscal representative in this country, who would have to be paid and serviced in order to satisfy the Inland Revenue. That obligation will not be levied on resident insurance companies, and a difference in nationality is involved. Overwhelmingly, non-resident insurance companies will be foreign-owned they will be based, owned and registered in other member states. The Government should not try to argue that that is not discrimination on the grounds of residency or non-residency, and that does not wash at all. There is a clear breach of the treaty provision rather than a prima facie one, and my hon. Friends and I have elaborated on it. Will the Paymaster General say unambiguously whether and how the clause comes under the treaty's ambit? I must again ask him to put the matter beyond doubt by publishing the legal opinion that supports his case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> That is a very direct question. I shall have to revert to the matter if the right hon. Gentleman seriously wants us to publish the legal case. On balance, we probably would choose not to do so doing so would have many implications for government, not least the fact that we would have to reveal our hand in legal terms ahead of the necessity to do so.
<P>
I must inform the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) and the right hon. Friend the Member for Wells that our legal advice is that our proposals are not contrary to article 59 of the treaty of Rome. That is for the simple reason that they can be objectively justified on the basis of effective fiscal supervision, which is a ground of justification that the European Court of Justice recognises. I cannot put the matter more simply than that and I cannot, at this stage, promise to go into further detail even with your indulgence, Mr. Butterfill. I explained the legal opinion that we received if we had not received it we should not be proceeding in the way that we are. That is also the basis on which the previous Government consulted, and the direction that they intended to take.
<P>
We have had a thorough debate on the matter. The intent of the Government and of the Inland Revenue is beyond reproach. Our aim is to encourage and to obtain the co-operation of life insurance companies that are non-resident in the UK but which have relevant information relating to residents in the UK. Our taxation arrangements are fair. People may not realise that the gains that result from, for example, the maturation of a life insurance policy that they took out some years previously when they were not resident in this country should be declared. It is therefore reasonable to ask our partners to co-operate with the Inland Revenue. That is not a draconian addition to its perfectly normal supervisory and tax-collecting powers and, as I said, the Opposition intended to take that step when they were in government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I appreciate the Paymaster General's words, and I am glad that he accepts that there is a case for publishing the legal opinion. I, too, appreciate the constraints under which he operates, and his approach is reasonable. However, I have a modest request to make of him: could he cause to be written a response to the counsel's opinion of which he has a copy and from which I quoted, and could he ensure that he answers its main points? Otherwise, it might seem to the Committee and to outside observers that that opinion holds the day. Despite his assurances, he has not mounted a specific or lengthy demolition of counsel's opinion, although this Committee may not be the right forum in which to do so. If he wants to respond in writing that would be acceptable and we should not in that case press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I support my right hon. Friend. It seems that the Paymaster General is relying on the provisions of article 89 that allow measures where they are necessary for effective fiscal supervision. I am not a lawyer, but his proposal to exclude policies written in countries where secrecy laws are in force drives a coach and horses through the argument that the clause is necessary for effective fiscal supervision. The Government are proposing to build their own loophole into the clause. When the AILO stated that it would send counsel's opinion to the Inland Revenue, the Financial Secretary wrote to the AILO to say that that would be most welcome and that Inland Revenue officials would study the matter carefully.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Members are unaware of any further response from the Inland Revenue or Financial Secretary. The association obtained counsel's opinion at its own expense I assume that it has fewer resources at its disposal than Her Majesty's Government, and the Paymaster General acknowledged that obtaining counsel's opinion is expensive but I should have thought that the Government would have the courtesy to let the association know what Inland Revenue officials made of the opinion and to advance any counter arguments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge wish to press the amendment to a Division?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has made it clear that we want the Paymaster General to explain whether he will publish the information for which my right hon. Friend asked. If the Paymaster General can assure us that he will do so, within the constraints that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells acknowledged, I shall be more than happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I would never suggest that as decent and honourable a man as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was being mischievous, but he cannot seriously be proposing that the Government should publish their opinion in detail and before a challenge is mounted against it. There is a good measure of agreement about the clause and Revenue officials have held detailed discussions with the AILO; they are well briefed on the strength of the Government's case. I hope that hon. Members will accept that I am not in a position to undertake to publish the Government's opinion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That is a retreat from what I took to be the Paymaster General's initial offer. The Committee's job is to try to extract answers from the Government. The Paymaster General could answer, at length, the points that we have made. If he cannot do so, we are willing to accept a written submission or letter, but it is not sufficient to say that any defence of the clause would provide ammunition to those who may mount a legal challenge. If the Government have a good response to such a challenge, they should give it to the Committee.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge may like to reconsider his generous offer not to divide the Committee because I believe that, in the absence of an argued defence from the Paymaster General, we should mark our concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My suggestion that the amendment might be withdrawn was predicted on my belief that the Paymaster General would respond positively to the suggestions of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. Having reflected on my right hon. Friend's comments, I shall press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 198, in page 72, line 2, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2) After section 553A of the Taxes Act 1988 there shall be inserted

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 199 and 200.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Clause 86 ensures that there will be a proper tax charge if someone takes out an overseas life policy when outside the United Kingdom and then becomes resident in the United Kingdom. The amendment extends that charge to capital redemption policies.
<P>
The clause corrects an anomaly. It covers overseas life assurance business OLAB which, broadly, is business written by United Kingdom insurers with foreign policy holders. In 1995 the previous Government consulted the industry on proposed regulations for OLAB and agreed that an OLAB policy should, under the regulations that were introduced in late 1995, generally continue to benefit from tax-free growth in the hands of the insurance company, even if the policy holder came to live in the United Kingdom. That was a sensible enough decision, but it created the anomaly that we are trying to deal with now. There is no tax on the investment return accruing from the benefit of any OLAB policyholder, but the policyholder tax rules treat the individual as if tax had been paid on the investment return and given inappropriate credit at the basic tax rate. Clause 86 remedies that defect, and gains will be taxed in future at the individual's marginal rate, which is entirely correct and proper.
<P>
The normal rules for foreign policies will apply to any gains that arise on those policies, so the gain will be reduced to reflect the time that the individual spent abroad that is a pro rata temporis alleviation, which seems to be perfectly fair.
<P>
Returning to the amendment, I should explain that the Finance Act 1996 authorised the Treasury to make regulations to extend the rules for taxing life assurance business to capital redemption business, and the Inland Revenue has had discussions with the insurance industry about the fact that such regulations could be introduced for accounting periods within the new self-assessment regime for companies.
<P>
As a result, we know that the industry would like the regulations to allow capital redemption policies issued to non-residents to be brought within overseas life assurance business. That is a good example of the benefits that can flow from the use of secondary legislation, but if we were to do what the industry would like, income and gains arising for the benefit of relevant policyholders would not be included in the profits on which the life assurance company paid tax. That would create the same problem regarding policyholders who move to the UK with life insurance policies, and it would require the same solution. That is what the amendment aims to achieve.
<P>
An extention of the rules for taxing life assurance business to capital redemption business, especially the ability to write policies that qualify as overseas life assurance business, would be welcomed by the insurance industry. The amendment is a necessary precursor to that. We are also planning I am sure that this will be welcome news to the Committee to relax some of the regulatory requirements for overseas life assurance business, so that the total package of measures will greatly help those companies who are seeking to increase their overseas business. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Paymaster General is taking a risk in moving Government amendments at a time when their majority on the last vote sank to only four, but let me put his mind at rest by saying that we do not oppose the amendments. Indeed, we welcome them.
<P>
The inclusion of capital redemption insurance will be welcomed by the UK insurance industry. It is popular in other countries, particularly in France, and I think that UK insurers would wish to have the opportunity to sell that sort of policy within the OLAB framework. I shall make some more general points about the treatment of OLAB under the clause if I am fortunate enough to catch your eye during the stand part debate, Mr. Butterfill. However, for the moment, let me assure the Committee that we accept Government amendment No. 198 and the two consequential amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I am grateful for that response, which is the one that I expected. I am unsure how we shall vote on the amendments, if we shall vote at all, because I imagine that they are accepted by the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> It would not be right to allow the clause to become law without commenting on it more generally. The clause closes loopholes and prevents possible exploitation; we have no objection to that and support the Government's aim. However, it was always understood by the industry that measures to clamp down on possible exploitation should march hand in hand with measures to allow UK insurers to compete more fully in overseas markets. I would be grateful if the Paymaster General would respond here to a couple of points.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
First, OLABs, as they are rather inelegantly described, and which would probably sound better in the Latin to which the Paymaster General treated us a few moments ago, have to compete at a competitive disadvantage overseas. Overseas nationals wishing to do business of this kind have to sign various declarations. They have to declare that they are currently not resident in the United Kingdom and that the policies that they are taking out are compatible with our current tax rules. They also have to tell the insurer if circumstances change, such as if the policy becomes subject to a trust. Overseas nationals would therefore have to have quite an understanding of United Kingdom tax law, trust law and finance law generally which most would not. It would, therefore, make it less likely that this kind of business would be won by UK insurers.
<P>
Secondly, under the law as it now stands, UK insurers are unable to sell certain types of product in overseas markets or to sell those policies to certain types of companies. They cannot sell life policies if the purchaser wants to nominate any kind of benefit to a relative or to a godchild, for example. That again is a significant discrimination against UK insurers. We need to see whether the Government are prepared to consider changing that. They may not be prepared to do so straight away, but at the very least I do not see why death benefits should not be received by UK resident individuals.
<P>
I do not see why overseas companies should not be able to own OLAB policies and why, therefore, multinational companies based in the United Kingdom should not have OLAB business provided that they have overseas establishments. Those are the kind of reforms that should march hand in hand with the avoidance measures that are being proposed. As I understand it, before we recently and sadly lost office on a temporary basis, we were proposing a package that the industry wants.
<P>
If the Government are seeking consensus on this matter, which the Paymaster General would be wise to do as he is in a minority in the Committee at the moment and could be outvoted at any point, I hope that he will say that at a future stage, perhaps in next year's Finance Bill, if satisfactory talks are concluded with our own insurers there will be measures of this kind. If not,[Mr. Fallon]
those who are competing overseas for this kind of business will feel that the Government are not there to help them compete more fairly in overseas markets, but are simply in the business of closing down loophole after loophole. I hope that the Paymaster General will be able to report some progress on that front.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I want to back up the points made by my hon. Friend. It is worth pointing out that we have seen a whole range of measures which expatriates could read as a message that they are not welcome back home. We will debate another clause which we are concerned treats expatriates quite unfairly. No Conservative Member wants people to avoid or evade tax that they should pay. Inland Revenue press release No. 38 on 17 March said that the measures, along with three others, was expected to yield neglible income in 1998-99, £30 million in the following year, and £150 million in a full year. Will the Paymaster General explain how much of that saving will be due to the clause, and how much will be due to the other clauses that the press release mentions? That will show us which clauses are most important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall deal with the constructive remarks of the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon). We are working with the Association of British Insurers on the points that the hon. Gentleman made. The hon. Gentleman may have had an intimation of the fact that, as a result of the discussions, the Inland Revenue will write to the ABI in the next few days to give details of proposed changes that the Financial Secretary has approved to the relevant regulations. Draft amending regulations will be published for consultation later in the year. Some matters have already been discussed and agreed between the Inland Revenue and the ABI.
<P>
The most important change means that foreign policyholders will no longer have to provide individual certificates about the resident's position or undertake to notify their insurer if they move to the United Kingdom. I hope that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks agrees that those changes answer his first point, although they are not directly related to the subject that we are discussing. The changes are part of a package with clause 86. The hon. Gentleman made his remarks in that context. The new compliance rules will help the industry, while clause 86 will protect the Exchequer.
<P>
I hope that that will reassurer Conservative Members. Dealing with compliance matters and closing loopholes are proper functions of the Treasury and the Inland Revenue working together. We have made no secret of the need for that. However, we must also promote business opportunities and interests. Financial services constitute one of our most important business interests. Opening up the EU and removing restrictive practices for businesses as well as, for example, energy, must remain a high priority. Whenever we can securechanges to existing practices and legislation that are in the interests of British business and open competition, we shall do that. I shall be in the forefront of those pushing for that objective.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford asked whether the clause would make it more difficult for United Kingdom insurers to sell to expatriates. Under the clause, the tax treatment of a policy that an expatriate buys from a United Kingdom insurer outside the United Kingdom will be the same as that of a policy bought from a foreign insurer.
<P>
At present, the tax bill on a foreign policy can be higher or lower, depending on the personal circumstances of the policyholder. That is confusing and unfair. I am confident that United Kingdom insurers will have no difficulty in competing on an equal basis in the expatriate market.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Guildford will be as reassured as I am by that statement, and as confident in the ability our our businesses to seize and expand the opportunities that arise from opening up the EU. Whatever our views on the common currency or the EU, there is agreement throughout the House about the need to open the European market to proper, fair competition between companies and sectors.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford also asked about yield. There is currently a negative yield from OLAB. If we do not take action now, the loophole will be increasingly exploited, and a loss will occur. Action now will prevent that. The hon. Member for Guildford mentioned the figure of £35 million. Although we have not yet incurred the loss, if we do not act now the loophole will be exploited and the sums could be considerable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> What the Paymaster General says has been helpful. He has whetted the appetite of the industry. The notes on clause say that the removal of inappropriate credit would make it possible for the Revenue to relax further the compliance rules. The Paymaster General has encouraged the process.
<P>
I welcome what he said on the residents declaration. He did not, however, respond to specific points on prohibitions on nomination or the taking out of policies by companies. I assume that both those issues are being discussed with the industry. I hope that he will introduce further proposals through regulation or primary legislation in the not too distant future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Indeed. I would, however, add a word of caution. The process governing primary legislation is severely congested. It is in everyone's interest that we handle matters without it. I fear that we may be approaching a debate on regulations, so I shall not pursue that further.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 86, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
