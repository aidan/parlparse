the amendment and asking the Committee to consider the
issues that will occur as a consequence of the Bill and the
paper’s stated intention. I want to speak about the worries that
the amendment was originally designed to deal with and how I now see
the combination of the Green Paper and the Bill exacerbating those
worries.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000012">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Above all, the
amendment reflects something that many hon. Members share an interest
in, which is the future of young people not in education, employment or
training. Last month showed the highest number of unemployed young
people in this country since 1992. Clearly, a good education and
training system is critical to overcoming the problems that they will
face and ensuring that future generations will not face such problems
in
attainment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000013">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The hon. Lady mentioned the number
of young people not in education, employment or training. Is she aware
of the study that came forward at the weekend saying that comparisons
with the early ’90s were a little skewed in relation to the
proportion of those out of work, given the increase in the number of
those in education and higher education over the past 10
years?<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000014">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have also read that study. It notes the dramatic
increase in the number of young people going into education and
training, and the fact that the number of young people not in
education, training or employment remains fairly stable. That is an
interesting phenomenon and is exactly why I am worried about the
consequences of the combination of the Bill and the special educational
needs Green
Paper.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that we talk about NEETs. We understand that there is a
variation within that 10% of young people. There are three different
categories of young people: first, those on gap years or who are
volunteering. It is important for us to differentiate between those in
terms of their future opportunities, and other young people whom we
have concerns about. Secondly, there are those young people who have a
serious identifiable barrier to participation, such as the severely
disabled. They need help to overcome those barriers, which is entirely
possible with the right
help.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am particularly worried about the third category of young people whom
the Bill could create more problems for in the future. Those who have
no identifiable barrier to participation make up two thirds of NEETs.
Of that group, 85,000 are young men. A generation of young people are
not connecting with available education, employment or training offers.
We all recognise that getting that right has huge social benefits for
us all. For me, that group mirrors the number and nature of young
people who are excluded from the school
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000017">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I had the opportunity on Friday to visit one of
the training organisations in my constituency that deals with young
people beyond school age aged 17 and 18 who are not in
employment or training. We discussed issues to do with family structure
and the impact of being in households where no parent had ever worked.
Does the hon. Lady accept that that also is an issue to bear in mind as
we debate this part of the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000018">&#160;</a>

talking about this morning and who are at most risk of exclusion are
often those with a multiple range of needs and concerns. That is
precisely why I am so worried about the implications of the combination
of the special educational needs Green Paper and the Bill. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will let me progress, and I shall explain why I am
so concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000019">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Exclusion is a
tool that schools do not use lightly, but it is a tool that is being
used. We know that 6,500 pupils have been permanently excluded and more
than 300,000 young people have faced fixed-term exclusions from
secondary schools, 39,000 from primary schools and 15,000 from special
schools in the past year alone. It is important to unpick precisely who
those young people are. As I have already said, young men feature more
than young girls, although that is changing. The peak age is around 13
or 14, so we are dealing with young people who are making the
transition to adulthood. By that age, they are facing a number of
challenges, which may come from their home life, but may also come from
their
schooling.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000020">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am particularly concerned about the huge overlap between the group of
young people who are excluded and the group who have special
educational needs. Pupils with special educational needs are eight
times more likely to be excluded than children without special
educational needs. In the broader category of special educational
needs, not only those with statements but those with a school action
plus are 20 times more likely to receive a permanent exclusion from
school than those with no statement or no school action plus. It is a
very large group of young people. Their behaviour and experience in
school may have serious ramifications not only for their schooling but
for their future life chances as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000021">&#160;</a>

between the children who are excluded from school and the young people
with special educational needs. Indeed, the Department for
Education’s statistics confirm that the primary need of most
excluded children with special educational needs are of an emotional,
social and behavioural nature. They are the young people who are on the

with people who have a huge wealth of experience of the practical
realities of trying to work with young people. I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for setting out the point that I was about to make about the
interplay between ADHD, autism and mental health issues in young people
who are excluded as well as statemented and having school action plus
programmes. There are challenges in getting the support right. I do not
think anyone can argue that there is one programme that would work with
every single one of those young people. It is important to have the
ability to work with them in a number of different
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are variations in the ways that young people are supported and in the
level of support that they get: whether the intervention is early
enough to help head off some of the challenges, or when it come to a
point where they need a substantial amount of intervention, whether
that is done in the right way. For example, we know that many children
wait more than a year to access mental health services such as
counselling, which can have severe consequences on some of the
challenges that we are dealing with. Parents play a critical role in
trying to help such young people. As the Green Paper recognises, many
parents find it extremely difficult to find their way through the
system and to find the right support for their children. The Green
Paper admits that it can be inherently frustrating and confrontational.
It also
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000029">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
know that there is a group of children with SEN who are currently
excluded on multiple occasions on a fixed-term basis, and there may be
other excluded pupils whose SEN have not yet been identified. Incidents
which prompt multiple exclusions will often be an indication that a
pupil has underlying difficulties that may not have been correctly
identified or
met.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are dealing with a group of young people who need support to remain in
education, which, we know, makes a massive difference. Between half and
three quarters of children between the ages of four and 18 who are
excluded from schools have significant literacy and numeracy
difficulties. When they are excluded, such problems are compounded, so
their life chances are worsened as a result.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000030">&#160;</a>

see teenage boys, diagnosed ASD teenagers, being excluded on a monthly

fully support the school as it is essential to follow boundaries in
schools and not let students get away with appalling behaviour.
However, it’s very important to have a clear structured
procedure of what happens to these teenagers after they have been
excluded, and in my opinion this is where we fail them and our
community as some of them will, as you put it, fall through the
gaps.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000261">&#160;</a>

some passion. We share her sentiments and, certainly, her spirit. I
want to get to the bottom of the issue about exclusion, special needs
and the character of the particular need. I visited Gosberton House
school in my constituency, which I know you will be familiar with, Mr
Walker. I mention it because it particularly specialises in children
with autism. Are children with complex needs best educated in such a
special school? If so, are they less likely to be
excluded?<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000032">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister asks me to prejudge a group of young
people whom I have not met, so I could not make such an assessment. We
need a range of provision for young people, and in some instances
mainstream schooling can support those with special educational needs;
in others, we need specialist provision. The point is to provide
services that meet the needs of the young person and to have a process
by which such needs are identified early enough to make an appropriate
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We must also
have the opportunity for a range of provision. One of my concerns about
the Bill, and its combination with some of the proposals in the Green
Paper, is that the range of options will be reduced. The opportunity of
working with a young person to identify the support that they need will
be reduced rather than strengthened. I hope that Ministers will reflect
on some of the problems that they may inadvertently be creating through
the Bill for meeting the aspiration of having a system that identifies
early enough the appropriate intervention for young people with complex
needs, and emotional and behavioural
difficulties.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000034">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend the Minister made. In special schools in my constituency,
such as St John’s school and others, there is a view that there
has been a presumption about including children in mainstream schools
and not allowing parents the choice freely to say where their child
will go, with all the consequential impacts of that on local financing.
On the particular issue of exclusion, does the hon. Lady think that
such a presumption in favour of mainstreaming has partly caused the
increase in exclusions of children with special educational
needs?<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000035">&#160;</a>

issue is much more complex. One of the reasons why I tabled the
amendment, which is even more pertinent in the light of the Green
Paper, is that our ability to track such young people and understand
what is happening to them will be reduced by the lack of evidence that
we will gather and the lack of focus.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000036">&#160;</a>

correlation between the increase in the use of exclusion and the
increase in identifying special educational needs. We have to have a
more informed debate about the nature of special educational needs, and
how they will be affected by the Bill. I drafted the amendment
precisely to put those issues on the table. I am concerned that a
number of factors will create a

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Green Paper mentions the idea of reducing the number of young people
who have their special educational needs identified and are placed on
the register. That is an interesting proposal, but it raises several
questions about how we track young people who face being educated in
challenging circumstances, be that in the home environment or in the
school that they live in, and how we untangle such issues. We know that
the earlier intervention occurs and the earlier that a focus is made on
behaviour, the more cost-effective the support is for the public purse
and the more effective it is for the young person, which are two
honourable
aims.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
also know that the support secured outside the school environment, as
much as the support inside it, often makes the difference. That is why
I am extremely concerned—I will come on to this later—by
clause 30, which will unhook the relationship between the local
authority and schools at the point at which schools might wish to draw
on a wide range of support networks to deal with challenging behaviour
or issues about home life, which I know the hon. Gentleman is concerned
about, before they have to consider excluding a child. Although there
is an admirable ambition that every young person should receive the
support that they need at the appropriate point, the ability of schools
to plan for that will be reduced by the core proposals in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">More
specifically, the provisions in the clause on exclusions create an
incentive to exclude young people and to look at excluding them earlier
in the process. The fear that we might see an increase in exclusions is
founded on those provisions, because the Bill will create a financial
disincentive for schools to deal with complex needs, for which it can
be expensive to provide the desired care and support, and make them
more likely to exclude a child and give someone else that
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000040">&#160;</a>

if the relationship between a child and their school is turned into one
about finance alone, a series of perverse incentives is created. For
example, educating an excluded child at a pupil referral unit typically
costs an extra £15,000, and transfer to a specialist residential
units costs upwards of £50,000. For a school that manages its
budget, those considerations may well come into play, but all of us
would want the best provision for a young person to be the focus of

through as much as I would like to, and I hope we will have time to do
that in future. To pick up on an earlier point made by the hon. Lady,
creating a financial incentive on the school to look at and to manage
the cost of the excluded child puts a pressure, which does not exist
now, on the school to ensure that it has the most inclusive policies
possible and makes the necessary adjustments to reduce the number of
children who will ever need to be excluded. I accept the hon.
Lady’s argument that there are cases in which schools do not do
everything that they should, and children are excluded when they should
not
be.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000044">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman attempts to give a generous
interpretation of what might happen. The other scenario is that that
situation creates an incentive for schools not to take such young
people at all, and to operate a back-door selective policy about not
taking children coming from challenging backgrounds, who may have
behavioural problems that were identified at primary school level,
because of fears about the cost implications for its budget or about
future scenarios. The situation might be played in either way, which is
one of my
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000045">&#160;</a>

powerful and well-informed argument, but listening to her, I get the
impression that the current education system seems to have failed
children with SEN. She suggests that they are eight times more likely
to be excluded under the current system. Is the focus of the Bill not
to improve numeracy and literacy and provide such schools with the
behavioural strategies and abilities to work with those children? In my
experience, the many special schools in my constituency want children
to be able to go into mainstream education. We have a pre-school
nursery that tackles autism. I am trying to suggest that the current
system has failed children. The Green Paper and the Bill seem to have
recognised that and are trying to move on.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000047">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yet again, Government Members are confusing
correlations with causations. I do not accept that the current system
is failing young people with SEN, not least because it identifies those
young people. It can be argued that the way we support those children
and where those support mechanisms are put in place is too patchy. My
concern is that the Bill—if the hon. Gentleman shares a concern
about SEN, he might see these problems too—will make it harder
to get this stuff right, rather than making it easier for professionals
or parents. For example, the cuts to local authority services that we
are already seeing are putting at risk educational psychologists. Those
are key people who work with these young people. Making schools islands
will make it harder for each school to access the support networks that
will help young people make those
transitions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000048">&#160;</a>

authorities to help support a behaviour strategy across schools if it
is possible to move pupils around and to look at where support networks

also fear what will happen to children in free schools and academies. I
know that these are new models, but there are already concerns about
academies. It is clear that, where schools are one step removed from
that responsibility of dealing with the more difficult children who
need that extra support, in certain cases such schools have absented
themselves from that responsibility—be that in discouraging
children from applying to those schools in the first place, or in
challenging their ability to deal with the SEN of those children. I
have direct experience of that in my

                           </strong> It was interesting that in the evidence, the
representatives said that they had not gone through any tribunals. As I
said, I have a different experience. More fundamentally, people in the
SEN sector say that such parents are discouraged from applying to
academies on their children’s behalf. I was struck by what the
heads of academies said about the importance of schools being able to
join up their work. There is no incentive in the Bill to do that. If
anything, because of the way the budgets could work, as the hon. Member
for Beverley and Holderness said, there will be a disincentive, because
it will be about individual school budgets, rather than the care
package that may be put in place to support that young
person.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Barnardo’s
and the NASUWT have expressed concern about the inability to scrutinise
the panels that will take on exclusions and examine SEN. Surely, if
exclusion is the only option available to a school, it is all the more
necessary to ask, “Is this the right action for this young
person? What else can we do to support them?” We must not simply
pass children from pillar to post, or risk their falling through the
cracks and ending up outside of mainstream school provision. There
would be a cost in terms of their immediate education, but it would
also mean less opportunity for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would allow Parliament to deal directly with three issues,
the first of which is the huge overlap between exclusions and SEN,
which I have set out. The second is the lack of accountability
regarding children who have been excluded. Having recognised the
relationship between SEN, challenging behaviour and exclusions, we need
more ways of dealing with that early on, rather than leaving it to
schools or suggesting that it will be okay because the money will
follow the pupil, when in fact, what needs to follow the pupil is
care.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The third
issue is the variable quality of alternative provision. We all know
that more work needs to be done to make the right alternative provision
available to deal with these young people. Without such a report or
focus, the danger is that we ask local authorities to take such
responsibility—they will not have that authority under the
Bill—or we ask parents to do so. There is merit in saying that
we parliamentarians should support parents in using the report to
scrutinise and provide accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am concerned
that the Green Paper refers to reducing the number of children
identified as having special education needs, without specifying
whether the number of young people with emotional and behavioural
difficulties will decline. The Minister may suggest that Ofsted look at
that problem, and I take the point that it could do so on a one-off
basis, but because it has been around for a generation it requires more
persistent attention. The amendment seeks to find out what persistent
attention the Government will pay to young people who have emotional
and behavioural difficulties. Wishing that young people with emotional
and behavioural difficulties did not exist by not categorising them
will not make the problem go away or make their needs
disappear.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000056">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The point, which I do not think the hon. Lady is
wilfully misunderstanding, is that many children in school action or
school action plus are in those categories only because they have not
had their needs met at an earlier point. Had they been given
appropriate teaching and support, they would not have had to be put in
those categories. Many children are stigmatised by SEN and then
struggle because teachers have lower aspirations for them. They do not
need to be in those categories. What we must do is intervene early and
get it right first time. That is the Government’s aim in the
Green Paper, which is only a Green Paper. The aim is not artificially
to classify children in need into a category they do not need to be in,
and the hon. Lady should accept that. Whether we can deliver on this is
a different
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000057">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>Again, I think the hon. Gentleman has come
up with a series of non sequiturs. It is absolutely right that we
intervene early and give support as soon as possible to help young
people thrive in education. That, however, does not mean that they will
not need support at a later stage in their educational process, or that
we should be blind to that problem and to the fact that under the
proposals, schools will be more likely—not less—to use
exclusion to deal with children with emotional and behavioural
difficulties. The Green Paper may inadvertently encourage that and fail
to provide identified support to young people by ignoring the fact that
there is a series of behavioural difficulties that we need to deal
with.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
the question of whether schools will be able to access the support they
need to deal with those children in the way the hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness intends. If they do not have a relationship
with their local authority or local health care services, and they are
then expected to manage the problem on their own, they may not have the
experience or relationships to access support. At the moment, those
support networks are coming together, but all too often they are doing
so around local authorities, rather than as a national programme. My
amendment tries to get to the bottom of how we might secure that, and
of how, in this world of breaking up such relationships, that is likely
to happen. The biggest non sequitur involves the ambition set out in
the Green Paper—the joined-up service that parents will be able
to access—and an Education Bill that seeks to centralise
decision-making power in the hands of the Secretary of State or head
teachers, rather than building the partnerships to make that ambition
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000059">&#160;</a>

takes into account those factors and reveals the complicated debate
that lies beneath the tip of this iceberg. I know that many Government
Members are concerned about provision, but I hope they will accept that
Opposition Members have grave concerns about the Bill and the Green
Paper’s implications for a group of young people

and well-informed speech of the hon. Member for Walthamstow, despite
the fact that she attributed non sequiturs to me and then enunciated
none. I do not think there were any non sequiturs in my comments. It is
certainly not a non sequitur to say that if we intervene early and
address a child’s needs early on, we can eliminate the need to
categorise them as having special educational needs. The Select
Committee evidence shows that we can do that. There is no need to
categorise 21% of children as having special educational needs, and
that is not normally disputed. It is about getting it right first time,
so that SEN categorisation does not have to be sought in order to get
the teaching, support and curriculum provision we would expect in the
first place.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000061">&#160;</a>

not guilty of a non sequitur. I respect many of the hon. Lady’s
points. She is right to talk about the potential impact of the
Education Bill and the Green Paper’s implications for the most
vulnerable children in our system. With greater autonomy must come
greater transparency. My amendments seek to ensure that we have the
best possible visibility of what is going on in the system. If people
are given autonomy and trust, let us ensure that we can see clearly
what is happening. Let us see which children are being excluded. Such
information is important so that we can hold the system and individual
institutions to account.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000062">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will address
most of my remarks to new clause 2, which requires the Secretary of
State annually to collect and publish data from a representative sample
of schools on the number of serious incidents of misbehaviour in
schools, including those which do not result in fixed-term or permanent
exclusion. The new clause is not asking for a comprehensive collection
of data from every single institution in the land: it is saying that,
in the light of the findings of the Select Committee’s behaviour
and discipline inquiry, a sample should be taken. The Committee had a
difficult time in forming a view of standards of behaviour in our
schools, both currently and over time. It was hard to judge whether
behaviour had got worse or better—whether there is more or less
low-level antisocial behaviour now than there was, say, 10 or 20 years
ago. It is important to have some idea of standards of behaviour across
the school system as a whole—perhaps all the more so when we
recover greater autonomy and trust at the front line, rely more on the
frameworks we set up and hope that we have understood and thought
through any perverse incentives they may provide. We need to ensure
that we monitor what happens thereafter to check that it
works.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000063">&#160;</a>

feeling is that where such intervention takes place, we need to ensure
that we record it. The Government are rightly cautious, going one step
at a time, as one does with all regulation. Such regulations—be
they on health and safety or anything else—add up to an
oppressive burden on organisations, even though individually, they
always sound quite reasonable. I would be nervous about prescribing
precisely what each school must record about every incident, but I take
the hon. Gentleman’s point. As greater autonomy is enabled and
we try to stop the over-regulation—there has indeed been too
much prescription—we do not want to reach the point where there
is no transparency of performance. The balance must be right, and it is
that balance which we are considering.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000065">&#160;</a>

rely on schools’ existing records—whether they are
sufficiently consistent, and sufficiently available, to allow that
sampling exercise to provide the true picture—I am not sure.

if we raise the quality of teaching, we reduce the level of bad
behaviour. When that happens, children who are at risk of becoming
categorised as having SEN will not need to be so categorised. Their
skills will be raised to a sufficient level to enable them to engage
with their learning, so they will not display some of the behaviour

Some of the challenges that create a difficult learning environment for
young people are not in school. Some of the support that they need and
the difficulties that they face may beset their entire childhood and
early adulthood. Does he accept that we must be able to recognise such
difficulties and that there must be consistent support? That support
may need to be outside the school, whether it is provided through
social workers or through youth voluntary organisations. We must not
preclude the idea that we can fix a problem early on, but to get things
right, we might need to support the young person throughout their early
childhood and adulthood.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000085">&#160;</a>

use resources better and are better able to support

if a child continues to receive special educational needs support; it
is possibly a recognition of their condition. It can be a sign of
failure if that child would not have needed to have been so categorised

engage with the curriculum. The hon. Lady and I are not necessarily at

important to keep getting a picture of behaviour in the system, not
least because we are told time and again that many children who behave
badly do so because of the quality of teaching. Teaching that fails to
engage young people can lead to disengagement. If someone is already
struggling and is exposed to poor teaching over a sustained period,
often by secondary school they disengage entirely. When all the
teaching goes over a young person’s head and every day in school
is a reminder of failure and misery, it is hardly surprising that they
disengage, kick off and find themselves excluded. Early intervention is
the key, as is visibility within the system, which is the aim of my new

by my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool and me. I pay tribute to my
hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow and the hon. Member for Beverley
and Holderness for their very balanced and informed contributions. I
agree with a number of points made by the Chair of the Education
Committee. Good discipline and behaviour in school starts with
consistency, fairness and the application of clear rules. Good teaching
is an essential component of maintaining good behaviour and discipline
in schools. I would add supportive leadership to that, as would many of
the teachers’ representatives whom the hon. Gentleman quoted.
Clear, supportive instructional leadership in schools is a key
component, as is a relevant curriculum. The Education
Committee’s report noted the importance not only of good
teaching but of having a curriculum that is relevant and stimulating to
pupils. That is the recipe for getting the vast majority of pupils to
behave well in
school.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
philosophy has always been that the vast majority of school students
are professional pupils. They come along with quite a professional
attitude to school. As long as the expectations are clear and fairly
and consistently enforced, the majority of pupils will respond in a
positive way. Their behaviour will be good and they will be able to
learn in the best possible environment, provided the components we have
talked about are present.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, there
will always be pupils with special needs and special problems, coming
to school carrying not only their rucksacks or satchels but many other
things. The school cannot solve all the world’s problems, but
being aware of what pupils bring to school with them is a further
essential component of achieving a

                           </div>quiet, calm, orderly environment in school, from which learning can be
built for all pupils. That is the essence of our debate. It is about
how the system impacts on the pupils who very often bring other
problems with them to school. The general issue of naughtiness can
usually be resolved by the measures that I have just talked about, but
other issues can be more complex and difficult. We need to understand
those issues very clearly when trying to deal with the
students.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000091">&#160;</a>

amendment would require the decisions of responsible bodies and review
panels to be quality reviewed. As the Bill stands, it is not clear
whether there will be any such monitoring. With the removal in the Bill
of an appeals panel that has the right to reinstate a pupil, it is
crucial that parents, pupils and the Secretary of State can gain the
assurance that the decisions taken on exclusions are of good quality
and adhere to the Equality Act 2010. The NASUWT
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000092">&#160;</a>

hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us regarding the
Equality Act. The National Children’s Bureau also
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000093">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
urge close monitoring of the proposed power of the review panel to
direct reconsideration of the exclusion to make sure that it proves
robust enough to challenge schools that may be behaving precipitately
or
unfairly”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000267">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
NCB is not alone in having concerns about how some schools occasionally
deal with such matters. The Minister of State, Department for
Education, the hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather), said in
June 2007 that there were<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000094">&#160;</a>

some academies use excessive exclusions and suspensions as a form of
back-door
selection.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
concerns are therefore shared by the Minister with responsibility for
children, right at the heart of the Department.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000095">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is intended to prevent that problem and seeks to ensure that equality
in exclusions is monitored. We will hear in a few minutes, when we
debate the next group of amendments, including amendments 27 and 39
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool and me, that the
clause could disproportionately affect children with special
educational needs, who, as we have already heard, are several times
more likely to be permanently excluded than
others.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000096">&#160;</a>

case he does not, I want a debate on how the process will happen. I do
not know what the average number of permanent exclusions is in
schools—it is not very high—so if that is published,
people in a community might talk and say, “Oh, it’s Tom
Smith.” The question is whether that just cannot be allowed, or
is a price worth paying for transparency in the system. Exclusions are
mostly from secondaries. I assume that the community will generally
know if someone is excluded from such a school. Will the hon. Gentleman
engage a little with the question of why the last Government took that
view, why the current Government take it and why it is not possible to
publish the information at institution level, even if there is the
possibility that excluded people might be
identified?<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000103">&#160;</a>

for some time. It was not changed under the last Government, as the
hon. Gentleman correctly said, and I understand the Minister’s
reluctance to change it without giving considerable thought to the
implications of revealing who such people are. I accept that the hon.

                        <p class="tabbed">When
the Minister responds, will he confirm that the provision will impact
not on the SEN tribunal but on students who may have special
educational needs but are not statemented? Will the SEN tribunal remain
in place and still be able to overturn the exclusion of someone with a
statemented special educational need who is subject to the SEN
tribunal? Does the Green Paper mean that fewer pupils will eventually
be subject to the SEN tribunal, and therefore that fewer people will be
protected than currently? If I am wrong about those points, I would be
grateful if the Minister provided clarification, because they are
pertinent to the clause and to the procedure that will be followed on
exclusions of pupils who have special educational needs but are not
statemented.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000105">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
its evidence, Barnardo’s told us that primary children on free
school meals are five times more likely to be excluded from school,
adding to their experience of social exclusion and removing them from
the place where they are most likely to receive support and early
intervention to improve their social skills, language and behaviour.
The other major issue is the disproportionate exclusion of pupils from
particular ethnic minorities. For example, the Children’s Rights
Alliance for England stated
that<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000106">&#160;</a>

                        <p>I
recall an Adjournment debate on the subject when I was a Minister in
the Department, before the last general election, and it is a
particular concern. With that in mind, it is vital that there be a
mechanism to examine both the quality of the provisions and the
equality of their implementation, which is what the amendment seeks to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Following
our previous sitting, the Minister kindly wrote a letter to me, which
presumably he has copied to other members of the Committee, clarifying
some points about consultation with review panels. He confirmed that,
although there had not been a formal, separate consultation on
independent review panels with head teachers, there had been
responses to the White Paper on such matters. He and his officials had
consulted directly groups such as the Association of School
and College Leaders, the Independent Academies Association and the
Department’s secondary heads reference group. Rather than a
formal, separate consultation, there was a discussion with those
organisations about the
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000108">&#160;</a>

there any such consultation with representatives of parents, children

specifically consulted representatives of head teachers? It is

                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
to new clause 2, the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness said that
the Select Committee had found it difficult to form a reliable picture
of behaviour when it was undertaking its inquiry. I intervened on him
about the recording of restraining incidents because, unfortunately, I
know from experience that, despite what the hon. Member for Wells said
in her intervention, such matters are often not recorded systematically
within
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000110">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Moreover,
the Government have revoked the previous Government’s
commencement order that would have brought sections 246 and 247 of the
Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, on recording
and reporting the use of force in schools and colleges, into force on 1
September. I think that that was in 2010, but I shall correct myself if
I am wrong. Clearly, force would not be used unless a serious incident
occurred, but by not commencing the provision, the Government are not
requiring that such incidents be recorded. I am sure the hon. Gentleman
wants to have a good idea of what behaviour is like in our schools. If
schools recorded properly incidents where force is used—by their
nature, they are fairly serious—as well as their frequency and
intensity, we would have a better grip on behaviour in our
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000111">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My information is that the use of force will be
recorded from September; however, no doubt the Minister will elaborate
on that. The Select Committee did not have a picture on sampling, but
said that it needed to sample schools and carry out surveys on parents
and teachers to complete the picture. Does the hon. Gentleman
agree?<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000112">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That might be useful additional information. I am
sure the Minister will clarify whether recording the use of force will
be required from September. Such guidelines will actually be helpful to
schools, because it is likely that parents will lodge malicious
complaints about the misuse of the power to use force. It is good
practice for schools to record such action, and it will not be
burdensome. When the legislation went through Parliament, it was
amended to take into account teachers’ concerns that parents
might react in such a way to the report that force had been used
against that child that they might be in danger of significant harm
from their parents. We all know through experience that that is
possible in some circumstances. Some discretion will therefore be
required in the reporting of such incidents. Still, a record should be
kept.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000113">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
tendency to characterise the position on exclusions and pupils with SEN
at two extremes. At the one extreme, no head teacher would ever dream
of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 345<a class="bkMark" name="Column345">&#160;</a>
                           </div>having any motive on the difficulties of dealing with a particular pupil
that would inform a decision to move to permanent exclusion. At the
other extreme, every head teacher in the country is desperate to get
pupils who are costly or difficult to support and deal with out of
their school as quickly as possible. We are actually somewhere well
towards the former. The vast majority of head teachers care deeply
about every pupil in their school and want to support them and ensure
that they are given every opportunity to develop and learn in a safe
environment. We have to accept that problems occur, which is why we
have a route to exclusion and a process.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The evidence
that we had from head teachers suggested that some decisions have been
overturned, which has had a hugely detrimental effect on staff who have
been involved, perhaps in incidents with other pupils in the school,
such as bullying. That has informed this decision to do something in
the Bill, to move the balance back towards the head teacher and the
governors, so that they can take a decision in the best interest of
that school
community.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is clear, however, that there is great concern outside this
place—as well as from hon. Members both in this Committee and in
the House—that there is the potential for, in some
circumstances, the wrong decision to be taken and that the safeguards
may not be entirely in place. It is important that we have the
information to inform the decision on any change, as well as being able
look at how it is performing. It is reasonable to ask how this will be
monitored and what information will be available on any rise in
particular groups of students, however they are identified, in being
more vulnerable to permanent
exclusion.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept that that is a valid debate to be had, but the hon. Member for
Walthamstow, in initiating this debate and particularly in her comments
on the Green Paper, seemed to be ascribing a certain motive and desire,
both to schools and the Government, to scramble to get as many pupils
with identified and valid special educational needs away from that
categorisation, to break down links between the local authority and
educational institutions, and effectively to set up a fortress school
that can take any decision that it wants and have no regard to other
factors. I do not accept that at all. It is important to place on
record my objections to that characterisation of the debate. In the
Green Paper, I see a determination to bring organisations
together—the hon. Lady identified this as its stated
intent—to overcome problems where organisations are not working
together. For example, in the past the health sector has not been part
of the process of putting together an overall package. What the Green
Paper seeks to do in that regard is helpful and goes in the right
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000119">&#160;</a>

we will debate in due course. That is a much wider duty than the issue
we are talking about here with regard to special educational needs. So
I am looking forward to the Green Paper, leading ultimately to
legislative change and guidance, which will ensure that with this
particular group of pupils there is that safeguard, and co-operation
between children’s services, health, schools and any other

                           </strong> The Green Paper focuses particularly on those
where there are needs that are easily identified for support and
funding. That is important. But as other hon. Members have said, there
are other groups of young people—whether they are those with
caring responsibilities, or who have other issues, for example
bereavement—all sorts of things which might not mean a special
educational need. We would need to be conscious of what was affecting
their lives as well. Her hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff West
referred to what a young person brings to school with them, and it is
important to have reference to that. In the vast majority of cases the
safeguards will be in place, and if a real problem is identified, we
have the review process which will challenge governors to look at the
situation again. However, I accept that there is a need to have
information. I think the Chair of the Select Committee was right to set
out the difficulties the Committee has had before in getting access to
the information to help its consideration of these issues. I hope the
Minister can explain how information will be captured, so that we will
be able to see whether there is any trend that is potentially dangerous
to particular young people and deal with that
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>

responsible for the future educational provision of children with
special educational needs, it will be important to understand what
options they are choosing, and the cost implications of that. For
example, at the moment if children need out of borough provision, that
can be disproportionately expensive to a local PRU. If schools are left
to make those decisions rather than local authorities, they may choose
the cheaper option. We need to track what is happening to those
children who have been excluded and what happens
next.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>

the proposal that schools maintain an element of responsibility for
what happens to a young person following a decision that relationships
are breaking down—or whatever—in the school and that
there is a need to exclude. It is not clear to me whether it would only
be up to the school to make that decision. It is my understanding that
others would be deciding where that young person went. I do not think
it would be up to the governors of that school to say, “We are
excluding you, and you must go to that place as an alternative
provision.” There is an element of funding, and we have talked
about not a fine, but a potential financial burden on that school if
the review panel felt that it had acted precipitately.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>

the Green Paper and the direction of travel around SEN. It is difficult
to separate exclusion from SEN. The vast majority of excluded children
are children with SEN, but I was very surprised by the
Minister’s suggestion—and I know he was referring to
autism—that these children be taught in special schools. What I
am picking up is the underpinning principle that would it not be easier
if these children went to special schools—that they are the
right place for these children and that there would be less exclusion.
I hope that that is incorrect, as that would be a mistake. Clearly, SEN
is a continuum, from a child who experiences mild problems at one
particular time in their life right through to one with severe
difficulties.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000122">&#160;</a>

point. Regarding special schools and special educational needs, the
sentiment that I get from what I have heard on this side of the

one type of school or the other, but for parents to be empowered to
make that decision without a strong presumption one way or the other. I
am interested in the hon. Lady’s thoughts about that, because
that was what I thought the sentiment was, not, as she was suggesting,
that there was a blind push in one direction or
another.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000123">&#160;</a>

the legislation that talks about mainstream education. Although there
is a presumption in the legislation regarding statemented children, it
says later—this might cover the points that the hon. Gentleman
is talking about—that while there is a presumption to
mainstream, if a parent prefers a special school, that is where the
child should go. That is incredibly important. It is the combination of
expert advice and the parent. Too often, the balance has been in favour
of specialist advice rather than parents, which hopefully we will see
redressed. If we are looking down the route of exclusions, there would
be fewer exclusions if more of the children were educated in more
specialist provision.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000124">&#160;</a>

matter. On occasion, I have had parents who have insisted on mainstream
when I looked at the profound difficulties of a child and thought,
“This is simply not an efficient use of resources. It is not the
right place,” and I have been wrong. Although the pressure on
the Minister at the moment is for more special school provision, my

identified or met. There could be a range of causal factors for
behavioural problems including underlying mental health or family
problems. Exploring wider family circumstances is often crucial to
identifying the root causes of behavioural problems. A whole-family

that the children from families facing multiple problems, which may be

states that schools trigger the assessment, but they do so in instances

will lead to a trigger because the behaviour is at the school. There
may be other instances, and the hon. Lady should meet my hon. Friend

throughout the trial. The hon. Member for Walthamstow raised other
issues during the debate and said that the whole approach might lead to
an incentive to exclude, an issue raised by others, too. It is not
about that. It is about trusting professionals to make such decisions
and to remove impediments to the exercising of their professional
judgment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000136">&#160;</a>

intention to address over-identification of special educational needs,
something that is highlighted in Ofsted’s important report. It
is not good for children if they are identified as having learning
difficulties, in a special educational needs sense, when they do not
actually have learning difficulties. Too often, as has been hinted
during our discussions, that can lead to lower expectations of what the
children can achieve and the wrong approach to addressing their

also improve and expand the range of provision that parents can choose
for their child. It puts a strong emphasis on the appropriate
identification of special educational needs and of other underlying
causal factors, such as mental health problems that can sometimes be
labelled as SEN without appropriate

are consulting on the Green Paper both on replacing the school action
and school action plus categories with a single school-based category
of SEN, and on how the category of behavioural, emotional and social

about what he is saying? Is he suggesting that children with mental
health difficulties may not have special educational needs as a result
of their mental health difficulties, or is it about how support is
built into the system? There seems to be a suggestion that if a child
has mental health difficulties, they would not necessarily require
special education. Often, the mental health difficulties may appear
later in life, in adolescence rather than in early years, so it seems a
slightly confused approach to have a connection between emotional and
behavioural difficulties and learning embodied in the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000142">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The point is that it is easy to label a child as
school action or school action plus and, once the labelling is done,
not to then obtain the proper support from professionals, child and
adolescent mental health services and elsewhere to help address the
problems facing the child. Simply labelling them as special needs can
often be the end of the task that the school has undertaken. Sometimes
it is a lazy way of tackling problems, and those problems can then go
undiagnosed and unsupported, and the child is not helped with the
problems that he or she is facing. That is the danger of this too easy

the concern about the use of school action plus without follow-up, but
I am not sure that such follow-up will occur under the Bill and the

starting the process—risks more and more young people not
getting the necessary support to enable them to come in and learn,
particularly if such support is external to the
school.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000146">&#160;</a>

to do so. The extra hurdles to making such an identification will
require a school to obtain the correct diagnosis, and from that, obtain
the correct support from the agencies and professionals who ought to be
involved in helping that child. The provision is about avoiding lazy

strong, robust accountability systems and, as a consequence, we will be
able to trust professionals more without having the continual
initiatives and top-down prescriptive approaches to professionals in
our education system, which were a symptom of the previous Government.
We want to remove all that. We are removing some of it through the Bill
and trusting professionals, but the quid pro quo is that the systems
that we are introducing—and the proposals in the Green
Paper—require a rigorous approach to assessing an early

happen in practice? If a young person has emotional and behavioural
difficulties that manifest in school, they will struggle in learning
without the support networks. Yet there will be a financial
disincentive to schools to support such networks because of the cost of
doing so under the new system. It will be easier, therefore, to exclude
them to trigger the process of getting the assessment, which he has
explained. Without an in-between process, when will the funding come
into the system to bring in the educational psychologist, the youth
worker, or the social worker to work intensively with that
person?

which is a significant sum of extra money for schools with high
proportions of children from poorer backgrounds, among whom is a higher
proportion of children with special educational needs. We are therefore
providing the funding for such children and we are doing everything
that ought to be done, in the current financial climate, to help and

Friend. He is right. The previous system was adversarial. If one talks
to parents, they say how difficult it is to get an assessment for a
statement, let alone a statement. The drive behind the Green Paper is
to try to change that adversarial approach to a multi-agency approach
on assessing the wider needs of children. I believe that that will lead
to early intervention. Hopefully we will not get to the position where
five or seven years into school these children’s behavioural
problems are so bad that they end up having to be

course, important to know what is happening in schools on an important
issue such as this. I therefore wanted to explain what happens with
such data currently. Schools must send full details of all exclusions
to the local authority and to the governing body and, in the case of a
pupil referral unit, to the management committee. That applies to
maintained schools and academies, for which it is written into their
funding agreements. In each case, they have to report the
pupil’s name, the length of the exclusion, the reason for the
exclusion, the pupil’s age, gender and ethnicity, whether the
pupil has a statement of special educational needs, whether they are
being assessed for such a statement or are on school action or school
action plus and whether they are looked after, as defined by the
section 22 of the Children Act 1989. For fixed period exclusions of
pupils of compulsory school age—where the exclusion is for more
than five school days—the school has to report what alternative
provision has been put in place for the
pupil.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000158">&#160;</a>

Department already publishes annual statistics on permanent exclusions.
We intend to continue to provide those statistics on the number of
permanent and fixed-term exclusions by local authority. At the national
level, we currently collect information on the proportion of
excluded pupils with SEN, and on the appeal panels—the total
number of cases, the number of appeals upheld and the number of
reinstatements. That will be replaced by equivalent collections of
information on review panels, assuming that the Bill goes on to the
statute book. All permanently excluded pupils should receive full-time
provision, whether in another school or in alternative provision.
Through annual censuses, we gather data on children in alternative
provision. The information that is and will be available is sufficient
to inform future policy developments and for us to monitor what is
happening. I do not think that this requirement is needed in the Bill.

already publishes statistics on the number of permanent and fixed-term
exclusions, including for each local authority and ethnic group, as I
have said. We intend to provide national information on review panels,
the number of cases heard and decisions, which will be similar to those
currently gathered about appeal panels. That should be an adequate
level of detail, and I am reluctant to impose a new duty on schools to
report the number of exclusions each year, as they already have to
provide full details of each exclusion to the local authority. That
includes academies, for which the requirement is written into their
funding agreement. Governing bodies also receive details of all
exclusions, and I expect all those bodies to pay attention to that
important information when considering the management of behaviour in

                           </strong> We know that when the Government shine a light on
certain children, such as looked-after children, and their attainment,
things improve. Given the very real concerns expressed—we can
argue about which children have SEN or have additional needs; they
clearly have significant needs—and the impact that a permanent
exclusion has on a young person’s life, does not the Minister
think that it is worth supporting the amendment, so that a small amount
of bureaucracy can change the number of children in that category in

schools, even in the new, more autonomous system and, if so, how would
that play out, so that we can be reassured that no schools are

future role of local authorities. Their future role should be to
challenge schools on a whole range of data coming from the schools in

focus on, because it might indicate wider concerns about particular
local
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000170">&#160;</a>

my hon. Friend’s comment about the lowest number of pupils
excluded that can be revealed in school data, and whether that is
always five, there is no fixed figure. The principle is that there must
be no risk of revealing the identities of individual children in what
is such a sensitive area. In some statistics the figure is five, but in
others it may be 10. Hon. Members appear to want a breakdown by SEN or
ethnic origin at school level, but the numbers are likely to be far too
low to be able to deliver that. That is an issue in addition to the one
about burdens on
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000171">&#160;</a>

earlier intervention. First, the Minister has shown that that
information is already collected. The bureaucracy is done: it is only a
question of publishing the information, and if we shine a light on
that, it will make a difference. Secondly, I agree with what the Select
Committee Chairman is saying—that there is a role for the local
authority—but given the cuts, people have received their
redundancy notices now, and they are leaving on 31 March. There will be

administrative burdens on schools, but I do not believe that the
additional burden of reporting on this issue is necessary. Even more
importantly, because the number of exclusions in any school is likely
to be small, there would be a risk, as I have just said to my hon.
Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness, that individual pupils
could be identified from a report that includes the number of
exclusions in a particular school. I do not believe that it would be
helpful for local authorities to publish information at school level
for all schools in their area. They would have the information but,
leaving aside the additional burden on local authorities, I am not
convinced that publication of such data would be helpful. As with
schools publishing data, there could be concerns about possible
identification of individual
pupils.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000173">&#160;</a>

consistency with the Equality Act 2010, I agree that it is important
that schools and local authorities comply with their duties under the
Act, which prohibits discrimination against pupils on the grounds of a
protected characteristic, whether gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual
orientation, gender reassignment, religion or belief, pregnancy or
maternity, and expressly covers excluding a pupil as being a potential
act of discrimination. Schools must have the Act in mind when making
decisions relating to exclusions. In addition, the Act obliges public
bodies to comply with the general duty to have regard to the need to
eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster
good relations between groups with different protected
characteristics.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000174">&#160;</a>

Adequate information will already be published, both on the overall

suspensions, and statistics prove that they do not. I shall try to
explain the stats. In 2008-09, 0.68% of pupils with special educational
needs, with and without statements, were permanently excluded from
academies, compared with 0.16% of children with no SEN. The equivalent
figures for local authority-maintained schools were 0.57% compared with
0.07%. That shows that the exclusion rate for pupils with SEN in
academies was approximately four times higher than that for pupils with
no SEN. That compares with the rate for SEN pupils being eight times
higher than for pupils with no SEN in local authority-maintained
schools. On the basis of those figures, it seems that there is no
discrimination in academies against children with

would like to speak to new clause 2, tabled by my hon. Friend the

to exclusion, it raises the issue of incidences of serious
misbehaviour, some of which may lead to exclusions. It is therefore
appropriate to discuss it in the context of clause 4. Regarding
recording incidences of the use of force, section 93 of the Education
and Inspections Act 2006 will be commenced in September 2011. I
reassure hon. Members that although the duty was not commenced in
September 2010—this relates to the hon. Member for Cardiff
West—it will be commenced in September 2011. The governing body
of a school in England must ensure that a procedure is in place for
recording each significant incident in which a member of staff uses
force on a pupil and reporting each use-of-force incident to each
parent of the pupil as soon as practicable after the
incident—although I take on board the flexibility that we need,
which another hon. Member raised, about whether it is appropriate to
report it to some parents, who may take an inappropriate response to
that news. Use of force may, in some circumstances, include restraint,

inquiry into behaviour and discipline in schools. I welcome the
Committee’s inquiry and its report. I believe that its
recommendation was largely prompted by the concerns of some witnesses
about the efficacy of the Ofsted inspection capturing a true picture of
behaviour in our schools. Those concerns centred on how some teachers
felt that they were fighting against a tide of low-level disruption
without acknowledgement or support of senior managers in the school,
and how such incidents in particular are sometimes kept hidden from
inspectors when they come to the schools, for example by suggesting
that certain children do not come to school that day.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000186">&#160;</a>

                        <p>While I agree with Sir
Alan Steer’s statement that one has to have very strong grounds
to disregard Ofsted evidence, I accept that there is a need for change.
That is why I have set out in our White Paper and in the Bill that
behaviour and safety will be key elements of the new streamlined school
inspection system that will be trialled this year. That focus will give
Ofsted more time during the inspection to explore what is going on in
individual schools and hold them to account.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
we should remember that the problems in our schools are not all caused
by serious incidents, such as violence against other pupils or staff.
Around 30% of permanent exclusions from secondary schools are for
persistent disruptive behaviour, a proportion that has remained
constant since data collection began. Focusing on serious incidents
alone will not give us the whole story. I am conscious of the
pernicious effect of poor behaviour, particularly the so-called
low-level

                           </div>disruption, on the ability of teachers to teach and of pupils to learn.
We have a made a commitment, which was set out in the White Paper, to
reform initial teacher training to focus on key teaching skills, such
as managing behaviour, because we expect that all teachers will be
trained to manage such disruption and improve children’s
behaviour from the start of their
careers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
independent review of all levels of standards for teachers, which was
also announced in the White Paper, will consider how the standards
might provide a strong focus on how best to manage poor behaviour. That
review is chaired by Sally Coates, the excellent principal of
Burlington Danes academy. We also expect senior school leaders to
support their staff in tackling poor behaviour, whether through better
continuing professional development or simply by establishing and
applying consistent behaviour policies, the terms of which are clear to
staff, parents and pupils.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I agree that
it is important we gain a full understanding of the impact of poor
behaviour on schools, pupils and teachers and of how we can spread best
practice in improving behaviour. However, that cannot be done by
focusing on serious incidents alone. As I have said, we do not want to
impose extra burdens of data collection on teachers in schools. Our aim
is to keep those to a minimum. We will consider new collections of data
only where the need for new information is absolutely critical. We do
not have a critical need for a new data collection, given that we have
detailed statistics and other information on exclusions and school
attendance from the Ofsted judgment. As I said, we hope to strengthen
those. Although I understand the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member
for Beverley and Holderness, it is not appropriate to legislate in the
way he suggests. I therefore hope that he will not press his new
clause, when we come to that point.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000191">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Can the Minister refer to two points I raised?
One relates to the SEN tribunal and whether the provisions around that
are affected in any way by the groups of amendments or the clause. On
SEN tribunals, will there still be a power of reinstatement—I am
treading water just to give the Minister a chance—if an
exclusion is forwarded to them? The situation will probably be that
fewer people are afforded that protection, given the
Government’s intention in the Green Paper to reduce the number
of students who are statemented. Is my assumption on that correct? The
second point relates to my question whether there were any specifics in
addition to the points he mentioned in his letter to me about
consultation on the matter with children, parent’s groups and
young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000192">&#160;</a>

exclusion is due to disability discrimination will be able to take
their case to the first-tier tribunal, which is the existing case for
pupils who are being excluded on a fixed-term basis. That will also now
apply to permanent exclusions. They have the power to reinstate a pupil
to the school. The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of parents and
pupils. Although there was no direct prior consultation, I have met
representatives of both children’s rights and SEN organisations.
These provisions were discussed. I remind him that the new system has
additional provisions; for example, access to an SEN expert if the case
for disability discrimination is to go to the first tribunal. There are
plenty of measures in the Bill to

people to whom he is referring, but we talked to representatives of
children’s rights and special education bodies. On that note, I
shall finish my remarks by saying that I hope the hon. Member for

started to untangle some of the issues about which a number of people
across the House are concerned when it comes to our young people and
how we ensure that they are equipped for the modern world and the role
that education will play in that. We know that young people are facing
an extremely difficult jobs market and that there is a fall in the
number of unskilled positions in our economy as we move towards a
knowledge economy. Therefore, it is absolutely critical to help young
people to get the qualifications and training they need to get on. The
group of young people we have been talking about this morning, who may
well be affected by the proposals and by the main clause, are of great
concern to a number of
us.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the worries that I have taken note of this morning is how much more
work needs to be done to join up the support given to children at any
point during their educational career. I hope that members of the
Committee will take on board my concern that emotional behavioural
difficulties can manifest themselves not only in early years, but
during adolescence and in later years. It is important that the system
can respond to that. Not identifying such difficulties and additional
needs is no substitute for giving young people the necessary
support.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000195">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for North West Durham ably made the point about
the importance of shining a spotlight on such a group of young people
and asking how we should best support them. That is mixed with a fear
that the proposals in the Bill as a whole will make such action harder
for head teachers to take, even with the best will in the world. At the
risk of repeating myself about non sequiturs and the idea that we trust
professionals but do not think that they are making good judgment calls
on identifying young people, I am worried about how that might be done
under the new system. We must understand what happens to young children
next.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
urge the Minister to look closely at the data sets that the Department
has already collected on exclusions. The amendment simply asks the
Department to go one stage further in its manipulation of the data and
track young people to see whether they come up repeatedly. That would
give us the opportunity see whether we were getting the support for
those young people right. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, in creating
financial incentives for schools to pick the easier option for young
people with such needs and excluding them rather than using the options
that could work for them, realises the worry among many of us who work
with young people and want to see that their needs are met; we want to
track what
happens.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000197">&#160;</a>

if we will not identify additional needs through school action plus,
reform the process or reduce it. I shall be seeking the

later clauses that could underpin such a support network at both early
years and in adolescence, there will be agreement throughout the
Committee about the need to look at how support services can be
accessed. When we trust professionals, we need to trust more than one
set of professionals to help a young person. We must be able to bring
in educational psychologists, youth workers and social care workers to
give those young people the best start in life, which is what we all
want to happen.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000198">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister made several reasonable points.
Ofsted and its narrow focus and ability to look at behaviour is
important, but we should remember that it will be focusing in future on
fewer schools. Hopefully, as the number of outstanding schools
increases, Ofsted will reduce its scope. Therefore, we will not have
through its inspection activity the overview for which I was calling,
so I hope that my hon. Friend will consider that matter further.
Although no mention is made of it in new clause 2, the Select Committee
recommended that consistent surveys be taken so that we know what
perception teachers, parents and pupils have of behaviour in schools,
which will give us an overview. I hope that my hon. Friend will
consider that, too. I am happy not to press the new clause, having had
such a full debate.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000199">&#160;</a>

new system, we have a Green Paper that places an increased emphasis on
early intervention. We have the ability of a parent to require an SEN
expert to be on the review panel, and we have direct access to the

disability for permanent exclusion that did not exist before. With

often local authorities and schools have failed to arrange SEN

cent of secondary school children who are excluded from school have
special educational needs. A significant number of these children have
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and mental
health issues. Many of these children do not receive the specialist SEN

                        <p class="tabbed">We
also heard from Ambitious about Autism, which used to be known as the
TreeHouse charity to one or two hon. Members here. It
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Exclusions
are a major concern for parents of children with autism. Our research
showed that 43% of children with autism were officially excluded from
school in a 12 month period. Exclusion can often be the result of an
underlying special educational need, which has not been identified and
has manifested as challenging behaviour...Our primary concern is for
young people facing exclusion who may have unmet special educational
needs that impact upon their behaviour. For example, we see many cases
where young people with high-functioning autism, but without a
diagnosis, struggle to understand instructions given to them at school,
or fail to effectively communicate their innocence, and end up in a
cycle of
exclusion.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Children’s Society is also worried, and said that it would like
no pupil to be permanently excluded unless a review has been undertaken
by the school of the sufficiency and effectiveness of reasonable
adjustments being made for a disabled pupil or special educational
provision for a pupil with SEN. It says that assessment<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000218">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“should have an
independent element and should be undertaken before a decision is made
to permanently exclude the child. We know that many behavioural
difficulties observed in pupils stem from a disability or SEN and
therefore the most effective way to address this is to meet the SEN
need.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000282">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The

from inappropriate exclusions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000219">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 27
aims to ensure that a pupil’s SEN are taken into account when
the responsible body—such as the governing body—considers
whether a pupil should be reinstated, which may follow an independent
review recommendation for the decision to be reconsidered. As we have
heard many times this morning, children with SEN are far more likely to
be excluded than others. We have referred to the Education
Committee’s report on behaviour and discipline in schools, which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000220">&#160;</a>

with SEN (both with and without statements) are more than eight times
more likely to be permanently excluded than those pupils with no SEN.
In 2008–09, 24 in every 10,000 pupils with statements of SEN and
30 in every 10,000 pupils with SEN but without statements were
permanently excluded from school, compared to three in every 10,000
pupils with no identified

was 19.1%, 14.2% for pupils with SEN without statements, and 2.2% for
pupils with no
SEN.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000283">&#160;</a>

                        <p>In
evidence for that report, Professor Pam Maras, who is honorary general
secretary of the British Psychological Society, told the Education
Committee that schools find it difficult to interpret SEN policies in
relation to behaviour, because behaviour is also dealt with through
disciplinary action. Amendment 27 seeks to ensure that children with
SEN are not excluded if their needs have not been adequately addressed
by their schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In addition,
Ambitious about Autism told us that the removal of the right to
reinstatement through the independent review panel might have the
unintended consequence of increasing exclusions among those groups that
are already vulnerable to exclusions, including children with autism
and other SEN. The Bill removes appeals panels and replaces them with
review panels that do not have the power to reinstate, so we are
concerned that children with SEN may be disproportionately
excluded.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would place a duty on the responsible body—the governing body of
a school—to consider a report from the SEN co-ordinator when
deciding whether a pupil should be reinstated. Such a duty would ensure
that responsible bodies have all the necessary evidence to make an
informed decision about reinstating, and it would protect children with
autism and other SEN from discriminatory exclusions. I would be
interested to hear the Minister’s reaction to the amendment in
light of the additional information that he is provided to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000223">&#160;</a>

briefly to amendments 67 and 68, which were tabled by the Chair of the
Education Committee, the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness.
Again, I suspect that the hon. Gentleman has drawn heavily
on his Committee’s report—particularly
recommendation 25—which is understandable. The recommendation
followed a discussion of school collaboration on the necessity of
carrying out an assessment for a child on school action plus, for
example, to see whether a statement is required. Amendment 67 has some
merit, although the Minister will want to tell us whether its proposals
would involve additional costs in the short term; it might result in
considerable savings in the long term. I know that the hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness will speak about his amendments in a minute,
but it is important that the Minister identifies whether consideration
has been given to the long-term savings that the amendment might
produce.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000224">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
68, tabled by the hon. Gentleman, would require review panel members to
be trained in the law and practice of children with special educational
needs and with disabilities. On the surface, it seems a sensible
proposal. We sought to address that matter in government, and there is
a comprehensive set of training materials, which was prepared for the
previous Government by the Information for School and College Governors
service, already available on the teachernet website. That guidance
could do with being updated, once the new arrangements come into force.
We would be interested to know what the Government’s plans are
for training arrangements for review panel members, which was

                           </strong> We will see whether we can up our pace from the
glacial one that we have so far maintained. I will speak to amendments
67 and 68. Amendment 67, as has been said, is based on a recommendation
from the Education Committee’s recent report, “Behaviour
and Discipline in Schools”. It would require a trigger for an
assessment of need that may include special educational needs if a
pupil has been excluded more than once in a 12-month period or is at
risk of permanent
exclusion.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000226">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Children
with special needs, and their parents with them, suffer the most
astonishing frustration within our system. Only days ago, I heard from
a constituent who talked about a child with Asperger’s, who has
been on school action plus for the whole of his school life. He has met
educational psychologists and had various support, but his experience
has been woeful. He has been suicidal and self-harming, and has failed
to get a statement. Over five years, the system has resisted efforts by
the parent to have that child given the help that he needs. Yet, if we
looked at the services provided, we would be able to tick many boxes
showing that efforts had been made to meet those needs; however, his
needs have not actually been
met.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
therefore welcome the Green Paper’s section on accountability,
where it states that it is not enough to show that services are being
provided; whether the needs of the child have been met needs to be
looked at, and that is far more important than whether,
institutionally, there has been a response within a certain number of
days or certain steps that the system requires have been taken. Of
course, it is easier to talk about that in a Green Paper than it is to
implement it on the ground, but that aspiration is well worth
pursuing.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will be mindful of that little boy, who is having such a miserable time
at such a young age. His mother said that she does not believe that he
is truly suicidal, but that he is so desperate and so disappointed that
he expresses his frustration in that way. It is for the benefit of
children such as him that we are trying, in our inadequate fashion, to
improve the Bill. I do not think that any member of the Select
Committee would suggest that the trigger is the be-all-and-end-all
answer to the needs of such children, but we want to have processes put
in place to ensure that a child’s needs are
met.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000229">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>That is
also true. It is not necessarily a failure of responsibility or care,
let alone malice, on the part of schools, but an inability within the
existing systems for people of good will to do the right thing by the
most vulnerable
children.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is an extremely difficult area, but I hope that the amendment might be
considered and accepted. If not, I hope that it at least triggers a
serious debate about how we change the system. Many speakers have
spoken about the increased likelihood of children with special
educational needs being excluded from school. What happens to those who
are excluded is well known. Of the people in special units, only 1% get
five good GCSEs. The chances of ending up in jail or on drugs
and—however we measure it—leading a miserable life are
massively increased if a child is excluded. While accepting the need
for the school to maintain proper discipline, anything that we can do
to make that less likely and to ensure that a child’s needs can
be met and they can be kept in school is a good
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000236">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Recognition
of the current appalling outcomes for excluded children is the reason I
welcome the pilots that the Government are suggesting on schools
maintaining responsibility. I entirely accept that there are all sorts
of issues, which is why they are piloting it. There are conflicts of
interest. If schools have an automatic right to additional money, they
might have a perverse incentive to exclude. If they have to pay for it
out of their existing budget, do they have a perverse incentive not to
find specialist additional support, external to the school, when they
could? Those are things that we need to tease out. Getting it right
could not be more important to the future of some of our most
vulnerable
children.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000237">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the hon. Gentleman also share my concern that
there might be a perverse incentive for the children who remain in the
school? Schools might end up sacrificing the cost of teaching
assistants or extra support to fund special education places. Without
the support that perhaps local authorities are currently providing,
there could be all sorts of perverse incentives in the system that
could damage educational opportunities for a range of young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000238">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady makes a reasonable point. I do not
know whether Governments should brainstorm, but when they try to tackle
something as intractable and difficult as this, I do not want to pour
too much cold water on it, especially when they are not announcing it
as a fait accompli because they are so certain that it is right. They
are actually piloting it. I want to give it a chance, because what we
have now is not good enough. There are conflicts of interest in any
system, but it is worth pursuing. When a child is excluded and drops
out of the school’s picture, we know what their outcomes 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 366<a class="bkMark" name="Column366">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are. If the school, which probably knows them better than anyone else in
the system at that point, has a continuing link and some sense of
ownership over that child’s future, perhaps that could offer
real benefits. What happens to children now can be pretty catastrophic,
so changing the system and supporting the pilot is worth while. It is
worth raising the issues so that we get the framework as appropriately
drawn up as we can to minimise any negative impacts, which there are
bound to be in any system. I think it could offer some
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000239">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
67 would ensure that children with undiagnosed special needs, deficient
literacy skills or other unmet educational needs did not fall through
the cracks by requiring a closer investigation of the root causes of
poor behaviour prior to the permanent exclusion of the pupil. The
equality statement for the Bill indicates that pupils with SEN account
for 72% of all exclusions. More must be done to ensure that fixed-term
exclusions do not become permanent exclusions owing to unmet
SEN.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">According
to the Social Market Foundation and the Disability Rights Commission,
at the age of 16 young people with SEN and disabilities are twice as
likely to be NEET as those without. That figure rises to three times as
likely by the age of 19. High levels of permanent exclusion for such
pupils will only increase those numbers. That is the reason for
suggesting this trigger today.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000241">&#160;</a>

would require members of review panels to be trained in SEN law and
practice and disability awareness. Such a requirement is particularly
important when there is an unidentified need because children may be
labelled as having behavioural difficulties when it is the system that
has failed to meet their educational needs. I refer back to the quote
that I gave from the Ofsted report, which suggested that up to half the
children on school action would not need to be so designated if they
had had their needs met appropriately in the first place. If a child is
permanently excluded, it is vital that review panels have the expertise
to recognise that and advise the school accordingly if they fail to
meet SEN needs or make reasonable adjustments.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000242">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 1 is a substantial amendment that refers
to failure. Where a school has significantly failed, there should be an
opportunity for review panels to reinstate pupils. I am looking in
particular at four groups of children: those with special educational
needs; those who live in poverty and who would have attracted a pupil
premium in the previous 18 months; those who are looked after or who
are on the local authority at risk register; and those who are young
carers. Under amendment 1, the review panel may reinstate

                        <p class="tabbed">I was a little
concerned by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford who said, on
Thursday, that Members on the Government Benches trust head
teachers more. I am not sure whether that is true. I
literally love head teachers; my immediate family is littered with
them. Someone said earlier today that this is a continuum; we have head
teachers who will go to the nth degree to meet the needs of all their
pupils. We have teachers at the other end of the continuum whose focus
is on standards, and the needs of individual children are secondary to
that. We are, I think, at the end where most head teachers will go to
great lengths to

                           </div>meet the needs of all children. Nevertheless, there should be somebody
between the head teacher and God in these things.<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The common
denominator in all four proposed subsections is where the school has
failed to recognise, assess and make reasonable adjustments. We are
talking about very vulnerable young people. Where they have been
failed—and they have been failed in the past—there should
be a right to reinstatement. When I first became head of the service,
Achievement and Inclusion, I came across the case of a boy called
Peter. The phone rang, I picked it up and it was my pupil referral unit
saying, “There was a permanent exclusion governors meeting last
night. The exclusion was upheld. We are starting to get all kinds of
alarm bells ringing. We have never heard of this child before. The
behaviour support people and the SENCO have never heard of him and yet
he has been permanently excluded.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103161000251">&#160;</a>
