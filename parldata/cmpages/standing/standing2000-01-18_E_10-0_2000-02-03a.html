<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 296, in line 10, after `liabilities', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(being property or rights used or exercised, and liabilities incurred, prior to this Act coming into force by the CAA wholly or in part in, or as a direct consequence of the provision of air traffic services)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 297, in page 26, line 11, after `undertaking', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`as relates to the provision of air traffic services'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 299, in page 26, line 19, after `CAA', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and engaged wholly or in part in the provision of air traffic services'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We have now come to the provisions that deal with the transfer of shares out of the Civil Aviation Authority and the change whereby it will become the regulatory authority for the provision of air traffic services. I should like the Minister to explain why the clause is so widely drawn. The amendments would provide superior, and more precise, wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I do not know whether you think it appropriate to debate transfer schemes more widely at this stage Mr. Gale. I spent a long time with a wet towel around my head trying to understand exactly what is intended in this chapter. For example, clause 40(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Provisions falling within this subsection are ones for the transfer of any of the CAA's property, rights or liabilities or of all or part of its undertaking to any of the following—
<P>
(a) the Secretary of State;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) a company which is wholly owned by the Crown;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) a company which is wholly owned by the CAA;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) a company which is a wholly owned subsidiary of a company falling within paragraph (b) or (c).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am unable to grasp why such wide-ranging transfer powers are needed. The provisions deal with the nuts and bolts of the public-private partnership. We are reaching the moment of truth, when the Labour party rats on its pre-general election commitment that, as the right hon. Gentleman who is now the Chief Secretary to the Treasury proclaimed, our air is ``not for sale''. It should be quite simple to create a schedule to the Bill containing a list of the assets or trading entities that need to be privatised and either to transfer them to the Secretary of State en bloc or privatise them directly and recoup the proceeds from Civil Aviation Authority. The Bill seems to deal with the matter in an extraordinarily complex way. No doubt there are—
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> Precedents!
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Absolutely. The Minister took the words out of my mouth.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman asked me a question and I had better rule him in order before I have to rule him out of order. Many of the clauses require wide-ranging debate. When considering a new chapter of the Bill it is inevitable that we must deal with general issues that interrelate between clauses and amendments. On that basis, I am prepared to permit a wide-ranging debate, bearing in mind that that will be reflected in my judgment on clause stand part debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for your remarks, Mr. Gale. Many part I clauses deal with different aspects of the same matters, so I hope that we shall be able to discuss the principles of transfer schemes and their general intentions. We shall also have to consider closely how each clause has a bearing on the process that the Minister will no doubt set out.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As I said during the previous sitting, such matters will be for the judgment of the Chairman, which will depend on the thoroughness with which amendments have embraced issues arising from a clause and thus on how much it will have been debated. As further amendments will be tabled in due course, I shall not exercise that judgment now. It is in order for an hon. Member to seek the Chairman's indulgence for a wide-ranging debate, but he cannot do so twice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I believe that the term is ``tedious and repetitive'', and I shall, naturally, avoid falling into that trap.
<P>
Subsection (3) of the clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Provisions falling within this subsection are ones for the transfer of any of the property, rights or liabilities of a company (the transferor) which is wholly owned by the CAA or of all or part of the transferor's undertaking to any of the following—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the Secretary of State;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the CAA;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) a company which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the transferor or of any other company falling within subsection (2)(b) or (c).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That drafting seems extraordinarily complex and contains a repetitive refrain that extends throughout part I. Perhaps it reflects a desire on the part of the Government to give themselves maximum discretion and flexibility. Is such a maximum of flexibility justified, or does it allow undue manipulation of the business and assets not merely of the National Air Traffic Services but of the CAA? As my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) pointed out, the Bill does not contain provisions to restrict Ministers from moving around CAA assets that have nothing directly to do with air traffic services. It gives the Minister the opportunity to change things that it is clearly not intended will be changed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister shakes his head, so he must have assented to my previous comment that the Bill gives him the power to change matters that are unrelated to air traffic services. The title of part I of the Bill is ``Air Traffic'', so one would have hoped that it would not contain provisions that fall outside that title. The Opposition seek extensive clarification of how the provisions are intended to operate. Will the Minister explain the obligations that the Secretary of State could
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``impose . . . on the transferor and transferee to take any necessary steps''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to secure the objectives set out in paragraphs (a) and (b)? How long will those obligations have effect? There is no time limit. If the transferee is the final company that will be the subject of the partnership agreement, will the subsection (7) obligations continue to apply after the PPP has begun? Possible obligations could relate to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any interest, right or liability created by virtue of subsection (6)(a) or (b)'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
such as property interests to which the scheme relates, and rights and liabilities between transferor and transferee. For how long will those contractual obligations exist? Subsection 7(b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any incidental provision made by virtue of subsection 6(c)'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which relates to provisions that are made under paragraph (a). That is extraordinarily complicated and does not add much to the sum total of human knowledge. A more straightforward transfer and sale process must have been available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire)—rose
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Ah, the Back Bencher!
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am glad that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) is paying attention.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) agree that there is a safety angle to consider? The mechanism, which is unnecessarily complicated, could lead to a delay. To maintain public confidence, the swiftest transfer to the new set-up would be the most beneficial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The hiatus, as the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) has said, is that the process of moving towards the PPP distracts management from the main business of operation. That is a concern. The clause only amplifies the fact that this matter is complicated. The management of NATS will spend much time deciding which light fittings, desks and telephones to transfer to the new company. There is a balance sheet, but the creation of an inventory of assets and liabilities so that they are enumerated in the transfer is complicated. I am reasonably confident that the management is well organised. It should follow good commercial accounting practice and be able to cope. However, the safety obligation remains on the Secretary of State and the CAA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that, rather than the new partner having, say, 46 per cent. of the asset value, the management would divide up the light bulbs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That intervention does not surprise me and I am tempted to brush it aside as time wasting. The hon. Gentleman knows that if a light bulb is cut, it destroys the value of the asset.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that light bulbs should be divided individually? He should go away and read up on the legal concept of equity. Assets that are joined together can be owned jointly. Their value cannot be split without dividing the asset itself. The idea of equity and privatisation is a new Labour concept. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman's old Labour conscience is stirring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The explanatory note makes it clear that the transfer scheme covers up the fact that a licensed and a non-licensed activity will be separated. The way in which that is managed has implications for employees.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend is right. There are not merely implications for human resources and the organisation of the CAA and NATS operations—matters such as the pension scheme will also be affected. We have not yet established the working of the pension arrangements. If I remember correctly, there is a single CAA pension scheme. A separate pension scheme for the new employees will have to be established. Unless present NATS employees are to remain in the existing scheme, it will have to be split. Such assets and liabilities of the business will have to be dealt with through the complex and arduous process.

<P>

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Will not a change of ownership—whether a change under a public-private partnership or one between private owners—mean a consequential change of pension scheme for affected employees? The hon. Gentleman might have filled 10 minutes, but what he has said has not increased the sum of the Committee's knowledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We would be interested in the hon. Gentleman's experience of the matter. Having taken part in the transfer of the ownership of bus companies, the hon. Gentleman found himself on the opposite side to many of his hon. Friends in the considerable row about the pension liabilities of those companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am not sure how long you will allow the exchange to continue, Mr. Gale. The hon. Gentleman is wrong again. The transfer of assets in which I was involved was initially between a municipal undertaking and what was then known as an ESOP—an employee share ownership scheme. There was no controversy—we merely established a mirror-image pension scheme. The same will presumably happen here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he established a mirror-image pension scheme. He knows that I was referring to a pension scheme in which the legal advice was changed regarding what could happen to the surplus after the transaction. We are dealing with a funded pension scheme.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I said that I was prepared to allow a wide-ranging debate on the purposes of the clause, and I am. However, I am not prepared to admit a debate on amendment No. 358, which we shall come to shortly. I hope that we may now return to the broader debate that the Committee wished to have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale—I know that we shall discuss the pension scheme. In conclusion, we must know whether the Government intend to establish a mirror-image pension scheme, to which members of the existing scheme will be transferred. Will the obligations to the present pension arrangements be honoured? The transfer raises another matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> What the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East said was relevant. His example was of one clean transaction. My concern about safety was that there would be a double transaction, which would seem to cause unnecessary work, delay and management distraction. I would like to get to the bottom of that matter; the hon. Gentleman missed my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I understood my hon. Friend's point. I hope that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East also did.
<P>
Why is the provision for many of the transfers necessary? The main business of National Air Traffic Services is already domiciled in a limited company, which should be capable of being subject to the public-private process—there should be no need to transfer the business to a new company. We must change the articles of association and, perhaps, other aspects of the company, but I do not see why we must establish a ``newco''—to use the jargon—and transfer the assets from the existing company to the new one, as the amendment would provide.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would elucidate how those processes will work and say why so much flexibility is necessary and when he expects the transfers to be made. Will they be made during the negotiations with the potential strategic partner or will the transfers not take place until the agreements are in place? Will the transfers be affected by the scope of the negotiations with the strategic partner, and will that partner have an influence over what is and is not transferred? Will the Minister ensure that what is transferred is a secure stand-alone business, which can say goodbye to the strategic partner, if it needs to, at a later date? I regret the fact that we need to bring the strategic partner into the equation at all. Management would be perfectly capable of raising their own capital to run their own businesses, if Ministers would allow proper privatisation to take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I was listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that what he just said suggests that the more likely way to achieve that end would be to establish an independent publicly owned company?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As we progress through the Bill, it will be interesting to see whether an IPOC is a more viable interim solution than the present public-private partnership. We must consider not only the views that have been expressed in Committee, but those of the House on Report as well as those expressed in the other place. The hybrid public-private partnership—which we would call a botched privatisation—is not the most obvious or satisfactory way to proceed. I want an assurance from the Minister that the nature of the transfers envisaged under the schemes will not close off those other options. The important point is that the partnership route, whereby assets are transferred to the final partnership company—for want of a better phrase—would ensure that the company would have the necessary assets to carry on its business and would not be overly dependent on the support of a strategic partner. We want the partner to bring in money, but the management do not need anything else. The whole purpose of a strategic partner, and the whole reason why the business is being transferred, is for the money; there is no vision of creating a new British company. This is all about getting the Treasury out of the hair of the management, so that they can raise some money. We do not want to create a situation in which the management are left without certain assets and are not sufficiently independent from the strategic partner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The implication of what the hon. Gentleman says is that the Government are taking this route only to bring in additional, much-needed funds for further investment. I understand the importance of that, but hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have agreed that another objective is to bring in expertise from the private sector to work with management in the provision and development of services. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that that does not have to be done through the part-privatisation route and that it could be achieved through the establishment of an independent publicly owned company, which could bring in expertise from the private sector? I acknowledge that it could also be done by total privatisation, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, although I oppose that route.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. Such a transfer scheme is necessary only because the Deputy Prime Minister keeps losing his battles with the Treasury. During the Second Reading debate, I think it was the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Gordon Prentice) who turned around to his colleagues on the Back Benches and said something like, ``We do not need to do this. The Government are awash with money.'' As the hon. Gentleman will know, the Government are running what they regard as a big surplus because of all the stealth tax increases that they have imposed and because they look only at the current account. [Interruption.] This Committee is a fast track to the future, at least for Conservative Members. I am extremely pleased with the progress of my latest protégé.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Give him a job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am touched by the intense interest that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East takes in my every movement, gesture and word, and I see that he is listening again now. However, we must make progress.
<P>
I want to take up the point raised by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Don Foster). It is not only a question of money but of bringing in new management skills and giving freedom to management. I reiterate that this will merely be a massive distraction for management.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is why we recommended straightforward privatisation. I do not know whether transfer schemes would be necessary in any privatisation, not just the Government's privatisation. I look to the Minister for clarification, My hon. Friend is right. The two elements that will benefit NATS most are access to capital and management freedom. To that extent, the strategic partner will not bring very much to the party. In fact, the strategic partner is just a fig-leaf to cover up the fact that this is privatisation. In hanging on to the 49 per cent. stake and the transfer of the 5 per cent. stake to management, and limiting the strategic partner to 46 per cent., the Government hope that their Back Benchers will concentrate on the 46 per cent. and not the fact that 51 per cent. of the shares will be moved into private hands. This is all a front by the Government to avoid the charge that they have done a U-turn on their undertaking not to privatise the business.
<P>
The business needs access to capital and freedom for management. We are concerned that, by allowing Ministers too much flexibility in the manner of the transfers and allowing the strategic partner to influence which assets are finally transferred, management will be freed from one set of chains but delivered into another—the chains of the strategic partner, albeit with the controls and safeguards that will be necessary to look after the public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> One of the areas that we should probe is the £35 million cost relating to PPP, referred to in the explanatory memorandum. How much of that cost relates to the transfer scheme and the separation of business and does it include any redundancy or official business costs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is an interesting question. How much of the £35 million referred to in the explanatory memorandum will be take up by the transfers and how many firms of accountants will be involved in drawing up accountancy reports? [Laughter.] I can see that I have amused the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East. The irony is that Labour Members used to criticise the Conservative Government for that reason. I raised the matter because I know that many Labour Members used to feel passionately about it when they were in opposition, and they may be anxious. It is not that we think that spending money on consultancy fees is unnecessary, although it must be watched, but it used to be regarded as a bad thing, full stop. Now, the proportion of fees in the proceeds realised from the sale is astronomically high.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. When I was doing the job, parliamentary private secretaries were seen and not heard. Would the conversations on the Back Benches please cease? If Members wish to talk among themselves, they must do so outside the Committee Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am happy to give way if anyone wants to intervene, but I do not think that they have anything to say. When I was in venture capital, in my previous life, we reckoned that if—
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to do so, I shall continue. If the fees in any transaction were more than 5 per cent. of the gross consideration it was regarded as a dodgy deal, because it meant that the people involved were doing the deal for the fees, not the deal itself.
<P>
The maximum gross consideration in this case is £600 million and £35 million is certainly more than 5 per cent. That causes anxiety about how much is being spent on fees. However, moving the business out of the public sector can be a complex matter and I suspect that it will involve considerably more expense than going for a flotation because the Government want a strategic partner, which is an expensive process in itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am moved only to remark that the Committee might have been more impressed by the hon. Gentleman's speech had he made it when he was a venture capitalist rather than an Opposition spokesman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am hurt. I thought that I was bringing the benefit of outside experience to the task of trying to understand what the Government intend. That is what Members of Parliament are meant to do. The experience of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East in the bus industry is valuable to the Committee and we are looking forward to what he has to say about later clauses, especially those with which he does not agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Further to the intervention of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East, has it occurred to my hon. Friend that the three Ministers in the Committee do not have direct experience of the industry, according to their biographical details. It is in the interests of the accountants, the professional advisers and the lawyers to make the process as complicated and costly as possible. The second stage is completely unnecessary. It may have been slipped in and Ministers are too naïve and inexperienced to have spotted it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We must be on our guard for ministerial inexperience; I was about to rush to the defence of the Under-Secretary, but I shall give way to him.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> I do not wish to make too much of my business experience, but for two years I ran a small company that employed 10 people. It was in debt when I took it over and had money in the bank when I left.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman. He, too, brings useful business experience to the Committee. I have no doubt that that will have been noted by my hon. Friend.
<P>
I remind the Committee of Benjamin Disraeli's remark to Lord Derby, whom he was trying to persuade to become Chancellor of the Exchequer. Lord Derby said, ``But I'm hopeless with figures,'' to which Disraeli replied, ``Don't worry. They give you the figures.'' My confidence in the Government's accounting practice and, indeed, their ability to control fees rests partly on the competence of the civil service. Ultimately, we must hope that the fees and costs of the deal will be better controlled than indicated in the memorandum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> There has been a slight misunderstanding of my argument, which is not that there will be a lack of control, or that there will not be careful auditing within the structure set out in the proposal, but that the structure is unnecessarily complicated because it is in the interests of the professionals, legal advisers and accountants to string out the process for as long as possible and bag the fees. I am sure that everything will be carefully audited when the bills come in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The public-private partnership issue has been hanging around for a long time. It has been dragging on for two and a half years since the Government first contemplated the idea and I imagine that much of that £35 million has already been spent. Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us what proportion of the amount has already been committed and spent, and whether the £35 million for fees is likely to be exceeded.
<P>
To become too preoccupied with fees now would be a mistake, as we shall discuss financial matters later. We should concentrate on why the definition of a transfer scheme is so widely drawn that the Secretary of State can move anything anywhere, as long as it remains in the public sector. The scheme's moment of conception is later in the Bill; we are discussing not the privatisation but the definition of the transfer scheme and by drawing its definition so widely the Secretary of State has huge scope to specify what shall be the final assets in the company. I have asked several questions about that matter and I shall be grateful if the Minister will reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I have tried to understand why the Bill contains an unnecessary, intermediate stage. It comes to a head in clause 40(2), which amendment No. 296, tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for North Essex, for Poole and for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), would amend. There is not much elucidation in the explanatory notes. The Ministers have been good enough to give us comprehensive documents on the draft articles of association, although they arrived late, but there is little on the transfer scheme. The introduction to the subject in the explanatory notes states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Transfer schemes are the means by which shares in the current air traffic services provider will be transferred out of the CAA's ownership and into Crown ownership, in readiness for partial sale.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My immediate reaction is to ask why cannot there be a straight sale—a one-off transaction to save time, trouble and effort? The explanation may lie in the next line, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The transfer of ownership is the means by which the objective of separating the CAA's regulatory functions from the provision of services is achieved.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not satisfied with that explanation. I do not understand why the transaction cannot be made in one go. As we have discussed, expensive lawyers will be involved and much civil service time will be spent in analysing who does what. Surely it should be done in one hit. The explanatory notes continue:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The transfer scheme provisions also allow the corporate structure of the air traffic service provider's business to be reorganised in light of the new licensing regime and the proposed public private partnership.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The second paragraph of the introduction states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Clause 40 deals with the meaning of a transfer scheme, and describes what may be transferred and the parties between whom transfers can be made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is pretty thin gruel for a cumbersome, intermediate stage in the process. In an intervention, I mentioned management, and my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex touched on the inventory that will be taken under clause 2, which relates to the CAA's property rights; we also mentioned the pension scheme. That will be a major distraction for whoever is involved. There should be one process, once and for all, because it will have to be gone through again in the second stage, which we shall discuss later in the Bill. The temporary plateau will absorb the management time that should be devoted to the maintenance of a good air safety system. It will also put off prospective players. There will be a delay, but we want continuity. A swift, smooth transfer to the new set-up will enable the management to get on with their job of improving our air safety system.
<P>
The amendment is sensible. Analysing assets requires a great deal of work. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Geraint Davies) mentioned light bulbs. Valuing assets will cause upheaval and turmoil and it is unnecessary to do it twice. It is important for public confidence that the process is carried out swiftly. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh is concerned about that. How long will the process take? How much will it cost? How many people will be dedicated to the task? Who will oversee the project?
<P>
I touched on the role of the professionals. There are huge fees to be made from privatisation. My point is serious. It is difficult to create an effective scheme without professional advice. Everyone is human. There is an incentive for professional advisers to produce an arrangement that will take a long time to come into effect because they are paid by the hour. I see that the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) grins, but that is the reality. It is in their interests to have a lengthy process. Instead of producing a safety gain, the provision will distract the management and remunerate professional advisers and lawyers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Our wide-ranging debate started with a succinct contribution by the hon. Member for Poole, after which we were given a less succinct tour of the horizon and beyond by the hon. Member for North Essex. I shall avoid inciting anti-European spasms on the Opposition Benches by not using French. I missed the incisive contributions of the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo), whose brief sojourn on the Committee was described by the hon. Member for North Essex as a fast track for the future. He and his colleagues live in hope that they, too, will follow a similar trajectory. I suspect that this may not be the right time to mention this, but will we see the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) on the Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is correct. This is not the right time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Bath gave us a preview of the main thrust of his speech on the next group of amendments in his doomed attempt to persuade the Conservative party of the merits of an IPOC. The hon. Member for North Staffordshire—

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> It is North Shropshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I apologise. It is interesting that Opposition Members represent the northern part of their respective counties of Essex, Shropshire and Wiltshire. The hon. Member for North Shropshire implied that Ministers have no business experience. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), corrected him about his business experience. If the hon. Gentleman had been more assiduous in his reading of Members' biographies, he would know that I ran a small company between 1987 and 1992, when I was not able to pursue a career here.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I did not mean any slur. The print-out lists the Minister's previous occupations as being a market researcher and housing consultant. I did not realise that that involved running a business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The housing consultancy was a business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Was my hon. Friend's business a family business, like that of the hon. Member for North Shropshire? May I say that my dad did not run a bus company?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister cannot pursue that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the company was called Raynsford and Morris, my hon. Friend will realise that it had a strong family connection, although I established it.
<P>
I shall give an overview of the transfer scheme before dealing with the amendment. Three principal concerns emerge from the plethora of comments. The first, which was expressed by the hon. Member for North Essex, is that the wording is unnecessarily complex. He was unclear about the purpose of all the provisions. The second concern is the fear that the powers go wider than is necessary for air traffic control purposes. The Secretary of State's powers in the transfer cover a range of eventualities.
<P>
The third concern, which was raised by the hon. Member for North Shropshire, was that the separation of regulatory and operational functions might not be necessary but that is fundamental to what we are doing. There is unanimity on the need for that and it was strongly recommended by the Transport Sub-Committee. It is in keeping with good practice in regulated industries that there should be a clear separation between the regulator and operational body. That is the principal purpose of the transfer. It will completely separate the CAA from the operating body that it will regulate. The additional purpose is to make it possible for the Secretary of State to sell shares to the strategic partner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I ask this purely for elucidation because I subscribe to the consensus view. What is the Minister's response to the criticism that, because air traffic control is a safety regulatory business, it is a false distinction to describe air traffic control as operational when it is regulatory in character and effect? It is designed to regulate the safe separation of aircraft in our skies. We are creating a false dichotomy. One or two of the Minister's hon. Friends have made that criticism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> One could argue that railways are a business in which the safety regulation function is intrinsic and that there is, therefore, no reason for separating operational from regulatory functions. However, the previous Government believed that there was a case for taking such action and that is the framework with which we are now working. We believe that there is a case for exactly the same provision in air traffic control which, as everyone knows, is a rapidly evolving field in which relationships between the various bodies will change significantly. The need for absolute clarity in the maintenance of regulation and safety standards is paramount. That is the reason for the huge consensus to which the hon. Gentleman referred, which is in favour of the separation of the regulatory from the operational functions.
<P>
It was suggested that the Government had no vision on air traffic control. I must tell Opposition Members who voiced such concerns that we have a clear vision. We want a strong and effective air traffic control system that is capable of dealing with the real challenges that will come in the years ahead, during which the structure of air traffic control in Europe could change dramatically. We want our air traffic control system to be well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise.
<P>
I think that there is a large measure of agreement on that desire. We heard about the importance of management skills as part of the new structure and about the need for investment to establish systems that can tackle the needs that will arise in the years ahead. We believe that the PPP is the best way forward, although we do not have a dogmatic view about that. A management-led bid is not ruled out and neither is a not-for-profit option—both are possible under the new framework. The process will be competitive and is not being undertaken just for the money but to strengthen management. The need for that process is widely accepted, including among management staff, who see its advantages. That is why we are introducing it.
<P>
I was asked about the cost of the process and whether it is a gravy train for the advisers. The cost is estimated to be in the range of £35 million, which is modest in comparison with that incurred on some previous privatisation ventures. I accept that we must be as prudent as possible, but we must have access to expert advice on matters such as those referred to by the hon. Member for North Shropshire, who rightly said that such issues were complex and that the Government must seek advice on them.
<P>
We want to minimise the costs, but we shall not stint on expert advice in ensuring that the correct structure is in place to enable air traffic control systems to develop successfully and safely during the coming years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I asked what proportion of the fees had already been committed. Will the Minister deal with that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I was about to say, I do not have detailed figures to hand. I shall, however, look into the matter and write to the hon. Gentleman I assure him that the estimated figures cover property reorganisation and the need for separation of IT and similar systems, all of which are necessary to separate NATS from the CAA to ensure separation of the regulator from the operating company. They also cover the legal and financial advice that are necessary to enable that process to proceed. A raft of measures is involved, so I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's question and write to him, informing him of the cost that has so far been incurred.
<P>
The clause makes provision for the use of transfer schemes to effect the necessary reorganisation of the industry prior to sale. It will allow property, rights and liabilities to be transferred between the Secretary of State, the CAA and NATS, including any of its subsidiary companies, prior to the establishment of the PPP. All of the bodies are within the public sector, which is clear in the definition contained in subsection (2) of the clause.
<P>
There are three reasons for using transfer schemes. First, without legislation, the CAA would have no power to transfer its shares in NATS to the Secretary of State or to a holding company. Secondly, transfer schemes will ensure that the transfer of assets, rights and liabilities can be achieved within the desired timetable. If we depended on using private law for transfers, there would always be a risk of delay, particularly with the involvement of third parties and the need for consultation. The hon. Member for North Shropshire feared that what we are doing might cause delay. On the contrary, we are doing it precisely to be clear about the timetable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> On the Minister's first point, would it not have been possible simply to amend existing CAA legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the legislation needs to be amended. We think it right to put a new framework in place as the basis on which both parties—the regulator and the operating company—will operate. Existing law is based on the premise that those two are integral. Trying to amend those provisions to create two different structures would lead, I suspect, to considerable—possibly counter-productive—complexities. Exactly those problems of over-complex legislation that the hon. Gentleman identified would result. In view of our vision of a new structure and relationship it seemed better to start with tabula rasa, if I may use a foreign language without incurring odium. That is Latin, so it goes back a long time.
<P>
The third reason for a transfer scheme is that it provides the greatest certainty about the respective rights and obligations of the transferor, the transferee and any affected third parties. Under subsection (2) any of the CAA's property, rights and liabilities can be transferred to the Secretary of State, to a company wholly owned by the Crown, to a company wholly owned by the CAA—for example, NATS—and to a wholly owned subsidiary of either of those two categories of company. Under subsection (3), the property, rights and liabilities of NATS can be transferred to the Secretary of State, the CAA and to a wholly owned subsidiary of NATS or a company wholly owned by the Crown.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This is where I get confused. What is the difference between subsections (2) and (3)? They seem to say the same thing differently. I hope that the Minister will forgive my confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There are many occasions when I, too, wonder why parliamentary counsel has chosen a longer way than one might have wished to draft a provision. However, close examination will reveal that subsection (2) deals with provisions for the transfer of any of the CAA's property, rights or liabilities to the entities in the list. It concerns the power that enables the transfers to happen. Subsection (3) covers the transfer of any of the property, rights and liabilities of a company wholly owned by the CAA, or all or part of the transferor's undertakings, to any of the entities listed. It is intended that the provisions should cover all the items that might be transferred.
<P>
The wording appears complex, I agree, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand the distinction between the power to effect the transfer and the process involved.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am afraid that I am still confused. What is the difference between
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any of the CAA's property, rights or liabilities''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the property, rights or liabilities of a company (the transferor) which is wholly owned by the CAA''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The two are similar. Subsection (2) deals with transfers from the CAA to NATS, whereas subsection (3) can involve a transfer from NATS to the CAA. There is a separation between the two bodies and both eventualities must be allowed for. The language does not make matters clear, but a two-way process is envisaged and differentiation is needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If we are dealing with transfers from the CAA to NATS or from NATS to the CAA, why is it necessary to go into details about the Secretary of State or whether the company is owned by the Crown? Far too many eventualities—far beyond what the Minister described—seem to be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman will remember that we are considering separating NATS from the CAA and establishing a new company in which a strategic partner will work with NATS, with the CAA as regulator. The Secretary of State—[Interruption.] Should I continue, Mr. Gale?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes. We must try to continue and put up with these things from time to time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am simply worried that this might be a real fire.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Let me assure the Committee that the alarm is in hon. Members' interests.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In my newspaper this morning, I read a review of a theatrical production last night that was interrupted when one of the actors shouted ``Real fire!'' The performance was halted for 10 minutes. I am told that a device that simulated fire for the production had overheated a little. I hope that that has not happened here.
<P>
I was explaining that the process will move from the current stage through an intermediate one to the final outcome. The Secretary of State must be involved in the process. Also, there will be a transfer of property and rights and liabilities between the different parties, which could be a two-way process. The wording of the Bill must make that possible and cover a wide range of eventualities.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex expressed concern that the measure might go way beyond the provision of air traffic control. I assure him that nothing can be done that falls without the overriding purposes of the Bill, which are about the provision of air traffic services. However, within the provision of those services, assets of many kinds will need to be acquired, some of which may initially have had no relationship at all with the provision of air traffic services. An insufficiently broad wording could, for example, make it impossible to obtain a lease on land for a beacon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Subsection (5) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``anything . . . anything . . . anything . . . anything . . . anything'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e). I should have thought that the beacon in the Minister's example was very relevant to air traffic services. Can he give an example of anything not related to air traffic services which the relevant body might want to transfer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I gave the hon. Gentleman an example. The land would, when the lease was taken out and before the beacon was located there, have no application to air traffic services. Conversely, a lease might be held on land where a beacon had ceased to be used. There are bound to be circumstances of that kind and it would be very unfortunate if legal difficulties about the transfer prevented the quick and orderly conduct of the matter which the hon. Member for North Shropshire rightly stressed. That is why subsection (5) is drawn widely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I regard the acquisition of land for a beacon as connected with air traffic services. The phrase ``for a connected purpose'' would perhaps be used in the Bill. Similarly, the disposal of redundant land would be connected with the business of air traffic services. However, there seems to be no qualification. The business could, hypothetically, transfer a hotel in Tenerife—that would fit the description. What is an example of something unconnected with air traffic services? The Minister has given an example of something that is connected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not understand. He said with great confidence—I admire him for that—that a piece of land would clearly be connected with air traffic control services because a beacon had been on it, one would be on it, or because there was an aspiration to put one on it. The other party interested in the land might not share that confidence—it might dispute the judgment and challenge the transfer. All the fears expressed by the Opposition about the power of lawyers to increase their income through litigation would come into play. We have done this precisely because, were the measure not broadly worded, there would be a risk of litigation, of challenge and of the process being delayed.
<P>
I should assure the hon. Gentleman about his hotel in Tenerife. As I said earlier, the provision—and the Secretary of State—is governed by the purposes set out in clauses 1 and 2, which we considered, as it seems now, a long time ago. Ultimately, the purposes concern the provision of air traffic control services. That is my reassurance to the hon. Gentleman. Even if it was intended to put a beacon on the roof of a hotel in Tenerife, the Secretary of State, NATS or the CAA could not acquire or transfer the hotel. He can feel confident with that guarantee, even if he is worried about our granting powers of effective transfer to the parties.
<P>
Subsection (4) extends the definition of property rights and liabilities to include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all or part of an undertaking''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (5) lists things that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may be transferred by a scheme''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was unhappy about subsection (5). Subsection (6) provides that the transfer scheme may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``divide any property, rights or liabilities''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so create a new interest in such property or new rights and liabilities in respect of a transferor and a transferee. The scheme may also make incidental provisions as to such interests, rights and liabilities.
<P>
Subsection (7) allows the transfer scheme to impose a duty on the transferor or the transferee to ensure that any interest, right or liability, or any related incidental provision created under subsection (6), is effective in practice. I was asked whether the subsection would remain in force permanently, or whether it should be subject to a time limit. I should make it clear that transfer schemes provided under the chapter are to be used for the establishment of the PPP. The test, as should be clear from subsections (2) and (3), is that the bodies should be in 100 per cent. Crown ownership. Of course, once the PPP is established, the test will no longer be met and the provisions will no longer be relevant. That is the safeguard against the need for a time-limited provision.
<P>
Subsection (8) provides that schemes may impose an obligation on the transferor or transferee to enter into written agreement with each other or with a third party. Such agreements are to be binding on all parties.
<P>
Subsection (9) provides for the inclusion in a transfer scheme of supplemental provisions, which the scheme's maker thinks appropriate, to ensure its effectiveness.
<P>
I hope that that has given the broadest outline of the purpose and nature of clause 40 and the purpose of transfer schemes. I should now turn to the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Poole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister described the property reorganisation required by the transfer schemes. Will he say what the major property transfers will be, and will he comment on information technology systems? He might like to deal with the property issue first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The property involved will be that held by any of the parties, which is essentially property used for the purpose of air traffic control systems. Ancillary property may be available, for beacons, for example. IT systems are extremely important for the provision of air traffic control systems. The splitting of the operational IT systems from the regulatory systems is crucial to establishing the separation, which is an integral part of the process. There will thus be existing systems and investment in the development of software and other rights and liabilities necessary to separate the parties.
<P>
The amendments would ensure, broadly speaking, that the only property rights or liabilities that may be transferred by the CAA under a transfer scheme are those used or incurred by the CAA in the provision of air traffic services prior to the Bill coming into force. The amendments would require that any transfers made under a transfer scheme by a company wholly owned by the CAA could be made only by such a company when it was involved in providing air traffic services.
<P>
The amendments are technically flawed. The provision of air traffic services was delegated by the CAA to NATS with effect from 1 April 1996. It is therefore unlikely, to track the wording of amendment No. 296, that the CAA would have property, or rights, that it uses or exercises in the provision of air traffic services. All such property or rights should be used or exercised by NATS, but there may be some held but not used by the CAA in the provision of air traffic services which, perhaps through inadvertence, have not yet been transferred to NATS. I mentioned rights, including the leases of land used for the siting of beacons. That is the only identifiable right of which we are aware at present, although there may be others.
<P>
The property or rights will be required by NATS for the performance of its functions. They will therefore need to be transferred to NATS prior to the PPP, but the amendment would prevent that. That is why it is technically flawed.
<P>
A wider implication is that the amendment may prevent the transfer of the shares in NATS from the CAA to the Crown on the basis that the shares in NATS are not property or rights used or exercised in, or as a direct consequence of, the provision of air traffic services. It is a fine legal point, but fine legal points exercise the minds of many lawyers. As I explained, the need to transfer the shares in NATS is one of the principal reasons for incorporating transfer schemes provisions in the Bill and if the amendment were accepted, the entire PPP reorganisation might be thrown into doubt.
<P>
Similarly, as I said earlier, NATS is at present the only company wholly owned by the CAA. Amendment No 299, therefore, is superfluous, as we are aware that NATS is engaged in the provision of air traffic services. On a more general point, the rationale for the hon. Gentleman's amendments is an anxiety that clause 40 may be used to achieve objectives that are unrelated to the preparation of NATS for the PPP, and therefore unrelated to part I. That is not the intention, and in any case it would not be possible, as it is, as I said, implicit that any actions taken by virtue of the powers conferred in the Bill must be taken for purposes connected with the Bill, as defined at the outset. A transfer scheme not connected with the preparation of NATS for the PPP would therefore not be permitted. For those reasons, the amendments would not assist in the preparation of NATS for the PPP and might even render the process more difficult. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
The Government intend to introduce an amendment to clause 40; we recognise a weakness and change is needed. The amendment has not yet been drafted, but it will be tabled on Report. Its purpose will be to allow transfer schemes involving NATS to take place both before and after the transfer of its shares from the CAA to the Crown. At present, the Bill provides only for the transfer while NATS is owned by the CAA and there could be problems if no transfer was permitted subsequently. An amendment will be tabled to rectify the matter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for North Essex, I must say that I am sure that that information is helpful to the Committee, but I cannot allow a debate on an amendment that has not yet been tabled.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was about to come to that, but I appreciate that we cannot discuss the matter now.
<P>
IT systems are inherent to the safety of the whole operation. I appreciate that the Minister was probably talking about the separation of payrolls and administrative systems, not air traffic systems. However, can he assure the Committee that we are not embarking on a dangerous set of changes to the core business of NATS and its IT systems, which, as we know, are beset by difficulties, problems and complexities? To echo the anxiety of other members of the Committee, notably the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh, I should hate to think that the PPP would disrupt the on-going work of NATS in the supervision of air traffic movements. Will the hon. Gentleman assure us that we are not talking about those IT systems, but a much lower order of IT systems?
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's explanation of the provision and I understand that the need for absolute powers to be given to Ministers to put things into effect quickly is essential. He said that the provision allows private law to be circumscribed, as a result of which it gives Ministers the power to set aside rights that third parties might have under other civil contracts, such as leases on land or items of plant and equipment. Will he give an assurance that, to his knowledge, no material rights of third parties will be set aside and that no one will suffer financial loss through the exercise of such powers by circumscribing the usual procedures required under private law?
<P>
I understand that the Government are replicating what normally exists in a lease and that it is intended to create the CAA, NATS and the Crown as one entity. Therefore, any transfer within that entity is not a transfer of beneficial ownership. In the normal terms of a lease, the transfer of obligations or liabilities under a lease would not constitute beneficial control. Technically, consent will still be required in those circumstances to inform the lessors. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the normal courtesies would be observed and that, although Ministers would have the power to disregard them, it would be usual practice under such circumstances for Ministers to inform third parties of what was going on, as though they had such an obligation under private law? I am sure that the Minister wants to do things as decently as possible.
<P>
The Minister has not yet told us whether the company that currently contains NATS—the present company shell, NATS Ltd.—is to be the partnership company, or whether it is intended to start with a clean sheet, such as a new off-the-shelf company, renamed, say, NATS 2000 Ltd., with new articles of association and so on? It is normal practice under such circumstances to give confidence, particularly to third-party investors, by assuring them that no history is involved and that the party will start with a clean sheet. Is it the Government's intention to set up a new company? If so, that would improve the confidence of any third-party investor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I asked a couple of questions earlier. One was about the time scale, but I might have missed the answer. I had to slip out because of my disgusting cough. Will the Minister give us an idea of the time scale for the process of the transfer? The other question was a practical one: who will oversee the process? Clearly there will be conflicts of interest among those who stay in the CAA and those who move on to the new arrangement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex has raised a number of further points. I can give him the assurance that he seeks about the IT systems being essentially low-level systems to ensure payroll and other administrative functions, which was his primary concern. Secondly, however, I cannot give him the absolute assurance that he wants on private interests. The nature of those interests is such that individuals might seek compensation if they considered that their interests had been prejudiced by the exercise of the powers. It is not the intention in any way to depart from the normal courtesies. I have already assured the hon. Member for Poole that it is simply a necessary process to ensure that we can proceed on the timetable. The timetable is important and we do not want to be caught in a position where protracted litigation could make it impossible to meet the obligations under the provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If rights were satisfied, would compensation be payable, or does the provision absolve the Secretary of State from paying compensation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can give the assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks. We do not intend to use the powers to set aside normal entitlements, but we have to have a safeguard against protracted litigation preventing us from being able to proceed according to the timetable because of a possible claim for a right in land which might lead to a claim for compensation. It is a hypothetical situation, which is why I cannot give the absolute guarantee that no individual's financial interest will be affected in any way. It is not our intention, however, to use the power to ride roughshod over the normal expectations. We will ensure that the proper courtesies are afforded; people should be aware of what is happening under the provisions.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman then asked a perfectly proper question about the nature of the company. I shall link that with a previous question about the role of the various parties in the transfer and the timetable. The reason for going through those intermediate stages is partly to ensure that the purpose of the separation of regulation from service provision is fully achieved. It would not be satisfactory if the body that was due to become the regulator had an interest in the process of sale to the operational body. That is why it would be inappropriate to proceed directly within the current structure to the sale of the 46 per cent. of shares in the new company: the regulator would have a direct interest in the selection of the strategic partner, which could not be right. The intermediate stage is therefore necessary to create the new NATS group structure, which will consist of a holding company with two subsidiaries: one regulated, dealing with the monopoly services, and the other, as was described earlier, covering the non-monopoly services that are outside the licence, which is subject to an exemption rather than to the licence. That is the purpose of the structure.
<P>
At the same time, the investment in NATS has to be transferred from the CAA to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State can then oversee the process—the hon. Member for North Shropshire asked who would be overseeing it—to ensure that there is no question of the regulator having an interest in the appointment of the strategic partner. At that point, when the assets and liabilities are in the correct companies, the selection of the strategic partner can take place because the strategic partner will become an integral part of the new NATS company. Whether it is called NATS 2000, NATS 2001 or some other name, I cannot say at this stage. Perhaps we could have a small, informal competition in the Committee to devise the best name for the company. That, however, is not part of the Bill and I will not stray further from my remit. I hope I have answered the questions and that the hon. Member for Poole will now agree to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I apologise for detaining the Committee on this, but I am concerned about what the Minister said about the amendment that he proposes to introduce to clause 40. I appreciate your strictures, Mr. Gale, but, although I listened, I did not quite understand the purpose of the amendment. If I understood it correctly, it would extend the transfer powers to a time after the company had been split and a new company formed. If that were the case, it would then conflict—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have already ruled on this matter. While it may be tantalising, we cannot debate an amendment that has not been tabled. The Minister has clearly stimulated interest. He may even wish to write to hon. Members on the subject. However, until such time as an amendment is tabled, it cannot be debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> On a point of order, Mr Gale. I apologise and I do not want to appear to be arguing—well, perhaps I am—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Oh no you are not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The Minister did mention that amendment and I did not quite understand it. I am worried that it might have significant impact on clause 40. I was going to ask the Minister to repeat what he had said, so that I could better understand it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is abundantly plain: I have ruled the matter out of order. If I had known in advance what the Minister was going to say, I would have ruled it out before he said it. Unfortunately, Chairmen are blessed with many things but crystal balls are not one of them or even two of them. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said that he would like hot towels behind his head. He is absolutely right. Clause 40 and the amendments are complicated and it is difficult for us to grasp exactly what is meant. We have managed to get a lot of additional information on this particular part of the process, and that will be very useful for us. We understand that not only is the transfer scheme a separate regulatory regime from NATS, but it reorganises the business so that, once the scheme is implemented, the business is in the position whereby the Secretary of State can start to sort out a strategic partner.
<P>
It was helpful of the Minister to tell us about the £35 million. It does make more sense, beyond solicitors' and accountants' fees and generally useful advice, to understand that some of that sum has to do with property costs and IT systems. No doubt, not only will some of these costs fall on the national air traffic side, but some will fall on the CAA side. There is concern that the regulatory side should have systems up and running to enable it to continue its very valuable role. On the whole I am satisfied with the amendments and the assurances given by the Minister so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
I now advise the Committee that, having had a wide-ranging debate upon the whole clause, I shall expect Members to concentrate entirely upon the amendments under discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Mr Gale, as you rightly said, we have had a wide-ranging debate on the issue of transfers and I am sure the entire Committee is very grateful to the Minister for having given us so much information. You may have observed that while I was listening to part of the Minister's contribution, I had to stoop down and so appeared to be in a somewhat reverential position. The Committee may be interested to know that, although it might have had something to do at that time with the positioning of the sun since for much of his speech, from where I was sitting, the Minister appeared to have a halo over his head.
<P>
I move on to amendment No. 83 and those that you have chosen to group with it, Mr. Gale. The Committee will be aware that I proposed earlier the establishment of an independent publicly owned company as an alternative arrangement for the future operation of National Air Traffic Services. I must be honest with you, Mr. Gale, and with the Committee and say that the amendments now tabled in my name were drafted at that time as part of our overall proposals in relation to that proposal. I am sure that you do not wish us to discuss the establishment of an IPOC again, given that we have done so at length before so I do not intend to do so, but I was somewhat surprised by the Minister's comment that the Liberal Democrat proposals were doomed if we sought to attract the support of Tory Members.
<P>
It is clear from the comments made by the hon. Member for North Essex that he prefers our IPOC proposal to the Government's part-privatisation. It would at least provide a halfway house and the Minister should prepare for a more robust debate on the issue now that we have with us the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh. I note with interest that today the issue is being debated not only in the Committee but in the Scottish Parliament.
<P>
I do not wish to stretch your patience, Mr. Gale, and bring about the first example in this Committee of your famed irascibility. Notwithstanding the original intention behind the amendments, they remain valid in relation to the clause and the specific issue of transfers. In our earlier, more wide-ranging debate the Minister acknowledged that hon. Members had some difficulty in understanding, for example, clause 40(2) and (3). He admitted that the draftsman could have simplified the wording The amendments have the effect of doing so. A number of lines are deleted, thereby simplifying the subsections and making life easier not only for the Minister but for all members of the Committee. Simplification of itself is not necessarily good and it may be appropriate and necessary to make legislation more complex if the Government's purpose is to be fulfilled.
<P>
The cost of transfer and other aspects of the part-privatisation has also been raised. A figure of £35 million has already been referred to today and is explained without any detail in the financial part of the explanatory memorandum. One of the advantages of the amendments now proposed is that by deleting some of the group structures that would have to be considered, we would reduce the cost of effecting the changes.
<P>
Reference has been made to the financial acumen of former Members of Parliament, especially by the hon. Member for North Essex. I was surprised that he did not mention the well-known acumen of a former Conservative Prime Minister, Alec Douglas-Home, who clearly and honestly admitted that he considered Budget matters only with the assistance of a box of matches.
<P>
Reference has also been made to the business expertise of several members of the Committee. I draw the Committee's attention to the expertise of my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) who once worked effectively—others may not have made the same judgment—in accountancy. Were he to catch your eye, Mr. Gale, he might make some interesting revelations on the cost to the Government of continuing in the way proposed in clause 40. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend would say that the amendments could significantly reduce the cost of the transfers proposed by the Government.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for North Essex raised a number of interesting points, and sought to assist the Government by pointing out that we should look carefully at the costs caused by the impact of clause 40. I confess to being surprised that the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) remained seated while the hon. Member for North Essex was speaking and that he did not seek to intervene. Throughout our deliberations, the hon. Gentleman, whose presence delights us all, has consistently spoken of his concern about the administrative cost of various proposals, yet when the hon. Member for North Essex spoke about the significant administrative costs of the Government's proposals, the hon. Member for Shipley remained staunchly silent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I might be able to explain why the hon. Member for Shipley has remained seated. Only the other day, he and I toured the new Portcullis House and viewed the lovely offices there. I suspect that the offices are in the gift of the Whips and that the hon. Gentleman has remained in his seat so that he can have a nice new office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Even with your infamous two crystal balls, Mr. Gale, I bet that you were not expecting that intervention. I am equally sure that you would rule me out of order if I responded to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Foster:</B> Your sedentary nodding makes it quite clear.
<P>
I tried to be honest with the Committee by suggesting that the original purpose of the amendments was connected to our earlier proposal for the establishment of an IPOC. Even if the Committee cannot return to that subject now, we shall have other opportunities to do so during the Bill's passage through Parliament. We may even hear later today what has been said about the matter in Scotland. However, the amendments still have a purpose.
<P>
In such circumstances, I would normally seek to withdraw the amendment. However, I note with considerable interest that soon after we submitted the amendments, other hon. Members found them so fascinating and exciting that they chose to become signatories to them. Had I sought to withdraw the amendments, I would have deprived those hon. Members of the chance to make a contribution. It would not have given my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale the opportunity to catch your eye, Mr. Gale, so that he could give us the benefit of his business experience. With the hope that we may have some interesting information still to come, therefore—I will happily give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I still think that I am doing better than the hon. Gentleman. His prote´ge´ is still here. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Bath is seeking to act as agent for his hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. I shall be able to catch his eye more easily when the hon. Gentleman sits down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Mr. Gale, your crystal balls have no doubt guessed that I am about to do just that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Moore.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Set-up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I am grateful to have caught your eye, Mr. Gale, this early in the debate on the amendment. As the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East observed from a sedentary position, I have a slight sense of having been set up. I hope to engage the Committee's attention with a few short comments on the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bath.
<P>
It is customary for hon. Members to declare interests at the start of their contribution. Mine is not so much a declaration of an interest as a confession. I admit to being a chartered accountant—the Minister for Housing and Planning cannot cope with that revelation. I also admit to having worked for Coopers ÿ Lybrand before it became PricewaterhouseCoopers, at the time of the privatisation of the coal industry. The Edinburgh office where I worked advised Mining Scotland, which was a mixture of private sector interests, the unions and others. Having discussed the matter with the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Clarke), his recollection of the fairness of that deal is somewhat different from mine.
<P>
Acceleration of professional costs is the issue that was common to that and many other privatisations, and it is certainly relevant here. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bath highlighted, our proposals are the best on offer. They also have the merit of being considerably cheaper than those put forward by the Government. When we see a figure of £35 million in the explanatory notes it is easy to get the impression that, in the scheme of things, that is not a huge sum of money, although it is just over 5 per cent. of the £650 million that we understand is to be the proceeds of the sale.
<P>
I have done some fag packet calculations. I did not have a fag packet to hand, but a handy piece of House of Commons notepaper has had to suffice. I wondered what assumptions could be built into that £35 million about the number of people that would be involved in the project on a professional basis, how long they would work and how much they would receive per hour.
<P>
The hon. Member for Shropshire, North observed that the more complicated the scheme is and the more difficult it is to plan and prepare, the greater the fees will be. If the consultants, advisers, professional accountants, lawyers and so on are all to be paid by the hour, the scope for endless merriment and many overnight sittings in offices in London or elsewhere is quite large. It will be interesting to know in due course what provisions the Minister and his team have put in place to protect that £35 million. In the context, it may not sound much, but it is a huge amount that might be earned by the different professional advisers in fees.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In the hon. Gentleman's experience as a professional adviser—the state may not be the best example, but perhaps he will know from his dealings with private-sector transactions—is it usual for firms to be notified in advance of the provision that has been made for fees in the deal? In my experience, that advertises how much cake there is to carve up among advisers and it is not the best way control the costs.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, although I am sure that, wearing another hat in another debate, he might say that the public had a right to know. There is a dilemma here, but I take his point. As soon as it was known how much was at stake, my former employers would have been delighted to work out how they could fulfil the expectations of the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> If the hon. Gentleman should have to return to his previous life, does he think that, after that admission, there will still be a job open for him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I have already made some unhelpful suggestions that have blocked that exit route but, like the hon. Gentleman, I am always wary of what might happen at the next election.
<P>
Various assumptions might be built into the equation. I worked in what in London would be known as a provincial office of Coopers and Lybrand, where fees were fairly modest. Let us assume an average hourly rate of £100 an hour. We are expecting 350,000 hours of professional advice, which strikes me as a lot. With a 40-hour week, that would mean 8,750 weeks, but a 60-hour week is perhaps more likely, which would make 5,833 weeks. Much maligned and misunderstood though accountants and lawyers are, they are more likely to work a 60-hour than a 40-hour week. One then has to work out what size team would be involved, and how many weeks the project will take.
<P>
There were various comments in earlier debates about how distracting the process will be, how long it will take and how that will affect NATS management. My assumption of a fairly conservative, quite cheapskate £100 an hour average fee for the whole team includes everyone from the well-paid, highly-skilled partners down to the runners and photocopiers, who are vastly under-valued in all walks of life, particularly in professional firms. In the 26-week project scenario, which is about six months, that assumes that there will be 224 professional advisers working a 60-hour week at £100 an hour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> They must be taking Concorde.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The hon. Gentleman, who has drawn on his business experience many times before, refers to flying on Concorde. Professional advisers can be imaginative in their expenses claims, but I am not sure that that claim would get past the Treasury's eager beavers, although he may have a point.
<P>
If the team were working such hours, to complete the project in the time that the Committee is expecting to sit—say, until Easter, which is about 14 weeks— would require 417 advisers. Again, that is a lot of people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the state tends to demand a Rolls-Royce where a Mondeo would do and therefore we are probably talking about £150 to £200 per hour, plus expenses of course, which was germane to the point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central. We also need to know whether a merchant bank is involved in the deal. Merchant banks do not have hourly fees. They take a percentage cut, so a considerable part of the £35 million might be down to a merchant bank, or even banks, since one bank may be advising the Government, one the strategic partner and another the management with their 5 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman has not been sneaking past and looking at the notes I made for the speech. I was coming to those important points in due course. The answer may be that a couple of banks will get the bulk of the money in percentage terms.
<P>
The bottom line is to understand what assumptions the Ministers and their teams have built in. We appreciate that they may not as yet have scrutinised this in detail, but enormous sums are included for professional advice. I have been trying to work out the most compact size of team that we could expect to see working on this and what that would mean for the overall project. A 52-week project would involve 38 people working a 60-hour week at £300 an hour. That is a fantastic sum if you can get it. Perhaps the Minister will shed some light on this.
<P>
There are other serious issues. How long is the process expected to take and how distracting will it therefore be to other parts of National Air Traffic Services? How many people does the Minister envisage will be involved and what is the full range of professionals? My focus and knowledge is drawn from working with other accountants and lawyers, but as the hon. Member for North Essex rightly said, the merchant banks have a habit of saying ``We want a percentage take of this, thank you very much.'' If that is the case, will the Minister explain at the earliest possible opportunity, which I hope will be during this debate, more about what is proposed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am pleased to participate in the debate, not least following that contribution by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale because he raises some valid points. For the sellers—the Government—this is an exact science, although, as the hon. Member for North Essex reminded us, had the Government not put the figure in the Bill, he would have pleaded public interest and asked how much it would cost. I cast no aspersions in saying that, having spent a few years on the Opposition Front Bench. One looks for questions where one can and consistency is not highly prized as far as that role is concerned. The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale went into some detail about the total cost, the impact of that on the business and how people involved—in this case—in NATS may be distracted from their normal duties because of the responsibilities that were thrust upon them during the sale.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), who can rarely resist poking a stick in my direction when he gets on his feet, will be pleased to know that I am about to give him and the Committee the doubtful benefit of some of my experience in these matters. In 1995 I was a non-executive director of a bus company in the West Midlands called West Midlands Travel. Once it was privatised, we hired a firm of whiz kids to give us a more update image as part of a major corporation. They looked hard and long at us and decided that we would be much more effective and successful if we were called Travel West Midlands. I am not sure how much an hour they charged us for that, but it was a considerable sum, so I have sympathy for the point more than adequately made by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. At the time I am speaking about we were seeking a stock exchange quotation and we went to some time and expense to consider these matters. We had been offered a merger with a company called National Express and we decided that, rather than seek a separate quotation, the merger was the better way to become a plc. We had to call in lots of advisers. Unfortunately I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was involved. Certainly many expensively qualified, and doubtless extremely intelligent people descended on our offices in Birmingham. We have since moved to smaller offices because in the private sector we believe in slimming down: we do not believe in all this padding.
<P>
These advisers, chartered accounts and merchant bankers were all anxious to give us the benefit of their expertise, at some expense to us. They spent many weekends doing just that. I had to leave my office because a group of them came one Friday and worked all weekend to prepare the documentation for the merger. When I returned on Monday, every spare space in the office was covered in papers, none of which were ever read. These are enormously complex matters and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will give us an idea of just how complex they are. If it is necessary to transfer assets as it was in 1995, and that is done under the provisions of the clause, it will be an enormously expensive business, as the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale was kind enough to remind us.
<P>
I had not realised just how cynical the whole operation was. Although I recognise that it is necessary to lay down an overall global figure for the operation, I would like some reassurance from my hon. Friend the Minister first, that that figure will not be exceeded and secondly, that the expenses to which the hon. Gentleman referred will be scrutinised with more expertise than they were during my company's merger back in 1995.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> Just so that I can keep a chink of the door open for any route back the future, may I make it clear that I did not characterise the process as cynical? When I said that people would look at what was available and see how it could be fulfilled, I meant that these accountants and advisers would try to see how best they could understand the Government's wishes and then meet their expectations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> That was not quite the impression I got from the hon. Gentleman's speech. At the risk of provoking your ire, Mr. Gale, and referring again to those crystal balls, I have to say that that the hon. Gentleman gave the impression that some other metal was involved so far as the accountancy profession was concerned. However, I hear what he says, and I do not want to close that door to him completely, given the vagaries of the electoral system to which we are all subject.
<P>
There is a serious point here. These matters are expensive. The Government's proposal is inevitably expensive. I suspect that were the Government wise enough to adopt the scheme floated by the Liberal Democrats, there would be some element of expense. Indeed, members of the hon. Gentleman's former profession would be around like wasps in a jam jar, whichever scheme was adopted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Given that the hon. Gentleman rightly expresses concern about these costs—a concern shared by many other hon. Members—would he acknowledge that there is a good possibility of reducing the costs if we significantly simplify the nature of the proposals that we ask the experts to look at? Given that the Minister has acknowledged the great complexity of the operation, would he agree that an alternative should be consolidated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I have been a Member of Parliament a considerable number of years. During that time, individual Liberal Members have impressed me. However, they never strike me as being especially good at financial matters. Indeed, their main role in Committee and the House appears to be to look for a more reasonable alternative than that offered by Labour or Conservative Governments on any subject before the House. Those alternatives are rarely costed. They are always warm and woolly—by and large, that sums up Liberal doctrine and philosophy, which always seeks to comfort us.
<P>
I accept that your well known irascibility is about to strike again, Mr Gale, so I shall tackle the amendments. Whatever scheme is adopted for NATS it will not come cheaply. I suspect that, in his heart, the hon. Member for Bath agrees with that. Based on the experiences that I related—I hope that I did not bore Committee members with them—the need for vigilance, especially when public money is involved, is no less great in this matter than any other.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman has stimulated my imagination on the subject. Is it not odd that we are thinking about the total fees of the deal? However, everything falls on the public purse. There are three parties to the deal. It may be unreasonable to expect management costs to fall on anyone but the company, but it would be fair to expect the strategic partner to pay its share of the costs of the deal. Is that reflected in the matter? If so, fees and costs in the deal will be considerably more than 5 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am sure that Committee members have noted the hon. Gentleman's comments which, however, are hard to take seriously. He has not been in the House that long, but he must be aware that the cost of rail privatisation was hundreds of millions of pounds. In the run-up to rail privatisation, the then Opposition spokesman made exactly the same point. The hon. Gentleman seeks to set us up in a certain way. Little is achieved by that.
<P>
I am trying to be kind: it is difficult for an intellectual gadfly like the hon. Gentleman to settle for long on one particular topic. I appreciate precedent has to be examined if amendments are to be tabled. One party label is substituted for another and the same argument is made over and over again. Those of us who are longer in the tooth are eminently familiar with that process.
<P>
However, regarding the amendments under consideration, it is important that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary provides reassurance, as the matter is an imprecise science. The Government are doing the right thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Given the hon. Gentleman's interesting experience and his past work as an Opposition spokesman, will he answer a chicken-and-egg question? Do Governments tell organisations such as Coopers and Lybrand, ``We have a massive problem. We have an immensely complicated project. Will you advise us and come up with a scheme?'' Or, do Governments approach the matter the other way round? Do they say to such organisations, ``This is how we want to do it. Cost it out and work out the details.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I do not know because, unlike my distinguished colleagues on the Front Bench, I have never been a spending Minister. I suspect that the Government take the latter approach, but I have to admit that I do not know.
<P>
In my undistinguished days as a Whip in the 1970s Labour Government, no such problems ever landed on my desk. Arms had to be twisted, legs were pulled occasionally and the Government had a majority. I am not suggesting for a moment that my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) behaves like that, but that was how things were then.
<P>
I do not have the experience to reply to the hon. Gentleman, although his question is very relevant. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will reply to it in his own inimitable fashion the moment that I sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I enjoyed that last contribution and the one from the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, who is almost a neighbour so I know his constituency. I was surprised to find a chartered accountant in the Liberal Democrat party. Perhaps his rival will have the effect of changing that policy on the ever-elastic penny.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> If the hon. Gentleman had thought for a moment, he would have realised that, north of the border, there ain't much future being in the Tory party.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I note that there has been a fair amount of elasticity in the approach to the amendments. Having enjoyed ourselves, it is time we got back to the matter in hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Mr. Gale, I will obey your strictures but would you allow me one small liberty? When the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale was talking about being a chartered accountant, I was reminded of the elderly retired chartered accountant who died and arrived at the pearly gates to discover a brass band and lots of bunting and flags. He said, ``What's all this for, St. Peter?'' St. Peter said to the accountant, ``Well, you're the oldest accountant we've ever had here. You're 480 years old!'' The man said, ``I'm not! I'm just 70.'' St. Peter said, ``Well, that's funny. We didn't know how old you were so we added up all your fee claims and you came out at 480 years old!''
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not an accountant of that sort. However, returning to the point, I have much sympathy with the Liberal Democrat amendments. What this scheme needed was simplicity, but simplicity is not what it got. One is reminded of the joke that if you were starting from here, you would not start from here. The Government have hatched out the most complicated way of transferring NATS into a PPP. I take the point of my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex. The answer is that it seems to have been a Government-inspired operation. They say what they want to achieve and they start to achieve it through legislation; then, they have to pick up the financial and legal complications. The Liberal Democrat amendment will simplify that because it will put the operation on a similar basis to the disposal of BP and British Telecom. If you take the whole thing back into Crown ownership and sell off some of the bits—there would be disagreement about that—there would be a degree of simplicity which the current scheme lacks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> As a Member of the previous Parliament, would my hon. Friend answer the question that I put to the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East: the chicken and egg question? Is it the Government who go to the accountants and say, ``We have this very complex programme. Please come up with a scheme that resolves it,'' or do they say, ``We intend to resolve the scheme like this. Please work out the details.''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> To my mind, it is the second course of action. Perhaps the Minister will be able to clarify that. This whole operation smacks to me of the second option; in the commercial section, they would have gone for the first. They would have said, ``This is what we want to achieve.'' Then, they would have called in the adviser and said, ``How best can we achieve it and what is the simplest way?'' The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East suggested a simple way, a reverse takeover.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What happened was that Labour won the general election having promised not to privatise the operation. The Government then realised that they wanted to raise private finance, but they did not have a clue how to do it, so they brought in a whole lot of Conservative businessmen to run the private finance initiative. They were given a brief to come up with a scheme that is privatisation in all but name, and the scheme before us is what they came up with. That is why it is rather a botch of a scheme and a rather more expensive one to boot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I agree. My hon. Friend is getting close to the truth. Seeing how complicated some of the scheme is, I would have thought that £35 million was a conservative figure. I suspect that at the end of the day—and this is an experience common to all Governments when embarking on such schemes—it will be found to be a lot more expensive. A one or a two will be put in front of that £35 million before it is finished with. The difficulty with the scheme, given the drafting of clause 40 and bearing in mind what I understood the Minister to say about the proposed amendment, is that the complications will extend much further than the date of transfer. That is what worries me.
<P>
It may not be appropriate to discuss the matter now, but the draft strategic partnership agreement and the articles of the company, particularly the first one, repeatedly refer to clauses in the Bill. If the amendment is not accepted, it would be possible for actions to be taken to transfer parts of the business to a company or subsidiary of a company that is partly owned by the CAA after the strategic agreement has been set up. To be certain that that could not happen and to protect itself fully from action after the event, the strategic partner would need an army of lawyers poring over the draft articles.
<P>
A further complication, as I tried to point out earlier, is that, although we do not know what the Minister is proposing in his amendment, it could be significant in terms of additional complications and therefore costs for the strategic partner. It is clear from the strategic partnership agreement that the taxpayer is not the only party who will bear the costs. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Each party shall pay its own costs and expenses in relation to the negotiation, preparation, execution and carrying into effect of this agreement [and the Ancillary Agreements].''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will clarify this, but I assume that the £35 million applies only to the taxpayer's costs. There is no mention of the costs that will be borne by the strategic partner.
<P>
I believe that these complications will mean enormous profits for the lawyers and accountants who will have to try to make sense of something that is unnecessarily complex and detailed. If we had started properly, by taking professional advice at an early stage, the whole operation could have been accomplished much more simply and at vastly less cost. That is why the Liberal amendment, although it may not be technically sound or achieve precisely what we want, is a gesture in the right direction. It would make this a far simpler and more straightforward operation than the Government propose.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> It is an interesting debate. The Liberal Democrat amendments are respectable in that one can view the issue in two ways: an IPOC would inevitably be simpler and therefore cheaper; on the other hand, if there were full privatisation, the £35 million would be spread over the cost of selling the shares. The PPP, however, is a more costly option. One of the reasons we are spending some time discussing this issue is that it is a matter of concern to us. If it costs as much to sell half a company as it would to sell 90 per cent. or 100 per cent. of it, the Government's Scheme is an expensive option.
<P>
The speech of the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale was good because it focused minds, not on the millions of pounds involved, but on people in accountancy offices with their quill pens or whatever they use these days, working very hard on the scheme. The debate has been useful in that respect.
<P>
We have added our names to some of the Liberal Democrat amendments to try to obtain some more answers from the Government. Some of the issues that we are concerned about came up in our previous debate, when we strayed quite wide. The only saving grace of the £35 million costs is that, once the scheme is set up, it will be possible to move from a PPP to a full privatisation relatively cheaply. No doubt the Minister will want to comment on whether further share sales would be possible, to retrieve the high cost pointed out by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Liberal Democrat amendments have given rise to an interesting debate on the whole question of fees and costs in this deal, perhaps the most interesting contribution being that of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East. He brought a rather complicated character to the drama of the debate. Long ago, he was the Dr. Faustus of the Labour party, who sold himself to the capitalist devil before it became such a fashion in new Labour. He was new Labour before new Labour was invented, profiting from the privatisation of companies sold by the state.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> In the interests of accuracy, the company was sold not to the private sector but to its employees. In 1992, I was asked by both management and trade unions to join the board as a non-executive director.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am casting no negative aspersions on the hon. Gentleman. If I am incorrect in implying that he had any equity interest in the business I stand to be corrected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Correcting the hon. Gentleman would be a full-time occupation. Under an ESOP—an employee share ownership scheme—everybody from the chairman to the most junior employee has equity in the scheme, otherwise the Inland Revenue would not permit it to go ahead. From that point of view, yes, of course I had equity. I still do. It is worth a lot more now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for that candid admission. However, I believe that what I said about property from privatisation was accurate. The hon. Gentleman's attachment to the concept of an ESOP is a good one and much more attractive than the employees and fat cats that resulted from other privatisations, though they achieved objectives in their own terms— [Laughter.]—for the public good.
<P>
I describe the hon. Gentleman as the Dr. Faustus of the Labour party because what was interesting about his contribution was that there was an element of repentance—although I realise that he is not near his deathbed. He has some experience of fees and costs. Most interestingly, he alluded to the volume of material that can be generated, which is of little benefit. It is often a process of going through the motions. The fees and costs are directly related to the number of pages in the accountants' report, but the length of that report is rarely a testament to its quality. The quality of such a report is often not in the hands of the accountants who produce it, but in the demands that the client places on the firm of accountants when it produces it.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will make it clear that we shall not spend money on changing the name of National Air Traffic Services Limited to Air Traffic Services National Limited. That was clearly a mistake, which the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East now regrets. He has admitted to the Committee that the value of the change of name was not reflected in the quantity of money that the company had to part with for it.
<P>
We need the Minister to provide a breakdown of what the £35 million comprises. How much is for accountants, how much for bankers, how much for lawyers, and how much is attributable to each of the three parties to the deal? We want an assurance that the strategic partner will be well able to cover its own fees and costs and that they will not fall on the taxpayer. The Committee will recognise that the fees and costs of any privatisation, however we may try to simplify it by amendments such as those we are discussing, will always involve extra complications and expense, simply because politicians and civil servants, who are never the best guardians of efficiency, are running it. The political process is necessarily an inefficient one because it is democratically accountable. By their very nature, these are exceptional, not run-of-the-mill corporate transactions. We understand that they involve expense, but will the Minister give us clear answers to the questions we have raised during the discussion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Can my hon. Friend answer my chicken and egg question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As I said earlier, I have little doubt that the Government were confronted with a problem. To be fair to the governing party, it began to look at the problem when it was in opposition. When we said that the solution was privatisation, Labour Members must have been saying to themselves ``If we do not privatise it, where will we get the money to run it and to invest in the business?'' The result is an alternative form of privatisation. The Labour Government might have hoped to do a public-private partnership—as we know, the Scottish centre was to be handled on that basis—but the risks and uncertainties of a simple public-private partnership deal without the opportunity for participation in the increased earnings of the business make the risk-reward ratio too unattractive for a private partner, unless there is a very expensive deal. That was not deemed to be good value for the taxpayer.
<P>
In private finance initiatives—as was contemplated for the Scottish centre and still is for the tube—the need to get value for money can kill off the possibility of bringing in private finance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The point I am trying to extract from my right hon. Friend's experience under the previous Parliament is whether the Government went to the professionals and said ``This is our preferred scheme; get on with the detail,'' or whether they said ``We have a very tricky problem, with political imperatives behind us,''—as I think has happened in this case—and asked, ``Can you come together with a scheme and also work at the detail?''. There is a crucial difference there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The crucial difference between the Labour Government and the previous one is that we always had a vision. The process of coming up with the privatisation of NATS, as has been demonstrated frequently during the Committee, goes right back to the privatisation of British Telecom. There was then the same problem of how to get capital into the business. The idea flashed into the mind of Ministers as an inspiration ``Why not sell shares to the public? Let the public participate in the growth of the company and provide capital for the increase in the general wealth of the country.''. A similar opportunity is being missed here. We are spending huge fees on a complex deal, but without the vision and the inspiration to spread share ownership and allow the British public—not only employees—the opportunity to participate and to make sure that the business gets the capital and the dynamic incentive it needs to succeed in the future.
<P>
The Government proposal is a miserable little apology of a privatisation. Because of its complexity, they will be unable to accept the amendments and we shall still have to pay out substantial fees and costs for their crabbed scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> My concern when looking at what has been proposed and at the various draft documents about the strategic partnership agreement is that the operation will be desperately unattractive to private capital of any sort. The BT scheme, although a very complex, huge operation, was a model of simplicity. The Government's scheme for NATS might fail to raise adequate funds, because of its complexity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, as we compare this scheme with the British Telecom scheme, the Government's own terms—
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
