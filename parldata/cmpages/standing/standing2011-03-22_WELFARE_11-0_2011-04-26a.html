                           </span> I wish to speak to

care is in place before a parent is required to comply with

                        </p>
                        <p>I
have repeatedly argued that the well-being of children must be a
paramount consideration in determining appropriate child care
arrangements, rather than simply the convenience of enabling parents to
go out to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are all committed to the provision of excellent child care,
particularly to the most disadvantaged children, who would especially
benefit from good-quality child care settings. We all welcome the
Government’s ongoing commitment to ensure that such child care
is in place, but child care is something that different children
respond to differently in terms of their social and emotional
development, their family experiences and what is going on in the home.
Even if affordable child care was available at the right time so that
the parent could work, it would seem quite wrong to put a child into
child care if it was not in their social, emotional and educational
interests. I have long argued that the person who is best able to make
that assessment is the parent of that child. They spend their time with
the child. They are responsible for that child’s emotional
development and well-being.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
crucially important, especially for younger children, that the
parent’s understanding of the appropriateness of the child care
setting is taken into account. It may seem that, if that acknowledgment
is made, parents will be reluctant to place their children into child
care, but that is not my experience. In most cases, parents welcome
access to good-quality child care. They want their children to attend
good-quality child care, and difficulties arise largely when the
credibility of the provision is not very high. It is important that
parents have a say in determining whether child care is acceptable. It
would be good to see that important recognition of parents’
rights in relation to the best interests of their children reflected in
welfare reform provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Older
children will want to have a say in child care arrangements. They will
probably take exception to the term “child care” for a
start. It is important that they can confirm that the nature of the
out-of-school provision adequately meets their needs, in a setting in
which they feel comfortable. They may have concerns, for example, about
bullying and personal safety. Those need to be listened to and taken
into account.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We should
recognise that such an experience is very important for children and
child development and not simply a route, important though that is, to
enable parents to get into work. There is a long-standing
tension about what child care is for, and I am very clear that the
interests and well-being of children are vital aspects. I particularly
support the element of amendment 41 that would enable both the child
and the parent to have a say in whether those best interests are being
met.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000041">&#160;</a>

Scotland.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
it is important to make it clear that lone parents or nominated carers
in couples with a child under the age of five will not be subject to
the requirements sanctionable under clause 26. Until their child is at
school, parents have no job search requirements that could lead to a
sanction under the clause. Where a child is under the age of five, we
only ask parents to attend work-focused interviews. A couple with a
child or children under five will be able to nominate one parent who
will be treated in the way that I have just described. Children can
perfectly well go along with their parents to the work-focused
interview; anyone who visits a jobcentre will see pushchairs alongside
the desk, as the child sits there while the parent goes through what is
at that stage in life a relatively infrequent process of simply keeping
in contact with the system. Once the child is at school, the parent
will be expected to consider opportunities to get back into the
workplace.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
work-related requirements are drawn up by an adviser as part of a
dialogue with the claimant, which includes a discussion of any child
care commitments and their impact on the claimant’s ability to
fulfil work-related requirements. Any action that a claimant is
required to undertake must always be reasonable, including those
requirements that could lead to a higher-level sanction if they are not
met. Advisers must take all relevant matters, including child care,
into account when setting the action. Those matters include an
individual’s personal circumstances, capability and child care
needs. For example, where a lone parent or nominated carer has a child
above five years old but under the age of 13, the claimant can restrict
their availability for work to jobs that operate around school hours.
We do not expect lone parents with primary school kids to work night
shifts, and the system and definition of what is reasonable are
designed to work around the needs of those children. The claimant could
not be subject to a sanction for refusing a job in such
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
stresses that child care must be acceptable to the parent and the
child, which is a principle that we agree with. However, where an
adviser is of the view that appropriate child care is available, a
requirement can still be imposed. A failure to meet that
requirement—for example, to take up a job offer—may
result in a reference to a decision maker to consider a
sanction.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000045">&#160;</a>

Plus cannot

                           </div>require a third-party adult to provide unpaid, informal child care. The
issue is purely about the availability of conventional child care

                        <p class="tabbed">We
think that the balance is right. If plenty of local, affordable
nurseries are available, but a parent says, “Well, I
don’t like any of them,” there must be a point at which
someone in the system says, “No, I’m afraid that’s
not good enough.” Broadly speaking, we are sensitive to the
needs of parents and the child. We have very consciously sought to
offer discretion to front-line advisers, and any sanction is subject to
an independent reference internally to a decision maker. I stress,
however, that there are no circumstances in which the state will oblige
a parent to place a child with a particular child
minder.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000048">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Our decision makers receive extensive training
on the issues that they should consider in relation to sanction
decisions, but this is also a question of professional common sense.
They will have a pretty clear idea of when someone is being reasonable
and when they are not. There will always be a degree of discretion in
such matters, but decision makers are given comprehensive training
about the different issues that they are likely to address in their
jobs, in an attempt to ensure that they make the best possible

                        <p class="tabbed">Where a
claimant fails to meet a requirement sanctionable under clause 26, a
sanction will be imposed only if the claimant does not have good reason
for failure. In considering whether there is good reason, we have to
consider any relevant matter, which can include the availability of
suitable child care, raised by the claimant. I will give an example to
illustrate how that might work in practice. If the child care costs
that result from taking up a new job amount to an unreasonably high
proportion of a claimant’s pay, they can cite good reason for
not accepting or applying for a job. If the claimant were found to have
good reason, the sanction would not be imposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I should
emphasis the key point, however, that when the child is at school, the
parent is only expected to do a job that fits around school hours.
There are many safeguards in the system. In policy terms, we have not
really made changes to the way that this operated under the previous
Government. It is a matter for common sense, and we have taken the same
view as the previous Government; we want lone parents to have the
earliest sensible opportunity to get back into the workplace.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the same
time, however, the system has to treat them reasonably. They cannot be
expected to take on roles that are totally incompatible with being a
parent of a child at school. Equally, there has to be a balance the
other way. They cannot be able to unreasonably refuse to take an offer,
as and when there is one, if it is reasonably consistent with the life
of a lone parent in school. I hope that that provides the reassurance
that the hon. Member for Glasgow Central requires: in his 
<div class="columnNumber">

obligation to accept a job when one has a child under school age, or
one that is inconsistent with school hours, the availability of
affordable good child care is clearly an issue. We as an administration
and he as a local MP and others will continue to push this issue
forward, because it is to the advantage of us all that good,
high-quality child care is available and that the safeguards exist to
ensure that his constituents do not suffer from the situation that he
described locally. On that basis, I hope that he will feel free to
withdraw the

reminding ourselves that, in clause 26, we are dealing with potentially
far-reaching sanctions on people’s benefit that can last up to
three years. I was struck by a note that appeared in a newspaper
article, which we will discuss later on, about the effects of sanctions
on an individual. It is worth reading an extract to the Committee from
the case study of John Robson, aged 53, from South Shields. He
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000061">&#160;</a>

never seems to go away. Every day you’re thinking: “I
haven’t got a letter today, so obviously there isn’t a
sanction going against me. Another day there’s a brown envelope

you.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000323">&#160;</a>

not applying for one job. He says:<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000063">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I tabled
amendments 79 and 82 to raise an important point. The White Paper on
universal credit stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I hope that the
Minister will confirm that that is indeed the Government’s
intention, because the Bill does not say that—it does not
exclude sanctions on the housing part of universal credit, which as I
understand it, and certainly according to the White Paper, was the
Government’s intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are intended to ensure that sanctions can be taken only from
the standard allowance component of universal credit, thus in
particular protecting support for housing costs, as well as additional
allowances such as support for children. My hon. Friends have tabled
amendments that refer specifically to such support, which have been
grouped with amendments 79 and 82. I hope that the Minister
will confirm that it is the Government’s intention that the
sanctions, which can lead, as clause 26 makes clear, to loss of benefit
for three full years, will be taken only from the standard allowance
and not from the other elements of an individual’s universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I draw the
Committee’s attention to the comments of the Child Poverty
Action Group about the whole framework of
sanctions:<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Universal
Credit as currently proposed will create an unprecedented increase in
conditionality. At present neither tax credits nor housing benefit are
subject to any conditionality at all. The conditionality regime
envisioned in the Bill imposes work related requirements on virtually
all adult claimants, is within a more dictatorial structure and has
much stiffer penalties.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is important that
the Committee recognises that the proposals represent a significant
increase in the conditionality to which benefit recipients are subject.
There may be good reasons for that, but the Committee should not
overlook the scale of the changes. The Child Poverty Action Group makes
the point that the<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000070">&#160;</a>

research evidence to suggest that the most vulnerable claimants are the
most likely to be sanctioned. We are therefore concerned that there is
no provision in the bill to protect the wellbeing of vulnerable
claimants and their children from financial
sanctions.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000329">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
the Minister will be able to provide an element of reassurance that
these pretty draconian sanctions, which may apply for up to three
years, will be taken only from the standard allowance component of
universal credit. The note on regulation-making powers that the
Department for Work and Pensions has sent us offers some encouragement
that that is the Government’s intention. The note on clause 26
regulation states that<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Universal
Credit may continue to be paid during a period of a sanction, but at a
reduced rate because the claimant’s full award amount will be
reduced by an amount broadly equivalent to the JSA personal
amount.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000330">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That implies that only
a standard element equivalent to the current JSA personal amount can be
sanctioned, rather than the benefit as a whole, but the Bill does not
actually state that. If the Minister confirms that that is the
Government’s intention, that will provide at least an element of
reassurance to those who are considering the effects of these pretty
far-reaching changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000072">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I rise to speak in support of amendment
79 and the amendments grouped with it. My right hon. Friend has already
mentioned that we are especially concerned about the sanctioning of the
element of universal credit that is received in respect of children.
I hope that the Minister will assure us this morning that
that element of universal credit will not be subject to
sanction.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
difficulty arises because universal credit, in integrating payments
that are currently made from different pots and by different agencies
into a single credit, means that the existing arrangements, which leave
some of the payments for children completely outside the current
Jobcentre Plus sanctioning regime, will be affected. In particular, I
refer to child tax credit, which is now paid by Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs and is therefore not a sanctionable benefit under
the span of authority of Jobcentre Plus. The child tax credit will be
folded into universal credit as a payment in relation to children,
which is a new element, and it seems particularly important that that
payment is not subject to sanction. It is not now, because it is paid
by HMRC, and I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that the
current position will be read across into universal credit. As on the
housing element, as my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham has
pointed out, the Bill is not
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me outline what will happen if payments in relation to children are
sanctionable and what that could mean for child well-being and the way
that money is spent on children in a household. There is already
international evidence that where parents are subject to financial
sanctions, the impact on children’s health and well-being can be
quite significant. In the US, for example, it has been shown that
children growing up in households where parents experience financial
sanctions are more likely to be admitted to accident and emergency
care. Clearly, there are concerns about whether parents will have
adequate income to be able to afford some of the essentials for their
children such as a healthy diet, the opportunity to participate fully
in their education and development and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want clarity from the Minister about how, if more than simply the
standard element were to be sanctioned, the claimant would understand
what was being sanctioned, in what proportion and why. If the intention
is that any element of universal credit could be subject to a sanction,

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 457<a class="bkMark" name="Column457">&#160;</a>
                           </div>will claimants know, for example, to what degree the financial support
that they receive for rent might attract a sanction? If that is the
case, it is essential that they understand that, because that will
obviously inform any discussions that they then have to have with the
landlord of the property that they occupy.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We already
know from considerable research evidence that claimants are often quite
confused about sanctions. In many cases, they do not understand that
they have been sanctioned; they simply think that their benefit has
gone down a bit in a particular week and they do not make the
connection that that is the result of a sanction. Where different
elements are bound together within universal credit, it is all the more
important that there is absolutely transparency and clarity for
claimants about which elements of their benefit are being sanctioned
and why. That is because the purpose of sanctions should be to effect a
change in behaviour. If the sanction appears to be completely
disconnected from the behaviour that is being questioned or punished,
it will clearly have a less motivating effect than if it were well
targeted on bringing about the desired change in
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
elements of the benefit other than the standard allowance will be
subject to sanction, it is important that we have a running order in
which such sanctions would be applied. The Opposition certainly do not
advocate that: we are of the view that the standard element only should
be subject to sanction, but if that is not the case we need to
understand the approach that will be taken to sanctioning different
elements of universal credit and the order in which benefits might
attract a sanction.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is real
concern about where Ministers are going with the proposals; the
amendments are designed to elicit assurances to allay that concern. We
hope to hear an assurance this morning that only the standard element
of universal credit will be subject to sanction. That would be
analogous to the present position, where the adult benefits
administered by Jobcentre Plus can be sanctioned, but the other
benefits paid for children, housing and so on, are left outside the
sanction
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000079">&#160;</a>

this sanctions regime to apply only to the equivalent of the standard
jobseeker’s allowance, I hope that it could be put on the face
of the Bill in the way that we suggest. It would greatly reassure
claimants and their families that what is said in words will be carried
out in deed. The difficulty in dealing with many people in a system
that uses sanctions—whether they are long or short-term
unemployed—is what we do about children, and how we ensure that
their welfare is provided for.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000081">&#160;</a>

easy to make statements—they are sometimes made in the media, by
constituents and politicians—that in some sense it is wrong that
people do not work, or that certain types of claimant should not
receive benefits, for example people with drug or alcohol problems. The
problem always arises when it comes to children. When I have that
discussion with people one to one and we start to unwrap that kind of
statement, I find that virtually everyone agrees that whatever line is
taken with the adult—whatever use is made of carrots, sticks

those who have not worked for a long time—the needs of the

think that that is well and widely accepted, even among those who
perhaps have fairly strong views about how a sanctions regime should
operate. In that context, I hope that the Minister will not merely give
us reassurance, but actually agree that it is right that this be
clearly stated. As ever, our difficulty is that at this stage we have
not seen the regulations that might be
proposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000083">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope that I can reassure hon. Members about
our intentions. Indeed, the shadow Minister referred to the notes that
have been circulated to Committee members. It is not our intention to
change the position significantly for those who are currently out of
work and might face conditionality relating to their job search, but of
course the nature of universal credit makes it a little more
complicated.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall start by setting out the position for the maximum amount for
somebody who has applied for universal credit, is receiving the
standard amount and amounts for children and housing. To be clear, in
almost all circumstances, though there is one exception to which I will
return in a moment, it is not our intention to use the sanctions system
to reduce the entitlement to universal credit to a level below that of
the housing and child-related elements. That very much mirrors the
current situation, whereby the amounts paid in housing benefit and
child tax credits are not sanctionable in the same way as other
out-of-work benefits. So in that respect we do not intend to change the
current
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000085">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
I must make two qualifications. The first relates to the introduction
of the capital element. If there is a situation whereby
somebody’s overall entitlement to universal credit—which
might include the standard amount, and amounts for housing and
children—is reduced because they have savings and an income from
them, it is theoretically possible that a sanction could reduce the
amount that they receive to below the combined cost of housing and
children. However, at the same time, they will, of course, receive a
matching income from those savings. That is a technical circumstance in
which an award of the housing and child elements together could be
reduced to below those combined levels as a result of a sanction, but
only if the recipients have money in the bank and are receiving an
investment income from that money according to the rules we discussed
for the capital provisions that exist in relation to universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000086">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think I understand the Minister’s point.
When we discussed the capital limit on universal credit, it became
clear that those with £16,000 in savings would not get any
universal credit and £16,000 will not generate anything like
enough of an income to make up for child allowance, plus housing
benefit, plus other parts of universal credit. Is he simply making the
point that those with more than £16,000 in the bank will get no
universal credit full stop, or is something slightly more subtle
happening? That does not sound to me like a sanction as meant by clause
26.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000087">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman needs to bear in mind
that there is effectively a taper for people who have between
£6,000 and £16,000 of capital in the amount of support
that they receive. Let us imagine a situation whereby someone receives
the basic amount, an amount for children and an amount for housing, and
an element of that is reduced because they have £8,000 in the
bank. If they were then sanctioned to the equivalent of the standard
amount, the amount they received for the other two elements might be
slightly lower than the maximum because that capital element is taken
into account. That is the only circumstance in which somebody in
receipt of the maximum amount would have a reduction in the amount they
receive below the child and housing element. That is only because they
have and are deemed to have income coming in from the capital that they
have in the
bank.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000088">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> One of the problems with that capital rule, which
has existed for some time, is that the imputed income from capital is
often, particularly in current circumstances where interest rates are
low, considerably higher than the actual income. In the scenario that
the Minister paints here, people will see a real reduction in those
elements, not just one that can be balanced up through an accountancy
procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000089">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not sure the hon. Lady has totally
understood the way in which the capital element works. There is an
expectation in the system that existed under Conservative and Labour
Governments that people will draw down on their capital until they
reach a certain amount. They will use that money to support themselves
at least in part until they reach the bottom end threshold, which is
£6,000, below which they are not expected to draw on their
capital any further, and they will receive the full amount from the
state. My point is that, while they continue to do that, in a small
number of cases, the overall universal credit they receive, if they
face a sanction for the equivalent of the standard amount, may be
slightly less than the total they would otherwise have received from
housing and child elements until they reach the point when that capital
is exhausted. At that point, the maximum amount by which they can be
sanctioned would simply reduce them to the housing and child element of
the universal credit. I hope that that reassures Opposition Members
about the impact on those in receipt of the maximum universal credit
payment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The situation
becomes much more complicated when somebody is in work part of the
time, when they may be subject to an in-work sanction for reasons that
we will debate elsewhere. At that point, once the universal credit
starts to taper away, it becomes much more difficult to work out what
the different elements are. It may be possible to quantify the total
amount of a sanction in terms of a proportion of universal credit.
Someone may receive half the universal credit entitlement that they
would have received because they are working part time, have refused to
go into full-time work and are subject to a sanction. I cannot give
Members a breakdown of what the equivalent elements would be at that
point because universal credit has tapered away and people are not
receiving the maximum amount.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000091">&#160;</a>

deal with the detail in such a situation. I cannot write rules into
primary legislation today, which is what we are talking about. I cannot
give the hon. Lady an assurance that in all circumstances the standard
amount today—the lower rate of JSA is £67 a
week—the proportions of a sanction will relate to the
proportions of overall initial universal credit of £67 a week
plus the housing element and the child care section. We will taper each
of those elements
individually.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
assure the hon. Lady that somebody who is out of work and looking for a
job will not be subject to a sanction that reduces the universal credit
that they receive to below the child and housing element, except in
cases when they have savings in the bank that they are expected to draw
down. That is the core point raised by the hon. Lady and her
colleagues. It is not possible to set an equivalent amount in primary
legislation and to say that those three elements will remain intact,
because as the universal credit tapers away, the amounts will change.
When sanctioning someone through the universal credit, we do not intend
to disadvantage them in terms of the housing and child
elements.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000094">&#160;</a>

that each component of the universal credit will be calculated
separately for claimants both in work and out of work? Will it be
possible, including for claimants in work, to see how much money is
received through universal credit in relation to the low hours they are
working and their income below the threshold, and how much of that is
for children and how much for housing? Will it be possible at least to
identify the way in which the total is made up of those different

above the amount that is equivalent to the standard amount at the
moment. However, we do not intend to taper away sanctions rates as
people return to work over a period of time. This may help to clarify:
we intend to specify a cash amount for a sanction. We do not intend to
taper away sanctions rates if people are working part time. The
sanctions rate will remain constant all the way through. We do not
intend to reduce the component amount as the overall entitlement to
universal credit tapers
away.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000104">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> What we are saying—very
straightforwardly—is that the maximum amount that any individual
can receive under universal credit, if we take a case where somebody
has children and housing needs, includes the standard amount, the
housing amount and the child amount. At that point—the maximum
entitlement level—we do not intend to set a sanctionable amount
that is higher than the standard amount, which is effectively where we
stand at the moment with the £67 a week for JSA.
However, we do not intend to taper away that sanctionable amount. If a
claimant breaks their conditionality and does not do what they have
agreed to do, the sanctionable amount will not taper away. That
sanctionable amount will remain constant. At the basic level, if a
claimant is unemployed, we do not intend to sanction them at a rate
that impacts upon their housing and child elements unless they have
money in the bank. If the claimant is back in work and if they are some
way down the taper, and they face a sanction because they have broken
their conditionality, it is still our intention to sanction them at the
equivalent of the standard amount. We will not vary the sanctionable
amount.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000106">&#160;</a>

certainly cannot accept the principle that we would write the elements
that the right hon. Member for East Ham has suggested into primary

probing amendment anyway. It is not our intention to take away housing
or child costs from parents or from claimants who are out of work. Once
we are into the universal credit system, we intend to sustain the level
of sanction at that set amount from the

reassurances, but I am still puzzled. I do not quite understand why he
is saying that the components cannot be maintained once they have been
calculated. If somebody is in work, and if their universal credit has
been worked out on the basis of standard allowance, housing and other
elements, there is a well-defined figure that corresponds to the
standard allowance as it affects that person’s universal credit.
Can that not be protected if someone is then
sanctioned?<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000110">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The standard amount will be protected. In
today’s example—I am not saying that this is the final
figure—if we take the current JSA sanction rate of £67 a
week, someone sanctioned for a breach of their

That would not change, regardless of someone’s position on the
universal credit ladder. That means that for someone who is unemployed
and breaches their conditionality we do not touch the housing or child
elements.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000111">&#160;</a>

people progress through the universal credit system, they may have a
part-time job and agree to look for a full-time job, only to turn
around and say, “Well, I am not willing to look for a full-time

request that they look for a full-time job is reasonable, they will
continue to be sanctioned to the set amount. Otherwise we would be in a
position where the amount of the sanction would drop as universal
credit tapered away, and there would be lesser consequences for
refusing to do what they had previously agreed. We should bear in mind
that these are things that the claimants themselves have agreed to do:
“I will do a part-time job for six months, and I will then agree
to look for a full-time job.” After six months they are turning

people who do not have savings and are not in work. However, the
position is worrying for people who are in work and will be sanctioned,
perhaps because they are not doing enough to increase their hours. This
is, of course, a whole new area of in-work conditionality that we have
never had before, but it sounds as if the position of people in work is
much more at risk than the position of people who are out of work. The
Minister has given clear reassurances for those who are out of work,
but can he give some assurance to people who are in work that they will
not lose the support that they need to pay their rent, for

which is people refusing to do what they have agreed. We are discussing
providing support to people who are back in work and, for example, have
agreed to do a part-time job for a while before looking for a full-time
job, but then refuse to do so. We are simply saying that there is a
sanctionable amount that will remain constant and is a consequence of
breaking the agreement that someone reaches with Jobcentre Plus. I
think that that is a perfectly reasonable approach; it is perfectly
reasonable for the state to say to people that if they receive money
from the state we expect them to fulfil a number of conditions in
return. Those conditions are agreed to, and if people then turn round
and break them there is a financial consequence. That principle has
always existed within the welfare state, and we intend to continue with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000114">&#160;</a>

two-way contract between the claimant and the state. We will provide
support, and a better system that tapers away, rather than having the
cliff edge that we have at the moment, but in return it is not
unreasonable to say, “We expect you to continue to work towards
getting a full-time job at all stages in the receipt of the
benefit,” up to the stage where they effectively move beyond the
point where there is the scope to increase their hours, for example.

from the state is ever-decreasing. At any stage, if those people are
subject to conditions but turn around and say, “I’m not

point to the hon. Lady. If somebody is out of work, they are receiving
money for the standard amount; they are receiving money for children
and for housing. If they get back into work, once the earnings
disregard is taken into account, that support tapers away. However, it
does so because they have more money to fill the gap than is actually
needed. Their household income is in fact increasing, so we are not
disadvantaging anybody proportionately. We are taking away the same
standard amount, the same proportion of everyone’s household
income—in fact a slightly lower proportion of household income
for those who are in work—because of the impact of universal
credit. We are saying to those who have said, “I will take a
part-time job, then get a full-time job if I can,” only to turn
round and say that they are not in fact willing to look for a full-time
job, that they will face a sanction. That is how we approach the issue

what happens when somebody’s circumstances, and therefore the
requirements that rest on their shoulders, change. It could involve the
break-up of a relationship and somebody becoming a lone parent where
previously they had not been a lone parent. It might be the illness of
a child. There are many reasons, but the point is that we are seeking
to give Jobcentre Plus advisers as much discretion as we can against a
guideline of being reasonable and making sensible decisions about
individuals, to make sure that we do not impose unfair conditionality.
We want to impose fair conditionality, and will only sanction people
who break that requirement. I hope that that is not a point of

simple. Effectively, there is a requirement for people to increase the
number of hours they work and the amounts that they earn, to try and
get them beyond the point where they are dependent upon the
state.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A case in
point might be somebody who chooses to take the first steps back into
the workplace. One of the benefits of universal credit, for example,
for somebody with a disability, is that it enables them to do a few
hours’ work to get back into the workplace and learn more about
what they can do. After a period of time, once they are re-established
in the workplace and have the potential to do more, it becomes
reasonable to say, “Right, we now want you to try and take a
step to the next level.” It is our intention to use in-work
conditionality to encourage people in a whole variety of circumstances
to take further steps back towards full-time employment. That is the
goal. Of course, some people, such as a lone parent with a child at
primary school, or a carer where only temporary respite care is
available, will never be able to secure full-time employment for health
or other reasons. They will never be able to do more than part-time

			Column number: 466<a class="bkMark" name="Column466">&#160;</a>
                           </div>work. Our goal should be to help people who are out of work take steps
back towards full-time work. Part-time work and mini-jobs, as we have
discussed, all provide a useful stepping stone, but they cannot be the
end point. Our intention is simply to include in the claimant
commitment a ladder or an agreement that people will take steps, where
it is reasonably practicable and possible to do so, to move back
towards full-time employment. If at any point they refuse to do so
without good reason, in-work conditionality will apply. In-work
conditionality will operate in a similar way to out-of-work
conditionality.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000126">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is possible. It is difficult to apply
one-size-fits-all rules, certainly in legislative terms, to individual
situations. If somebody has a part-time job on a Monday and a Tuesday,
and they have the ability to work full time, it would not be
unreasonable to ask them to apply for a job that required somebody on a
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. There are circumstances in which that
could apply, but it is down to the individual adviser, the individual
claimant and, where necessary, a decision maker to decide what
is reasonable and what is not.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We will
continue to apply the standards of reasonableness that have been
applied by Governments of both persuasions over many years. It is not
reasonable to expect people to do things that are completely out of
kilter with the rest of their lives. It is not reasonable to expect a
lone parent to work a night shift. It is not reasonable to expect
somebody who has a health problem and can only work a few hours a week
to march straight into a full-time job. This is all about helping
people on the journey into work.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I return to
the core point of the amendments. Somebody who is out of work, and who
is receiving their full universal credit assessment, will be sanctioned
only up to the maximum of the standard amount unless they have capital
in the bank and, therefore, there is a degree of offsetting income.
Where somebody is back in work and is subject to the taper—the
rate of support that they receive falls off depending on the number of
hours that they work, but the additional income that they receive has
pushed their income above the total amount that they received while
they were out of work—we do not intend to vary the amount of any
sanction. It will stay at the same rate at all levels. I hope that that
clarifies the situation. I do not know whether Opposition Members want
to accept that or not, but that is the position that we intend to
pursue.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000130">&#160;</a>

finished scrutinising that part of the Bill but we do not know what the
position will be for people who are in work and find themselves subject
to conditionality. Will they have to go down to the jobcentre every
couple of weeks—presumably, they will—to report how many
hours they are now working and to see whether the jobcentre adviser
thinks that that is enough? Clearly there will have to be a
requirement, and I understand why this is the case, on people who are
in part-time work to seek longer hours. There seems to be a bit of a
contradiction if the Government encourages mini-jobs, as we have
discussed, but people with mini-jobs are told, “No, that
isn’t enough; you should be working part time.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Checking
up on people who are in work and requiring them to work longer hours is
a new area of activity for jobcentres. I hope that the Minister will
tell us when he publishes the account that he has referred to—he
suggested that that might be in the summer, and I imagine it will be
after the debate on the Bill has finished—what the manpower
implications are for Jobcentre Plus of doing all this extra work. To
return to a question that I asked him before Easter, how will jobcentre
advisers know how many hours people are doing, unless he expects people
frequently to go back to the jobcentre to report what their hours are?
The whole area of in-work conditionality is a worry, not least from the
perspective of what sanctions will be used.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000132">&#160;</a>

with disabilities. It points out that people unfamiliar with autism,
for example, might well regard as unreasonable behaviour that somebody
who is familiar with the effects of autism would regard as completely
unexceptional. Care is needed before imposing a sanction and
potentially causing serious hardship, if, in fact, the behaviour that
is about to be sanctioned is the result of a disability. I hope that
the Minister accepts that getting advice from a disability employment
adviser—people whose expertise is well known and who have a well
established role in jobcentres—would be a helpful
safeguard.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000144">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Broadly speaking, I agree with virtually
everything that the shadow Minister has said. I share his concern about
ensuring that we have a system that is responsive and thoughtful about
people with disabilities, particularly those with mental health
problems where, as he rightly says, some problems are difficult to
diagnose on a first meeting—a person’s condition may not
become apparent until a second or third assessment—or without
more detailed knowledge of their case. The only difference between us
is that the amendments focus on the wrong individual in the Jobcentre
Plus system. The decisions are not taken on the front line by the
advisers or by the disability employment advisers, but by the decision
makers. I will share with him why we have taken a different
tack—a better tack, I
think.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000148">&#160;</a>

the right hon. Gentleman is aware, one of my concerns about the work
capability assessment, particularly the migration off incapacity

                           </div>that we get decisions right for those with mental health problems and
with fluctuating conditions. Along with our work within the Atos
network—the introduction of mental health champions, for
example—we are putting a lot of effort into the decision-making
process within Jobcentre Plus, training our decision makers and
introducing a reconsideration process for more significant issues
around the migration. The quality of decision making is improving, I
think, and my intention is to continue to invest in our decision-maker
network to ensure that decision makers are as aware as possible of
those issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000149">&#160;</a>

makers are free within the Jobcentre Plus system to talk to the
disability employment advisers should they believe it appropriate to do
so, but I would like them to have access to broader mental health
expertise. I see no reason why decision makers should not be able to
phone the mental health champions when they are dealing with a decision
in the migration process. What I do not want to do is write into
primary legislation something that appears to draw focus away from the
decision maker’s role and towards the disability employment
adviser’s role. The prime purpose of disability employment
advisers within Jobcentre Plus is to provide expert guidance and
support to disabled people to try to get them into the workplace; that
is enormously important and I do not want to take them away from that
task. Nor do I want to de-emphasise the importance of ensuring that our
decision-maker network has the right expertise to deal with the issues

first point of contact is important. Some people never get as far as

to create a convoluted process. In Jobcentre Plus, as became very
apparent when it came to addressing the problems in the work capability
assessment process, many decision makers were simply treating the
recommendations of the Atos professionals as gospel and were not taking
a more detailed look at the situation. We have changed that; we have
gone through a process of retraining decision makers so that they are
much more clearly accountable and responsible for taking the
decisions themselves. We have introduced the reconsideration process
within Jobcentre Plus for more significant decisions, such as the
reassessments, because we want to ensure that the decision makers
become a team of experienced, highly qualified individuals who perform
a degree of investigation themselves before taking a final
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000153">&#160;</a>

does he agree—he said at the outset that he agrees with the

                           </strong> Absolutely. One of the things we have done with
the IB reassessment is to ensure that decision makers know that it is
their job not simply to rubber-stamp, but to go back to investigate and
to
check.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000156">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
be frank, I want sanctions for disabled people, certainly people with
mental health problems, to be few and far between. We have clearly
instructed the Jobcentre Plus network that we expect it to be very
careful about people with mental health problems. Generally speaking,
people who have mental health problems need support and treatment
rather than to be sanctioned—we do not intend the regime to be
targeted at such people. In what I hope will be rare cases, where we
have to face up to the possibility of sanctioning somebody who has a
mental problem, I expect decision makers to go more than the extra mile
to ensure that they have understood the challenge and the nature of the
problem. In many respects, I want them to go further than the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000157">&#160;</a>

importance of what he has said, given the huge rate of successful
appeals against the assessment process? Currently more than 50% of
assessments are changed on appeal, so sanctions being applied, in his
words, in a rubber-stamp way based on those assessments is clearly
inappropriate. There should be a much better system for dealing with

that the hon. Gentleman has described will change over the next few
months. The system that we have inherited was too formulaic: some
decision makers believed that their job was simply to rubber-stamp the
decisions taken within Atos. That has now clearly changed. Clauses
later in the Bill contain elements related to the reconsideration
process. At the moment that reconsideration process takes place
informally, but we are overturning internally decisions that have been
taken by our decision makers. We are looking again at decisions that
have been challenged, we are finding that sometimes we got them wrong,
and we are changing them, which I think is right. We will not always
get everything right, and before we reach the question of appeal I want
us to work through some of the most challenging decisions
carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000159">&#160;</a>

think that writing what the amendment proposes into primary legislation
will help that process, because there may be situations in which the

disability employment adviser. I want our decision makers to be senior,
experienced people, who have built considerable expertise in dealing

                        <p>It
is absolutely right that people should be prevented from playing the
system, for example, by being on benefits, getting a job and leaving
that employment after a short time in order to resume their former
comfortable life on benefits. The Government are right to take action
against that. I am puzzled, however, about why the Government want to
penalise somebody for having, for example, left a job long before the
sanction was considered. The wording of the clause
is:<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“if,

                        <p>and
“at any time” appears to be completely unconstrained.
Amendment 113 would substitute “within a prescribed
period” for “at any time”, because we think it
more sensible to say that if in some prescribed period before a claim
is considered the claimant had left their job, ceased paid work, or
lost pay, they could be sanctioned. I cannot understand why the
Government would want sanctioning to be possible for an action that
took place a long time before.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000167">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I shall give
an example. If someone left their job two years ago and had not claimed
since because they had done something else—perhaps they had
decided to travel abroad for a couple of years—or for family
reasons, would it be right to sanction them when they applied for
universal credit because of a decision made a couple of years
previously? I hope that that would not happen in practice, but the Bill
is framed in such a way that would allow that, and I am puzzled about
the reason. I suggest that the prescribed period should be for the time
between leaving employment and the claim, and that any sanction should
end when the person takes

to have such safeguards in place when there is growing concern about
people being sanctioned inappropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000168">&#160;</a>

hope that the Minister will provide some reassurance. He may accept a
limit on the period, looking backwards, that can be taken into
consideration before imposing a sanction, instead of having the
unlimited ability to look back that the clause
implies.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000169">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment would provide that when
determining whether a sanction should be applied for failures prior to
a universal credit claim, we should take into account a
claimant’s actions only in a particular limited period before
the claim. To put the matter into context, it might help the Committee
if I explain why in certain circumstances it is right to impose
sanctions on claimants for actions prior to their claim.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Hon Members
will agree that, as a general rule it is not fair of claimants to
choose to rely on public funds if they could be supporting themselves.
It is not fair to the taxpayer or to other claimants who are genuinely
in need of support, so sanctions for people who voluntarily put
themselves in that position have been a feature of the benefit system
since the introduction of unemployment insurance in 1911. We need
strong and clear sanctions to encourage claimants to do the right
thing, and to support themselves rather than rely on universal credit
paid from the public purse. If claimants do not do the right thing
because they leave a job or lose pay voluntarily or through misconduct,
or refuse a job prior to their claim and forgo the opportunity to be
self supporting, they should face a higher-level sanction. Individuals
who claim universal credit after making the choice not to support
themselves simply cannot expect to receive full payment straight
away.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The sanctions
seek to deter claimants from taking advantage of the system by making
choices that significantly increase their dependency on benefit. They
will be applied when there is a clear link between those choices and a
subsequent universal credit claim. They are not intended to capture all
claimants who have lost any job at any time prior to their universal
credit claim. We do not intend to sanction individuals who are not
looking to take advantage of the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand the intention underlying the amendment. Clearly, the period
between leaving a job and making a universal credit claim is a key
indicator of whether the claimant was purposely making a choice to
forgo the opportunity to be self-supporting and to rely on support from
the public purse. The right hon. Gentleman makes a sensible point. The
problem is that when specific time periods are set down in primary or
secondary legislation, as sure as apples are apples, along will come a
case that steps outside those parameters, and we will wonder why we
allowed someone to get away with it because we did not anticipate the
unusual circumstance when we decided the point at which to set the
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000173">&#160;</a>

especially as we are in the early days of universal credit, is that we
should not be too prescriptive in primary legislation. We can set a
period in secondary legislation, if we choose to do so. The right hon.
Gentleman has made a sensible and thoughtful point this morning. We
think that we have regulation-making powers that will provide
flexibility if it is needed, but I am happy to look at this issue again

                           <strong> </strong>I hope that the Minister can explain what
many would consider to be a pretty harsh proposal for the withdrawal of
benefit. The current system has been in place for some time. It is
perfectly possible for people to lose their benefit for a year,
although that is rather unusual. Under the arrangement in the Bill,
people could lose all their benefit for three years. As we were
discussing earlier, that would not just be part of their benefit but
everything. The support that they receive towards the cost of their
rent, their standard allowance and other elements of their support
could be removed for three years if people are sanctioned three times
in one
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000185">&#160;</a>

read earlier an example about a Mr Robson who had had three
sanctionable—if that is the right word—offences. One was
because he was ill, one was because he thought he had applied for a job
and the jobcentre said that he had not, and there was one for some
other reason. Getting up to three is not that difficult. People
certainly do not need to flout the rules wilfully to find themselves in
that position. In future, they could lose all support for three
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000186">&#160;</a>

suffer a benefit loss for three full years. But how far can he assure
us about that? As we know, once the rules are put in place, the system

sanctions, has a bit of a record of going off and doing things that

Government are breaking the link between support for housing costs and
actual rent paid, and they are adopting consumer prices index uprating
only for people’s housing costs. That means that people will
have to make up the shortfall in their rent from their standard
allowance. If that is sanctioned for three years, as is envisaged in
the clause, with the gap between housing cost support and rent being
paid likely to increase over that period, the danger of people getting
behind with their rent will be significant. That could lead to eviction
and homelessness even though the sanction will, in most circumstances,
apply to the standard allowance only, as we have been discussing. The
prospect of a three-year sanction is
worrying.</p>

Friend’s comments. I have concerns about a proposal that would
include the potential for benefits to be sanctioned for up to three
years. That is an extremely long and draconian period of time for
people who will be on very low incomes. I fear that the measure is more
about being able to communicate to the public that the Government are
talking tough rather than re-engaging such people with the labour
market, which must surely be the
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is considerable evidence, particularly from US states that have adopted
particularly hard-line approaches to benefits withdrawal, that when
people start to fall out of the benefits ambit for the long term, we
lose all contact with them. We have no idea what happens to those
people or their families over time. They do not re-engage with the
public employment service where that exists. They do not re-engage with
the benefits system. They may be in paid employment, but it is almost
certainly in the informal economy, stop and go, and likely to be in
particularly poor conditions in relation to the quality of work, safety
at work and so on. There is also a particularly damaging effect on any
children in such households. Even proponents of hard-line

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is difficult to expect people faced with a three-year benefit sanction
to feel that the system has anything to say to them. That period will
be unimaginably long to the probably vulnerable and often chaotic kinds
of people who are faced with such a sanction. They are people who, as
my right hon. Friend pointed out, are quite likely to find themselves
in the position of incurring such a sanction, because of the nature of
and instability that may exist in their lives. A long benefit sanction
is likely to lead those people to give up entirely all form of
engagement with the employment system. It is unlikely to re-engage
them. They will simply feel that the system no longer wants to have
anything to do with them, and they will not be able to think that, over
that period time, there is any sense in
re-engaging.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">The
other point I wish to make about such a long period of financial
penalty for what is admittedly a small group of individuals, is that
those people will suffer severe hardship. It is not only losing money
that puts people into hardship, but the fact that the loss of adequate
income will persist and be sustained over a period of time. Hon.
Members from all parties will agree that persistent poverty is
particularly invidious and nasty, yet the Bill seeks to
institutionalise that persistent hardship in a way that can only damage
a range of other health and well-being outcomes for people in that
position.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
will say that those people put themselves in such a position by
refusing to engage with the system, and that in a small minority of
cases the system will have to impose such penalties. However, I cannot
see how that strikes the right balance to ensure the proper protection
of people who are likely to be vulnerable and less well attuned to
requirements that the system may impose on them. The balance is between
re-engaging with those people and compelling them to face up to their
responsibilities, and ensuring that their fundamental well-being is
protected. I feel that a three-year sanction has been included simply
for dramatic effect and to show that the system will get tough on
offenders. It is not an effective, fair or sensible penalty and I hope
it will be reconsidered.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000195">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment aims to make the Government confirm
whether the decision to impose sanctions on a claimant will be
reviewed. All three proposed sanction periods are fairly lengthy,
especially the last one, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and
Urmston said, and the Government need to put appropriate review periods
in place to take account of changes to people’s circumstances,
such as the birth of a child or moving away from a partner. The need
for a review period is even more important given that the Government
have so far not provided any details about an appeals process. Current
sanctions for jobseeker’s allowance run to a maximum of six
months, with an average length of 18 weeks. Although no review period
is in place, a review is automatically triggered once the claimant
launches an appeal against the decision or applies for a hardship
loan.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000196">&#160;</a>

period be? Will the reviews be worked into the appeals system, as is
currently the case? Will sanctions from an old claim for universal
credit be carried over to a new claim? Will claimants be made aware of
the review periods? What criteria will be applied before sanctions are
lifted from the claimant? How many times can sanctions be reviewed?
What is the proposed frequency of sanction reviews? Finally, as my hon.
Friend said, this proposal will cause hardship for several families.
What support will be made available to those families under such
circumstances?<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000197">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Many of those who might find themselves
sanctioned in this way are likely to be among the most chaotic and
vulnerable people. They will not necessarily be those who have come to
a conscious decision to avoid work at all costs. Sadly, those who fall
into that category may well continue to work the system to their
advantage, because they are capable of working out what it all

however, some long-term vulnerable people. Last week I visited the
Grassmarket Project in my constituency. It works with people who have
multiple issues, of which not working is only one. Such people tend to
have other problems, perhaps due to mental health issues or because
they have recently come out of prison or have problems with addiction.
They find it difficult to get their lives together in any meaningful
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000199">&#160;</a>

people to whom I was speaking last week have spent time in
bed-and-breakfast accommodation, which is a transient situation. One
man, who had been in bed-and-breakfast accommodation for eight months,
had been in six different places during that period. There is no doubt
that he was making really great efforts to get on with his life. The
project, which has the facilities to train people in a number of
skills, does fantastic work, but this man is in a transient position
and if correspondence does not reach him, he might well find himself
repeatedly sanctioned. He is probably one of the most capable people
that this particular project deals with.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000200">&#160;</a>

to work, but about those who are not necessarily large in number, but
are difficult to deal with. We must find a way in which we can help
them back into work, and that is exactly what this kind of project
does. People who work in this field are telling me that their clients,
if they are sanctioned for a long period such as this, will disappear
under the radar. Those people will be out of the system because they
think that it has nothing for them. This is why I support the

universal credit system so that work always pays. That is an important
change. No one should sit down and take a rational decision not to look
for work. I emphasise the word “rational”. I fully
restate the point about people with mental health problems. It is not
our intention to include in the sanctions process people who have
mental health problems that preclude them from making rational
decisions. We will give clear guidance and training to Jobcentre Plus
and

on. I say to the hon. Member for Glasgow Central that all such
decisions, like today’s sanction decisions, have a statutory
right of appeal.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000202">&#160;</a>

point is that we are talking about a fixed amount, equivalent to the
standard allowance in universal credit. We are not talking about the
removal of support for children or for housing. None the less, the
welfare state has to be a two-way contract. There has got to be a point
at which the state simply steps back and says, “I’m
sorry, that’s it. No more.” If we do not have that, we
are effectively giving people a blank cheque. They may get short
sanctions here and there, but effectively they can carry on
indefinitely and that is simply not acceptable. There has to be a
backstop. We are talking here about people who are capable of taking a
decision and not those who, for mental health reasons, are not capable
of doing so. There has to be a point at which the welfare state says,
“Enough is enough. We can go no further.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000203">&#160;</a>

talking about sanctioning for three years someone who has failed to
turn up to three work-focused interviews or someone who has committed
some minor misdemeanour. We are talking about people who have committed
the most significant offence: those who refuse to apply for jobs that
they are suited to do; those who wilfully turn down job offers and job
opportunities, and those who are referred to an activity as part of
their job search but systematically refuse to turn up—again and
again and again. There must be a point at which we turn round and say,
“No. That is not good enough.” So we have put together a
sanctions regime that has two levels.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000204">&#160;</a>

sanctions are designed to deal with a significant breach, such as
failure to turn up to a work-focused interview. That is not among the
highest level sanctions. If there is a major hiccup in someone’s
life, the system should always be responsive—if someone is taken
ill, it is reasonable not to turn up. However, it is normal practice to
phone the jobcentre and explain, or to get somebody else to do it.

                           </div>that there has to be a backstop. It would be easy to say, “We
disqualify you for life. If you’re not prepared to engage, no
more welfare.” There are aspects of the US system that take
people out for life. We have not gone down that road. However, we have
said that if people wilfully refuse to engage with the system, there
has to come a point at which they disqualify themselves from receiving

those on benefits are not in a position to understand that clear
message. I think that it will ring loud and clear: there is a point
beyond which people cannot go, and, if they do, they effectively

different idea of engagement with the system. However, if somebody
receives jobseeker’s allowance, or is out of work and receives
universal credit with job search conditionality, there is an obligation
to look and apply for jobs. If somebody is offered a job, there is an
obligation to take it. If people are systematically refusing to do
either of those things, it is entirely reasonable for the system to
say, “Enough is enough.” That is what this part of the
Bill seeks to do. It simply says, “We expect you to be active
and proactive in looking for work, in return for the support we
provide. We are changing the system so that you are better off in work,
so that there can be no more excuses that you are better off on
benefits. You need to sit down each week and go through jobs that you
can apply for. Turning up two weeks later and saying, ‘Oh, I
didn’t bother’ is not acceptable and will be punishable
by extended sanctions. Ultimately, if you keep doing it, it will be
punishable by an extended sanction of this kind.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000213">&#160;</a>

stepping up the support that we give people who are out of work. We are
introducing a variety of different measures to try to help people in
their job search. It is not unreasonable for us to seek in return their
active co-operation. If we get wilful refusal to co-operate, from
people who are mentally capable of co-operating, that is the point at
which we must say, “Enough is enough; we are not tolerating
it.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000214">&#160;</a>

a week, then that all disappears.”

secondly, I hope that, for the rest, it is a place where they will
simply not go. This is not a sanction I ever want to be introduced

                           </div>with at a much earlier breach, because clearly this is a third offence,
not a first offence. We will ensure that our more experienced decision
makers are responsible for taking decisions about more serious
sanctions. Where there is a danger that somebody could get themselves
into this position, I will expect our decision makers to look at the
cases with immense care. Bear in mind that, where there is a particular
concern about an individual case, we have provision for home visits by
decision makers and Jobcentre Plus staff to make sure that we really
understand the nature of any medical problems that the person might
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000223">&#160;</a>

most fundamentally, if we have exhausted the inquiries and are
convinced that mental health problems are not the cause of the
situation, then we revert to the position that this is a two-way
contract. If somebody is not willing to engage to the point where they
could face a sanction of this kind, then in my view they, not we, have
questions to answer. We are providing a situation where work will
always pay. We are providing much better back-to-work support through
the Work programme. We are providing enhanced support in some areas
through Jobcentre Plus. My wish and goal is to help people into work,
and no one who is looking for work and is doing the right thing has
anything remotely to fear from the sanctions regime. Anyone who is
working with us to try to find the right opportunities and turning up
to things has absolutely nothing to fear, and will not be involved in
the sanctions regime. Only those who refuse to engage will be involved.
There must be a point at which the state says that refusal to engage is
not acceptable, and will invoke consequences, and that if it continues
a line will be crossed beyond which support cannot be expected to
continue. This element of the Bill is no less and no more than that. We
intend to continue with the provision as drafted, and not to accept the

that they have it coming to them, but the fact is that many people will
fit the test in the clause. There are people like Mr Robson whom I
spoke about earlier who had one breach because he was ill, another
because he thought he had applied but the jobcentre said that he had
not, and a third because by that time he was so demoralised that he had
given up. I do not believe that the Minister would suggest that Mr

such sanctions had been in place, Mr Robson would have been
down at the jobcentre making sure that he was not sanctioned and was
not at any risk of being sanctioned. That is the key point here. People
will make a much greater
effort.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000236">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands
the position of people like Mr Robson. He had been working for 35
years, was made redundant from his driving job and, yes, was very badly
demoralised by the experience that he then went through. But it was not
because he was not sufficiently frightened that he did not comply; on
one occasion he was sick, and on the second there was some confusion
about whether he had applied for a job. That is the messy reality of
the position that people find themselves in, and under clause 26 people
like that can lose their benefit for three
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000237">&#160;</a>

big increase in the number of sanctions at the moment and I am afraid
that will lead to significantly more people than the Minister wants
being affected. He says that he wants the figure to be zero, but I am
afraid that under this clause significant numbers of people will lose
all of their benefit for three years. I hope that the Committee will
vote in favour of the amendment and object to that

                           </strong> The amendments provide the opportunity to look more
closely at what happens in jobcentres about sanctions, and they are
prompted by a revealing article that appeared in <em>The Guardian</em> on
the Friday before the House adjourned for Easter. The headlines were,
“Jobcentres ‘tricking’ people out of benefits to
cut costs, says whistleblower” and “Soaring number of
sanctions against unemployed amid claims that DWP staff are being told
to trip people up with paperwork”. The article quoted my hon.
Friend the Member for Makerfield, who intervened a few moments ago. The
article’s central charge is that staff and offices are being
compared by Jobcentre Plus management, on the basis of how many
sanctions they have issued against jobseekers—the more they have
issued, the better. The whistleblower is quoted as having
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

your office can shine through one of two targets. You can either shine
through getting people into work, but that's really difficult. Or you
can stop their money, and that's really
easy.”’<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000342">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Incentives
are apparently in place to encourage jobcentres, or individuals in
jobcentres, to behave in that way. The article suggests that staff at
the whistleblower’s jobcentre, at least, were
given<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000274">&#160;</a>

statistics from the Department for Work and Pensions that show that the
total number of cases in which people have lost their benefits has
soared since the beginning of 2010 to 75,000 in October, the latest
month available. The figures also reveal that the number of claimants
with registered disabilities who are being cut off has more than
doubled to almost 20,000 over the same period. There is, therefore,
clear statistical evidence confirming what the article claims. If I
remember rightly, the increase in the overall number of sanctions
represents about a 40% rise, so there is a significant statistical
increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000277">&#160;</a>

it was not; a few days later, it was the main substance of the report
that appeared on 8 April. The headline was, “Government admits
Jobcentres set targets to take away benefits”. The hon.
Gentleman describes that behaviour as outrageous—the civil
service does not do such things—but it turns out that that is
what has been going on. Jobcentres have set targets to take away
benefits in precisely the way that <em>The Guardian</em> said that they
had. What gave rise to that article was the DWP issuing a statement
confirming that the original report was true:<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000290">&#160;</a>

Gentleman has said, understandably, that surely civil servants would
not do such a thing, but that is precisely what was happening. In
certain jobcentres, targets were set and comparisons were made between
jobcentres on the basis of how many sanctions had been imposed, and
staff were evaluated on the basis of how many sanctions they had
issued. That is the reality that will be shaped by what we have agreed
to in clause 26.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000292">&#160;</a>

is clear, I am relieved to say, from the Secretary of State’s
interview on Sky TV that he does not approve of such measures, and I do
not think that a single member of this Committee approves of them
either. The DWP’s statement told us, however, that Ministers
discovered a few weeks ago that their message to be clearer had been
misinterpreted and therefore such things were happening. Presumably,
the Minister would have been among those who discovered what was going
on, and I should like to ask him to confirm specifically whether he
knew that those things were going on in jobcentres.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000293">&#160;</a>

neighbouring CAB told me that it was experiencing an incredible
increase in the number of people who were approaching it about the
sanctions, and I should like to provide some examples of why I did so.
Recently, someone attended my surgery who had been sanctioned for not
attending a work-focused interview. Fortunately, however, he kept the
envelope in which the letter inviting him to the interview had been
posted; it was dated the day after the interview. That example made me
think, “There is a problem here with the sanctions
regime.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000297">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
spoke to my local CAB, which had also contacted me because of the
number of people who had approached it about sanctions. I can give
three good examples of people who have been sanctioned, who have mental
health problems and various other learning disabilities. First, a
homeless client, who has mental health problems, was sanctioned for not
providing enough evidence of job search. That client would have got
into the higher level of sanctions and would possibly have reached
three. However, he had been eating out of bins, because as soon as he
got the sanction he thought, “I am not entitled to
anything.” He had been eating out of rubbish bins for six
weeks—much longer than his sanction—because he had not
understood the letter. The CAB appealed; he had been placed in the
wrong group. He was in the work group when he should have been in the
support group. That appeal was
won.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000298">&#160;</a>

engaged with the interview. One of the questions asked by the
interviewer was, “Can you tell me why you are suitable for this
job?” The client replied, “Yes.” To someone with
autism, that is a perfectly valid response. He was asked whether he
could explain why he was suitable for the job. Yes, he could. He was

by decision makers who are supposed to understand the issues. All those

then being passed on—and were then won. That cost the state a
phenomenal amount of money. The CAB tells me that it has never had the

                           </strong> Hon. Members will be aware that we are very
concerned about this issue. It is a debate about context and tone. No
one is suggesting that we have evidence that, at the very top of the
Department for Work and Pensions, the Secretary of State, has imposed
sanctions on Jobcentre Plus offices or officers. What we are saying is
that, somewhere in the process, Jobcentre Plus offices have apparently
interpreted the context in which they operate as one where managers
wish to impose sanctions and that there is some form of incentive for
them to go along that route, which is perhaps simpler than placing
people in employment, which is very difficult in the current economic
context. However, that has happened in the Jobcentre Plus
process—that interpretation has been going on in recent
months—as appears has now been accepted by
Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have spent enough time examining Jobcentre Plus and how it behaves to
understand how such things can happen. It is an institution that is
extremely responsive to direction and tone set by the top. That is why
it is so important that we are careful both in our language and
legislation to ensure that we send the right messages to the public and
claimants and to Jobcentre Plus staff. It is a very incentive-driven
organisation. Whenever hard or soft targets have been put in place for
Jobcentre Plus, it has, in my experience, changed processes, procedures
and practices to enable it to meet them. It is greatly to its credit
that it is so good at doing that. However, it therefore behoves
Ministers to be incredibly cautious about the context in which that
Department operates.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000307">&#160;</a>

agree that the points made by the hon. Member for Makerfield, who spoke
just before her, are really about performance management issues? They
are not in themselves an argument against any sort of sanctions regime;
they are an argument for people to manage performance better and to
interpret the regulations correctly. They are not therefore arguments
against the regime itself, which is what the hon. Lady seems to
suggest.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000309">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree with the hon. Lady on both points. First,
it does not appear that every jobcentre has made that slip. We do not
have evidence that every jobcentre has set and applied targets in the
same way. She is absolutely right about that, but that is an issue in
itself, because there should be consistency across the country. We
cannot have claimants being subject to a greater likelihood of a
sanction because of where they live and which Jobcentre Plus they are
engaged with, when compared with claimants in exactly the same
circumstances in another part of the country. She is correct. There has
been not a blanket instruction from the top, but an interpretation of
tone and context, and I am anxious to avoid that
inconsistency.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will come to the point raised by the hon. Member for Dover in a moment,
but I first want to take up the important second point raised by the
hon. Member for Battersea on performance management. She is absolutely
right, but performance management operates within the context of what
people understand to be Ministers’ objectives, values and sense
of direction. Somewhere in that process something has gone
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000311">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
can make some assessment of the context in which Jobcentre Plus offices
operate. A written answer that I received from the chief executive of
Jobcentre Plus in response to a question that I asked of the Secretary
of State last December stated that there are no targets for Jobcentre
Plus offices, but there is a benchmarking system, in which it is seen
as an early warning if a Jobcentre Plus office is not imposing a
certain proportion of sanctions. The warning appears on some sort of
performance dashboard that is looked at either by Jobcentre Plus
management or by Ministers, I am not sure which, and sets up a query,
“Why does that Jobcentre Plus office not appear to be
sanctioning as many people as the one over
there?”<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000312">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not suggesting that there are sinister reasons for that. Perhaps it
is thought that such Jobcentre Plus offices are not, as the hon. Lady
suggests, assessing consistently whether someone is in breach of a
condition. She is absolutely correct that it is a performance
management issue, but the consequence of having the benchmark is that
people begin to see it as a target that must be met to avoid the hassle
of explaining why it has not been met. To put it crudely, it may be
understood as a target—something that has to be
attained.<a class="bkMark" name="11042615000313">&#160;</a>
