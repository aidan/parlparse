No. 153, in clause 35, page 25,
line 4, at end insert</div>

including an offence under the Corporate Manslaughter Act
2007,&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07112232000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I
say what a total and unalloyed pleasure it is to see you back in the
Chair, Sir Nicholas. You are quite right: we made good progress under
the chairmanship of Mr. Frank Cook and we are grateful to
him for stepping in to assist you and Mr.
O&#146;Hara.</div>
					<a name="07112232000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not wish to add to the gloom of today, but I want to talk a bit about
corporate manslaughter and investigation into deaths. We are discussing
the remit, the powers and the role of Her Majesty&#146;s commissioner
for offender management and prisons. We have debated his accountability
to the Secretary of State. We would prefer him to be accountable
directly to Parliament, but for one reason or another, even if I did
not lose the argument, I certainly did not persuade the Committee of
that.</div>
					<a name="07112232000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I want
to tease out from the Government what the commissioner will be able to
do. In relation to the investigation of deaths, it is important that we
understand from the Government precisely what their policy is with
regard to deaths in custody. Hon. Members will remember that we had
some vigorous debates on the Floor of the House earlier this year when
we discussed the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007
about whether deaths in police custody or prisons might attract
investigations and possibly prosecutions under the Act&#146;s regime.
As I remember, the compromise that was reached eventually 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>was that, while accepting that corporate manslaughter should bind upon
the Prison Service and the police, the Government acknowledged that
there would be a delay of about three
years.</div>
					<a name="07112232000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000217"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Maria

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000218"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Between three and five years, is it? Well, there
we are. Even compromises get compromised. The process would take that
time before it bit upon the Prison Service and the police. It is not a
matter of interest for a debating society, but a fundamental matter
about the powers of the state and its powers over individuals in
involuntary custody. We know from the clause that the commissioner will
carry out investigations into deaths falling within what is
delightfully called the &#147;deaths remit&#148;. The clause
states:</div>
					<a name="07112232000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
death falls within the deaths remit if it is of a description specified
in Schedule
8.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not take the Committee through every paragraph of schedule 8, but
it is interesting that paragraph 2 refers
to</div>
					<a name="07112232000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A death of
a person while in the custody, or under the control or escort, of
prison officers or prisoner custody officers anywhere in the
world.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
a description of a set of circumstances that comes
within the commissioner&#146;s deaths remit. &#147;Anywhere in the
world&#148; includes within this jurisdiction, but I submit that we
need clarification, hence my tabling the amendment, of how precisely a
death in custody or of the sort described under paragraph 2 of the
schedule fits.</div>
					<a name="07112232000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
not complaining. Indeed, we welcome the fact that, under clause 35(3),
the commissioner must
aim</div>
					<a name="07112232000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to establish the
circumstances surrounding the death; and...to identify steps that
should be taken for the purpose of eliminating or reducing the risk of
deaths occurring under the same or similar
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
suggested that the commissioner
should</div>
					<a name="07112232000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;determine the
scope of, and the procedure to be
applied&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">in any
investigation. However, clause 35(6), which is where the amendment
would bite, does not specifically refer to deaths that might attract an
investigation under the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide
Act. Clause 35(6)
reads:</div>
					<a name="07112232000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
subsection (5) &#147;criminal investigation&#148; means an
investigation conducted by police officers or other persons with a view
to ascertaining whether an offence has been committed or whether a
person should be charged with an
offence.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I dare say that
the Government may say that a death that might attract an investigation
under the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act is implied
within clause 35(6). If that is true, I would like to hear the Minister
say so; if not, I would like the Minister to explain why it is not
implied and why corporate manslaughter is, by implication at least,
expressly not included in the Bill. That is the short point that I wish
to draw to the attention of the Committee and I invite the Minister to
respond.</div>
					<a name="07112232000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000219"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> It is good to see you back in the Chair, Sir
Nicholas. Although it seems to you like a long time since you have been
here, I hope that I speak for the entire Committee when I say that it
does not seem like that to us. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] Time passes so swiftly.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>
					<a name="07112232000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to reassure the hon. and learned Member for Harborough with respect to
the point he has made and his amendment. The commissioner will defer,
where necessary, to a criminal investigation of any offence, including
any that is being investigated under the Corporate Manslaughter and
Corporate Homicide Act. Obviously, as the hon. and learned Gentleman
has already said, while that legislation comes into force generally
next April, it is not being applied immediately to custody, but will
apply in the not too distant future, within the next three to five
years.</div>
					<a name="07112232000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Work is under way with the
Prison Service and other custody providers to identify what steps must
be taken to ensure that they are ready to deal with the application of
the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act to the settings
that they control. I think that everybody remembers the passage of that
legislation through Parliament, with the ping-pong at the end of the
previous Session. In fact, it was a carry-over Bill from the Session
before that, so it was ping-pong out of time or early ping-pong, if I
might call it that. As was said at that time by the Secretary of State,
we will be reporting to Parliament annually on progress made in respect
of applying that legislation to the custody setting, where it is
accepted that there are greater difficulties in applying it, although
those are not insurmountable.</div>
					<a name="07112232000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. and learned Member for Harborough is reassured that there is
no attempt to exclude from the remit of the commissioner any offence
that might be investigated under that legislation when it applies to
the custody setting. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon. and learned
Gentleman is obviously getting instructions about whether to withdraw
his amendment, but I should have thought that he is perfectly capable
of making up his own mind. I shall clearly continue talking for a
while, but not for too long. I hope that with those reassurances, the
hon. and learned Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07112232000221"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am between a rock and a hard place. I thought
that I had put my telephone on silent as I came into the Committee
Room, but I was faced with a dilemma when the telephone rang because,
while I was enjoying listening to the Minister and was anticipating
listening to other contributions during our debate, I noticed on my
telephone screen that the call was from my wife, so the question was
who I should obey. I obeyed you, Sir Nicholas. I do not know whether
you have met my wife. That was a difficult
decision.</div>

the issue under discussion in clause
35.</div>
					<a name="07112232000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to
the Minister for having explained the corporate manslaughter
provisions. When they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>finally implemented they will bind upon, or not hinder, the commissioner
in his investigatory work. Despite pressure from various interest
groups, the Government have at last agreed to allow the corporate
manslaughter regime to cover what the Minister delicately called
&#147;the custody setting&#148;. It is hugely important that the
commissioner is permitted to deal with matters that might lead to
investigations and prosecutions under the Corporate Manslaughter and
Corporate Homicide Act. On that basis, I am satisfied that clause 35
does not need to be amended in the way that I suggested, and I beg to

						</b> This is a series of technical amendments to clarify
the extent of the provisions in part 4. Much of the
commissioner&#146;s remit with respect to deaths will be confined to
England and Wales but, as immigration matters will remain the
responsibility of Parliament and are not devolved to Scotland and
Northern Ireland, the commissioner&#146;s complaints remit in respect
of such matters will extend throughout the UK. Deaths in immigration
custody in Northern Ireland will also come within the
commissioner&#146;s deaths remit. The amendments preserve the primacy
of the Lord Advocate in the investigation of deaths in Scotland. The
amendments ensure that the dividing line is drawn in the right place. I
am happy to answer any challenges that hon. Members may have, and to
explain the extent and purpose of each amendment. However, the purpose
of all of them is to clarify the extent of the commissioner&#146;s
power.</div>

						</b> Does that include the prison establishments for

hon. Friend say a bit more about the debate. Obviously, I want to see
those institutions retained in the Bill, which is why I brought the
matter up. When I asked our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in
the House, he said that secure training centres would not be covered,
so I was a bit surprised to see them in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000230"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> My understanding is that there has been some debate
between the Youth Justice Board, the commissioner and the Department
about whether that is the appropriate way to deal with deaths in secure
training centres. At present, it is in the Bill and no amendment has
been tabled to remove it. Clearly, there will be an opportunity to do
so later if there is some change of view on the matter. To my
knowledge, though, there is no reason to think that that will happen.
However, discussions are ongoing at a technical level between the Youth
Justice Board and the commissioner. I am not promising at this stage
that there will not be some further clarification in respect of this,
but no amendment has been tabled to change this. I realise that my
answer might not be as helpful as my hon. Friend might like, but that
is the current
position.</div>
					<a name="07112232000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I
could read out the technical detail of each amendment, and I am happy
to do so if people have particular questions about them. Their general
intent is to clarify very precisely the extent of the
commissioner&#146;s powers and to ensure that there are no mistakes,
which could be very sensitive when we deal with the devolved
administration. The amendments ensure that there is no error in the
precise way in which these matters are set out in the Bill. They cover
minor technical matters. On that basis, I commend the amendments to the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07112232000231"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> I apologise for not being here at the start of the
meeting, but I was caught up in traffic. I strongly support the
proposals as they stand and urge that they are not amended. I had
considered tabling an amendment to this section to include secure
training centres and other youth establishments in the list of
institutions that were to be under the remit of the commissioner, which
was why I raised the matter with the Secretary of State. To my
astonishment I found that they had been listed in here, which was
contrary to what I had understood from his response to me. It is really
important that children and young people have at least the same level
of protection as other offenders. Preferably I want them to have more
protection. Having unfortunately had to deal with one of those cases,
and being aware of a number of others, I believe that it is important
to have a visible, clear and centralised mechanism for investigating
such deaths. At present, I understand that most of the protections for
children come through the local authority and the safeguarding children
board, so if something happens the case goes back out to the local
authority.</div>
					<a name="07112232000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that the local authority may be some distance from the
institution concerned. In the case of Gareth Myatt&#151;I know, Sir
Nicholas, that you are familiar with that case and my concerns about
it&#151;the local authority was a long distance from the institution
concerned. I am sure that the local authority is perfectly competent to
safeguard children&#146;s issues, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>the fact remains that Gareth&#146;s family did not have quite the
access to the local authority that they might have had because of their
personal circumstances. The level of scrutiny that should have been
applied in that case does not seem to have happened until very much
later. At the inquest, a whole pile of information came out that
strictly speaking should have been dealt with much earlier; it quite
properly had to deal not only with the circumstances of the death but
the treatment leading up to it. I imagine that the commissioner will
look at much more closely at that, as it is really important.</div>
					<a name="07112232000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also have some qualms about
references being made from secure training centres to local
authorities, because the follow-through is not always rigorous. That is
partly because of the vulnerability of the young people and their
families and partly because they are not always able to pursue their
complaints. All who support such families know perfectly well that some
of them have real difficulties in pursuing their complaints through the
local authority via existing mechanisms.</div>
					<a name="07112232000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another important factor is
that people who are used to dealing with care issues seem to have some
difficulty in dealing with what goes on inside prisons or secure
establishments and working out whether it is good or bad. I think, for
example, of the monitoring and management of restraint. At the inquest
into the death of Gareth Myatt, the Home Office monitor clearly
expressed his difficulty in challenging some of the decisions made and
some of the practices going on at Rainsbrook. That is very telling. It
is important that those looking into the deaths of children and young
people in prisons and secure training centres should have the skills
necessary to deal with custodial matters, such as the use of force and
physical restraint. They should understand the culture of what happens
in prisons. The same safeguards should be put in place for children and
young people.</div>
					<a name="07112232000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
strongly support the proposals as they stand. If my hon. Friend is
thinking of watering them down, I very much hope that such suggestions
will be resisted. I hope that the Bill goes through
unamended.</div>

							<a name="07112232000232"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Northampton,
North for returning us to this subject. It is one that she introduced
on the Floor of the House in an Adjournment debate towards the end of
the last Session. The Minister of State responded to that debate and I,
too, was present as the shadow Prisons Minister.</div>
					<a name="07112232000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady and I have a
constituency interest in that in the case involving the death of her
constituent in a secure training centre, one of my constituents was one
of the officers who could have been prosecuted had the case been found
to have a criminal tinge to it. Fortunately, for my constituent, it did
not. Of course, that does not take away the appalling nature of the
incident that led to the hon. Lady&#146;s constituent dying and the
tragedy that it caused the family.</div>
					<a name="07112232000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we conclude on the
deaths remit, I should like to remind the Minister of what the Prison
Reform Trust said to us in its written submissions during the evidence
sessions. It wanted to be assured that the deaths remit would extend to
people held in police and court cells under Operation Safeguard, to
children held in local authority secure children&#146;s
homes&#151;that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>question may have been partly answered already&#151;and to people who
die within 72 hours of their release from
custody.</div>
					<a name="07112232000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last
point is particularly important, because the rate of self-harm and
suicide in the first few days after release from prison is very high
and far higher than it is in the ordinary population, if I may call it
that. The period immediately after release is one of the most difficult
periods for people. Approximately three quarters of prisoners who are
released are suffering from some form of substance abuse that was not
dealt with while they were in custody. They very often have
nowhere to live and no job to go to. They have lost contact with their
families; indeed, they are utterly lost and alone. That is not
to suggest that they should not have been in prison&#151;quite the
contrary. For a great many people who are in prison, it is
right that they went to prison. There is a proportion who
perhaps should not have gone to prison, but there we
are.</div>
					<a name="07112232000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whoever comes out
of prison needs to be looked after by someone in many cases, but in
many cases they are not and they die. They die from drug overdoses and
suicide and, in my submission, the numbers are far too high. Can the
Minister therefore confirm that the commissioner&#146;s remit in
matters of death does not stop simply because the death occurs outside
the prison walls as opposed to inside the prison walls, so long as the
period within which the death occurs is sufficiently and reasonably
proximate to the date of release from
custody?</div>

Eagle:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton,
North, who, as other Committee members have made clear, has exercised a
vigilant and extremely proper interest in this matter, particularly as
it relates to the experience of her constituent and the family of
Gareth Myatt. I want to make it as clear as I can that the remit will
include, and is intended to continue to include, deaths, whatever the
discussions between the Youth Justice Board, ourselves and the
commissioner. The debate is about whether it should include complaints
in secure training centres. My hon. Friend made points about that,
which I will certainly pass on, so that they inform that
debate.</div>
					<a name="07112232000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
question is whether the issue of complaints in secure training centres
should still be dealt with by the new commissioner or whether that is
better dealt with in other ways. We will come on to the issue of
complaints, but I think that it is appropriate for me to say this now,
with your indulgence, Sir Nicholas. Complaints from children detained
in young offender institutions are included in the
commissioner&#146;s remit. Complaints from children held in secure
training centres are included in the Bill. However, a debate is taking
place between the commissioner, ourselves and the Youth Justice Board
about whether that is the appropriate way to deal with complaints in
secure training centres. The board is considering what changes may be
needed in its system for investigating complaints in secure training
centres and whether the commissioner should have a role. That has not
quite been sorted out yet, but there is no question of deaths being
taken out of the new commissioner&#146;s remit. I hope that that
assists hon. Members.</div>

					<a name="07112232000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Member for Harborough made points following on from the
evidence that we had from the Prison Reform Trust. He set out the
points that the trust made, so I will not go over them again. If there
is a death in circumstances in which prisoners are held in court cells
or police cells under Operation Safeguard, it will be investigated by
the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Any deaths occurring
among those recently held in court cells, who were in the custody of
the Prison Service at night and escort contractors during the day,
would fall within the commissioner&#146;s remit under paragraph 2 of
schedule 8. In the event of a death occurring after release from prison
or immigration custody, the commissioner would have discretion to
investigate it if he or she believed that it was linked to events that
occurred during custody. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough
made some comments about proximity in time and circumstances, and it
would be for the commissioner to take a view on that matter, but if he
thought there was good reason to investigate he would certainly be able
to.</div>

secure local authority children&#146;s
homes?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000235"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> My hon. Friend has anticipated me; I was just
coming on to secure children&#146;s homes, which are, of course,
under local authority control rather than that of the Youth Justice
Board. They are not provided primarily for criminal justice purposes;
they are provided for welfare purposes in the main. There is already
statutory guidance, &#147;Working Together to Safeguard
Children&#148;, and the local safeguarding children board has a
responsibility, with the local authority that places children, to make
sure that the children&#146;s welfare is looked after. Complaint and
investigation arrangements are in place, including and up to serious
case reviews if things go very wrong.</div>
					<a name="07112232000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not at present accept
that secure children&#146;s homes should be included in the
provisions, because they exist for a different purpose and have a
panoply of arrangements that link the responsibility of the local
authority in placing children in the homes for welfare reasons with the
investigation of complaints on matters up to and including
death.</div>

							<a name="07112232000240"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I do not want to have too long
a discussion about it, but there are various sorts of privilege, with
which we must be careful not to confuse ourselves. I shall come to the
law of privilege within the common law on defamation, or statutory law
as it will be if I succeed in my amendment. For the moment, I do not
want to guess whether a report published by the commissioner in breach
of a consent or without the consent of a personal representative of the
deceased would take the commissioner outside any protections that he
might have, either expressly or by implication. The Minister may well
have something to say about that.</div>
					<a name="07112232000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
would expressly protect from defamation law both the commissioner and
anybody who might wish to carry a fair and accurate report of what the
commissioner reported. We all understand that deaths in custody, or
deaths that come within the death remit, are hugely emotionally
sensitive. Sometimes the commissioner will have to make some pretty
hard criticisms of managers or individuals who work within&#151;I
shall use the expression, even though I have made fun of it&#151;the
custody setting. It is not in the public interest for the commissioner
to feel inhibited, merely through fear of an action in defamation, from
saying precisely what he thinks based on the evidence he has
discovered. I need not give examples; I am sure that Committee members
can easily understand the sort of inhibiting factor that might
influence the commissioner. That is why I am suggesting a new
subsection (8) in the terms of the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112232000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Absolute privilege is the
privilege that protects us as Members of Parliament when we speak
either in Committee or on the Floor of the House. Anything that we say
is absolved from the law of defamation; it might breach the rules and
regulations of the House, but we cannot be sued by a third party for
saying it. Equally, a newspaper has absolute protection in reporting
what we have said, so long as what it publishes is fair and accurate
and is published contemporaneously. Protection from libel suit becomes
qualified if the report is non-contemporaneous, and in that case issues
of malice apply. The Minister suggests that a fair and accurate
contemporaneous report is covered only by qualified
privilege.</div>

fair and accurate contemporaneous reports are covered by absolute

qualified privilege.</div>

						</b> I suspect that the Minister is too young for her
brain to have had the chance to rust at all. I am reasonably confident
of my position, although confidence is a dangerous thing. I am
reasonably sure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>that contemporaneous reports of parliamentary and court proceedings are
absolutely privileged, but I am happy to be corrected by anybody. What
I want to emphasise is that the commissioner needs express protection.
If the Minister tells me that he is already protected by other
measures, I shall be
content.</div>
					<a name="07112232000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is an
important matter of public interest both that the commissioner be
protected and that we as the public should have access to his report
and be able to read, if not the whole report, newspaper or media
reports of what he has to say. During the past two years, I have been
increasingly concerned about the secret world of prisons. I have often
used that metaphor, which is getting a bit worn, but there is very
little public knowledge of what happens inside prisons. I often say
that of course prisons should have walls, but they should also have
windows, so that the public can see inside and know what is being done
in their name, and so that prisoners can see out into a world that will
receive them back if they reform, rehabilitate themselves and show
every sign of being prepared to live responsible lives. Having used
that same analogy not so long ago, I was rung by a local journalist who
asked me where I was going to get all the necessary public money to put
windows in prison walls. As I said before, it is possible to lose the
will to live on
occasion!</div>
					<a name="07112232000192"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div>
					<a name="07112232000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is through
media reporting of what goes on inside prisons that the public gain
access to the prison world. If deaths take place in custody or in
secret places, the full glare of public reporting should be focused on
them, not only as a discipline, to ensure that bad things do not go
unnoticed and undealt with in prisons, but so that the public can know
what is being done in their name. All of us&#151;policy makers and
practitioners in the criminal justice system and particularly in the
world of custody&#151;should learn from previous mistakes. That is
the short point that I wanted to make.
</div>
					<a name="07112232000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry that I
have not brought my &#147;Gatley on Libel&#148;, which is my bible,
or even the shorter version, Duncan and Neil. They are both good books,
which I recommend to you, Sir Nicholas, and colleagues in my chambers
have made very positive contributions to them&#151;I shall not
advertise my chambers much beyond that. However, I ask the Minister at
least to acknowledge the principle behind my remarks, even though she
and I may disagree over whether contemporaneous parliamentary court
reports are covered by absolute privilege.</div>

							<a name="07112232000245"></a>Mr.

						</b> It now seems rather late to welcome you to the
Chair, Sir Nicholas, and I could not possibly do so in the same
enthusiastic terms as the Minister, but I of course welcome you in what
little way I can.</div>
					<a name="07112232000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
another context, the speech that we have just heard from the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough would have been extraordinarily
expensive, but he is on to a good point, which needs elucidation from
the Minister. I claim no expertise in this subject&#151;I intervened
on the hon. and learned Gentleman to try to expand my knowledge of
it&#151;but it seems to me that it is important that the privilege
that may or may not apply to a report by the commissioner apply from
the point of publication, not from or at the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>point at which the report is presented to a coroner&#146;s court,
which may be much later if there are adjournments or delays in the
court&#146;s
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07112232000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
enables me usefully to ask the Minister whether she can help me in
respect of the relationship between the coroner and the commissioner.
We were rather hoping for a coroners Bill in this Session, but we are
left hanging on the expectation that one may arrive if parliamentary
time allows. I think that parliamentary time should allow for a Bill on
the important issue of reforming the coroners&#146; courts system. My
question, however, is whether, having received the report, it is in
order for the coroner to request further investigation from the
commissioner, because there is no express requirement for the
commissioner to undertake further investigation. The coroner&#146;s
powers may in any case enable him to request further investigation. As
further facts about a death in custody unfold during the
coroner&#146;s court hearing, it might be extremely helpful if the
commissioner could be asked to carry out further investigations into a
specific matter and to report back to the court. I would be happier if
such provision, if it were necessary, was built into the Bill, but it
may be unnecessary, and perhaps the Minister can reassure me on
that.</div>

						</b> Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell us about the
sequencing of priorities in the reports and investigations? I am
thinking of the Gareth Myatt case and others. The police had the first
crack at it, followed by the Crown Prosecution Service. The decision
not to prosecute took two or three years, after which there was a
further delay, and the coroner&#146;s investigation did not start
until four years after Gareth&#146;s death. Will the commissioner
investigate immediately after a death, or will they have to wait for a
decision whether to prosecute, which can take some time? If so, will he
investigate before the coroner&#146;s court, or regardless of what
happens there?</div>

						</b> A short, sharp legal debate at this time of the
morning is quite difficult to cope with. The hon. and learned Member
for Harborough might like to hear that I agree with him, in a qualified
way, about the importance of protection for the commissioner&#146;s
reports from issues of defamation. If he turns to clause 44(12) on page
32 of the Bill, he will see that it uses terms pretty similar to those
of his amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112232000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that he is satisfied with that, subject to our disagreement about
how far absolute privilege extends beyond&#151;to use the example
that we heard&#151;the Floor of the House and Committee, or in this
case the commissioner&#146;s report. My recollection is that
qualified privilege would cover media reports; his is that absolute
privilege will cover contemporaneous media reports. We are each
half-right, to be kind about it. My understanding is that a full report
of a parliamentary debate would be covered by absolute privilege, but
extracts from the debate would be covered by qualified privilege. If we
are to be kind and co-operative, we might say honours are even. I hope
that he does not get too much ribbing from members of his chambers when
he gets back. His amendment is not necessary, because the matter is
covered by clause 44(12). I hope that that is sufficient for him to
feel able to withdraw it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div>
					<a name="07112232000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome asked about the coroner&#146;s role. The commissioner will have
quite a lot of flexibility. He will certainly be able to reopen an
investigation at any time to deal with new points that emerge from an
inquest hearing or elsewhere. It is perfectly open to him, if he feels
the need, to accept the suggestion from a coroner or anyone else that
he ought to reopen an investigation to look a bit
further.</div>
					<a name="07112232000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North, on the basis of her
experience with her constituent, made a point about the length of time
that such investigations can take. It is an important point. As we
discussed during debate on clause 35, the commissioner will be able to
defer his own investigation if a criminal investigation is proceeding.
That is the way that it will normally be done, but there is nothing to
stop the commissioner from continuing an investigation if the criminal
investigation becomes lengthy and he considers that deferring his own
investigation further is not appropriate. He will be perfectly free to
get on with his own investigation. The time periods in the case that my
hon. Friend mentioned as an example were very long. It will be
perfectly open for the commissioner to take a view on that and to
continue his own investigation before the criminal investigation has
come to a close.</div>
					<a name="07112232000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are seeking to give the commissioner the maximum flexibility to deal
appropriately with the matters that we are putting in his remit in
respect of deaths and of complaints. I hope that that has answered the
points raised in the
debate.</div>

							<a name="07112232000248"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> If part of the point of what is happening is to
get the information out into the public domain&#151;which was the
reason for asking about the defamation laws&#151;the Minister, and
you, Sir Nicholas, will recall that there is also a sub judice rule,
which prevented us from debating some of the relevant circumstances for
four years. That needs to be thought about. We cannot allow a situation
in which a possibly destructive commissioner&#146;s report, which may
perhaps even be covered in the press, cannot be debated in the House
because we have gagged
ourselves.</div>
					<a name="07112232000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000249"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I am having to resort to my increasingly rusty
legal memory, although the hon. and learned Member for Harborough may
be able to help me, and should feel free to do so if he thinks it
appropriate. My memory suggests that the sub judice rule would apply
where criminal proceedings, rather than a criminal investigation, were
under way. It would thus certainly be possible in the circumstances set
out by my hon. Friend for the commissioner&#151;we want to give him
the necessary discretion and flexibility&#151;to deal with cases,
which are all highly individual, on a case-by-case basis, as he sees
fit. The commissioner might take the view during an investigation of
such a length as my hon. Friend mentioned, that it was taking too long
and he intended to get on with his
investigation.</div>

							<a name="07112232000250"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> May I intervene to help the
Committee? The clause does not deal with the sub judice rule, so, to an
extent, although I have allowed a modest reference, I do not think that
we should labour the point.</div>

							<a name="07112232000251"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I am always trying to be too helpful and not being
mindful enough of the limits of the debate, Sir Nicholas. I have
probably said enough. The point that the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough rightly made is covered later in the Bill, and I hope that
he will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112232000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000252"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I thank the Minister for reminding us of clause
44(12). It partly covers the matter, but partly does not, because, as
the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Northampton, North have
also suggested, it is all to do with public information, and unless
there is public information about the secret world in question, we
cannot fulfil our function as legislators in making sure that the
public know what is going
on.</div>
					<a name="07112232000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The distinction
between my amendment and clause 44(12) is that subsection (12) deals
only with what the commissioner does. It may well be that implied
within that is a protection for those who report what he has to say.
The more I think about it the more convinced I am that I was right and
that the Under-Secretary of State for Justice is not quite correct in
her understanding of the law of defamation, but I shall check that
during the short Adjournment and discuss it with her outside the
Committee. However, I can see that it would be a somewhat fruitless and
self-regarding exercise to pursue the amendment further than
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07112232000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary gave me qualified support. The purpose of introducing
the concept of absolute privilege as opposed to qualified privilege is
that the latter requires the complainant to demonstrate that the
publisher was actuated by malice&#151;that he was using the occasion
of privilege to some wrong or improper purpose. The most obvious
example of that would be to get some sort of revenge. I do not need to
go into that. It is important that the media should be free to report
the commissioner&#146;s reports and that the public should have
access to what he has to say, either in summary or verbatim form. I am
happy as long as the commissioner does not feel inhibited in telling us
what he has found and from drawing conclusions from his findings,
either in the form of further allegations of fact or comments on the
facts that he has found, and the media are not be inhibited in
reporting what he has to
say.</div>

					<a name="07112232000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not a
debate on the sub judice rule. In my view, the sub judice rule is much
misunderstood. That is probably why it is not necessarily a good idea
to discuss it this morning. Under the Contempt of Court Act 1981, the
law of contempt bites when proceedings are active. Within the criminal
sphere, proceedings are active in a number of ways, but essentially
proceedings are active once a charge has been
laid.</div>

Garnier:
						</b> This will be a relatively brief discussion, I
hope. Clause 37 is confusing because, although the policy behind this
part of the Bill is to give the commissioner a great deal of
independence and discretion, not only is the commissioner
required&#151;we have had this discussion before&#151;to report to
the Secretary of State, who then lays the details before Parliament,
but apparently the Secretary of State can give the commissioner
directions. The clause does not actually use the word
&#147;directions&#148;; it talks about consultation. Subsection (2)
states:</div>
					<a name="07112232000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State shall consult the Commissioner before making a
request under this
section.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
request the Secretary of State can make? Subsection (1)
states?</div>
					<a name="07112232000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may request the Commissioner to investigate any
matter mentioned in subsection (3) or (4) which is specified in the
request.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
understand why the Secretary of State needs to consult the commissioner
before making a request. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>Why does he not simply make the request and the commissioner can
consider it on its merits? However, subsection (7)
states:</div>
					<a name="07112232000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
the duty of the Commissioner to investigate any matter which is the
subject of a request under this
section.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
independence of action, discretion or conduct there. It seems that the
consultation proposed in the Bill is meaningless, and the request is
not a request but an order.</div>
					<a name="07112232000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (10), which is the
subject of amendment No. 160&#151;subsection (7) being the subject of
amendment No.
159&#151;states:</div>
					<a name="07112232000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to any directions give to the Commissioner by the Secretary of State,
it is for the Commissioner to determine the scope of, and the procedure
to be applied to, an investigation under this
section.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is the fig leaf of independence, but I am concerned that behind it are
messages coming from the Secretary of State saying, &#147;This is a
&#145;request&#146;, but you are to do the following.&#148; It
seems to me that, despite the warm words that no doubt will be uttered,
the commissioner is not clearly given discretion; he is not given the
independence of action to look into what he
wants.</div>
					<a name="07112232000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not an entirely fanciful concern. Let us assume that a big political
storm is brewing over the management of prisons. I am sure that this is
completely impossible to imagine, but let us assume that there is a
real mess in the prison estate. It is terribly overcrowded. The suicide
rate has reached, say, 87 during the course of a year and the suicide
rate for prisoners coming out of prison is very high. There is a
tremendous public hue and cry about that, which is engendering a great
deal of public
interest.</div>
					<a name="07112232000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State may wish to request the commissioner to investigate
&#147;any matter mentioned&#148; and he may wish to consult the
commissioner before making a request under the clause. All those
behind-the-hand consultations, all those &#147;requests&#148; and
&#147;consultations&#148;, are often, given the balance of power in
the hierarchical system that we run, in fact orders and directions.
That causes me concern. The purpose of my amendments to delete the
subsections to which I have referred is to ask the Government to make
it clear in the record today that the commissioner will not be told
what to do, but will have total discretion to look into things that
require looking into and to report as he
finds.</div>
					<a name="07112232000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000264"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman is
absolutely correct. What we are talking about is clearly not a request
but a direction. It is framed in such a way that it can be interpreted
only as a direction. There may be circumstances in which it is
appropriate for the Secretary of State to direct, although given the
independence that we have sought to achieve for the commissioner, I
imagine that it would be better if it were a request. What I am not
prepared to accept is subsection (10), which in effect allows the
Secretary of State to limit the scope of an investigation, having
requested/directed that that investigation should take place.</div>
					<a name="07112232000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The subsection gives the
commissioner discretion to determine the scope and the procedure, but
qualifies that by
saying:</div>
					<a name="07112232000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to any directions given to the Commissioner by the Secretary of
State&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>
					<a name="07112232000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">It cannot be right for
the Secretary of State, who in this instance will be the person who is
politically responsible for the department under investigation, to
limit the scope of an independent investigator conducting an
investigation into incidents that may have happened within the premises
run by that service. It is absolutely wrong that that should be the
case. I think&#151;I hope&#151;that it is inadvertent. If it is
not, the Minister must explain why she feels that the Secretary of
State should have the power to limit the scope and direct the procedure
adopted by this independent commissioner in the pursuit of his or her
duties. That cannot be
right.</div>

							<a name="07112232000265"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I am not sure what the copy of the Bill held by the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome says, but subsection (10) in my copy
says:</div>
					<a name="07112232000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to any directions given to the Commissioner by the Secretary of State,
it is for the Commissioner to determine the scope of, and the procedure
to be applied to, an investigation under this
section.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112232000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is therefore not the Secretary of State who determines what the scope
of any investigation should
be.</div>
					<a name="07112232000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might help the
Committee if I explain the circumstances in which we envisage use of
this element of the remit and the type of case in which it has been
used in the past. In some cases, a swift investigation by an existing
body with proven technical expertise into a set of circumstances that
requires urgent independent scrutiny might be a very useful
method&#151;indeed, the best method&#151;of getting to the bottom
of what has happened. That is the purpose of having the powers set out
in the clause in the Bill at
all.</div>
					<a name="07112232000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, in 2004, the prisons and probation ombudsman investigated a
major fire and disturbance at Yarl&#146;s Wood immigration removal
centre that happened suddenly one night. It obviously caused a lot of
concern and needed a swift, independent look at what had happened.
Other examples of what the ombudsman has been asked to investigate
include attempted suicides in prison that resulted in serious injury
short of death. The purpose of the clause is to continue the current
practice&#151; which is not set on a statutory basis&#151;of the
prisons and probation ombudsman that he can be asked to investigate an
incident of concern on request by the Secretary of State. We are merely
replicating that in the statutory
provisions.</div>
					<a name="07112232000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Investigations
under clause 37 will, by definition, be special commissions from the
Secretary of State. That is why it provides for the Secretary of State
to give the commissioner directions as to the matters to be
investigated&#151;the terms of reference or the overall remit.
&#147;Will you go and have a look at what happened at Yarl&#146;s
Wood last night?&#148; is the sort of direction that we anticipate
the Secretary of State will give. It would then be for the commissioner
to decide precisely the scope of the his action and how he does what he
does.</div>
					<a name="07112232000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000266"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> That is not what the clause
says.</div>
					<a name="07112232000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000267"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> That is what it says in subsection
(10).</div>
					<a name="07112232000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we recognise that it will be important for the commissioner to be
consulted by the Secretary of State before commissioning an
investigation. Obviously, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div>the Secretary of State will want to hear whether the commissioner thinks
that he can do something that suddenly comes up. We would not want to
ask him to do something without being clear whether he can carry out
the commission. That is why the provision makes reference to the
commissioner being consulted by the Secretary of State. It is clear
that the commissioner can determine the scope of and procedure to be
applied in the investigation that he then undertakes. We believe that
that will give an appropriate balance of powers and form the basis of a
viable relationship between the Secretary of State and the commissioner
for the purposes of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07112232000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments tabled by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough would
remove the duty on the commissioner to carry out an investigation
requested under the clause. The result would be that the commissioner
would, in effect, carry out the commissions by agreement and could, if
minded to do so, refuse to carry out a particular investigation. I do
not understand how that would have helped in respect of Yarl&#146;s
Wood, where an investigation was needed. The commissioner could just
say, &#147;Well, I am not going to do it.&#148; Clearly, the
commissioner has a great deal of independence, but the whole point of
the powers under the clause is to give the Secretary of State the
capacity to have an ad hoc, swift, independent but expert investigation
into a matter that cannot perhaps be easily
anticipated.</div>

this&#151;I hope that I did not&#151;but is she suggesting that the
ombudsman needed to be directed by the Secretary of State to look into
Yarl&#146;s Wood, or that he was utterly reluctant to do
so?</div>
					<a name="07112232000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000269"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> The ombudsman was asked to investigate on an ad hoc
basis. I am not absolutely sure that his remit at the time extended to
immigration removal
centres.</div>
					<a name="07112232000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000270"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112232000271"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> The point of the example and the clause is to make
it clear that, occasionally, it is in the public interest and necessary
for the Secretary of State to be able to respond to an incident, which
was unforeseen and presents great public concern, with a swift sending
in of independent expertise that can report on what has happened within
a short time.</div>
					<a name="07112232000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
the generality of the clause is about giving the commissioner the power
that the current prisons and probation ombudsman has to investigate
complaints and deaths. Perhaps a better example than Yarl&#146;s
Wood, where deaths did occur, is a case involving a near-death. There
have been several cases of people attempting suicide, not dying and not
necessarily making a complaint&#151;Indeed, some might not have
recovered consciousness and could not make a complaint. The ombudsman
can only investigate complaints from individuals within the custody
setting, and deaths. There are circumstances in which the Secretary of
State might want to ask him to investigate matters that are not
technically within his remit, but which he has the expertise to
investigate and on which

already exist; we are just putting them into statute. There is no
question in this part of the remit of the Secretary of State telling
the commissioner what to say or what not to look at, because the
commissioner will be determining the scope and the way in which he
carries out the investigation into what he has been asked to
investigate.</div>

					<a name="07112232000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue here
is about matters that are partially out of the
commissioner&#146;s remit&#151;that do not involve deaths or
complaints&#151;that the Secretary of State would like him to look
at. The Secretary of State will consult him first and then ask him to
take a look. He will be able to get on with his usual job,
independently and will himself determine how to proceed. He will then
write a report, which will be published. The sinister interpretation
made by Opposition Members is not the intention or the import of the
Bill. I hope that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome accepts
that.</div>
					<a name="07112232000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not seek
to enable the Secretary of State to fetter what the commissioner would
say in these circumstances. Rather, there will be a proper consultation
about the technical possibility of doing an investigation that the
Secretary of State might, on an ad hoc basis, wish the commissioner to
look at. That would be done swiftly, and the commissioner would then
get on and do the job. There is no more to it that that. I hope that
that persuades the hon. Gentleman&#151;we will find out soon whether
it
does.</div>

Heath:
						</b> This is one of those Humpty-Dumpty moments where we
are invited by a Minister to look at words that are written on the
paper, and construe them in the opposite way to how any other person
would understand them. I return to subsection (10). How can the
words:</div>
					<a name="07112232000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to any directions given to the Commissioner by the Secretary of
State&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112232000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">be construed in
any way other than as a potential&#151;I must say
potential&#151;limit to the commissioner&#146;s discretion to
determine the scope of and the procedure to be applied to an
investigation and a decision? Had it said,</div>
					<a name="07112232000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;following a direction from the
Secretary of State&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112232000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
might have been able to understand the Minister&#146;s point, but it
says,</div>
					<a name="07112232000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to any directions...by the Secretary of
State&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112232000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the hon.
Lady&#146;s suggestion that I am incapable of reading the clause in
front of me, those words cannot be interpreted as being anything other
than an overlying control of the discretion on the part of the
Secretary of State. If it is her intention to state the wide discretion
available to the commissioner, she would be better off leaving those 10
words out altogether. In that way everybody would be clear that a
direction would be given by the Secretary of State, and that once it
had been given it would be for the commissioner to determine the scope
and nature of the investigation. I invite the hon. Lady to consider
that before Report.</div>

							<a name="07112232000273"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I thought that the debate would be quite clear,
but it has become rather more muddled as we have moved along. There
will not be any reluctance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>on the part of the commissioner&#151;certainly not the commissioner or
ombudsman who gave evidence at the evidence session&#151;to
investigate matters that are within its remit. In the same way, there
has been no reluctance on the part of prisons inspectors&#151;Her
Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of prisons, the chief inspector of the
constabulary or of the probation service, or all the other senior
inspecting officials&#151;to investigate matters within their remit.
The only reluctance comes from Ministers. This is not a party political
point. I am sure that in the last Conservative Government there were
occasions when my colleagues would have preferred things not to have
come out and when they did come out, preferred them not be
investigated, but that is not the point. The point is that when things
go wrong and offices are created to investigate things that go wrong,
they should jolly well get on and investigate them and not feel in the
least bit inhibited. There is a confusion: the Bill will give the
commissioner the powers of a High Court judge to summon people and
documents. Whether he can summon the Secretary of State or summon
documents from his Department it will be interesting to find out in due
course, when he sends a request to the Secretary of State using the
powers given him in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112232000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister seems to be saying
that clause 37 is essentially about ad hoc investigation. If the
Government want to use the office holder to carry out a particular
function on an ad hoc basis, they are appointing the man and not the
office holder. We must distinguish between the office of the
commissioner and the individual office holder, who may or may not be
requested to hold an inquiry, in the same way that a judge or a
chairman of a statutory inquiry might be requested to do so by the
Government. When we have a train disaster, the Government often set up
either a judicial or other statutory inquiry, but that does not affect
the position of the coroner as an office holder. In the clause, the
Government are saying that there may be circumstances in which they
want particular investigations to take place. I am not suggesting that
the Government should not be enabled to cause particular people to
carry out particular investigations, but it is not apt to do so under
clause 37.</div>
					<a name="07112232000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
suspicion, which has not been allayed by the arguments put forward by
the hon. Lady either in response to me or the hon. Member for Somerton
and Frome, is that the Government want the Secretary of State to have
some form of direction, a power of control, over matters that the
commissioner should look into. I do not think that that is right;
either we have an independent commissioner or we do not, and on the
face of the Bill we do not.</div>
					<a name="07112232000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not press the amendment
to a Division, but I urge the Government to be clear in their thinking.
To elide functions and to allow confusion to exist, either because the
Government want that to happen or because they have not thought about
it, is not a sensible way to make legislation. As I am happy to tell
the Minister of State, this a plum-duff of a Bill. It is a complete
meccano set of lots of different things bolted together; it is an ugly
Bill and a badly-designed one. We should be even more careful when we
have a Bill of this nature not to make mistakes and not to allow the
Government to put things in that they have not properly thought
about.</div>
