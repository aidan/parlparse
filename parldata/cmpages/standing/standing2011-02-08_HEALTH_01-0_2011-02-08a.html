                           </strong> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary
announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove their jackets during
Committee meetings—that is a huge concession on my part, but I
am sure that it will be appreciated. Would all Members please ensure
that their mobile phones and so on are turned off or switched to silent
mode during Committee meetings? As a general rule, I and my fellow
Chair, Mr Hancock, do not intend to call starred amendments that have
not been tabled with adequate notice. There is a money resolution and a
ways and means resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000007">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Not
everyone is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public
Bill Committees, so it might be helpful if I briefly explain how we
will proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the
programme motion on the amendment paper, for which debate is limited to
half an hour. We will then proceed to motions, which I hope we can take
formally, to report written evidence and to permit the Committee to
deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence sessions. If the
third motion is agreed to, the Committee will move into private
session. Once the Committee has deliberated, witnesses and members of
the public will be invited back into the room and the oral evidence
session will
begin.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000008">&#160;</a>

Chair’s indulgence, I have three questions for you. First, in
your evidence to the Health Committee on 12 October you spoke of the
need to make £15 billion to £20 billion of
efficiency savings in the next three years, which has been dubbed the
Nicholson challenge. You said that half of that change was in better
community services. You said that a quarter of hospital beds were full
of people with four or more long-term conditions, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and they would be better managed in the community. In what way does the
Bill help with better integration of health and social
care?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              <strong>Sir
David Nicholson:</strong>
                           </em> This is a really important part of
the reform and the change that we are trying to make in the NHS at the
moment. If you look at most developed health care systems in the world,
the challenge around people with long-term conditions is increasing.
There are over 11 million such people in this country, and that will
rise over the next period. So in order both to give those people the
best quality service that we can for the future and to create a more
productive system, treating these patients and supporting and helping
them in the community is a vital part of that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The people
who are primarily responsible for these individuals are general
practitioners. A really important part of the Bill, and the way that
the proposals are being put forward, is the key role that general
practitioners and general practice will play in the shaping of
services. What it will mean for supporting people with long-term
conditions is the provision of more services closer to them, whether
that be diagnostic services, case management, district nurse support or
whatever—it needs to be close. To manage that and to change the
pattern of service, you need to shift resource from secondary to
primary care, which is essentially what the commissioning system is
designed to do. So the role of GPs in understanding people
with long-term conditions, and being able to move that
connection between the resource and the service to the patient, is a
vital part of this change.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000036">&#160;</a>

David Nicholson:</strong>
                           </em> Yes, and as a part of that of
course, people with long-term conditions not only get supported by
their general practitioner; they also require support from social care.
A critical part of the changes is the development of the health and
well-being boards. In lots of ways, if you think about the health and
well-being boards of the future, and local government being in a sense
the integrator of services where they bring all of the bits of the
local health, social care, housing and support systems together, to
shift power to health and well-being boards from PCTs is a critical
part of that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000038">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to ask you about strategic planning.
Again, your evidence to the Health Select Committee seemed to suggest
that you accepted that the strategic health authorities played a key
role in driving productivity and maintaining improvements in the
service. In London, of course, we have a great example of that in
stroke services. If you have a stroke, you go to certain hospitals and
not to others, and many lives have been saved. In the future, under
these reforms, how will we get that strategic planning? Do you think
there is a role for the NHS commissioning board to have regional
boards?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000039">&#160;</a>

There is one about how you get consortia to work together for a
particular geography to make decisions that affect the totality of
health care in that system. There is good evidence, even from talking
to the pathfinder consortiums, that they want to work together and
understand the need to think about a bigger footprint 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                           </div>than the current consortiums. That is good. On the other side, of
course, you have the role of the commissioning board. The commissioning
board will have responsibility for directly commissioning a significant
amount of specialist services, which are critical when you are talking
about these kinds of strategies. For both those reasons, I can see how
we can take forward strategic planning.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In terms of
the commissioning board having a set of regional boards, the
legislation certainly does not allow for that, and nor do I think it is
a very sensible thing to do, given that the commissioning board gives a
national perspective on services generally. There will obviously be
times when the national commissioning board needs to think regionally,
London being the best example. The national commissioning board will
have to find a way of working across London as a whole and working with
the institutions around London, but I do not think you need to
institutionalise that, in terms of having a board to make it
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000041">&#160;</a>

If the Bill goes through, GPs may well focus their attention and energy
on governance, how they will organise themselves and so on. Should they
focus primarily on that or on QIPP? Can they do both at the same
time?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000042">&#160;</a>

because they need to engage now with the changes that are happening and
they need to provide leadership and clinical input to make those
happen, but they also need to make their organisations safe. The issue
is getting the right balance. As far as the pathfinders are
concerned—they are the people who are engaged most in all
this—one of the criteria we have used for becoming a pathfinder
is that you are engaged in the QIPP process. Pathfinders are
increasingly involved in that and they will need to be involved in it
before they become formally established in 2013. If they do not engage
and work through these really important issues now, my argument to them
is that they will not have budgets to receive in 2013, because we will
have spent all the money.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000043">&#160;</a>

consortiums but NHS management and leadership generally. Part of my job
is to make sure that we focus our attention on the really important
issues right in front of us. In a sense, that is why we are putting so
much time and effort into the planning process, which is ongoing at the
moment. As you know, we have a broad idea about the way in which QIPP
will be developed, but we are now operationalising that. Every primary
care trust is now working through with their local providers the
implications in 2011-12 and 2012-13 of what that means in practice in
terms of services and resources for their patients. That has to be the
focus of our attention. If you think about the way you design a
consortium, a better measure of the potential success of that
consortium is how it engages in this planning process, rather than some
of the more esoteric parts of organisational
design.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000045">&#160;</a>

from space. In fact, on further examination, and now that the Bill has
been presented to Parliament, where there is clearly evidence of its
being more evolutionary—building on other pre-existing services,
practice-based commissioning and so forth—do you still hold to
that view, or do you accept that there is more evolution than
revolution?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000046">&#160;</a>

will know better than me the potential benefits of being quoted and
unquoted at various times. I was referring to the quality, innovation
and productivity challenge and the reforms together. It is quite
difficult to think about one without the other, and when you add those
two things together it is a very, very significant change for the NHS.
It is the biggest I have ever seen in my career in the NHS. We have
taken advice from people around the world in terms of management of
change challenge and it is very, very large.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You are
absolutely right, however, to say that we can see most of the change
within the service as it is at the moment. If you take the
commissioning consortiums, in my career I have
worked from GP fundholding through total
purchasing, PCGs and PCTs to practice-based commissioning. You can see
a 20-year level of experience and knowledge of taking general
practitioners and working in this area. If you look at the other area,
you have got foundation trusts. We have been working at this now for
some years to give independence and freedom to individual institutions
to encourage both local accountability and innovation. You can see a
mixture of things that are very bold and some that are building on our
experience.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000048">&#160;</a>

come up throughout the discussion is the new role of the economic
regulator, as opposed to the old role of the economic regulator. Those
are slightly brought together because they have got the same name, but
they are quite different functions. I think the thing about the new
economic regulator, as set out in the Bill, is that its prime
responsibility is not the integrity of an individual
organisation—that was old Monitor’s job—but what
the regulatory jargon terms continuity of supply, which for me and you
is protecting services to local people. It seems to me that that is a
very different way of thinking about the world. We would see the
economic regulator intervening to protect services, which, it seems to
me, is the most
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000051">&#160;</a>

commissioner to intervene to ensure that services were improving. If
there were a threat to the local services—the designated
services that the economic regulator looks after—I would expect
the economic regulator to intervene to ensure that those services
continue, but not necessarily to intervene to deal with the financial

am confused here. You are clear from your position as the chief
executive of the national commissioning board that you do not want any
services to go below the maximum price if we cannot measure quality,

national commissioning
board?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000055">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The new system is that the
commissioning board sets the pricing system. It decides on the currency
and on the shape of the tariff. For example, the commissioning board
could say, “We’ll give this
particular organisation £10,000 to look
after the total health care of that individual who has
diabetes,” or it could decide that we pay people on the basis of
the number of patients that are treated. The commissioning board does
that, but the economic regulator will set the price—the
number—because its prime responsibility is obviously to ensure
that we have a provider side that is vibrant and can take the issues.
The legislation cleverly locks us together to ensure that you get
agreement on that, so it is very much a joint position that we find
ourselves

the administrative costs of PCTs. There is the commissioning, which is
being transferred, and there is the administration of various producer

reorganisation, which I think are £1.4 billion in the impact
assessment: can I tease out of you the distinction between the impact
assessment as provided by the Department of Health and the
impact assessment as offered by the National Audit Office? As I
understand it, the NAO gives a figure of £15 million per
reorganisation of an organisation. Presumably it is thinking of SHAs,
PCTs and so on. The Department has scaled it down by taking out the
estimated costs of redundancies and then suggests that the cost of
reorganising a large organisation differs from the NAO’s
understanding of the costs of reorganisation. The letter I have from
the Comptroller and Auditor General

figure that we will be able to stand by. The outstanding issue for us
though, in terms of that figure, is the redundancies and the decisions

                           </em> For me and people in the NHS,
commissioning is a really important issue. Part of the benefits of the
new system is to introduce and develop more
integrated services for our patients. There has
been an idea that the only way you can do that is by managing it all
yourself and we simply have not delivered that to patients. There will
be lots of different providers for any individual supporting and
providing them with care. The critical thing is how you connect all
those things together. Commissioning is the way in which you do that.
Your armoury of tools—partnership agreements over many
years, close clinical working, the use of
protocols, tendering and any willing provider—is for the
commissioning system to use to improve services for patients. That is a
helpful way of developing the service and taking it forward. The other
issue on the other side is that in some places, for too long,
essentially, patients have had to put up with sub-optimal services
because of too cosy a relationship between commissioners and providers
and between individual providers. So in the sense of the economic
regulator being there to stop abuse, I think it is absolutely the right
thing to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000075">&#160;</a>

terms of the present arrangements, there is no doubt that provider
organisations—hospitals and all the rest of it—will have
to make significant productivity gains in their organisations. You will
have seen that around your localities. But the important thing to say
in terms of the timetable is that the Government have protected NHS
expenditures. It is not that the money that we save through the cost
reduction programmes goes somewhere else; it can be recycled within the
NHS to improve services for patients. What has been happening is that
quite a lot of the accent is on cost reduction, and not enough on what
we are going to use the money for, now that we have got it, in order to
invest in-community in other services. It is difficult at the moment to
identify—we will know better by the end of March when the

it all through. You highlight the dilemma. On one hand, you have a
national body, but on the other hand, it will be commissioning very
local services, so you will need more people working for the board
operating on a more local level. Dental is a good example of teasing
that out in a constructive way. We have not teased it out. I think that
there are things that we could centralise far more in dental
commissioning, such as a lot of the activities around back-office
support and all that sort of thing, but you will not get away from
requiring some local presence in order to have the kind of thing that
you described, because the local dental market in Winchester is
different from the one in Durham.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000080">&#160;</a>

would say to Governments over the years, because this certainly did not
begin in 1997, is that when something goes right in the NHS, it is a
triumph of Government policy and the Health Secretary wants to tell
everybody about it, but when something goes wrong in the NHS, it is the
fault of NHS trusts and front-line professionals. How do you see that
changing under the

think that what will be clearer is the accountability. At the moment,
it is too easy to say that the Government are to blame in all of this.
It is a real problem for us in terms of accountability. One thing about
foundation trusts and having local accountability to a local membership
is that it should hone that sense of local accountability in a way that
perhaps we have not seen before. Of course the health and well-being
boards will give us the opportunity, in a very public way, to
demonstrate that accountability. Sometimes Ministers have said to me
that it’s the opposite: they get blamed for everything that goes
wrong and the NHS gets all the plaudits. But I think you will see a
much more local NHS and feel it is much more of a local NHS, through

arrangements that we have and build capacity in consortia, so that by
the time we get to 2013 we are in a position to authorise them. We are

in all of that. The thing about the changes is—you are
right—that they involve significant devolution and
more local accountability; however, they involve some
centralisation, in a way that will give patients more consistency and a
clearer set of quality standards about the service that they provide.
So with national quality standards all that sort of thing will provide
consistency across the country for delivery. The point that you made is
right: we will have local people administering parts of the system, but
they will do so as part of a corporate whole—a national service
that will deliver locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000092">&#160;</a>

of schemes. We had the mutually agreed resignation scheme, and will
have a second one. We are to have a scheme that keeps people who could
take redundancy, making them stay another couple of years. That is what
we need to do, because the last thing we need to do is spend money on
redundancy and then re-employ people. We want to avoid that as far as

quite different. Most of the commissioning functions of the PCTs will
be carried out by the consortia, but there are specific
responsibilities around primary care commissioning, dental
commissioning and specialised commissioning, which the commissioning
board will do, and which it will have to have mechanisms for. For most
of it we will be able to achieve great economies of scale by doing a
lot of the back-office stuff nationally. Even in a big organisation
such as the national commissioning board there needs to be local
flexibility and local understanding, because that is the way services
are

                           </span> Good Morning, Sir David. I would
like to raise three questions that come out of the evidence being given
at the Mid Staffordshire inquiry at the moment. The first is on local
government and the health and well-being boards being critical, which
you mentioned earlier. One thing that has come out is that the
expertise available to, for instance, the oversight and scrutiny
committees, or even the health and well-being boards, might not be
sufficient to enable them to do their very important job. How do you
envisage that being
addressed?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

David Nicholson:</strong>
                           </em> I perfectly understand why that
might appear to be the case. First, if you think about it, the health
and well-being boards will have the expertise, knowledge and
understanding of the public health service at their disposal with the
changes on the public health side of the NHS and the appointment of a
director of public health for every local authority. That brings with 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 13<a class="bkMark" name="Column13">&#160;</a>
                           </div>it big capacity, understanding and knowledge of health care and the way
it is delivered, as well as the public health
stuff.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second issue is the engagement of general practice with local
government. One of the things that I have found with the pathfinders
and with the work that local government is doing is that, in some
places, GPs and local authorities are invisible to each other because
of the way in which the bureaucracies operate. In terms of
understanding how local government works on the ground, GPs have quite
a lot to offer. So engagement of the consortia in health and well-being
boards will give them more capacity to understand it. The third thing
is that the national commissioning board has the opportunity to engage
with the health and well-being boards, which will bring expertise,
knowledge and understanding. Those three things together will
significantly enhance the ability of the health and well-being boards
to play a proper role in health care in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000098">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My second question is on the approval of
foundation trusts. It was clearly a problem with Mid Staffordshire that
it was approved at a time when it should not have been. My concern is
that, according to the legislation, all trusts have to become
foundation trusts by 2014. How would you ensure that there is no repeat
because of a trust being rushed into foundation trust status? As a
supplement to that, we are aware that some of the private finance
initiative contracts that are going through at the moment mean that
some of those trusts will not be able to meet their financial return of
8%, or whatever it is, because of the payments.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000099">&#160;</a>

David Nicholson:</strong>
                           </em> I have two things to say about that.
First, Mid Staffordshire was a dreadful experience both for the
patients and for the service as a whole. People were absolutely
horrified by what happened. We moved very quickly and learned a lot of
lessons. If you look at the foundation trust process at the moment,
quality is written through it in a way it never has been before. Every
foundation trust has to be signed off by the NHS medical director and
has to go through a rigorous process. So we have learned some really
important lessons, but we need to continue to do so. The national
quality board, which I chair, will issue a report in February that will
give individual boards, patients and staff some clear tools and
techniques to ensure that we are alerted earlier when such things
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second thing is the foundation trust pipeline, which is going through
all the organisations that are not currently foundation trusts and is
categorising them into groups that we can take forward. For the biggest
group, which contains more than 70 of the organisations that need to
become foundation trusts in the next four years, it is relatively
straightforward. It is about developing a plan and a model for each
organisation that is robust and clinically and financially stable. I
have little doubt that that big group of organisations will go
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Then
there are some other organisations that are either in difficulty at the
moment or that have, as in the example that you used, some PFI schemes,
which are making it very difficult for them to achieve due diligence
and the arrangements about finance. We will have to deal with each of
those organisations individually, and we are starting to work through,
case by case, what the process means for each of those organisations.
When we have done that, I think that I will be in a much better 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>position to say to you, “Yes, we can deliver the 2014
programme”. However, it seems to me that the most important
priority is to get the right fit and the right response for
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000102">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Thank you very much for that. You referred to the
issue of accountability briefly in your answer. However, judging from
the Mid Staffordshire experience it still seems to me that we are not
quite sure who will pick these things up in future and who will
aggregate the evidence that is out there that a trust is failing. Where
does accountability for blowing the whistle on that lie, because it
really has to lie in one place?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000103">&#160;</a>

with the board of the organisation involved. That is the accountable
bit of the system and strengthening that bit, with the powers of local
governors and members, is an important part of future
developments.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000104">&#160;</a>

organisations go wrong and although it would be nice to say that one
organisation in those circumstances will be responsible for dealing
with everything that comes out of it, because of the nature of health
care it is very difficult to do that. Nevertheless, we have a very
clear set-up now, where the Care Quality Commission is responsible for
co-ordinating the various organisations. It uses a technique of
“risk summits” to enable it to do that. So the CQC will
ensure that the commissioners, the other providers, the clinicians and
the commissioning board are all brought together to solve these
problems when they occur.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000105">&#160;</a>

about the local strata that you are now talking about for the

get a complete picture of that, because it partly depends on what we
can centralise and what back-office work we can do nationally. We
simply have not done the work to make it happen. However, I have been
given an indicative amount of money to work with for the commissioning
board at the end of the process and if you think, for example, that at
the moment there are more than 5,000 people working in PCTs on primary
care commissioning, clearly we will have to work with at least a third
less of that number. However, I think that it gives you an indication
of the amount of local work that is

that we did was to say, “How would the system know, how would

could say, “What does a really good stroke service look
like?”, because there are myriad views about all of that.

all of the major services. In those quality
standards, the NHS will set out for the first time for commissioners,
providers and the public what a really good neonatal intensive care
service or a really good diabetes service looks like and all of those
things. That will then be translated by the commissioning board into
local commissioning guidelines. It will all be translated into a
national framework contract for providers. In that way, I think that
you can get the potential for local innovation and change on how you
deliver a service but you can be really clear about what a good service
is for the first time. In that way, you can give much more consistency
across the country, both for patients and
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000111">&#160;</a>

the outcomes expected and what the service shape would look like, would
be the commissioners. They would set that out. You would expect the
consortium to set out what it required and the quality standards. The
providers are responsible for responding to it. If they needed to
respond by changing the configuration of what they did, they would have
to do that. Both of them would have to account to the health and
well-being board, to explain what they were doing and whatever scrutiny
arrangements the local authority put in place. In that way, you would
get a clearer view about local responsibility for change. In terms of
designated services, there is still the right of the local authority,
whatever scrutiny arrangements are put in place, to refer the matter to
the Secretary of State.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000113">&#160;</a>

legislation. That connection between local and national is going to be
critical to its success. There are different ways to define national
and local. There will be a national contract of sorts, I guess, quite
different from the one we have at the moment. There will be a local
interpretation of that in individual circumstances. How is that to be
done? It could be through PCTs, through the national commissioning
body, through a whole set of things, but that principle about national
and local applies. The potential benefits of a national commissioning
board approach are that you are more likely to align the negotiation
and discussion of the contract with the delivery of the

about the GPs and the way in which that has been defined and the way in

of Primary Care has said: if every GP referred one less patient for
diagnosis a week—and I am not suggesting they should do
that—it would make £500 million-worth of difference to
costs in the NHS. Relatively small micro-changes in general practice
affect the service. They simply do not have the same effect on

pharmacy. My local PCT has a number of contacts with local pharmacies.
In some pharmacies, it delivers smoking cessation measures; in others,
it delivers daily doses of methadone. A minor
ailments treatment scheme runs throughout the PCT, which means that the
pharmacists can do it and there is no need to clutter the
doctors’ surgeries. Are we saying that the way forward is for
national commissioning of those things? The PCT commissions those
things effectively on a pharmacy-by-pharmacy basis at the moment. What
are we going to end up with if it is commissioned at a national

well how you can get benefits out of that system. I agree with you. The

these proposals are going to do to address
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000130">&#160;</a>

be allocated to consortia on the basis of a formula that we derive
around access to care. Secondly, the identification of a set of
national standards is a really important mechanism to take the service
forward. At the moment, it is up to individual organisations to decide
what standards they have, and, because of that, you have different ways
of measuring and so on. Getting clear, evidence-based standards, which
are based on NICE standards, and getting the commissioning guidance and
a mechanism for holding the consortia to account in place are more
likely to deliver a more equitable service than a less equitable
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000131">&#160;</a>

risk. Having just listened to Sir David’s evidence, I think he
was very clear about the need to manage the transition during a period
when the finances of the NHS will be, let us say, troubled, as the new

forget what the fundamental plan is—what the
fundamental idea is that we are trying to achieve—and become too

local commissioning decisions, and actually forget that the fundamental
reason for bringing about this change is that really important sentence

said, “Soon, the only people able to make a choice in our new

adopt. Fundamentally, these changes are about putting patients in the

an “etc.” thrown in as well. That needs to be pulled out,
and a duty needs to be placed on the national commissioning board and
the consortia to embed shared decision making in all care and

measure is very wide-ranging and there are clauses
to suit every eventuality. The possible fragmentation as a result of
competition not allowing collaboration—which is needed to make
efficiency gains—could be a problem. That will be all about who
runs the economic regulator and how accountable they are—it is
not clear to whom they are accountable, or who will adjudicate on

now shows that price competition is likely to lead to a lowering of

lead to a lowering of quality, which I do not think the system can

consortia, such as GPs talking to each other better. The evidence from
the so-called total purchasing pilots of the late 90s suggested that
the bigger the consortium, the likelier the wheels were to come off.
Smaller consortia will be better able to shift to play the market, so
to speak—to shift commissioning without destabilising providers,
which can happen—and they will be closer to patients. There is a
kind of minimum size that you need for a risk pool—in my
judgment, it is probably about 100,000—but there is a danger

two kinds of integration: there is organisational integration between
primary and secondary care, and there is budgetary integration. There
are dangers about organisational integration between primary and
secondary care, and particularly, the dominance of secondary care
swamping primary care. Acute hospital trusts can absorb any amount of
resources and energy that is thrown at them. The experience of acute
sector organisations running community services is that the acute
sector tends to dominate. On the other hand, budgetary integration,
which is what, in some sense, the consortium offers, with the GP
holding the budget, makes much more

do you think the Bill’s reforms will do to iron some of those
changes out in a positive direction? Specifically, what are your
thoughts about the changes to NICE, which is going to be renamed the

clinical professionals are trained. I am pretty upbeat about all that.
That will be built into the way in which, as I understand it, the

am sorry to come back to the point that I always make, but it is also
about activated patients. The patients are not passive; they need to
know about these things and we need to promote them. People need access
to them through websites, and we need to inform them about what the
current best practice and standards are, so that people can challenge
them locally, feel that they are activated to do so and that it is not

patient in front of you, but about having a leadership responsibility
for the whole of the journey that your patient is on, and about being
open and transparent about your data, your performance and that of your
colleagues. It is about being open about the bad apples in your
community and not turning your back on all that. We want a new
professionalism. No amount of markets or GP consortia will create that,
although a market can facilitate some of it. It is going to be right at

quality. They will soon realise that primary care provision has a deep
impact on the secondary care spend of their budget. Therefore, this
will really concentrate minds, I believe, in a way that it simply has
not
before.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be even better if specialists were in the mix, which takes us
back to this idea of integration—budgetary or real. One of the
problems at the moment is that primary care is still very separated
from hospitals. Clinicians are still very separated—they do not
talk to one another particularly; they do not budget together; and they
do not have aligned incentives. That kind of peer review performance
would be much better if specialists were in the mix and doing this
together in relation to a pathway. That is a failing in the Bill, but
it will definitely encourage it in primary care, and it is coupled
with, as you say, the quality standards and evidence base that have
come down from NICE. That can only reinforce this peer
review.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000163">&#160;</a>

improving the NHS in a variety of ways, including clinical practice and
so on. Although everyone nodded their heads and said, “That is
very interesting; that is great”, nothing ever happened. My
judgment is that that is because the incentives are not present. The
incentives really are not present to adopt good practice. It is much
easier just to carry on doing what you were doing. To return to my
mantra, quality competition is the driver for that. That does actually
drive incentives to improve it. It provides resource incentives and
reputation incentives for people to improve and to bring up standards
of clinical practice that are below the best to the best. That is where
I would put my faith, rather than in reorganisation of NICE or national

something that is going to improve services? I do not know who would
like to start. Stephen, you are on the National Quality

Thornton:</strong>
                           </em> As everyone knows, quality in health
service delivery is notoriously difficult to get your head around and
to define. People say, well surely you can define mortality—it
is pretty clear; you are either dead or alive. But we know from the
debate about hospital standardised mortality ratios of late just how
difficult even that is to get a clear understanding of whether the case
mix in your particular hospital is more complicated than others and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000169">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to remember that the best way of achieving an overall
improvement in the quality of service in the health care system is to
have a whole mix of the different arrangements and levers at our
disposal. There is a danger, in the conversation on the Bill, of asking
is it markets, or is it not markets, as if that is either bad or good
or the panacea. They have an important role to play in some bits of
health care delivery, but I have to say that I am slightly anxious
about losing the targets—the small handful of top-down targets
that, frankly, worked. Setting an 18-week waiting time and targets
about hospital-acquired infection have produced results. When we had
173 of them at the turn of the century it was hopeless, but with four
or five, it is different. So you need a mixture of all those things to
bring about an overall improvement in quality. It then is possible to
have an overview of quality across different bits of the health care
system, and that is really what the Care Quality Commission is in
business to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000170">&#160;</a>

is not very observable, as the economists say, is absolutely right and
it probably never will be. So even though the measures in the Bill, or
at least in the White Paper, are good, with respect to the outcomes
framework, they are never going to take us all the way. We are never
going to be totally confident, at a national level, that things are
improving, so there has to be a mix of levers, exactly as Stephen says.
But also we have to rely on

need to be hard-wired into any assessment of quality in a way that they
are not at the moment. Who knows what Mid Staffordshire is going to

have said, that it is so difficult to measure quality. To some extent,
we have to rely upon inferring improvements in quality from changes in
other areas. There was quite an interesting study that looked at a set
of English hospitals and a set of Welsh hospitals across the border
with similar case loads. The English one was subject to targets and a
performance management regime and the Welsh one was not. It was
interesting that the English hospital performed much better in terms of
the targeted areas, which was not altogether surprising, but the
researchers found that it seemed to perform better in a whole range of
other, softer areas as well—more conventional things. The
inference was that the targets regime led to a kind of tightening up of
management all round, from which one could infer, perhaps, a general
improvement in quality. I am afraid that is the game we are in: trying
to infer improvements in quality from other areas, improvements, inputs
and processes that we think will deliver.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000172">&#160;</a>

suggestion to de-risk the legislation in one area—that, in the
event of service reconfiguration, ward downgrading or whatever, it
would be better left to SHAs and PCTs by effectively allowing them to
run longer, because, you argue, GP consortia are not well placed or are
too overburdened to do this. My concern is that that runs against
something else I think you believe in, in terms of local
accountability, transparency and engagement, which have all been
lacking in just about every service reconfiguration that has taken
place under PCTs and SHAs. I am not sure that is a price worth paying.
Is not the assumption that GP consortia cannot do this really just
speculation or
worry?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000173">&#160;</a>

consortia are ahead of the game—they are already functioning
well and are quite well developed, even though they are in shadow
form—so some can take the lead in making the leadership
decisions on reconfigurations that were discussed with David Nicholson
earlier. Some, however, simply will not: they are just too green, too
small and too undeveloped. To abolish PCT clusters at a time when they
are still in such a state could be very dangerous. The point we make is
that PCT clusters could be given a longer guarantee of existence,
simply to get the less developed ones up and
ready.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000174">&#160;</a>

also say that there ought to be an explicit authorisation
process—I noticed that David Nicholson used that word
today—akin to that for foundation trust status, so consortia
would have to clear a high jump to be able to take on a fully fledged
budget and the associated risk. There would be several waves, and that
would give a role to the PCT clusters to develop the consortia which
were not ready to get over the high jump. We think that would de-risk
the process. It has origins in fundholding, where there were first,
second and third waves, and it would mean that there would be more
obvious successes first, with the go-ahead, developed

really good way of de-risking, even, in the short term, still having
some PCT clusters or regional presence. That is pragmatic under the

they define an evidence-based care pathway, may have something in them
about the quality of primary care that needs to be offered in order to
provide world-class care across a pathway. However, the Bill is silent
on how else the quality of care may be improved, for example through

services and so on—rather than what was going on inside the

of interest, which would need to be worked through, these are
essentially local services that should be commissioned
locally—just as dental services should be: it is nonsense to

it several times? If GP consortia are very small, if they get a couple
of expensive patients—perhaps two, three, four or
five—they could run out of money. David Nicholson, in his
response to the Public Accounts Committee last week, said that, in the
end, it is the GPs’ responsibility, so they could end up going
into
debt.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000186">&#160;</a>

the size of the risk pool, and you are absolutely right: that is
a key issue, and an important question. I have
looked at the evidence, and I think it suggests, as I said, a figure of
100,000. There is a tension here: 100,000 will give just about the
right level of risk pooling, so you will not get one or two expensive
patients busting a budget, but at the same time it is small enough to
allow for some of the other advantages of small
size.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000187">&#160;</a>

specifically, following Nick’s question earlier, one of the
things that does not endear PCTs to Members of Parliament is the fact
that they are incredibly unsupportive when a difficult reconfiguration
issue occurs. Perhaps the expectation of the new GP consortia is that
they might do the job better or be more accountable in some ways. Given
the reduction in the acute tariff, which apparently is going to happen
anyway, is it your view that such difficult decisions will be more
likely to occur in the future, notwithstanding all this; and if they do
occur, will they be more manageable? Often they can lead to extreme
political volatility.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000189">&#160;</a>

                           </div>services. The Bill is really opaque on what that actually means.
Designated services are supposed to be services whose removal will be
significantly injurious to health for a certain population group. Now,
you could argue that all services should be
designated. It is not clear whether the intention
is for some or all services to be affected.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Designation
means that a service is more likely to be supported by the special
administration regime, and that it will be possible to petition for
higher prices from Monitor so that the service remains viable and
therefore protected. The legislation is really very woolly. The spectre
could be that an uneconomic health economy, instead of making hard
decisions, could instead decide to go as far as possible to designate
services and push for price increases to Monitor, thereby leading to
price inflation. In those circumstances, it would be difficult for
Monitor to have the information to make an informed decision about
designation and the price hike necessary. It would also be under the
severe pressure—that unless it made the decision to designate,
the hospital might close. That whole area of the Bill needs to be
thought through, because it is absolutely opaque. In that sense,
decisions may be made more difficult by the Bill’s
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000191">&#160;</a>

Le Grand:</strong>
                           </em> The honest answer is that we do not know.
There is an argument for saying that PCTs were, in some sense, in the
pocket of their local acute trusts. It was the old business of,
“If you owe £100 to the bank and can’t pay it back
you’re in trouble, but if you owe £100 million to the
bank and can’t pay it back, the bank’s in
trouble.” There was too close a relationship between the PCTs,
particularly in London, and that made it difficult to engage in
reconfiguration.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
another argument that says that GPs, who in some senses have more of a
tradition of independence, would be less respectful of their acute
colleagues and likely to be more robust in making reconfiguration
decisions, or at least switching their commissioning, which in turn
will have as a knock-on consequence the need for reconfiguration. My
guess, for what it is worth, is the latter is closer to the truth, and
I suppose I believe that there will be more reconfigurations. The
relationship with MPs will be interesting, and I suspect that, as
Jennifer was saying, a lot of it will be shuffled off to Monitor to
carry the can for the responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000194">&#160;</a>

issue. There is a need for these reconfigurations. That is a
politically tough thing to accept, and it is really difficult if you
are the local sitting MP where that happens, but in pure health care
terms, this is the future. David Nicholson spoke about QIPP being
underpinned and about a transfer of services from hospital into the
community. If they transfer, it is pointless keeping the facilities in
the hospital open. For many years, there has been a direction of
travel. Whether this Bill gets passed or not, that is where we are

competition tends to lead to homogeneity under certain conditions.
Lapsing into economists’ jargon, if you have an homogenous
commodity, such as cataracts or hernia removal for example, I suspect
that you will get a greater homogeneity of service and, hopefully, at
the higher level of service. When you have highly specialised services,
competition can—this is a reservation one has about
competition—lead to the growth of monopolies of various kinds,
and hence a variation in the standard of service and the types of
service offered. On balance, I think the arguments favour competition,
but it is something we have to bear in
mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000197">&#160;</a>

allocation and standard contracts being the way to achieve equity. As
he was speaking, I was worried not so much about the quality standard
differences across the country but about geographical access. I feel
that there is less threat from competition and new entrants than there
is from consolidation, which means that there will be fewer hospitals,
which will mean longer travelling times for people. We know what
happens from literature on that: some demand just stays in the woodwork
and does not come out any longer. The geographical component is not
really discussed on the standard contract idea, and that is the one to
watch. It really should be the CQC and the commissioning board that
take seriously the duty of equitable access, which is in the Bill. In
its annual report, the commissioning board should explicitly have a
section on equity of
access.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000198">&#160;</a>

that giving patients more information will be the thing that will drive
them to be activated to make choices, then we run a serious risk that
it will be the articulate middle classes that will find that
information on the web and then use it. That is why, at the opening of
this session, I spoke about getting really activated patients who can
engage and about designing and shaping the system in such a way that
they are given those opportunities. Unless we do that, poorer people,
people from minority ethnic communities, people whose first language is
not English, and so on, will inevitably find it more difficult. We

experience in the United States of physician groups that formed in
order to hold budgets. In the early 1990s and late 1980s, 3,000 of
these groups formed; there are now 300 left. Broadly, there are two
reasons why many of them went belly up in that period. One was that
they were unable to take on appropriate financial risk and were
therefore torpedoed. They were too small to take on the risk that was
given to them. The second thing is that they invested badly in
management—they did not see the need for management; they were
clinicians who felt a pound spent on management was a pound down the
drain. Those are the ones that failed. Those are the main lessons from

smaller brief than the total purchasing pilots or the consortia, also
turned out, on average, to be rather better managers of their budgets
than the health authorities, which were the principal bodies at the
time. Again, that might be something to do with size, but that is what

course there will be, and one has to accept that that there will be,
some GP consortia that will not do a good job. My contention would be
that the average GP consortium will probably be better managed that the

                           </em> Can I just come back on this question of size?
I was one of the researchers who wrote this report and evaluated total
purchasing. We found that the total purchasers and the fundholders,
which were forerunners of the consortia, made absolutely no headway in
reconfiguring hospitals; they made very little headway on anything to
do with the inside of hospitals. They did lots of things outside
hospitals because they were small and able to do that, but they could
not take on the hospitals, because they did not have enough purchasing
clout, the information or the leadership. Bigger would be better with
respect to having that kind of leadership, particularly if there is
nothing between the consortia and the commissioning board. That is
quite apart from the considerations about taking on financial risk,
having the management expertise that they need and the critical mass of
skills that leads to higher things. Those things push me towards a
larger size.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We at the
Nuffield Trust are in the process of doing the risk calculations for
the Department, so I cannot say yet whether 100,000 is the right size.
Any size is fine, but if consortia are smaller, they just cannot take
on the commissioning for certain services—if they are limited,
they cannot have much clout with the hospital. The big issue here is
service reconfiguration. We are going to see masses
of that over the next few
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000214">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is really interesting, but what about the idea
that smaller consortia can still band together with neighbouring
consortia to commission some of these services? It is not automatically
the case that the size of the minimum consortium will be a constraint
on commissioning some services, because my understanding of the Bill is
that we are expecting strategic partnerships, possibly different

                           </em> If I may start, I think there are two. One is,
as Stephen Dorrell has said on more than one occasion, embarking on
such major reforms for the health service at a time when rising to the
Nicholson challenge of finding £20 billion of efficiency savings
has to be the No. 1 priority. We know that whenever there is a big
reorganisation of the health service, local leaders are understandably
distracted from the core business of improving patient care and
maintaining performance, including financial balance, because they are
spending a

                           </div>lot of time on—if I can put it colloquially—rearranging
the deck chairs. So from the point of view of the King’s Fund,
while we support many of the aims and objectives of the reforms we are
worried about what could happen during the transition, making it more
difficult to rise to the Nicholson
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000221">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
I may add one other quick point: in our view the core of the Bill is
part 3, concerning economic regulation, setting up Monitor and the
powers that will be associated with it. That takes forward things that
we have been doing in the health service for 20 years, but goes much
further in creating the architecture of a market, and it is unknown how
that will work in practice. Whatever the policy intentions, whatever
the legislation says, there may well be a gap, once these arrangements
are up and running, in how the regulator works in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000222">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I would agree with Chris Ham in terms of the
timing and size of the reorganisation, given the financial problems
facing the NHS and the country in general. I think the other risk that
we see is the possibility of destabilisation and fragmentation of
services at a time when you need integration and co-operation. We do
not feel that widening or increasing market forces within the NHS in
the way in which this Bill seems to want to do is going to be helpful.
For instance, giving the economic regulator, Monitor, a prime function
of encouraging competition will not be helpful when
I think its prime function should be to ensure good, cost-effective,
comprehensive provision of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000224">&#160;</a>

the parts of the Bill that talk about greater local autonomy and
freedom from burdens run the risk that public accountability will be
missed out in that move forward. Our second major concern is the
governance culture of some of the new organisations. We think that the
Bill could be strengthened somewhat in terms of the way some of the new
organisations will structure themselves and the way they will involve
patients and the wider public in decision making, assessing quality and

how would the public and patients have a voice in order to try to stop
that? Could you help us with the different levels and how someone

Gilling:</strong>
                           </em> Okay. How it works now is that commissioners
and providers have a duty to involve patients and the public under
Section 242 of the National Health Service Act 2006. They are
duty-bound to involve patients and the public not only in decisions on
their own care, but in developing proposals for service changes.
Proposals for service changes quite often become very controversial. In
our experience of supporting the local authority in its scrutiny and
review function, that is very often because conversations about change
do not start early enough in the process. When providers and primary
care trusts are talking about making service changes, we do not think
that patients and the public are involved at an early enough stage.
There is considerable scope for the new arrangements in the Bill to
improve that, if they work in a certain
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000231">&#160;</a>

about service reconfiguration by consortia. A key part of the process,
though, will be the strength of the joint strategic needs assessment
and the health and well-being strategy that flows from that assessment.
In an ideal world, decisions about reconfiguration would be driven by
needs and by the health and well-being strategy. I see the health and

about the idea that seems to be around at the moment: that
Monitor’s prime duty was to encourage competition. It seems to
me that if you want to try to ensure good quality long-term services,
the first duty is to consider the stability of services. I have used an
analogy. It would be easy to find that you could have any willing
provider who might tender for certain elected services that a hospital
provides—for example, cold orthopaedic—but if that is
going to affect the trauma provision in that hospital and destabilise
the rest of the services, it would seem perverse to say to a consortium
that they have to go to that particular provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000251">&#160;</a>

comment briefly on public accountability. I share the concerns

something as dreadful as that could happen without people at all levels
responding. But, I think that might be more about the culture that
pertains at the moment, rather the various structures. Unless we change
the culture, I do not think changing the structures, as the Bill
proposes, will necessarily prevent what happened in mid-Staffs from
happening
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000252">&#160;</a>

Ham:</strong>
                           </em> May I respond on the stability point because
there is a fairly fundamental question here about whether you think
stability is a good or bad thing? There is a respectable view that we
probably need a bit more instability in our system in the sense that if
we are really going to deliver world-class outcomes and quality of
care, freezing our existing pattern of specialists to keep services in
current district general hospitals is not the best way of delivering
that. We need to take some tough decisions about what has happened, for
example, in London. We are beginning to see some really good results
around better outcomes for stroke patients because decisions have been
taken by the strategic health authority to concentrate specialist
stroke services in fewer hospitals, therefore delivering better
results.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000253">&#160;</a>

for me coming out of your challenge to us is where will the dynamic for
instability—positive instability—to deliver better
outcomes come from? One argument would be that GP commissioning
consortia will, quite rightly, be attached to their local services and
less minded to do what the SHA did in London, which was to stand above
local communities and say, “Actually, there’s a case for
change here, and change means some services moving away from local
hospitals to specialist centres, because that’s good for
patients.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000254">&#160;</a>

evidence that you provided for this session, there is quite a lot about
your concerns about introducing competition, including on price. There
are two quotes in particular that I want to ask you to expand on. In
the first, you say that it could make it impossible for commissioners
and providers to operate in the best interests of their patient
population and in the confidence that they will not be exposed to
frequent and potentially costly challenge. The second point that you
raise is that FTs will become private entities rather than NHS
entities, and as such will be subject to the same rules and regulations
that apply to other private companies, including UK and EU competition
law. Have you received any legal advice about how the Bill subjects the
NHS to the competition law of this country and of the
EU?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000255">&#160;</a>

the first point about price competition, we hear the rhetoric that the
Government do not want price competition—and quite rightly so,
because all the evidence shows that that tends to lead to a downward
spiral in quality. Yet it seems absolutely obvious that if a maximum
price can be stipulated, you can go below that. It would seem to us to
be much better to say that a price should be set.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000256">&#160;</a>

about the things that might or might not happen to bodies when we do

governed like a private enterprise body, the more it will be open to

on local government to play a co-ordinating role right across health
care, social care and health improvement activity in its area, driven
by a requirement to carry out a needs assessment and a requirement to
produce a health and well-being strategy. If that is becoming the
responsibility of a local authority made up of elected councillors, it
would mean a higher degree of democratic legitimacy in the process than

to assume that that would significantly influence the decision about

Meldrum, in respect of the BMA, I am slightly confused about something.
The BMA wants hospital specialists to be involved in GP consortia. I
understand that; you want that written into the Bill. What I do not
understand is why you want it written into the Bill when the Bill
allows it in the first place.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000266">&#160;</a>

is very unclear. It does not even say that you have to have a GP on
your consortium, which is a little strange considering that it is a GP
consortium. The message that we are getting loud and clear is that
hospital colleagues feel pretty alienated by this whole business.
Therefore we feel that unless there is something in the Bill giving
consortia a duty to consult with both their public health colleagues
and their secondary care colleagues, there will not be the reassurance
for them that we would seek.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000267">&#160;</a>

there were quite a lot of practice-based commissioning groups, many of
whom have now been renamed pathfinders. We are conducting a large
survey of about 20,000—not just GPs—and the evidence
emerging is what we picked up generally at meetings and other
times.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000270">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There are
some enthusiasts and some total rejectionists. There is also a very
large group—probably about 70% or so—who are
pretty sceptical and pretty pragmatic. They have now been through three
or four NHS changes and realise that it is probably best to try and do
what they can, rather than be left behind. But I would reject the idea
that there is an overwhelming enthusiasm for this just because a lot of
people have put themselves forward as pathfinders.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000271">&#160;</a>

little of your previous evidence. You need good leaders to take this
forward. You need the majority of practices and GPs to co-operate, but
not necessarily to have the ability. And you need commissioning
consortia to be able to employ the right people to help them in the
work that they will have to do. I differ slightly from Professor Le
Grand’s idea that small is best. Small is best in terms of
getting local buy-in, but if you want to employ the right sort of
people, then you need to be larger. That is why I would probably favour
a more federated model, with smaller groups feeding in to a larger
consortium, and even cross-consortia working for certain of the bigger
commissioning decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000272">&#160;</a>

been there ever since the introduction of fundholding, for instance.
The principal objection to fundholding was that it would create these
tensions. We have seen it a bit already with target payments for
immunisations. Particularly at the time of the MMR crisis, a lot of
parents or patients worried that GPs were giving their advice only
because they knew they were going to reach their target
payments.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000274">&#160;</a>

into the mix, as you say, the possibility of unregistered patients and
the flexibility of boundaries. We proposed the idea of
dual registration about 10 years ago,

allocation would be impossible. You now have not only dual registration
but potentially almost infinite registration, if you get rid of
practice boundaries. I think that that is just going to add to the
problem, but perhaps I should defer to experts greater than myself when

One of the arguments sometimes given for this legislation is that there
is a differential between the survival rates for diseases such as
cancer and heart attacks in the UK and other countries. Clearly, the
causal connection between those sorts of health outcomes and the
management and commissioning structures is slightly opaque, but can you
clarify your view? Do you think that structural reorganisation is
possibly a necessary, if not a sufficient, condition for improvement?

with greater GP and wider clinical involvement in commissioning

consortia, and we have argued consistently the need to get hospital
specialists, nurses and allied health professionals working hand in
hand with GPs. It is not simply a primary care challenge to deliver
those world-class outcomes in cancer care; much of it rests on primary
care working more effectively with hospital specialists in a more

we must be doing better elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000288">&#160;</a>

some countries, the way you measure cancer and cancer outcomes is
completely different. If you look at the Commonwealth Fund evidence,
which compares us with places such as the United States, Canada and
others, you see that the UK does pretty well. What I would say in
relation to cancer care is that the biggest improvement we have seen in
recent years has been the formation of cancer networks, which has led
to a much more integrated system of care. One would not want to see
those things undermined by the potential for fragmentation in some of
these proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000289">&#160;</a>

much more localised decision making by handing over 80% of the budget

purpose is to say to GPs and their colleagues, “You are better
placed to assess the needs of the populations you’re
serving”, and those needs will vary from place to place. On the
other hand, it is clear from what has been said in the White Paper and
the various other documents that the NHS commissioning board and NICE
will both have a significant role in publishing guidance on best
practice, standards and how GP commissioning consortia should
commission services.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000301">&#160;</a>

mentions<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000308">&#160;</a>

that you accept that GP commissioning will have interest in terms of
its value. I assume from conversations that I have had with GPs that
they are driven by clinical need and quality of service, but there is
rightly an emphasis on value for money for their patients. I wonder why
price competition automatically assumes the associated risk of decline
in quality; I do not see how one follows the other.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000310">&#160;</a>

“value” is much wider than price. Yes, you are certainly
looking at cost effectiveness when setting your tariffs, but you have
to look at the much wider picture than just each individual service and
how much this and that costs. As I was saying earlier, if you always
have to tender out every single contract, rather than negotiating a
major contract with your main provider of care for most of your
services, someone is able to say, “Actually, you could have got
radiology cheaper down the road,” or other services cheaper down
the road, and they could therefore challenge that. But if you took
radiology away from your main hospital, how would you treat the
patients that were there?<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000312">&#160;</a>

                           </em> May I add something briefly? The big question is
not whether GP commissioners need expert advice or patient input or
other sources of information. The big problem that we have had over the
past  20 years, in successive attempts to apply
market principles in the NHS, has been the fundamental weakness of
commissioning, whether done by managers or GPs, and whether it has been
fundholding or total purchasing.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000321">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Quite simply,
commissioning health care well is really hard to do. You need as much
management support as you can get, as much expert advice, as much
patient and public involvement. The hypothesis behind the Bill is that
GP commissioning, without PCTs and SHAs, will succeed where previous
models of commissioning over the past 20 years have all failed to
varying
degrees.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000322">&#160;</a>

about the balance of power and where it lies in that conversation. It
seems to me that obviously a lot of the decisions and things that we
are talking about are a balance between professional judgment on the
one hand and public input and views on the other. It is where the
balance of power lies in that relationship. That is why I think the
patient and public involvement and accountability aspects of the Bill
could be strengthened. It is not clear at the moment exactly where that
power balance lies.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000323">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The BMA is on record and has submitted evidence
that it is against the increasing commercialisation of patient care,
and that it wants to see the NHS restored as a public service, working
co-operatively for patients. A recent big BMA campaign, “Look
After Our NHS”, publicly funded and provided, focused on money
lost to the NHS when it is spent in the private sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000324">&#160;</a>

think the impact of more and more public money going into the private
sector will be over the longer term? I would like to draw your
attention to the impact assessment, page 42, paragraph B55, where it
identifies that the private sector health care companies are 14% higher
in cost terms than the in-house NHS provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000325">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There are a lot of questions there. We are
not ideologically opposed to private sector involvement. We have made
it clear that if the NHS cannot deliver, you have to look elsewhere.
However, the evidence, as we have seen so far in a lot of
areas—whether it be from PFI, to some of the experiences of the
independent sector treatment centres, to various other things—is
that they have not done what a lot of people hoped in terms of driving
up quality and driving down cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have seen,
certainly in the initial contracts for ISTCs, how they were given
guaranteed levels of income, how they tended—not
surprisingly—to cherry-pick cases by taking the less complicated
and leaving the more complex ones for the NHS. It also particularly
tends to lead to fragmentation at a time when you are seeking
integration. It is never going to be a true market in health care,
because there are so many differences. One fundamental difference is
that most markets want to increase volume and turnover and, therefore,
increase profit. If you do that in the NHS, it costs the taxpayer more.
There are a lot of other differences that I could highlight.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our worry is
that with the increased emphasis on competition, first of all it will
be more bureaucratic. Consortia will spend a lot more time trying to
ensure

                           </div>that they have got rid of any risk of challenge, because they have not
been seen to be looking at all the various options. Again, as I said,
it will lead to further fragmentation at a time when you want to see
integration and
co-operation.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000328">&#160;</a>

since 1948 has been essentially a privately run, profit-making
activity. That has never been seen to be incompatible with the
principles of the health service. These issues are manageable if we
have the right system of regulation in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11020848000329">&#160;</a>

practice has been a very integral part of the NHS since 1948. Contrary
