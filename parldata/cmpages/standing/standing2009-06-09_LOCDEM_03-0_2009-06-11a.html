have started proceedings at that time. However, I have been advised
that I would have had no power to do so. An uncorrected error in the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b> I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Amess, on this my first outing on the Bill. I
look forward to considering the clauses that fall under my
remit.</div><a name="09061171000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
we finished on Tuesday, the hon. Members for Wycombe and for Falmouth
and Camborne raised questions about the clause and asked for an
explanation of why it is in the
Bill.</div><a name="09061171000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061171000225"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): On a point of
order, Mr. Amess, would the Minister mind moving a couple of
seats to her right, because the light is behind her and it would be
much more pleasant to see her face than to see a black
blur.</div><a name="09061171000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000226"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Again, this is an unusual start to proceedings,
but the Clerk has advised me that we are going to adjust the
blinds.</div>
<a name="09061171000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000227"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Much as I should love the right hon.
Gentleman to see my face and not a black blur, I am afraid I need the
additional table here for all my bits of paper. I am sure we will sort
something out with the blinds.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div><a name="09061171000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
begin, I will explain the logic behind what we want to achieve with the
clause&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption</i><i class="I">]</i><i class="I">&#151;</i>if
anyone is listening. In 2007, we introduced the Local Government and
Public Involvement in Health Act, under which best value authorities
were given a duty to involve. That came into force from April this
year. There has been a positive response to that, and local authorities
welcomed the duty to involve. Many already do so as part of their usual
duties, and are keen to increase the level of involvement as a
result.</div>
<a name="09061171000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duty to
involve is not stand-alone legislation. On considering how to take
forward community empowerment, we took the new local performance
framework that we were introducing as our starting point. It became
increasingly obvious that to be most effective, the duty ought also to
apply to partner organisations that are under a duty to co-operate with
councils to agree local performance targets&#151;namely, local area
agreements. The proposal was discussed and agreed with the relevant
partner organisations; we subsequently announced, in the
&#147;Communities in control&#148; White Paper, our intention to
extend the duty to involve to those organisations.</div>
<a name="09061171000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will also
add the new Homes and Communities Agency to ensure that principles of
involvement apply to it. Since we have established that agency, it,
too, has a duty to agree local performance targets with the local
authority.</div>
<a name="09061171000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
seeks to place a duty to involve on a wider set of authorities. It
represents a simple, logical extension of the local community&#146;s
ability to have its say, and to be informed about and become involved
in a wider range of local services, as
appropriate.</div><a name="09061171000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question was asked why this list is not the same as the duty to promote
democracy list. It is not a question of having the same lists; it is a
different process. This list is for those partner organisations that
form part of the duty to co-operate and part of the local area
agreement.</div>
<a name="09061171000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Falmouth and Camborne asked whether subsection (4)(a) gives
an authority any powers. The clause is worded to mean that new duty
does not grant a public authority any new powers; it is intended to
exist alongside other statutory duties. It does not enable authorities
to pass on duties or responsibilities to another body beyond any powers
set out in legislation governing that authority. With that explanation,
I hope we can agree that the clause should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061171000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

in the Chair, Mr. Amess. The only person who spotted the

and Ripon that the Minister would be unwise to move her place, because
apparently, Ministers are sometimes reliant on sources of inspiration.
I am never going to be a Minister, sadly, so I do not know, but it is
unwise for a Minister to separate herself too far from those

Jackson:</b>
Indeed.</div><a name="09061171000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is cunningly disguised as a probing amendment. Conservative
members of the Committee feel that there was not sufficient debate in
the other place on financial provision for tenant representative
bodies. The specific questions that my noble Friend Baroness Warsi put
to the Minister, Baroness Andrews, and others were not properly
addressed.</div><a name="09061171000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a wider issue about this clause. We have heard that, in many
respects, the Bill contains the fag ends that could not be put in other
Bills. As the appropriate Minister advised us, part 8, on construction
contracts, should have been a separate Bill in the same legislative
programme. It is not and instead, it was tacked on to the end of this
Bill. In the same way, this clause should more properly have been
included in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, which I was
privileged to be involved with on Report and Third
Reading.</div><a name="09061171000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause seems to be out of place, and there are issues with the
definitions in it. There has been some debate about the concept of
&#147;other residential property&#148;, and whether it is right in
the Bill to give carte blanche financial responsibility not only to the
representation of social tenants and the functions of the organisation
set up in their name, but to the tenants of social housing in other
residential property in
England.</div><a name="09061171000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Committee in the other place on 3 February, Baroness Warsi
asked:</div><a name="09061171000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Once
the Secretary of State has provided the money, who will spend it? What
will it be spent on? Who will account for it, and to whom? I will be

Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): As the hon.
Gentleman played some part in the passage of the 2008 Act, he will
presumably understand that the provision of social and affordable
housing embraces a range of different landlords and different types of
housing, including intermediate rent and what would traditionally be
seen as social housing. Is he seriously suggesting that we should have
a rigid distinction that limits the tenant voice solely to those people
defined as living in traditional social housing, and that others in the
more widespread tenure options that are rightly being developed should
be
excluded?</div><a name="09061171000088"></a>

Gentleman&#146;s knowledge and experience of housing. However, it
would be remiss of me not to say that I would take his intervention a
little more seriously had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>his Government in the last 12 years done something about, for instance,
leasehold reform. They have had plenty of opportunities to make changes
through primary and secondary legislation, and have failed to do so.
This is about listening to and consulting people, and acting on
perceived current failings in respect of
leasehold.</div><a name="09061171000198"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000267"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I hesitate to intervene again, but the hon.
Gentleman should reflect that the Government passed the Commonhold and
Leasehold Reform Act 2002. It would be incorrect to give the
impression that the Government have not legislated on this
subject.</div><a name="09061171000195"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000268"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> That is all very well, but, as the right hon.
Gentleman well knows, key provisions of that Act have never been
enacted. That is still a source of contention in the housing
sector.</div>

Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I am listening
to what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but would the establishment of
that body not enable tenants to press for exactly the changes he is
talking about? Is he not actually arguing against the amendment that
he has
tabled?</div><a name="09061171000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000270"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> That is one interpretation. The hon. Lady always
likes a good argument. The clause and the debate around it encapsulate
the whole problem with this Government. If they cannot in the space of
seven years enact the proposals in the 2002 Act, I bow to the hon.
Lady&#146;s optimism that establishing a consultative body across the
whole housing sector is going to bring about those necessary
changes.</div>
<a name="09061171000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to
the intervention from the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich,
I believe that it is important for social tenants and tenants in the
private sector to be consulted on significant changes in legislation
that have an impact on their quality of life, housing tenure and their
future. Indeed, I would commend our housing Green Paper to the right
hon. Gentleman, as it touches on those issues&#151;I am sure that he
has read it from cover to cover. However, we are looking at the
ramifications of the clause. It is too opaque, too loosely defined and
possibly falls outside the remit of the Bill, which deals with local
democracy. It is not a housing matter per se, and on that basis we
would not seek to support it if we divide.</div>
<a name="09061171000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061171000271"></a><b class="B">Dan

see you back in the Chair, Mr Amess, however briefly this
morning.</div>
<a name="09061171000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Peterborough quite rightly proposed his amendment as a point
for debate&#151;a probing amendment&#151;so that we could discuss
the Government&#146;s movement towards a situation which has been
envisaged for some time, with tenants having a far stronger voice at a
national level. I share some of the concerns expressed by the right
hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich about the principles behind the
amendment, which is seeking to create a stark distinction between
social landlords and other tenants.</div>
<a name="09061171000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was an
opportunity to debate the housing policy of the main parties earlier
this week, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah
Teather) and others discovered, there does not seem to be a huge 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>amount of enthusiasm among Conservative Members for social housing. That
is something that I discovered during the recent council elections in
my own constituency. A Conservative candidate who was not successful on
this occasion was keen to point out in a public meeting the problems
associated with social housing estates, describing them in a way I
thought we had all moved on from. I am sure that the hon. Member for
Peterborough and his hon. Friends in Committee would be of the opinion
that that candidate&#146;s views are
outdated.</div>
<a name="09061171000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000272"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The hon. Member for North Cornwall, who is a
fair-minded individual, would not wish to give the impression that the
Conservative party is not committed to social housing, given our record
in the period between 1979 and 1997. We saw lots of innovative methods
of delivering social housing&#151;flats above shops, housing action
trusts and tenant management organisations, to name but a few. If he
read our Green Paper he would see that we remain committed, and because
we have so many councillors at local level it is Conservative
councillors who have been building council houses. In the
past 12 years, Labour councils have failed to do
so.</div>
<a name="09061171000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000273"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am sure that councils of all parties would
want to reflect on the housing records of various councils. In
Conservative housing policy, I still detect a direction towards the
selling off of social housing. That is a continued theme, and a problem
when we are desperate to secure more affordable rented accommodation
across the country. I suspect, Mr Amess, that if I continue down this
line, you may well rule me out of order.</div>
<a name="09061171000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal
Democrats are a bit more sympathetic to the idea of a commonality of
problems and issues for all tenants who want to be sure that, in their
relationship with their landlord, they hold some of the cards, whether
their landlord is an RSL or a private landlord. We are somewhat less
concerned about the sorts of distinctions that the hon. Member for
Peterborough
raised.</div><a name="09061171000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne
questioned the need for the body, given that the Office for Tenants and
Social Landlords has recently come into existence. The Government are
reacting and jumping around rather than thinking ahead and planning.
The Bill considers some housing measures, but it has become a hybrid
measure for all sorts of areas of policy. However, there are some
urgent issues that we need to consider. The Government have said that
they will act to deal with the issue of repossession when landlords are
in difficulty&#151;that problem has huge consequences for the tenants
in that property in the buy-to-let market. They say that they will act
at the earliest opportunity to do something about that situation, and
perhaps the Bill is a missed opportunity, given that it considers
housing matters. In conclusion, the Liberal Democrats are less
concerned to make such a sharp distinction between tenants in social
housing and other tenants, but we are sympathetic to the view already
expressed that we are in danger of duplicating existing measures
.</div>
<a name="09061171000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061171000274"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Lilley</b> (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con): I have grave
reservation about this whole clause and whether it is worth trying to
amend it in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough
seeks to do. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>It flies in the face of the whole concept we have developed in this
country of representative democracy. Normally if a body is to be
representative, we required it to be elected and to have the authority
to fulfil the wishes of those who elect it. In the Bill, we are told
that the Government are going to appoint a body, and so this body
represents those people. They do not choose it: it is imposed on them
and set up on their behalf. It is a soviet-style council elected and
imposed from the top. That is unless I am sadly mistaken and there is
some proposal for this body to be elected by the social tenants whom it
claims to represent. However, I see no such clause in the
legislation.</div><a name="09061171000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nor
does the body have any power to implement the policies which it is
supposed to introduce, support, sustain or promote on behalf of those
whom it represents. The people who do that, of course, are
councillors&#151;they are the people who, in the past, have been held
to be the representatives of the social tenants and residents of other
residential property, not people who are appointed undemocratically by
a Government whose Prime Minister is not even elected himself and who
fears elections at every level. I therefore have grave reservation
about the
measure.</div><a name="09061171000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061171000275"></a><b class="B">Clive

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000277"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> I was, and I helped to secure his re-election. I
doubt whether the hon. Gentleman will achieve that in the case of his
leader. The other reasons for my reservations are the specific ones
that brought me onto this Committee as a result of my having taken part
in the debate on Second Reading. I want to reinforce the principle that
representatives are accountable to those whose interests they serve and
whom their policies directly affect. That means that if a council
chooses to build in the area of another council, and that affects both
the social tenants and the residents of other residential property in
that area, that is a monstrosity, because the council will not be
accountable to those whom it most
affects.</div><a name="09061171000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061171000278"></a><b class="B">Ian
Stewart</b> (Eccles) (Lab): I have some sympathy with the
argument that local government should be more involved in these boards
in the way the right hon. Gentleman says. It is a wee bit rich of him,
however, to be arguing that case, given that under Mrs.
Thatcher, his Government stopped local councils building council houses
and restricted the budgets to local level. Saying that democracy should
be enhanced at local level is one thing; starving it of funds, as the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s Government did, is
another.</div><a name="09061171000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000279"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will treat me with the
generosity of spirit for which he is renowned as a sinner who
repenteth. I hope in the same spirit to have his support when we come
to a Division on this clause and particularly on the new clause that I
will later introduce and which may remedy some of the defects in the
measure.</div><a name="09061171000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever
representative body exists&#151;I hope that it will be councils
rather than something appointed on high by the state&#151;I want it
to have responsibility for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>what it does in its own area, and not be allowed to do things in other
people&#146;s areas where it is not accountable to those whom it
affects. Why does the Minister think that that is satisfactory and what
sort of representation would she like to provide for the inhabitants of
Cockernhoe, Mangrove and Lilley in my constituency, who may find their
homes in their part of north Hertfordshire swamped by housing built by
Luton and South Bedfordshire councils. They will have no say in the
matter; they cannot vote against the councillors who proposed the
matter; they will have no influence over it; and they will have no one
to represent them, other than myself at parliamentary level. I would
like the Minister to tell me why she has not provided any
representation for them and restricted the responsibilities of the
councillors in Luton and South Bedfordshire to meeting the needs of
their own inhabitants in their own
areas.</div><a name="09061171000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000280"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I thank you for your indulgence in allowing me to
finish my cup of coffee, Mr. Amess. I wanted to make a small
gesture towards the modernisation of Parliament and I am glad that I
have been allowed to do so.</div>
<a name="09061171000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000281"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have to confess that I had not seen
what the right hon. Gentleman was doing and I have to enforce rules.
Until there are changes, drinking tea or coffee is not permissible. I
just turned a blind eye, given that there was some confusion about the
start of proceedings.</div>
<a name="09061171000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000282"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Reform often emerges from confusion, as indeed did
humanity, if I may
so.</div><a name="09061171000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000283"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> Would my right hon. Friend not agree that under
this Government it usually ends in
confusion?</div><a name="09061171000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000284"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member for Eccles should inquire
of the Housing Minister what has happened to the Government&#146;s
proposals to look again at the destination of housing revenue. At the
moment, a significant amount is pre-empted by the Treasury. If he
wishes to see more funds committed to the construction of social
housing, perhaps he should ask the Under-Secretary what she intends to
do about the very large amounts of money which is in effect taxed away
from big authorities and which could otherwise go back into
housing.</div><a name="09061171000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000285"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> Further to the comments of the hon. Member for
Eccles, does my right hon. Friend agree that in practice in the period
1979-97, a lot of housing subsidy was remitted from the south of
England to the north of England&#151;to local authorities and Labour
voting areas&#151;based on housing need, which is as it should
be?</div>
<a name="09061171000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000286"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> It was, but one has to be careful before one sees
hard geographic lines in that. This proposal comes from the Cave
report. Our attitude should depend on what clarification and precision
the Minister can give about how it will work in practice. I can see the
argument for having such a body&#151;it was part of a well received
bunch of recommendations&#151;but the question is how it will work in
practice.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="09061171000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
expression, &#147;other residential property&#148;, I assume, along
with the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, that that is
intended to widen the net to embrace all categories of sub-market
provision. If the Minister would clarify that phrase&#151;and if
there is no better way of capturing that concept than that particular
phrase&#151;that might set some minds to rest. As things stand at the
moment, &#147;other residential property&#148;, could mean that if
Madonna decides to rent another mansion block somewhere, she could
claim representation on the tenants&#146; body, which, I assume, is
not the intention of the measure. Indeed, any MP who rents property in
London could claim they were a tenant and demand to be part of the
body, so I am just seeking some
precision.</div><a name="09061171000199"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09061171000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
what will the body actually do? How is it going to be formed, and who
is going to sit on it? How are its members going to be chosen? We live
in a world in which more people sit on quangos in England than sit on
local councils as elected members. It is an astonishing statistic, but
it happens to be true; local democracy has largely given way to
quangocracy. We just need to be sure, if we are creating another
quango, that it really is necessary to do a particular job.</div>
<a name="09061171000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill says
that the body could be an &#147;existing body&#148;. Will the
Minister give us an example of an existing body which might qualify
under this clause to be nominated as the tenant representative body?
Moreover, who is the interlocutor going to be? Presumably it is the
homes and communities quango&#151;is that its interlocutor, or is the
interlocutor going to be the Department or the local councils?
Who is it going to talk to, and about
what?</div><a name="09061171000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
of the complaints I receive from tenants are about the behaviour of
other tenants. It is about anti-social behaviour, or people using
drugs, or needles in the garden; it is basically about people whom they
do not think suitable being put in next door and creating all sorts of
disturbance and problems so that their lives become miserable. That is
the overwhelming category of complaints I receive from tenants. If this
gave some assistance to local councils in dealing with that issue, so
that people in social housing felt they had neighbours they could trust
and were at ease in their homes, that would be a great
asset.</div><a name="09061171000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next category of things people are concerned about is allocations.
However many properties are transferred, the allocations usually remain
with the local authority, so the allocation policy is a council policy,
even if the ownership of the properties is moved
elsewhere&#151;whether it is a transfer authority or an arm&#146;s
length management organisation. That is another area of
concern.</div><a name="09061171000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often,
if there is a transfer, part of that deal is a programme of
modernisation of kitchens or bathrooms or whatever. A common concern is
that, if there is a modernisation programme going through the estate,
its progress appears to be inefficient, too slow or not up to required
standards. I would therefore like reassurance that the organisation, if
it is set up, will focus on very practical issues of concern for
tenants, and that it is not going to get itself into an ideological
argument about the nature of housing, or the merits or demerits of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>transfer proposals&#151;in other words, that it will deal with the
nitty-gritty of life, which is almost entirely the material which comes
into our
surgeries.</div><a name="09061171000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister can reassure us about the practicality of how this will
function, how it will represent the tenants, how its members will be
chosen, how it will report back, and how it will be accountable to
their tenants, and the nature of the interlocutors, there may
be a case for not opposing the clause. However, a huge amount hinges on
how the Minister responds to those
points.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000287"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I will try to sum up the various points that
have been
made.</div><a name="09061171000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Peterborough said that these were probing amendments,
but he went on to say that he intended to oppose the clause. I am
saddened that the Conservative party does not support the creation of
National Tenant Voice, a body that will act as an advocate for millions
of tenants, not least by enabling a direct dialogue between tenants and
Government, and between tenants and the new social housing regulator.
The amendments would restrict activities to matters concerning only
social housing tenants, rather than tenants of other residential
property. I do not think that that is right.</div>
<a name="09061171000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The creation
of National Tenant Voice is part of the wider reform of social housing
regulation, and the new body&#146;s initial focus should be tenants
in social housing. However, I do not want the benefits of National
Tenant Voice to be confined to social housing tenants alone, although
they should be its core focus. Many of the issues that concern social
housing tenants are of equal concern to many tenants in the private
sector. National Tenant Voice will be an independent body. Once it is
established, it will decide whether to seek, at some later date, to
give a voice to tenants in the private sector, particularly the most
vulnerable of those tenants. We want the legislation to be sufficiently
flexible to allow such a decision to be made. However, the clause does
not envisage that National Tenant Voice would be able to represent
private sector tenants alone. Where private sector tenants are
represented, the body must also represent social housing
tenants.</div>
<a name="09061171000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
respond to some of the specific questions that were asked, such as why
the clause did not form part of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008.
That was because the original intention was for the National Consumer
Council to house National Tenant Voice. However, on reflection, it was
decided that that would be too great a burden to place on the new body,
and it was recommended that we should have a stand-alone body. This
legislation is coming forward because we cannot set up the body until
we have the power to fund it.</div>
<a name="09061171000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000288"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Is it not the case that existing tenant
organisations, such as the Tenants and Residents Organisations of
England, and other bodies representing tenants and tenant management
organisations, participated in that discussion and recommended the
outcome that is now being brought forward: there should be a
stand-alone body, rather than a body that forms part of the NCC? This
is not just a good idea, but a proposal that reflects the responses and
wishes of tenant representative bodies.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div><a name="09061171000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000289"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for
raising that salient point.</div>
<a name="09061171000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
question, which was originally put by the hon. Member for Peterborough,
before being picked up by other members of the Committee, was about to
whom the new body will be accountable. National Tenant Voice will be a
non-departmental public body and publicly accountable to Parliament.
Its board will oversee expenditure on research, advocacy and support of
tenant groups locally.</div>
<a name="09061171000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000290"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I welcome the Minister to her new
post&#151;I do not think that I have had the opportunity to do so
before. Will she explain how the membership of National Tenant Voice
will be determined and tell us how large that membership will be? How
representative will the organisation be of not just different types of
tenants, but the different problems that might exist in different parts
of the country?</div>
<a name="09061171000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000291"></a>Sarah

that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000292"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Before the Minister does so, she said that the new
body will be accountable to Parliament, so will its accounts,
activities and outcomes all be subject to scrutiny by the National
Audit Office, as I assume they will be?</div>
<a name="09061171000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000293"></a>Sarah

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000294"></a>The

Members cannot intervene on an intervention. Secondly, if members of
the Committee wish to make points, they must stand up to do so. I will
not allow sedentary remarks to be made from this point

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000295"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess. I am able
to confirm to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon that the new
body&#146;s accounts, activities and outcomes will all be subject to
scrutiny by the NAO.</div>
<a name="09061171000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are now
coming to the issue of how the new body will be composed and who will
choose its board. As the new body will be publicly funded, Cabinet
Office guidelines require that the Secretary of State must choose the
board. However, the Secretary of State will have no power to implement
policy. Tenants will form a majority of the board members and will put
forward names for the board to the Secretary of State. We also have a
project board advising on the remit and composition of National Tenant
Voice, and we are holding tenant awareness events this summer so that
we can achieve the maximum involvement of tenants in the
process.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000296"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Is it intended that somebody will write to, or
communicate with, every single tenant whose interests will be
represented by the board of the new body to invite nominations, or to
set out a mechanism through which they can influence nominations? I ask
because the new body sounds like another quango with the Secretary of
State controlling it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div><a name="09061171000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000297"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Our intention is that tenants will propose
names to the Secretary of State so that the latter can choose the
board. I have explained the reasons behind the legal requirement on the
Secretary of State to choose the board. We will conduct a formal
recruitment service, which will be informed by tenancy
groups.</div><a name="09061171000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000298"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> This body will represent &#147;tenants
etc&#148;. Non-social tenants in my constituency who are lumped
together under &#147;etc&#148; might feel rather insulted. However,
could they propose, choose and elect representatives, and even recall
them if they are useless, or are they to be treated with as much
contempt as they are in being described as
&#147;etc&#148;?</div><a name="09061171000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000299"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> No disrespect was intended in the
phrase &#147;tenants etc&#148;. Where does that appear in the
Bill?</div><a name="09061171000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000300"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> The clause
title.</div><a name="09061171000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000301"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I see. The right hon. Gentleman will agree
that it is not found in the substance of the clause,
however.</div><a name="09061171000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to pick up on a point made by the right hon. Member for Skipton
and Ripon. By extending the enabling power to residents of other
residential properties, we want to capture non-social housing tenants.
However, those tenants must share the concerns of the social housing
sector&#151;I am not talking about millionaires who
rent.</div><a name="09061171000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000302"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> How will it be established that a non-social
tenant shares those concerns? Who will make the judgment and on what
basis?</div><a name="09061171000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000303"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Private tenants can put themselves forward
to sit on the board and oversee the national council. I must emphasise
that this is an independent, non-departmental public body, and it will
be for National Tenant Voice to make that decision. We are putting into
the Bill the enabling power to include the concerns of non-social
housing tenants. The idea is to provide a resource to support tenants
locally, if they have complaints against the policies and practices of
specific landlords that affect tenants as a group, not
individuals.</div><a name="09061171000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000304"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The implication of the Minister&#146;s
remarks is that there will be representation of only the needs of
larger landlords with concerns similar to those of social landlords. My
hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall made the point that one of
the biggest growth sectors at the moment is the buy-to-let market, in
which there are many individual landlords. The biggest problem for
landlords is the threat of repossession, and that problem also means
that tenants have no idea what will happen to them. I do not think that
that major issue will be represented properly by this body. We need
primary legislation at the earliest opportunity to address that
problem&#151;this would have been a great opportunity to do
that.</div><a name="09061171000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000305"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As I said, this is an independent body. We
are giving it an enabling power to include those matters in its remit,
if it so wishes, but its primary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>core concern will be social housing. However, this clause will enable it
to consider the concerns of the private sector as
well.</div>
<a name="09061171000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000306"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> How will the Government raise the
awareness&#151;to use one of my favourite expressions&#151;of
private sector tenants of the imminent existence of this body and of
how they can propose candidates? There might well be a framework of
local organisations&#151;an architecture through which voices can be
expressed&#151;within the social housing sector, but that is not the
case with the private rented sector. With shorthold tenancies of, say,
six months, there will often be quite a rapid turnover. How will they
feel that they have just as much of a crack of the whip as social
tenants? I agree with the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne that
their needs might be very similar, and in many ways, given that they do
not have security of tenure, their situation might even be more
acute.</div><a name="09061171000200"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="09061171000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000307"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Again, I return to my earlier point. We have
provided for flexibility so that the national tenant voice can include
private sector tenants if it so wishes; however, its core focus will be
social housing. The awareness-raising, which we will do in the summer,
will probably be done through those groups, although it will not
exclude private sector groups from having an input and proposing names.
This is a real step forward for all tenants, especially social housing
tenants, and I shall be very disappointed if Opposition parties vote
against the
clause.</div><a name="09061171000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000308"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> We were waiting for the Minister to assuage our
significant concerns. I fear that the clause is an example of mission
creep from the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. We have some serious
concerns on a number of
bases.</div><a name="09061171000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to ask whether the body is truly independent. Listening to the
good fist that the Minister made of a sticky wicket, I suspect that the
answer is no. Next, we are being asked to make a carte blanche
commitment to financial assistance to a body whose efficacy we are not
entirely convinced of. We have significant concerns on the basic,
practical issue of the database. Who will maintain it? Is it possible
to maintain a private sector tenant database to feed opinions to the
independent body?</div>
<a name="09061171000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
right at the outset in my remarks on Tuesday, if the clause did not
exist, would we need to invent it? Would housing be demonstrably any
worse without it? I do not think that it would. As the Minister will
know, many registered social landlords have effective and successful
communications with their tenants. I suspect that the body may not be
needed.</div><a name="09061171000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is bizarre and surreal to measure the vulnerability, or otherwise, of
private sector tenants. Surely, it is not for a Minister or an
organisation to measure how vulnerable tenants feel, by making a value
judgment under primary legislation. That point was raised by my right
hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. We have serious
concerns.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div><a name="09061171000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000309"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes the point that a
number of existing RSLs and other social landlords have existing
arrangements for relations with tenants that work well and ensure that
there is feedback to those landlords. That is absolutely correct. But
does he not understand that the whole purpose of the National Tenant
Voice is to provide a national voice, bringing together the various
disparate tenant representative groups throughout the country? The
absence of a single voice at the moment makes it much harder for the
Government to understand the priorities and concerns of tenant groups.
That is the basis of the National Tenant
Voice.</div><a name="09061171000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000310"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is clearly in favour of
the clause. The irony is that the Bill effectively ignores the
importance of housing in the relationship between local voters, people
whose opinions should be sought and any proposal. That does not assuage
my concerns. In fact, it undermines the representative capacity of
local councillors and MPs who are dealing with housing
issues.</div><a name="09061171000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
particularly, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden
made an important point about the tenure of his constituents, and how
they were going to be represented in, for instance, decisions regarding
residential development in his area made by Luton unitary authority and
other local authorities. I do not believe that the clause is well
written; it is far too oblique.</div>
<a name="09061171000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000311"></a>Ian
Stewart:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what the current
Conservative thinking is on secure tenancies? Does he support their
being left in place, or is he prepared to remove
them?</div><a name="09061171000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000312"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000315"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The Labour Government have had a very robust
debate on tenancies that was initiated by the right hon. Member for
Salford (Hazel Blears) and the lamented right hon. Member for Don
Valley (Caroline Flint). Although the Minister has made a good fist of
it, huge questions remain unanswered. On that basis, we feel disposed
to divide the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000338"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> I am very grateful to you, Mr. Amess,
for your judgment, with the wisdom of Solomon, in suggesting that I
respond now, rather than on the amendment. My first concern about the
clause is what it will cost. It refers to assistance that may be given
in financial form by way of a grant, loan or guarantee, as the
Secretary of State considers appropriate. To put it more crudely, it
is  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>an open-ended opportunity to disperse financial patronage, and I would
like to know what sort of order of magnitude of
money&#151;taxpayers&#146; money&#151;is likely to be disbursed
on this
body.</div><a name="09061171000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second concern is why is it necessary. We have a system called
parliamentary democracy. On average, one in five of our voters is a
resident of social housing. Do we not represent them? Are we not the
representative body that determines policy affecting the social tenants
that elect us? Is it not our duty to make sure that we know about their
concerns, their opportunities, how we could improve the system and how
policy can be introduced? To hive off that responsibility to another
body is to reduce to the responsibility of parliamentarians. Last year,
I introduced a Bill designed to relate the remuneration of Members of
Parliament to their responsibilities. It suggested that a principle
should be established: if we reduce MPs&#146; responsibilities, MPs
should be paid less. It was not universally popular in the House, but
it seemed to resonate in the
country.</div><a name="09061171000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061171000339"></a>The
