<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000342"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Vera Baird):</b><b class="B"> </b>It is good to be
under your chairpersonship on this Bill, Lady Winterton. I understand
that we are going to be less peripatetic than before, which might help
logistics. We did wonder 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>whether we ought to introduce an extra strand in the Bill for wandering
MPs: we had have three rooms. We shall proceed more easily now that we
are not wandering about so
much.</div><a name="0906128000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was still talking&#151;not wishing to sound as if I have been
long-winded&#151;about amendment 107. Many people have chosen to have
a piece of the amendment 107 pie. I draw the Committee&#146;s
attention to a new document that has appeared. Members know well that
there is a new single equality duty on public authorities, and that
will be supported by specific duties. We have undertaken to consult on
how the specific duties should be put together. That document is now
available on the Table at the back of the room if Members would like to
take a
copy.</div><a name="0906128000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Forest of Dean said that sometimes regulators of the
kind referred to in amendment 107 did indeed have some
strategic input. I accept the point that he made, although they are
better characterised as reactive. However, even where they take or
influence such decisions, they implement them through the bodies that
they regulate, and the duty will not fall upon the bodies that are
regulated. There is no lack of sympathy among Ministers with the
intention behind amendment 107. It has been argued with
great strength, and has garnered support, and we will look again to
make sure that we are not wrong, but we think it misses the target at
which it is
aimed.</div><a name="0906128000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to amendment 181, which, again, would extend the duty to all
public sector inspectorates, with the purpose of driving it through the
public sector more broadly. Again, I sympathise totally, but similar
arguments apply. Those inspectorates do not, by and large, take the
long-term decisions that we want the duty to hit, and if they do, they
implement them through the bodies they inspect. Unless we are prepared
to extend the duty to the whole public sector&#151;we have limited it
to the groups that we regard as the strategic ones&#151;there is no
real point in extending it to the
inspectorates.</div>
<a name="0906128000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906128000343"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Is the Minister
saying&#151;this again is genuinely for information&#151;that she
considered the possibility of extending the duty to the public sector
at large, and having derogations from that where it clearly was not
appropriate or necessary? Is that a model that we should have
realistically pursued, rather than this slightly odd system of
specifying part of it and adding in bits of it that we have
forgotten?</div><a name="0906128000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000344"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not think we are doing quite the
latter. We think that we have got into this part of the clause all the
relevant strategic authorities, but we cannot be sure we have, so we
kept a residual power to add to it. There has been a deliberate process
of looking at those authorities to ensure that the duty bites on the
right decisions, rather than thinking that it should be applied more
widely and allowing everyone else in
later.</div><a name="0906128000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the inspectorates that inspect the public authorities that are
covered by the measure, it would be redundant to put a duty on them.
The duty has been placed on the public authorities listed in clause
1(3)(a) to (k). They all have the duty. The inspectorates will have to
inspect them to make sure that they carry out their statutory duties,
because that is part of the matrix of their inspection. We are having
detailed discussions with the Audit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>Commission and the other inspectorates to ensure
that there are worked-out ways in which that will be done, because it
is key that they should be appropriately monitored. Therefore, there is
no need, where the measure bites on the public authority itself, to
make it bite on the inspectorate that will inspect it. We have already
heard the arguments earlier today that, if the duty is not placed on
the body, it should not be put on the
inspectorate.</div><a name="0906128000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906128000345"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): In relation
to the health service, I want to probe the Minister. First, what is
said by some inspectorates has a strategic impact. What a health
service inspectorate says can significantly affect the way in which the
body that it is inspecting delivers its service. There is therefore an
argument to say that the inspectorate, when giving its rulings, must
have regard to the impact that its ruling will have on socio-economic
disadvantage, otherwise inadvertently it might say that the body must
do more of something, even if that has primary care trusts, for
example, choosing not to provide some of the services that we
need.</div><a name="0906128000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
what about organisations such as the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence? Its recommendations are hugely strategic and have
a huge impact on what the health service delivers as well as equity in
the health service. Will the hon. and learned Lady give further thought
to whether that should be included in the
list?</div><a name="0906128000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000346"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> With great respect, the hon. Gentleman
is missing the point. No one will stop inspectorates saying&#151;as
he has put it&#151;what they want and expect, or going through their
usual matrix, added to the ordinary matrix of inspections. On every
public authority to which the measure applies will be the duty to
ensure that it has been complied with. It is really not that
complicated.</div><a name="0906128000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
4 relates to subsections (4) and (5). They are important because, when
the long-term vision for an area set out in its sustainable community
strategy is being put together, all the parties involved are to give
due consideration to the desirability of addressing socio-economic
inequalities. The long-term strategic planning in which they are
engaged is where the duty should be biting, yet amendment 4 proposes
that we remove the provision, which will leave the local authority that
needs to be planning strategically with its partner organisations the
only one that has the duty at the time. It is vital that, when all the
public service partners come together to make strategic decisions about
their long-term vision, they all have the duty then, not at another
time.</div><a name="0906128000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000347"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> To be clear, is it the intention that, when a
public authority enters into a strategic partnership with another
public authority, the duty under clause 1 would bind them in the act of
going in, as well as the body that was the successor, which was the
outcome of the partnership? I assume that it
is.</div><a name="0906128000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000348"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman talking about
machinery of government changes binding successor
authorities?</div><a name="0906128000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000349"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> More or less, yes. It may be that a local
authority is conscious that it is not doing very well on poverty and
could do better in association with another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>authority. One of the factors that might underlie
its decision to seek a partnership could be its need to discharge its
duty under the clause. If that is the case, can I be clear that the act
of it concluding a partnership is itself a clause 1 activity, as well
as whatever comes out of the partnership if it is agreed
to?</div><a name="0906128000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000350"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> As far as I follow that, I think that
the answer is yes. Let us look back at subsection (4), which is always
a good place to start. It says that the clause also applies to an
authority that</div>
<a name="0906128000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is a partner
authority in relation to a...local
authority&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0906128000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">it
deals with specific partner authorities for local government&#151;and
that</div>
<a name="0906128000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does not fall
within subsection (3)&#148;</div>
<a name="0906128000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure only
applies, however, so far as the authority is involved in preparing or
modifying the sustainable community strategy. Going back to the core
words makes it clear what the impact is. As for successor authorities
post-local government organisation, I doubt that this
applies.</div>
<a name="0906128000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We ask that
Members do not press amendments 2, 107, 181 and 4. We shall look again
to make sure that there is not anything in the points that have been
made about the power of the
inspectorates.</div><a name="0906128000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000351"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I was about to say something else before the hon.
and learned Lady said what she just said. When I pressed her, she said
that it was simple and therefore implied that I do not understand. What
has happened is that I have failed to get across my point accurately
enough. If she is willing to look at the matter again, it will be
better if I put my point in writing rather than take up time now
because we have had a long debate on the clause. I am grateful that she
is willing to hear anything more that we have to say on that subject
because I have not put across some of the points. We have not had an
answer on NICE as an example of a strategic body that is not listed,
which has huge implications for the approach that applies in the health
service. She does not need to reply to that now if she is willing to
hear further representations.</div>
<a name="0906128000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000352"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am not remotely convinced that NICE
is a body to which one would want the duty to apply. It is not
appropriate always to put that up. The Financial Services Authority was
another bad example where the duty would conflict with some of the
other targets that it has by statute. I do not think for one minute
that we have absolutely hit the spot. I did not intend to suggest that
the hon. Gentleman was not understanding by saying that it is a
straightforward point but it is a straightforward point and I have made
it three or four times. If he writes to me, I will read his comments
with great care, but I do not doubt that he has in his usual way
adequately made his point.</div>
<a name="0906128000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 108
proposes to extend the scope of the duty in clause 1 to a number of
London-specific bodies. The London Development Agency is already
covered under paragraph (j) in clause 1(3), because it has been set up
under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. The LDA
is, therefore, already in the clause. We agree that the Metropolitan
Police Authority has strategic responsibilities that are relevant to
tackling socio-economic duties and is to a sizeable extent analogous to
other police authorities. We will definitely look at that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div><a name="0906128000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Transport for
London is a bit more complicated because the Greater London Authority
Act 1999 puts the relevant strategic responsibility for transport in
terms of an integrated policy on to the Mayor. We thought therefore
that we had covered it. We will, however, consider the detail and the
division of that responsibility. If we think that Transport for London
should be brought in, we will come back with such a proposal. The same
can be said for the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, which
is also the subject of this amendment. We will consider that one
alongside the other fire and rescue authorities that amendment 109
suggests should be included. About half of the 46 fire and rescue
authorities in England are already covered, as they are local
authorities, but about half would not be.</div>
<a name="0906128000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">My experience
reflects that of the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green. Fire
authorities do a good deal of work in deprived areas. They have their
tenders out in deprived areas rather than in the fire station; they are
doing a lot of work about fire prevention and smoke alarms; and they
engage with the public in deprived areas where most fires start. They
do a good deal of good work. My own Cleveland fire service, under
strategic decisions taken by the authority, is excellent at engaging
youngsters who, through its tentacles, it finds are about to go off the
rails or are not gainfully occupied. It brings them in to do what is
called the life course, which is to train them as mini-fire people for
a week. Somebody&#151;usually me&#151;then presents them with a
certificate.</div>
<a name="0906128000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">It makes a
huge impact on a young person who would otherwise be leaning against a
wall in some fairly run-down estate to be taught discipline and have a
wonderful time on a fire engine with these wonderful he-men who are
good role models in a way the police cannot be. That does them enormous
good, as it does when one gives them a certificate to say that they
have achieved something, often for the first time. I agree therefore
that the fire authorities have a strong role in tackling socio-economic
underprivileged people and we will look again at
that.</div>

Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): I thank the
Minister for taking on board the amendments and having another look at
them. To reiterate what she said, I sat on the London fire authority
and the Metropolitan Police Authority when I was a member of the GLA.
There is far-reaching work that could be done and it is important that
that duty is placed on those
authorities.</div><a name="0906128000045"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000354"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That is what scrutiny is all
about.</div>
<a name="0906128000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I make one
or two general remarks in response to points made in the debate this
morning? Both Opposition parties were as one that we should not
legislate to send out messages. They seemed to suggest that as a
criticism, but it is only they who have conjured up that this is
sending out a message. It is not. It is legislating for a purpose. It
is vital that public authorities prioritise tackling persistent
inequalities, carry on doing it and do it every time that they consider
strategic routes forward. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>Many parts of the public sector do it&#151;of course they do
now&#151;but there is no legal duty to do it. The measure fills that
gap and, in the opinion of pretty much everybody who has been asked
about it in the course of this Committee, can be guaranteed to drive
the agenda forward by imposing the statutory duty. It is integrally
linked, as the hon. Members for Henley and for Daventry both said, with
the discrimination elements of the Bill in that, of course, poverty and
powerlessness make it much harder to battle with discrimination
and discrimination itself can undoubtedly generate poverty and
powerlessness.</div>
<a name="0906128000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">If people are
discriminated against, they cannot get a decent job and they will
remain poor and powerless. There is a key engagement with the
discrimination aspect in clause 1. That, I suspect, is why many
organisations, such as the Runnymede Trust, Race on the Agenda and all
who work in single-sector areas, have spoken in favour of it. A huge
body of people working in the individual strands see the measure as an
addition to their work and welcome
it.</div><a name="0906128000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Socio-economic
disadvantage may not be a racy phrase, but it does capture what we want
to deal with. The hon. Member for Henley is not in his place, but he
talked effectively about the need for outcomes to be a key focus,
rather than outputs. We completely agree and that is why the clause is
couched in these terms, but in order to get better equality in outputs,
one has to look at lack of opportunity. The hon. Member for Forest of
Dean talked about lack of opportunity. One also has to look at lack of
aspiration. I used to live in a mining village in County Durham and an
older miner there, some years ago, told me that people thought, two
generations ago now, that when they got a public library in that
village, that would empower everyone to go out and find a strong life.
Poverty leads to poverty of aspiration, poor education leads to a lack
of appreciation of what one can do with a library, so we have to look
not only at the opportunities that libraries can give, but at
aspiration. There is a complex interplay of
factors.</div><a name="0906128000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000355"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I promise that I will not rise to speak all the
time. I think it is an extremely important clause and I do not wish to
dissent at all from what the hon. and learned Lady just said about
poverty of aspiration. One word troubles me; I think it was implicit in
my earlier remarks, but perhaps she would like to say a word or two
about whether it is possible to tie down what is a
&#147;strategic&#148; consideration, or a &#147;strategic&#148;
decision. The last thing she or I would want is to have lots of
litigation saying that this was purely a tactical thing or an
administrative issue&#151;the kind of thing we get on the Floor of
the House when people are arguing about Ministers&#146;
responsibilities. Is she reasonably satisfied that this is precedented
and will either be coherently self-certified by the authority or be
something that would, if necessary, stand up in
court?</div><a name="0906128000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000356"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I will come to the issue of
&#147;strategic&#148; shortly, but you have to listen to the
advertisement first. We have done an enormous amount to tackle
inequality. We can be proud of our record in reducing inequality. We
introduced the national minimum wage, helping about a million low-paid
employees. We have lifted 900,000 pensioners and 500,000 children out
of poverty and put in place measures to help another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>500,000 children escape it. We have increased our spending on early
learning and child care to over &#163;5 billion&#151;four times the
amount that was being spent in 1997&#151;and we have increased higher
education spending by nearly 50 per cent. and created about
300,000 more student places to give more pupils from all backgrounds
the chance to benefit from enhanced
education.</div><a name="0906128000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument advanced this morning by the hon. Member for Forest of Dean
that the statutory duty to try to end fuel poverty had had no impact is
not correct. We made very good progress. We saw four million households
lifted out of fuel poverty and that duty drove that agenda over a very
considerable time. Of course, gas and oil prices then went rocketing
and we had to start again. It is not right to suggest that that more
complex picture is evidence that the fuel poverty duty did not
work&#151;it did. It is actually potent evidence that this will work
as
well.</div><a name="0906128000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have made good progress. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development study, which covered the period 1985 to 2005, shows that
inequality and poverty, which had both risen in the 15 years to 2000,
fell dramatically in the final five years of the study&#151;faster in
the UK than in any other OECD country. Despite our efforts, we know
that there are still pockets of entrenched poverty in some parts of
this country. We do not think that this is the entire solution, but we
think that it is part of
it.</div><a name="0906128000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think we have struck the right balance with the organisations that the
duty will cover. There are essentially five kinds: central Government
Departments, regional development agencies, local authorities, police
authorities and key health bodies&#151;primary care trusts and
strategic health authorities. The hon. Member for Glasgow, East talked
about Jobcentre Plus&#151;I think he was talking about executive
agencies&#151;which will be covered because the Department for Work
and Pensions itself is covered, so its agencies are too. The only other
bodies covered will be local public service partners that help local
authorities when they draw up their sustainable community strategy. We
think that is
important.</div><a name="0906128000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
were also asked who we consulted, now that I have said who is involved.
We spoke to representatives of all the bodies in clause 1(3)(a) to (k)
and representatives from the third sector and the private sector. We
have a list that I am ready to write out and deliver to all members of
the Committee&#151;I could read it out if the Committee wants me to
be tiresome. It is clear that we looked at, for instance, the Homes and
Communities Agency, the Planning Inspectorate, the child poverty unit,
community transport, better regulation, local and regional bodies, the
Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, the human rights
officials, the TUC, Unison, the Audit Commission, Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectorate of constabulary and the Equality and Diversity Forum. All
manner of people were consulted about clause 1.</div>
<a name="0906128000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;What
did they say?&#148; was probably a good second question; the
contention, I suppose, was that by not consulting we did not hear any
views on the clause. There was general agreement across those bodies
and the others we consulted&#151;who I will include on the
list&#151;that the duty would usefully support the extensive existing
work across the country to tackle socio-economic inequality and to
ensure a more consistent, concerted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>approach across organisations. It will pick up areas that are being
missed and improve the co-ordination of
work.</div><a name="0906128000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
public sector likes the flexible, non-prescriptive approach. Some third
sector bodies wanted us to be more prescriptive. We sense that we might
have got it right. All the consultees said that the duty should be
strongly applied to central Government Departments. That is a clear
message, which we have taken to heart. There was agreement that
guidance needs to be carefully drafted. Not only did we consult, but we
received a positive first response saying, across the piece, that this
will help, even if it is not the only
answer.</div><a name="0906128000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
&#147;strategic decisions&#148; we mean the points where key
policy-making decisions are being made&#151;setting overall
priorities and targets, allocating funds and commissioning services.
These seem to be the key points where those organisations now have to
consider what they can do to tackle socio-economic disadvantage. For a
Government Department that probably means its three-year funding
settlement negotiations with the Treasury. A major policy decision for
a local authority would be when it draws up its local area
agreement&#151;that is quite likely. For an RDA it would be when it
re-evaluates its key programmes, which they do systematically, and sets
priorities for the year ahead. It is less about needing extra
resources, although some would be required, than about organising
resources with this as a high priority. I hope that we have hit the
right people at the right point by referring to strategic authorities.
We have had a fair amount of discussion on targeting and monitoring. We
have resisted the pressure to be very prescriptive, but we have engaged
with all the monitoring, inspecting and regulatory organisations to
ensure that the duty will be looked at as part of the matrix of
things that they look
for.</div><a name="0906128000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): With regard to guidance and
conversations that the Minister has had with those inspectorates, does
she think that the monitoring will be by way of a matrix or by way of a
narrative of considering the decision-making? I ask because
inequalities and outcome are referred to. Will there be measuring of
movement of specific indicators or, rather than looking at outcomes,
will the concern be more about how organisations go about taking
strategic decisions? I do not know what sort of conversations
happened.</div><a name="0906128000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000357"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I think that they are still ongoing. We
are not trying to prescribe particular processes, and different
inspectors will probably need a different approach. We are, though,
quite satisfied that it will come within the matrix of inspections, so
there will be publication of the extent to which objectives required
under clause 1 have been attained, however they be measured in each
case. What will follow will not be some heavy enforcement mechanism.
Inevitably, though, the political people involved in the local
authority&#151;or the practitioners&#151;who press for child
poverty relief, will see the outcome and will press the authority to do
more. That is how we intend it to work.</div>
<a name="0906128000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, we
need to do more. Central Government cannot succeed on their own, so we
must drive the agenda through all the authorities. The duty will put
all the good work that we, and others in the public sector, are doing,
on to a statutory footing. It will help us drive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>progress and promote better outcomes for people who need the most help,
with minimum bureaucracy and maximum flexibility. It is a core function
of public services clearly to tackle all inequalities whether they
arise from a characteristic, life, age or race, or whether they are due
to poverty more generally. This is, overwhelmingly, the right thing to
do.</div>
<a name="0906128000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
indicated which amendments we seek to have withdrawn, and which we will
consider but for whose withdrawal we would be obliged. We will
return to those.</div>
<a name="0906128000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000358"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Given what the Minister said and given that I
explained that amendment 2 was a probing amendment, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="0906128000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="0906128000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000359"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I beg to move amendment 110, in
clause 1, page 2, line 35, leave
out subsection (7).</div>
<a name="0906128000298"></a><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">An amendment to
remove the exemption from the socio-economic duty in relation to people
who are immigrants or
asylum-seekers.</i></div><a name="0906128000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to probe the Minister because I have concerns about
creating a two-tier system that might make second-class citizens of
foreigners who live within our shores&#151;be they immigrants, asylum
seekers, foreign students, or husbands and wives of British citizens.
That might happen because subsection (7) would allow public authorities
to disregard their socio-economic status. The duty would help to
address chronic socio-economic inequality among
immigrants&#151;particularly asylum seekers&#151;and make strategic
bodies comply.</div>
<a name="0906128000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come from
Haringey where there is a large, vibrant population of immigrants and
asylum seekers. As a result there are, obviously, a lot of children who
need to attend our local schools. This is not only about the needs of
asylum seekers, immigrants and their children, but about the impact
that that has on schools in the area. I am surprised that the duty does
not extend in that way. Surely a body such as Haringey council has a
duty to consider socio-economic inequalities and the situation faced by
the children of asylum seekers, and that of children already at school
in Haringey. I am surprised by the Minister&#146;s thinking and I
want to probe how far it could go. This is an all-encompassing
exemption, and I am not sure whether there are meant to be variants
within it.</div>
<a name="0906128000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="0906128000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue is that of asylum seekers not being able to work while they wait
for a decision from the Home Office, which, with the best will in the
world, can mean waiting for a long time, even if the National Asylum
Support Service gives some support. When the Home Secretary considers
legislation concerning people who have come to our shores, surely he or
she must look at the situation regarding whether such people can work,
whether they are banned from work or, until recently, whether they are
given vouchers. The person in authority must make that strategic
decision as policy, which I cannot imagine should be exempt from that
duty. If the Home Secretary is going to decide or propose such
important measures, surely regard should be given to how the person
affected will survive that policy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div><a name="0906128000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000360"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point, but even if the
Government wanted to preserve their ability to have policies such as
the ban on work or the imposition of vouchers for asylum seekers, this
measure would not preclude them from doing so as it merely suggests
that they should have due regard to the issue. Asylum seekers currently
face many hurdles and handicaps due to policies that may or may not be
justified, and they should not be overlooked in other areas because of
that disadvantage.</div>
<a name="0906128000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000361"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for clarifying my
point. Another issue is whether the Secretary of State for Health
could, or should, consider the socio-economic impact on asylum seekers
of a refusal to give treatment for HIV/AIDS while they wait for a
decision about their status in this country. Although asylum seekers
can have emergency treatment, they cannot have non-emergency treatment
and that might force them into illegal routes in order to buy
antiretroviral drugs. Such things should be considered if we are
thinking of these matters in terms of all our people, even those
waiting to obtain the rights that people get once they have indefinite
leave to remain.</div>
<a name="0906128000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do the
Government seek this exemption because they are fearful of a judicial
review on policies such as refusing asylum seekers the right to work or
treatment for HIV? In Haringey I see the consequence of such decisions.
They are very long term and affect a vulnerable group of people,
instilling hardship into their lives. The problem is that due to the
way that decisions are taken, that can last for years on end.</div>
<a name="0906128000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example would be the Border and Immigration Agency, as this provision
would allow it to ignore the negative impact of the charges given to
people who are applying for status in this country, or passports, when
those people have no means of support other than help from NASS, if
they are entitled to it.</div>
<a name="0906128000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
invite the Minister to elaborate further on the amendment and on
subsection (7), and give us some idea of how the issues that I have
raised might be addressed if that subsection is not
removed.</div>
<a name="0906128000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000362"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am sure the hon. Lady has her heart in the
right place; I have a lot of sympathy with her argument and think that
the Solicitor-General has a case to respond to. However, there are two
things that have rather taken down my approbation. First, she let out
the revealing phrase &#147;second-class citizens&#148; but it is
precisely because those persons are not citizens and are
subject to immigration control that the issue might
arise.</div><a name="0906128000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
might have much wider concerns about the operation of the border and
immigration system, but I do not think that the Committee wishes to
hear them this afternoon, nor am I seeking to covertly change the law
in this area. However, the hon. Lady&#146;s point, which it is right
that the Committee should address, is whether persons who are asylum
seekers, or whose status is not determined, have human rights. We need
to remember throughout the process that although people are in a
position where they may be disadvantaged by administrative action, they
are not removed from the map. Many of us have considerable
concerns&#151;I had a very eloquent letter from a constituent this
week&#151;on precisely the issue of the treatment of people before
their condition is determined. We should consider that in a different
context.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000363"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I would like to change the comment that I
made about second-class citizens and second-class human
beings.</div><a name="0906128000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000364"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point. Really, some
human rights are indivisible and are not applicable in relation to
citizenship. I was going to share with the Committee one of the brisker
exchanges I had with a prison director in my constituency regarding the
actions of a prison medical officer, who was denying some prescription
from a prisoner, whose health, I thought, was at risk. I wrote a rather
brisk letter saying that if that went on, they would be in prima facie
breach of article 2. The decision was reversed in a week, and so it
should have been.</div>
<a name="0906128000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
serious point here. Whatever asylum and immigration system we have, we
need to be firm and fair at the same time. We cannot just write off
people as second-class human beings&#151;to use the excellent phrase
that has been deployed&#151;because people have human rights. At any
rate, the Committee needs the Minister&#146;s assurance that the
clause is not some covert way of smuggling in further unpleasantness
over and above the inherent difficulties of the situation at the
expense of immigrants and asylum seekers. If we have some assurance on
that, we will all feel a little easier on the
provision.</div><a name="0906128000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000365"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Subsection (7) is important and must
remain in the Bill. I will take a moment to explain it. For a start,
let me explain what it will not do. Certain public authorities, as the
hon. Members for Hornsey and Wood Green and for Daventry know, have a
duty of care towards people who are subject to immigration control. The
subsection will not affect that in any way. Nor will it affect those
public authorities that go beyond&#151;as I know my local authority
does&#151;responsibilities in this regard. Many do, but it is up to
them to treat each situation on its
merits.</div><a name="0906128000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
instance, people who have refugee status usually have full access to
services and are allowed to work. We have a clear aim for those who are
legally allowed to remain in this country, which is to earn
citizenship. We want them to learn English, find employment, integrate
into society, contribute to the country and be welcome additions to it.
We run integration programmes for refugees to try to ease their way out
of socio-economic deprivation. We try to give initial decisions on
applications for asylum relatively quickly&#151;we are far quicker
now than before. Following appeal, if necessary, we try to aim for
within six
months.</div><a name="0906128000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the meantime, as the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green knows, the
applicants have statutory rights. They are legally entitled to remain
in the country and are not here unlawfully, but it is not appropriate
to force authorities to give particular attention to the socio-economic
disadvantages of that group. No public body will be forced to go beyond
their existing responsibilities, but their existing responsibilities
are
substantial.</div><a name="0906128000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rationale is pretty clear, and I put it as bluntly as necessary. Our
position on people who are here unlawfully is that we are keen to deter
them from entering and remaining here illegally, and to remove them if
they are not entitled to be here. Unless people have shown that they
have a right to remain, we leave it to the public authorities, whose
responsibility it is to ensure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>people are subject to immigration control and are
not pressured by the new duty, and I believe that they seek to deal
with people in a compassionate
way.</div><a name="0906128000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000366"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> For the record, will the Solicitor-General
confirm that there is absolutely no detriment proposed or likened from
the clause to the existing human rights and rights in law that they
have?</div><a name="0906128000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000367"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is about not adding the new duty on
to authorities that already have clear statutory responsibilities for
this body of
people.</div><a name="0906128000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000368"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I am heartened by the Minister&#146;s
reassurances, but perhaps it is in the execution and the time lag that
some of these issues come to my surgery, for instance, where I do see
the situations that I described and real hardship. They must fall
between the intention and the reality. However, I take what the
Minister said and I thank her for it. On that basis, I beg to ask leave

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000385"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I will be brief. I just want to pick up from our
previous discussion one or two of the Minister&#146;s remarks about
the nature of the public authorities. This clause, which is the one
that I said we were not very happy with, gives Ministers the power by
regulations not just to add public authorities that are subject to the
duty, but to remove authorities and to vary the functions to which it
will apply. The Minister said she felt that the Government had covered
most of the authorities that they wanted, but they had left the power
to add them in case they had missed any, and her response to the
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green
suggested that there were one or two authorities that the Minister
needed to consider
again.</div><a name="0906128000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
given that the Bill has these authorities in it and the Committee has
now accepted them, it seems to me that Ministers being able to take
them out pretty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>much whenever they felt like it would not be
acceptable. I would therefore like the Minister to say a few words
about where Ministers thought they might use the powers. Is it an
administrative thing? In other words, is it about taking authorities
out when they cease to exist or there is a reorganisation and they are
called something different or the machinery of government changes? Are
we pretty much stuck with the list barring that happening, or will it
be the intention of Ministers to take out authorities for other
reasons? I would like some understanding of Ministers&#146; thought
processes.</div><a name="0906128000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000386"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We have already exhibited an interest
in being flexible about the list. If we change it, of course, it will
be changed before the Bill becomes law, so then, we hope, the list will
be as comprehensive as all parties here have been able to make it by
considering the purpose of it and being able to add and take off what
they wanted to. I am therefore hoping that we are getting even nearer
to the right list, but yes, the point of this clause is to future-proof
the list. First, we need to specify the right bodies and we think that
we have picked the correct ones. However, the machinery of government
can be subject to change; functions of particular bodies can change, as
can the bodies themselves. New ones come and old ones
go.</div><a name="0906128000310"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000387"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> On the strength of having recently attended the
Council of Europe social, health and family affairs committee, perhaps
I can ask the Minister to at least consider a situation where a public
authority is working with an international organisation. Therefore, the
authority would not be wholly in command of the situation, but there
would be a strategic implication. Will she consider whether there is a
possible loophole that needs
covering?</div><a name="0906128000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000388"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I will certainly reflect on that. The
hon. Gentleman spends his spare time in an interesting way. When old
bodies are wound up and new ones are established, we need the
flexibility to vary the provision, if necessary. It is for that kind of
thing, or where change means that we no longer have the list, because
the list&#146;s contents have
changed.</div><a name="0906128000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, we need the power to add the Welsh bodies to the list. We are
hopeful that Welsh Ministers will decide to extend the duty to their
relevant bodies in due course, sooner rather than later. It will take a
bit of time, so we need this clause to make provision for that to
happen. I hope that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean is satisfied
that, as he put it, we will not be putting bodies on and taking them
off when we feel like it. The intention is that it will not be used
often.</div><a name="0906128000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000391"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Amendment 115 is intended to widen the
definition of who is protected in transgender discrimination. On these
Benches, we have a high degree of concern about the narrowness of the
protection in the definition of gender reassignment. The issue is not
just about reassignment, which is the medical end to a process. We
would also have concerns if, additionally, it were about the process
that leads only to medical gender reassignment.</div>
<a name="0906128000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
vulnerable group, perhaps one of the most vulnerable in society. It is
also a small numerical group who, even at the medical end, have a low
number of operations. That sits atop a spectrum of a whole range of
people who have concerns or confusion about their gender identity. With
young people&#151;this is particularly supported by the European
Court of Human Rights&#151;there is a great deal of concern about
those who have not reached a decision or found their way in terms of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>gender identity. A great many people have gender
issues. In some countries, there is actually a third gender. That
spectrum, which leads from slight confusion to actual medical gender
reassignment at the other end, is very wide. People can find themselves
anywhere on that spectrum. What I would like to hear is that this
Bill&#151;this legislation and protection&#151;is so important that
it is not just there for what can be identified medically, but for how
people feel and where they find themselves in
life.</div><a name="0906128000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment to clause 7 defines what we would see as &#147;gender
identity&#148;, not &#147;reassignment&#148;. We use the
protective characteristic to protect all transgender&#151;including
gender variant people&#151;while also allowing for more specific
references to transsexual people, where appropriate. At the same time,
if I leap across to the new clause, it would not have a chilling effect
or prevent offensive jokes on gender presentation from inadvertently
being covered by a protective characteristic.</div>
<a name="0906128000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">One wants to
be able to have entertainers such as Dame Edna Everage, for example,
and not chill her out so that she cannot say anything. We think that
the clause, on which Press for Change helped, delivers protection for
all those characteristics and all those people on the spectrum wherever
they find themselves, but does not affect life in terms of
entertainment or
humour.</div><a name="0906128000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
of the amendments are consequent on the lead amendment being enacted. I
disagree with the argument that the amendment is not necessary because
it could be caught by other protections. It is so important, and it
would be wonderful if we could give an explicit and unambiguous
protection for those who are not so definite about where they are on
the spectrum and who are not definite about reaching the other end.
Many people never get to the medical operation or even near it. The
protection extends to how people feel about their gender rather than
what they are
medically.</div><a name="0906128000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would also provide future-proofing for the Bill because,
once amended, it would be in line with the international human rights,
equality and diversity statements, the recommendations of the United
Nations, the Yogyakarta principles, the Council of Europe, the EU and
others, ensuring that the Bill will not suddenly fall foul of a claim
in this area in the next couple of
years.</div><a name="0906128000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to include the term &#147;gender variant&#148;,
because it allows the Bill to protect children or adolescents without
requiring them to choose gender reassignment at a stage in their lives
when their identities are still flexible and forming. Much change
happens in those adolescent years. If there is any criticism of the
amendment for not being perfect, which is entirely possible, I would be
grateful if the Government were to ask their officers to look for any
unintended consequences. The intention of the amendment is so
important, I am anxious that we get it right. I am happy for the
Government to take that away, should they be so minded, so that we do
not narrow down the protection to the very few who need it but leave
out the vast number of people who live in a far less certain world in
the process to medical gender reassignment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000392"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> By no means will I guarantee regularly to
associate my views with those of the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood
Green, but in this case I will. The Committee will know the
views&#151;we have already 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>referred to this in the evidence
sessions&#151;that I have formed in relation to gender reassignment,
because I was involved in the Gender Recognition Act 2004. We should
remember in passing that that was an achievement, which I think the
Government can rightly record, and I am delighted that it was passed
with our
support.</div><a name="0906128000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
the Act was driven by a European Court of Human Rights case, which said
that the issue had to be dealt with. One of the glories of this place,
and one of the glories of the European convention in keeping us to our
vocation&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;is to look at the
protected status of minorities. It is well known that those involved in
gender transition at whatever stage are a small minority. I happen to
have a distinguished and very articulate constituent who has been in
touch with me about the legislation. He is following our every word, as
we go through the Bill.</div>
<a name="0906128000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have strong
sympathy with the arguments, and I just want to draw out two particular
points. First, as the hon. Lady has said, it is very much a spectrum of
consideration. At one end is the full acquisition of legal status
through the issue of a gender-recognition certificate, which takes us
in the United Kingdom out of the idea of a three-gender situation,
because it in effect switches from one to the other, being a kind of
digital solution. However, long before that there will be people who
have inclinations or concerns, others who may be seeking
treatment&#151;often with difficulty in finding access to it, or
getting the appropriate counselling&#151;and others then moving on to
medical interventions and therapies. Eventually they may move through
the whole spectrum or, in certain cases, reverse away from that and not
take it forward. Those are very intense and personal decisions for a
limited number of people. It is really important&#151;I cannot see it
as subversive of anyone or of any policy, or likely to cause
cost&#151;to embrace as many of those people as we possibly can. I
would like to see the widest possible clear
definition.</div><a name="0906128000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point has particular bearing when read with the age exclusions
in the Bill in relation to persons under the age of 18. That lady
constituent of mine who has been in touch with me has drawn attention
to the fact that she has been concerned about her status and sexuality
since her teenage years&#151;she is now of mature years and is older
than me. There is some plausibility in arguing, as came out in the
evidence sessions, that there is a battery of local authority
responsibilities in relation to persons under the age of 18 in school,
for example. Nevertheless, given that people live in the community as
well, and as such concerns, confusions, doubts and very difficult
personal situations can start earlier, it is important to make sure
that young persons, who are vulnerable enough in their teenage years,
who have that extra incubus or difficulty to contend with are covered
by legislation. If the Minister can look at whether more can be done in
that area, it would be very
welcome.</div><a name="0906128000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000393"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood
Green referred a number of times to a medicality of definition. Let me
assure her that there is no medicality of definition. It is removed
from the old definition that related to gender reassignments. Although
we are discussing the matter under clause 4, the definition of gender
reassignment is in clause 7&#151;it is clear why she needs to discuss
it under clause 4, none the less&#151;where there is no medical
reference whatsoever. It is not a medical definition; it is about a
personal process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div><a name="0906128000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000394"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the Minister for that information,
but:</div><a name="0906128000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment if the
person is proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a
process (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the
person&#146;s sex by changing physiological or other attributes of
sex&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0906128000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
sounds pretty much as if it is an end-game decision and process to a
complete reassignment. &#147;Medical&#148; might be the absolute
end but before that is a total reassignment of gender, whereas I am
arguing that gender identity is more complex than an absolute switch.
There are stages in which people do not change physically at all, but
they do change, and they need to be protected at whatever point they
are at. That is the point that I am trying to
make.</div><a name="0906128000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000395"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I hope none the less that the hon. Lady
accepts that there is no reference at all to medicality in the Bill.
The existing law talks about being under medical supervision, which may
be what has misled her, but there is nothing here. We have deliberately
left that out. The process is a personal one that an individual chooses
to go through&#151;I did not want to argue about the presence or
absence of free will or any other way it might be driven, but it has
nothing to do with medicality. I hope she has got that
point.</div><a name="0906128000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000396"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I look forward to clause 7, which uses the
phrase</div><a name="0906128000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has
undergone&#148;.</div><a name="0906128000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the spirit of my remarks, I am wondering whether a better formulation
for the Minister&#146;s consideration might be &#147;is considering
undergoing&#148;. &#147;Proposing to&#148; rather implies a
definite decision, albeit one that has not yet been implemented,
whereas &#147;considering&#148; could cover the ambiguous issues in
which many young people in such a situation, and others, find
themselves involved. I do not have that final rubric, but it might be
an idea that would make the provision a little wider without destroying
the clarity that is
required.</div><a name="0906128000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="0906128000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000397"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I acknowledge that and give way to the
hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood
Green.</div><a name="0906128000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000398"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> That is a helpful comment. However, the word
&#147;reassignment&#148; implies that there is a reassignment as
opposed to an identity confusion anywhere on that spectrum. Even the
word &#147;considering&#148;, implies considering a complete
reassignment, whereas people may not ever get to considering
reassignment&#151;they may be wondering about their gender, which is
not the same thing.</div>
<a name="0906128000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000399"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is difficult to protect someone who
is only wondering about their gender. What we are considering is that
many people&#146;s gender identity is the same as their
sex&#151;mine is and the hon. Lady&#146;s is. Therefore, sex is
protected, it is one of the extant characteristics. If one changes
one&#146;s gender identity away from one&#146;s sex toward the
other, then one is reassigning one&#146;s gender identity. That is
what the provision is about.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div><a name="0906128000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000400"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am becoming increasingly confused. The new
clause proposed by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green provides
a definition of gender identity. However that new clause, given the
debate that has just been happening, specifically talks about gender
reassignment and specifically reintroduces the concept of medical
supervision. However, the whole point of what is in the Bill&#151;or
certainly as I read it and explanatory note 57&#151;is that the
medical necessity in provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was
specifically removed, thereby widening the range of people who would be
protected. I felt that that was a sensitive change. New clause 8 seems
to be going in the opposite direction. I draw that to the
Minister&#146;s attention, and perhaps the hon. Member for Hornsey
and Wood Green may want to intervene in due
course.</div><a name="0906128000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000401"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is clear that part of the definition
in new clause 8 reverts to that medical basis of reassignment, but it
is only part of the definition, so the hon. Lady is not totally
regressing, although it is probably what is leading her astray about
our
definition.</div><a name="0906128000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000402"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I want people who are transsexual to have
the protection as well, so that the measure is all-encompassing,
wherever one is on the spectrum&#151;not just medical, not just
reassigned. However, in terms of what the Minister said regarding
someone dressing as a different gender, that might be
temporary&#151;a passing phase. I want that protection wherever one
is on the spectrum, so that the definition is as broad as possible so
as not to exclude anyone. I repeat that this is a tiny group of people
who are incredibly vulnerable&#151;probably more so than any other
group.</div>
<a name="0906128000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000403"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me put it this way. We are
confident that our definition includes everything in new clause 8
except, possibly, subsection (1)(d), which I do not entirely
understand. That is why I say that I cannot be confident about it.
However, it must be made clear that the term &#147;gender
reassignment&#148; is about a personal move away from one&#146;s
birth sex into a state of one&#146;s choice, so that one is no longer
protected by sex and is in a different category. That is what the
provision is about. It makes it clear, by deliberately leaving out the
medicality, that we are talking about a personal process, which may be
proposed but never gone through. It may be considered, in process, or
it may have happened. Its nature may be a medical one. Its nature may
be in choosing to dress in a different
way.</div><a name="0906128000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
whole of that range is satisfactorily covered. If it is not, the
perception element in the definition of discrimination in clause 13 may
cover others who are perceived to be in the category we protect under
clause 7, even if, in fact, they are not. I will say one
more thing before I give way to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon. There is an illogicality in new clause 8 as well, because it
states:</div><a name="0906128000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person has the protected characteristic of gender identity if the
person ... is perceived to be&#148;</div>
<a name="0906128000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">undergoing a transition.
One does not make somebody into something by perceiving that they are
it. If someone perceives that I am over 60, they will not make me over
60, and I will not have that characteristic. It is not there that it is
necessary to put the point about perception. The definition of
discrimination in clause 13 is wide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>enough to deal with perception. The new clause, however, is
over-complicated and completely illogical at that stage, and we could
not accept it in any event on that basis, but the real point is that we
have covered everything the hon. Lady has
covered.</div><a name="0906128000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000404"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister&#146;s last contribution was very
helpful in delineating the difference between us, and I accept that as
long as clause 13 covers perception, as the explanatory notes describe
it as doing, then that is the best place to put the definition. That is
just a criticism of new clause 8. However, the question is whether her
reference to reassignment will actually be an obstacle for someone who,
for example, chooses to dress in the clothes of the other gender but
actually has denied thinking about reassignment and just chooses
because of their gender identity to cross-dress. We worry that the
Minister&#146;s definition will exclude those people from protection,
because it refers to reassignment, even if it is just proposing
reassignment. That may be the only difference between us, given what
she has just said.</div>
<a name="0906128000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000405"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I shall try to make our intention as
clear as I can. I am entirely satisfied that clause 7 fulfils our
intention. Clause 13 covers the definition of discrimination, which is
deliberately couched widely enough to include discrimination by
perception and association, and comes to the aid of the category about
which the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green is particularly
troubled.</div><a name="0906128000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes state that a person who was &#147;born physically
female&#148; and decides to live as a man,</div>
<a name="0906128000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;starts and
continues to live as a man&#148;,</div>
<a name="0906128000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">with no medical
intervention at all&#151;just passes as a man&#151;will have
undergone gender reassignment. He will have started that
process by proposing to do it in the first place, and will have
continued it, but if he had started it&#151;had proposed it, but
withdrawn&#151;he would still have been covered while he was
proposing it. All the various vacillations of the process&#151;often
a very long one, is it not?&#151;are very adequately
covered by the definition, which is our intention, and we have
fulfilled it.</div>
<a name="0906128000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000406"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister has just described someone who
chooses to live as another gender from the one they were born in. If we
take the case of cross-dressing, the decision is not always permanent;
it is not always an every-day decision and not always an
all-the-time-in-any-day decision. It can be intermittent. Given what
the Minister has just said, can she reassure us now or at a later stage
that she is confident that her definition is wide enough to capture the
need to protect people who, because of their gender identity, and not
for the hell of it, choose on some occasions&#151;not permanently or
seeking to do so permanently&#151;to appear as, and live as the
gender other than that into which they were
born?</div>
<a name="0906128000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000407"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Will that not be a question of fact in
each case? Is it a characteristic, or it just something somebody
fancies doing, not because they are driven by gender identity, but
because they like to cross-dress? I do not know his name, but whoever
is behind Dame Edna Everage cross-dresses for that purpose, but he is
not driven to it. I do not think that Dame Edna will be involved in
this clause, although in every other way she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>is safe with this Government. However, somebody who was driven by a
characteristic would be in the process of gender reassignment, however
intermittently it manifested
itself.</div><a name="0906128000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is hard to see why that would not be the case, but I can see that it
would be a question of fact in each case. The person would be rescued
anyway by the association and perception
provisions.</div><a name="0906128000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000408"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The underlying problem may arise from the use of
the phrase &#147;gender reassignment&#148; because that is a relict
of the medical process. If I have correctly understood the concerns
expressed by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, he is
worried about people who may manifest some of the behaviour of someone
who is contemplating trans-gender but may have resisted medical
reassignment. The Solicitor-General is saying in effect that anything
about the issue of transsexuality, however tentative, however
reversible and however expressed, is somewhere covered. If that is what
she is saying, and she can reflect on it and assure us that it is so,
we would be a lot happier. There is a worry that once we start setting
out criteria that a court has to consider if there is an accusation of
discrimination, people will ask for objective tests, which would be
easy to frustrate or argue against in a particular case and could then
cause a great deal of distress to the
individual.</div><a name="0906128000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000409"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> How a court determined the question if
the unfortunate situation that one hopes will not arise ever arose
would be a matter for the court. The use of the term &#147;gender
reassignment&#148;, which in the earlier definition did connote
medicality, has now been specifically rid of that component. I cannot
say more often or with more emphasis that we are talking about a
personal process that may or may not have
medicality.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000411"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I will give way, although I have an
&#147;angels on the head of a pin&#148; sense about this
debate.</div><a name="0906128000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000412"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> The debate may hinge on a pin head but it is
vitally important to a particular community. I am seeking reassurance
from the Minister&#151;although I know she feels she has probably
already given it. I have constituents who are indeterminate and would
not necessarily be identified as gender reassigned or as one sex or the
other. They are somewhere in between and unidentifiable physically. I
want to make sure that those people are protected. They may not even be
on a journey; they may just be indeterminate in their gender identity,
so there is no reassignment at all. Would that be
covered?</div><a name="0906128000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000413"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We have not found evidence of
discrimination against people who one might call third sex. We have not
found discrimination against people like that at all. What causes
discrimination is characteristics that other people can see. A state of
indecision within oneself or a tentative reflection on where one wants
to be on the spectrum will not light itself up so that somebody can
discriminate against the person who is thinking or feeling that
way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div><a name="0906128000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000414"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I would argue against that point because
there are people who are indeterminate or third gender of whom it
cannot be said which sex they are and they face discrimination simply
because they do not look quite as expected in either
gender.</div><a name="0906128000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000415"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We have not come across discrimination
against any such people that has not been linked to a
separation&#151;however tentative, however temporary and however
partial&#151;of gender identity and real
sex.</div>
<a name="0906128000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000416"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Would the Minister at least agree that it would
be extremely undesirable in terms of humanity and public policy if any
individual who was in this ambiguous position felt under any pressure
to undergo some physical process of gender reassignment by medication
or whatever on the fear that otherwise they would not be able to avail
themselves of defence under the protective characteristics provisions.
The last thing we want is to drive somebody into doing something they
do not want to do in order to get them protections they feel
they need.</div>
<a name="0906128000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000417"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> There is no suggestion anywhere that a
person has to be driven into a medical process. As I have said
innumerable times, quite the reverse. Gender reassignment, as defined,
is a personal process so there is no question of having to do something
medical, let alone something surgical, to fit the
definition.</div>
<a name="0906128000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="0906128000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Daventry was worried that the protection would not
apply to young people but it does. In due course I am sure we will have
a debate about age discrimination not applying to people under 18, but
all the rest of the statute does so. I ask the hon. Member for Hornsey
and Wood Green not to press the new clause. I understand why she tabled
it, but it was on the false basis that medicality is the key. I hope
that I have explained that it is
not.</div><a name="0906128000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000418"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Before my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and
Wood Green responds, I should like to make two quick points about what
the Minister has just said. First, the whole Committee is grateful to
her for explaining the intention behind the wording of clause 7. Even
though we are discussing it under the hook of an amendment to clause 4,
the wording of clause 7 is critical.</div>
<a name="0906128000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
used two arguments, which are important and I recognise the intellect
behind them. Proposing to undergo a process of reassignment does not
involve medication or medicality. We accept that. Just because part of
the definition in new clause 8 reintroduces that point, it does not
mean that we think that is the criterion. Obviously it is not, because
the other three components of our definition in new clause 8 have
nothing to do with being under medical supervision.</div>
<a name="0906128000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is
the use of the term &#147;gender reassignment&#148; and the process
of gender reassignment, to which one must refer to have any protection,
even if protection can be obtained by arguing that the person is
proposing to undergo gender reassignment. The hon. Member for Daventry
helpfully suggested the idea of &#147;considering&#148;, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>but even that would not capture someone who has
absolutely decided that they will not reassign themselves&#151;that
is in their own terms. Although the Minister may say that
cross-dressing because of their gender identity is in itself a process
of gender reassignment, I do not think that it is for Parliament to
tell people how to describe their own processes. Those who do not wish
to have gender reassignment resist the idea that they are seeking
gender reassignment simply because they have a gender identity that
involves adopting facets and characteristics of a gender, for example
in the way that they dress, that is different from the one they
were born in.</div>
<a name="0906128000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
unfortunate if the Bill ran against the face of advocates for that
group of people. That is why we still think that the definition in
clause 7 is unsatisfactory. The Minister said there is no
evidence&#151;another limb of her argument&#151;that the sort of
people we are talking about are discriminated against. That may or may
not be the case. We will have to go back to their representatives to
see whether they can give us some examples. It is generally one of the
benefits of equality law that we can act to provide protection before
there is clear evidence of discrimination. That is exactly what
happened under disability, race and gender, where many more data were
made available after the law came
in.</div><a name="0906128000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the Minister says that in any event we can rely on the read-in
provisions of perception in clause 13. Obviously we hope that is true.
The problem is that I do not think it should be necessary for us to use
that back-door approach to get protection in such a limited area, on
the basis that if someone is cross-dressing, other people will perceive
that they are gender reassigning even if they feel that they are not.
That might catch it, but it is more than slightly unsatisfactory. The
Minister might accept that it is unsatisfactory from an intellectual
point of view, even if from a practical point of view it might catch
almost every
case.</div><a name="0906128000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000419"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I cannot see anything to take exception
to in relying on perception and association. They are key developments
in the law of discrimination and very important components of
protecting people. Perception should cover cross-dressers, whatever the
draft would afford.</div>
<a name="0906128000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody here is
suggesting how people should define themselves. What we need to do to
nail it finally is to look at new clause 8 and see whether it includes
anybody who is not covered by our
clause.</div><a name="0906128000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
the medical definition in subsection (1)(a) is undoubtedly covered by
our clause. Secondly, a person living permanently in the gender role
other than their birth sex is covered. Thirdly, somebody who has
received gender recognition would obviously be covered, and fourthly,
somebody</div><a name="0906128000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who
has a gender identity that is different from that expected of a person
of their recorded natal
sex&#148;,</div><a name="0906128000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
covered too. Where is the deficiency in our clause? Each and every one
of those cases is covered, and I have said that at least 15
times.</div><a name="0906128000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000420"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the Minister. She has tried hard.
Perhaps the problem is not in the totality of the clause, but in the
title of &#147;protected characteristic&#148;. It is the
differential between gender reassignment and gender identity that for
me is the most forceful issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div><a name="0906128000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000421"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> In the hon. Lady&#146;s proposed new
clause,
a</div><a name="0906128000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;person
has the protected characteristic of gender identity&#148;</div>
<a name="0906128000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">if they fall into one of
the four categories that I have just set out. The new clause that she
drafted would not add anything to those
categories.</div><a name="0906128000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000422"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the Minister, but I am not sure that
subsection (1)(d) of the proposed new clause is covered. It is people
with the protected characteristics who press for change and the
community behind them who are the most vulnerable, and the ones to whom
we have to try to give future-proofing for almost any eventuality on
the spectrum, which is barely discussed in the world as we know it. I
am worried, but I will not seek to divide the Committee. I ask the
Government to give a little more thought to that differential between
the words &#147;identity&#148; and &#147;reassignment&#148;,
which send out completely different messages to that community and to
others. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000425"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The amendment is short and probing. It would
simply add &#147;or paternity&#148; to the protected characteristic
&#147;pregnancy and maternity&#148;. There are two reasons for the
amendment, one of which is similar, I suspect, to the reason for the
amendments on parenthood tabled by the Liberal Democrats to cover
fathers in those clauses that refer to maternity and maternity breaks
from work. Given the developments that I think are supported across the
parties in increasing the role of fathers in bringing up their
children, especially at the early stage, I wish to explore with the
Minister whether she feels that having another look at that might
help.</div><a name="0906128000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second, slightly wider reason, is one that we looked at when we
discussed the gender pay gap. A number of the witnesses in the evidence
sessions mentioned that one of the reasons for the gender pay gap might
be that, in many cases, women are still the primary carers for
children. Because of the compromises that they have to make in their
working lives to look after their children, they might either not be
paid as much, or not progress as far in their career. Another reason
for exploring the issue is that fathers taking more of a role may
equalise the roles of mothers and fathers in the workplace, and be of
benefit to fathers and their children. It might also even up the roles
that mothers and fathers take in looking after their children, which in
itself might help to deal with issues such as the gender pay gap, when
that occurs because of the choices that people
make.</div><a name="0906128000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a short amendment and I have given a short explanation. For both of
the reasons that I have outlined, I wish to explore with the Minister
what thinking the Government have done about the role of fathers and
paternity. As I have said, I have noticed that the Liberal Democrats
have tabled some amendments on fathers as well. Given the developments
that we have had since the parent legislation that has been rolled over
into the Bill, the Government might give that some
thought.</div><a name="0906128000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000426"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I will be relatively brief, as I will
essentially make the same argument as the hon. Gentleman. It is
important that we probe the Minister&#146;s thinking on this subject.
Many consequential difficulties, to quote Nicola Brewer&#146;s
assertion, have arisen from people not employing women because their
maternity benefits were so good. If we can equalise the entitlement for
men, not only might it encourage men to take part more&#151;I am sure
that all the Gentlemen in this room already do&#151;but it will
further protect women from discrimination in the workplace.</div>
<a name="0906128000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 138
is slightly different. We do not understand why the Minister is only
extending the period of protection for mothers&#151;and indeed
fathers, because amendment 141 is for fathers&#151;from 26
to 52 weeks. We do not understand why it is protected at 26
weeks, when the allowances for mothers&#151;and fathers, we
hope&#151;now extend longer than that. We understand why that has
been cut down, but the essential point of all the amendments is to
create equality between men and women in their care for their
children.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div><a name="0906128000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000427"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Amendment 6 would add paternity to the
list of characteristics. Amendment 138 would extend the period of time
a woman is protected from maternity discrimination in non-work
cases. Amendments 139 and 141 would give men the same
protection against paternity discrimination in non-work cases.
Amendments 140, 149 and 151 would give men protection from paternity
discrimination in the workplace for the period from when their child
was conceived to 52 weeks after birth. Amendment 150 would give
new fathers protection from discrimination for taking, or trying to
take, paternity leave. Amendment 152 would prohibit indirect
discrimination where the relevant protected characteristic is
parenthood.</div><a name="0906128000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Forgive
me for stating the obvious, but paternity would apply to men only.
There are clear and well established reasons why women need protection
against pregnancy and maternity discrimination, but there is no
equivalent evidence to suggest a problem where men are discriminated
against outside the workplace, particularly if they are new fathers. As
my colleague put it to me last night, what the lads usually do is take
a new father out for a drink; they do not start to discriminate against
him. We have not found any evidence to suggest a new strand that needs
protecting.</div>
<a name="0906128000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would add
characteristics if there was a need. We recognise that fathers as well
as mothers should spend the time they need with their families and be
able to balance work and family life, but discrimination law is not the
way to tackle that. There is separate provision, alluded to by the hon.
Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, which advances the cause of
balancing work and life, and we will continue with that. When rights
are given, they will of course be in the legislation that gives
remedies in case those rights are breached.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000428"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> If an employee becomes a father for the first
time and requires, beyond the normal immediate provisions of paternity
leave, time off for &#147;exceptional family circumstances&#148;
under employment law, would there be a prima facie breach of employment
law or would there be discrimination if the boss said, &#147;Look, I
am really getting fed up with this. You are away all the time, you are
producing these pretexts which arise out of your being a father and I
am going to sack you.&#148; We need an assurance that the boss would
not be able to do that.</div>
<a name="0906128000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000429"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Yes.</div>
<a name="0906128000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me top off
my argument on the amendment, which is acknowledged to be probing, by
saying that I agree that it would be only beneficial if we could move
to a situation in which we can commit to extending maternity leave with
pay to 52 weeks at some point. After the first six months, during which
we think that leave is better allocated to the woman, the leave would
become transferable. That would mean that the woman could take six
months leave and then the man could do so. In a direct sense, that
would be a great aid to work-life balance and to redressing the
traditional imbalance in roles.</div>
<a name="0906128000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="0906128000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the Opposition Members, talking about the amendments on that point,
said that such a provision would take away the point of discriminating.
I am not talking about husband and wife now. An employer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>faced with a man and woman who are both job applicants will not know
which one will take the time off, and there will be no point in
discriminating against the woman who is going to get pregnant. That has
always seemed to me a key point of that proposal. I hope that I have
given the necessary reassurances on parenthood and paternity.</div>
<a name="0906128000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leaves me
with the question of the protection of maternity and breastfeeding,
raised by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green. The 26-week
period of protection is not the end of the protection. We have brought
in special protection because we want to enhance the 26-week period,
which is what the World Health Organisation and the Department of
Health recommend for exclusive breastfeeding. We want to frame that and
light it up, to make it clear that there is special protection during
that period. We want to use every available facility, including
discrimination law, to encourage breastfeeding to
continue.</div>
<a name="0906128000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000430"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I do not understand why there should be any
time limit for breastfeeding. Why should discrimination be allowed at
any point?</div>
<a name="0906128000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000431"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not know how long the hon. Lady
has in mind, but discrimination is not allowed at any
point.</div>
<a name="0906128000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000432"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> As I understand it, six months is the
minimum EU requirement. Is that correct?</div>
<a name="0906128000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000433"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Six months is the recommended period
during which breastfeeding should be the exclusive way that the child
is fed. After that, the recommendation is to start to mix foods, but of
course breastfeeding may continue. The hon. Lady need not worry about
protection stopping. It does not stop. It is sex discrimination in any
event to discriminate against a breastfeeding mother. We have made a
special characteristic of those first six months for the purpose of
enhancing their importance.</div>
<a name="0906128000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a shame
that the relatively recent 2005 infant feeding survey showed that the
majority of mothers in this country stop breastfeeding long before the
recommended 26 weeks are up. We want to flag up that period and give
encouragement. As I have said, after that period, any discrimination
continues to be direct sex discrimination. If we want to get technical,
there has been a successful claim, notwithstanding that sex
discrimination requires a comparator, but that has not presented an
obstacle.</div>
<a name="0906128000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
with that reassurance, the amendments will not be pressed, although
they have provoked a useful debate.</div>
<a name="0906128000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000434"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I thank the Solicitor-General for that useful
debate. Given her reassurances to me, the hon. Member for Hornsey and
Wood Green and my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="0906128000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="0906128000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000435"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I beg to move amendment 111, in
clause 4, page 4, line 15, at
end insert
&#145;caste&#146;.</div><a name="09061233000013"></a><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">An
amendment to outlaw discrimination based on a person&#146;s
caste.</i></div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div><a name="0906128000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment looks again at protected characteristics. We are seeking to
probe the Solicitor-General&#146;s thinking on caste being a
protected characteristic. The caste system exists in the United Kingdom
because it has been imported by a large south Asian immigrant
community. My understanding is the caste system makes distinctions
between different sections of society by dividing communities into
rigid social groups determined by birth and/or occupation. That type of
behaviour in this country is exactly what the Bill, in its essence,
seeks to outlaw, so we ought to give serious consideration to whether
caste-based discrimination should be specifically outlawed by making
caste a protected characteristic.</div>
<a name="0906128000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware
that the Government claim that they have found no evidence of caste
discrimination, but I am interested to hear from the Minister what
efforts the Government have made and how they have sought such
evidence. Does the hon. and learned Lady agree that it is likely to be
more difficult to find out whether discrimination exists in an
immigrant community because of the inherent difficulties of consulting
members of the community about something they know is not part of the
ethos? Just because the Government have not been able to find the
evidence, should we not question whether that discrimination exists in
some form? Those who might suffer caste
discrimination&#151;untouchables, or whatever&#151;are less likely
to be plugged into those routes, to come forward to make a complaint,
or to use the channels that others who are not in a caste system might
use.</div><a name="0906128000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evolution of the Bill has been based largely on engagement with
established and organised lobby groups that are well geared to respond
to the Government&#146;s consultations, but I am not sure that that
is true of those who experience caste discrimination. If the Government
are not persuaded, rather than miss the opportunity of a generation to
outlaw a potential form of discrimination that flies in the face of
everything that the Bill tries to do, why not allow the possibility of
an enabling clause to be enacted by a Minister in the future, if now is
not the right time or if the Minister is not minded to add it as a
protected characteristic? Perhaps we can enact it to protect against a
future where we discover the
evidence.</div><a name="0906128000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000436"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I rise to speak briefly for two reasons. First, I
want to say one or two things about the amendment. It and the following
amendments raise another issue, which is relevant to how the Minister
might decide to tackle this one. Part of the point of the Bill is to
codify and simplify the law. If we go through the population, pick out
lots of different groups and invent a new protected characteristic for
every single one of them, there is a danger that we will make the whole
thing very complex. I am a little concerned that that is what we are in
danger of
doing.</div><a name="0906128000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a specific point, I suspect that the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood
Green has had correspondence from the anti-caste discrimination
alliance. It also sent a copy of the letter from the Government
Equalities Office. Two points were raised, and I want to the Minister
to address them. The first is on the lack of evidence. GEO specifically
referred to an informal survey of 20 key stakeholders that the
Department for Communities and Local Government conducted to see if
they were aware of evidence. It would be helpful if the Minister
outlined the nature of the stakeholders, without 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>necessarily listing them all, because there is
concern that the stakeholder groups might well be those from castes
that do not suffer discrimination. Unless the Government spoke to
organisations representing those who do suffer discrimination, they may
well not have picked up evidence of it. We would appreciate some
reassurance on that point, as well as on whether the GEO or the DCLG is
keeping the matter under review, so that if evidence emerges, the
Government can take the appropriate
action.</div><a name="0906128000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
if such evidence became available, rather than invent a new protected
characteristic, could caste be subsumed in the protected characteristic
of race, given that that already includes colour, nationality and
ethnic or national origin? If it was thought that it was sensible to
act in that case, rather than create yet another protected
characteristic, could a new dimension be added to an existing
one?</div><a name="0906128000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000437"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The amendment would add caste to the
list of characteristics. I am invited to add it, in a sense,
speculatively, and I do not propose to accede to that invitation. We
are always willing to consider whether there is a case for legislating
on caste discrimination, but it is not a matter of the Government
&#147;claiming&#148;, as the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green
put it, that there is no evidence of it; it is the fact. We have done
our best to look for the necessary evidence, but we have not found any.
There really is not sufficient evidence to suggest that caste
discrimination is a significant problem domestically. We would protect
if it was seen to be a problem, but we cannot find any evidence to
justify such a measure. One has to appreciate the areas in which
domestic legislation prohibits discrimination&#151;in the workplace,
in vocational training, in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in education, in the management and disposal of premises and
in the exercise of public functions. There is no evidence that, in
those areas, caste discrimination is
occurring.</div><a name="0906128000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to a report published by the Dalit Solidarity Network in 2006,
the Department for Communities and Local Government carried out what
the hon. Member for Forest of Dean talked of as an informal look, but
was, in fact, a scoping survey. The survey was carried out by
contacting a number of Hindu, Sikh and Muslim organisations to ask
whether they were aware of any evidence that individuals or communities
had been discriminated against on the ground of caste in Great Britain.
The scoping survey was, in fact, designed to pave the way for a formal
consultation if the evidence came up in the survey, but it did not, so
there really was nothing to take us further forward in a process that
we were perfectly willing to engage with if there had
been.</div><a name="0906128000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I am sure that many members of the Committee have had correspondence
about this issue from what I shall in shorthand, without the slightest
disrespect, as a write-in campaign, there is, apart from the odd piece
of anecdotal evidence, none of which we have been able to drive down to
a factual basis, still no evidence from that campaign that the
territory which can be covered by anti-discrimination legislation is
impacted upon by caste at
all.</div><a name="0906128000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906128000438"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): I take the Minister&#146;s
point that there is very little evidence at the moment. Can she at
least give the assurance that, if evidence comes to light in the
future, she will look at this issue again?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div><a name="0906128000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000439"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Yes, we are considering looking at it.
I have found out about the stakeholders surveyed. The Hindu Forum of
Britain and the Hindu Council were the two largest and the best we
could do in terms of representative organisations in that field. They
were, and to this day remain, totally against the introduction of caste
legislation. We consulted a variety of predominantly Hindu groups and
some Sikh and Muslim groups as well, and because this was a scoping
survey and would have carried on to a more profound consultation,
people did their best to ensure that we were not talking only to the
discriminators, as it were, and not talking to the discriminated
against.</div><a name="0906128000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000440"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Will the Minister go back to those
organisations to ask why they were so against caste being included as a
protected
characteristic?</div><a name="0906128000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000441"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Because it is socially divisive to have
legislation against something that is not happening and is needed by no
one. The hon. Lady is inviting us to introduce a new characteristic
when there is no evidence that protection is needed. That is hardly
going to contribute to community cohesion, and I think that those
groups are very sensible in taking the view that they do, having, we
are satisfied, conscientiously sought for what we asked.</div>
<a name="0906128000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, we
intended to carry on to a real investigation and consultation if there
was the evidence to justify such a step. We were very willing indeed to
do that, and we have no intention of stopping looking now that we have
looked. Officials from the DCLG and the GEO, the Department that
sponsors the Bill, are continuing to monitor the situation and to meet
representatives of interested parties, but even as that happens, we are
still not getting any evidence. The concern was rightly raised, but I
hope that it has now been put to
rest.</div><a name="0906128000314"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="0906128000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000442"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I am reassured by the sincerity of the
Solicitor-General and the efforts made by the Government to find
evidence. I still worry about whether they will come back if such
things occur, but at this point I am minded not to divide the
Committee. I accept the reassurance of the hon. and learned Lady that
the Government will keep looking, but hopefully no evidence will turn
up. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0906128000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

rise to speak to the amendment standing in my name and that of my hon.
Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green. It relates to the
suggestion that there should be an additional protected
characteristic&#151;specifically that of genetic information,
including family history&#151;to protect those who might suffer from
genetic
discrimination.</div><a name="0906128000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will know that the matter is a live issue these days not only
in this country, but in the United States. It was the subject of
consultation in the discrimination law review, the issue being that
those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>who are genetically susceptible to a condition might be discriminated
against in the provision of insurance in a way that really damages
their life chances. Insurance is just one way, but it is the most well
known.</div><a name="0906128000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about genetic predisposition, and such people do not get
the coverage of the disability protected characteristic. They would be
pre-symptomatic. They would not be exhibiting symptoms. Indeed, they
would not yet have the condition, but the likelihood might be such that
it was significant enough to worry those doing actuarial calculations
on behalf of insurers and would deny such people insurance and leave
them to be discriminated against. Moreover, they could be discriminated
against if the information became available in respect of applications
for work, as employers might not want to take on someone whom they
considered possibly being at high risk of not being able to continue at
work indefinitely or for a specific
time.</div><a name="0906128000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
matter was subject to consultation and the Human Genetics Commission,
which the Government set up to advise them
on</div><a name="0906128000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;new
developments in human genetics and their influence on individual lives,
with a particular focus on social, ethical and legal
implications&#148;,</div><a name="0906128000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">responded
to the discrimination law review, arguing that discrimination on the
grounds of genetic information should indeed be prohibited. I shall
take the Committee through some of its reasons for making that decision
because it is important that we recognise the strength of the case for
such grounds to be included in the
Bill.</div><a name="0906128000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission
said:</div><a name="0906128000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Unfair
discriminatory treatment of groups or individuals on grounds of genetic
difference is
unacceptable&#148;.</div><a name="0906128000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
could say that using the adjective &#147;unfair&#148; means that it
is automatic that we would describe something that is unacceptable as
unacceptable. However, I can say more than that: there is a public
interest in ensuring that, rather than creating a group of people about
whom it might be argued that it is justifiable to discriminate against
them on narrow or even broad actuarial grounds, it is wrong to allow
the development of a group of people&#151;a genetic
underclass&#151;who are not able to get insurance or find it
difficult to get employment. The alternative is that we could ban the
discrimination and share the risk on those actuarial calculations of
insurance, for
example.</div><a name="0906128000240"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000444"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The way that the hon. Gentleman came to a
conclusion was helpful, given that I was about to ask about the matter.
I agree with some of what he said, but there are two dangers in respect
of insurance. First, it is already the case that, if something has
happened to people that is known about, an insurance company is allowed
to take that information into account. If someone has a terminal
illness, an insurance company can decide not to write life cover for
them or to do so on terms that would be expensive. He might say that
that would be discriminatory. However, if that could be done, clearly
the basis on which insurance is done would fall
apart.</div><a name="0906128000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second danger comes down to the quality of information , which is one
reason the moratorium is in place. If individuals can arrange their own
genetic testing and know their genetic inheritance, yet the insurance
company is not allowed to use it, people will be able to get insurance
for all sorts of things, which again may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>lead to that insurance not being available for
everyone. There is a public policy issue to deal with here, but I am
not sure that adding a protected characteristic to the Bill is the
right way to go about
it.</div><a name="0906128000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000445"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I was going to come to all the good points that
the hon. Gentleman made and will deal with them in order to save time.
He made three points, although he might not have realised that he made
a third. The extra point is that part of the problem&#151;unlike when
someone is terminally ill and refused life cover, for example&#151;is
that even for single allele conditions the actuarial calculations are
incredibly complex because many predictive genetic tests are simply not
as predicted in all
cases.</div><a name="0906128000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the genetic condition may not be fully penetrative&#151;it
does not exhibit itself physiologically in every case in the same way
in every person. It is complex, yet insurance companies may generalise
and say, &#147;We know that if we exclude these people we are at less
risk of making an adverse offer and paying out a claim. Therefore, we
can cut the premiums for everyone else&#151;those who are not
afflicted by this genetic predisposition.&#148; If it were an exact
science, there would be a stronger case for it, but it inevitably leads
to rough approximations and generalisations, which are part and parcel
of why this is unfair.</div>
<a name="0906128000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">One key reason
that this differs from having the condition when considering insurance
is the fact that there is a significant public policy interest in
encouraging appropriate people to have appropriate tests in their best
interests and to ensure that family members, where appropriate and with
consent, also have the information to help them to judge their genetic
susceptibility.</div><a name="0906128000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the moratorium is, by definition, not permanent, if people worry that a
test will be used against them, that is a huge disincentive for those
already at a health disadvantage to access the technology, have the
test and get early intervention and lifestyle advice where that is
relevant. There is a real problem of deterring people from accessing
testing, as well as a problem for researchers who have an ethical
obligation to ensure that those taking part are not damaged by taking
part in research. If there is any concern that life chances will be
harmed by taking part in the research and being randomised to the test,
for example, the risk of randomisation cannot be offered with equipoise
because the researcher knows there is a chance of discrimination. It
holds back
research.</div><a name="0906128000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the Committee will accept that these are serious issues that have
to be considered. This is not simply a matter of saying that people are
not yet ill and that we can cross that bridge when we come to
it&#151;when they are disabled in employment protection terms or when
they are symptomatic and insurance companies must be allowed to
distinguish between people with serious conditions and those without.
We are not suggesting that insurance companies should not be able to
distinguish between people with symptomatic serious
conditions.</div>
<a name="0906128000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
argument, which we heard in the caste debate, that there is not a huge
amount of evidence that this discrimination is taking place. While
there is a moratorium in respect of insurance, it may well be argued
that there is not much discrimination. However, as I said in respect of
gender identity&#151;it is well recognised&#151;anti-discrimination
law should lead, not always just respond to established poor practice.
It is there not only in case of discrimination, so that people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>can take advantage of it, but as a deterrent to discrimination that
might occur. As we know from previous anti-discrimination law, it also
enables data to be collected because there is a legal framework.
Finally, in this case there are the positive public health and public
policy advantages of not deterring people from taking the relevant
steps.</div><a name="0906128000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the insurance field, for example, relying on a moratorium does not give
the required long-term assurances&#151;this applies to employers as
well as insurers. The United States is a country where there is great
support for financial services, including insurance companies, some of
which have done better than others in recent years. Nobody could say
that the United States is hostile to the purchase of private insurance
or that its people are not interested in trying to make as much money
as possible out of the system&#151;consistent with the law, of
course, at least in most cases, and consistent with the ideals of the
American
dream.</div><a name="0906128000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the United States, research has been carried out to check whether there
would be significant gaming&#151;adverse selection, I think it is
called in actuarial circles&#151;to identify whether people who were
genetically at risk of serious disease would get insurance, up the
premium, have the test and not disclose the results, or if the test was
banned, take it anyway and screw the insurance companies. In the
research that I am aware of, it was not found that that is likely to
happen.</div><a name="0906128000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
with these serious conditions, or genetic susceptibilities to them,
have other things on their mind and there is a cap on the amount of
life insurance that people can get without providing the test. That is
another way forward&#151;they can get a reasonable amount, but cannot
go for millions and millions&#151;and it has worked
well.</div><a name="0906128000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of the Committee will be aware of the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act 2008&#151;an Act of the US Congress signed into
law by President George Bush on 21 May 2008, which prevents medical
advances in DNA testing from being adversely used by employers and
health insurance companies against people with a genetic predisposition
to particular health issues. I think that Act was passed by the House
of Representatives by 414 votes to 1, which, by any account, is a
significant margin. We would be fortunate to consider in the House
anything that attracted such overwhelming
support.</div><a name="0906128000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
Act refers to the use of family medical history&#151;my understanding
is that if the insurance companies had not resisted the restriction of
the use of medical tests, they would probably have got away with still
being able to use family history&#151;and I have included the term
&#147;family medical history&#148; in my probing
amendment.</div><a name="0906128000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are positive public policy advantages in doing this and there is clear
evidence from other jurisdictions that it is felt to be necessary. We
should not have to wait for gross examples of such discrimination in
employment&#151;that would put the onus on the victim to come forward
before we would act&#151;when there is a clear argument that the
measure might be used. It would do away with the need for people to
worry about whether the moratorium will continue past 2014 and give
certainty to the insurance industry that this is not a path that it
needs to spend a lot of time investing in and that we will share the
risk. I speak as someone who is willing to pool that risk so that a
genetic underclass is not created. I urge the Minister and the
Committee to give consideration to the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000446"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We reflected on this and concluded that
there is no reason to include the amendment in the Bill. There is no
clear evidence of a problem. All the examples sent to us that might be
termed genetic predisposition would already be covered by disability
discrimination. The hon. Gentleman referred to the insurance
industry&#146;s voluntary measure to guard against the inappropriate
use of genetic tests, which could lead to certain people being asked to
pay higher premiums. That is in place and will last until 2014. It is
working well and he has not suggested that it is
not.</div><a name="0906128000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other relevant area is employment. The Human Genetics Commission
reported in 2006 that it had no evidence of employers using genetic
tests. The Information Commissioner has told employers that if they
plan to use genetic tests, they must inform the Human Genetics
Commission. These measures seem to be working well and are
sufficient.</div><a name="0906128000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="0906128000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000447"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> On the moratorium and the fact that it is in place
until 2014, is the Minister able to give the Committee any information
about what the Department of Health&#146;s view is on what the next
steps might be, or are we at a stage where it is too early to think
about that? Given that it is working well, is the Department of Health
thinking of rolling that forward, perhaps indefinitely, or is it
thinking about a legislative solution along the lines that the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has spoken
about?</div><a name="0906128000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000448"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I will check that and drop the hon.
Gentleman a line, so that I can give him a complete
answer.</div>
<a name="0906128000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000449"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister rattled through that response very
quickly, but she said that the moratorium was working well. The fact is
that it is a moratorium and at some point, a future Government may end
it. That would mean that people would be exposed to being required,
before they can get insurance, to disclose any genetic test that they
have had.</div>
<a name="0906128000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
it is possible that employers may seek to take advantage of what is
becoming a more available technology. Other than legislation in this
area, I would like to know what future-proofing the Minister can
provide that would prevent employers from discriminating against people
who would not fall within the disability definition because they are
healthy, are asymptomatic but have a genetic predisposition, or do not
consent to their information being used by the employer. In itself,
that is sufficient to trigger a problem for individuals. I would be
grateful if she could provide some information on
that.</div>
<a name="0906128000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000450"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I rattled through the response quickly
because I thought that we were finishing at 3 o&#146;clock and I
wanted to try to complete this section. Now we have more time, I am not
going to say it all again, but I can slow my pace. The hon. Gentleman
has not suggested the moratorium is not working well. Negotiations on
an extension or whatever is to follow are for the future. In our view,
it is not appropriate to deal with that in the
Bill.</div><a name="0906128000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Human Genetics Commission, to which the hon. Gentleman has referred
quite a lot, found no evidence of employers using genetic tests. The
Information  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>Commissioner has made it clear that employers must inform the genetics
commission if they plan to use them. That would trigger further
inquiry. Again, he has not suggested that these arrangements are not
working well and are insufficient.</div>
<a name="0906128000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
perhaps a key point for me. If there were evidence of a
problem&#151;I make it clear that there is not scant or limited
evidence, but no evidence, despite being open-minded about looking for
it&#151;it is by no means certain that discrimination law would be
the right way to deal with it. It would almost certainly be better
tackled through the use of data protection legislation, prohibiting the
use of genetic test information in setting insurance premiums and
vetting for employment, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw
his amendment.</div>
<a name="0906128000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000451"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> First, I would like to apologise to the Committee
if there was a 3 o&#146;clock time limit that I was not aware of. The
Government Whip has been extremely
helpful&#151;</div>
<a name="0906128000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000452"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It was my
mistake.</div>
<a name="0906128000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000453"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Had there been such a time limit, I would have
spoken even more quickly, although I could not compete with the
Minister.</div>
<a name="0906128000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the thrust of what the Minister was saying. It would be impossible to
respond to all her points, so the best thing I can do is take them away
to discuss them with the Human Genetics Commission and others with a
particular interest in this matter. We will see if there is a necessity
to bring the matter back for further debate. In the meantime, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="0906128000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000454"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I beg to move amendment 113, in
clause 4, page 4, line 15, at
end
insert&#151;</div><a name="09061233000016"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;belonging
to a disadvantaged socio-economic
group&#146;.</div><a name="09061233000017"></a><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">An amendment
to outlaw discrimination against a person on the basis of their
belonging to a disadvantaged socio-economic
group.</i></div><a name="0906128000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would outlaw discrimination against a person on the basis of
their belonging to a disadvantaged socio-economic group. It is to probe
the Minister because we have a socio-economic duty, but no strand, or
no protected characteristic for it to work with. As we have said, the
socio-economic duty is weak. We think that the amendment might give it
real teeth. In providing for a protected characteristic, people from
disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds would be protected from direct
and indirect discrimination. The amendment would make it clear that we
believe that socio-economic disadvantage is one of the great strands of
inequality.</div><a name="0906128000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000455"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I will not rehearse all the arguments about the
socio-economic duty; we did so at length this morning. However, if a
protected characteristic were added and, effectively, called a
&#147;disadvantaged socio-economic group&#148;, how would one
define such a group? Would it be only people who were poor, or would it
be a more complex definition? I do not see a definition in the
amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div><a name="0906128000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000456"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I have to say that I have not defined that
in an explicit way at this point because I want to probe the
Minister&#146;s thinking about whether the Government would even
consider such a characteristic. Obviously, it would require a great
deal of thought and work. There would be a number of legitimate
concerns that such a protected characteristic would have unintended
consequences. However, as other Members have said, that is always the
case when new discrimination law is introduced. With will, the Minister
might be persuaded to ask the Government Bill Office to establish what
those unintended consequences might be, and what would qualify a person
to be someone from a disadvantaged socio-economic background. Would it
be simply poverty? The definition would be within the sense and meaning
that the Government place on the socio-economic
duty.</div><a name="0906128000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906128000457"></a><b class="B">Emily
Thornberry</b> (Islington, South and Finsbury) (Lab): I hope
that the hon. Lady will not take this the wrong way, but is it possible
that the amendment is a clear characterisation of what it must be like
to be in a political party that has no chance of having any power? To
put forward something that has such a vague aspiration and then ask the
Government to go away and sort it out seems unnecessary; there is no
background to it and it is not
practical.</div><a name="0906128000273"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000458"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her helpful
intervention. However, that is exactly the point of scrutinising
legislation. The Government have come to the Bill at the end of a very
long germination. I regard the new socio-economic duty as important,
but it is not connected in the same way with the rest of the Bill, as
Conservative Members said at this morning&#146;s sitting. Therefore,
this amendment seeks to test out whether the proposal would make a
connection that gave the duty some substance and strength.</div>
<a name="0906128000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, one of
the key purposes of the Bill is to eliminate the hierarchy between
equality strands. Without giving the socio-economic duty that protected
characteristic, we create a new hierarchy that will, at some point,
need sorting out. I want to test the Minister as to whether that is an
appropriate thought pattern or
not.</div><a name="0906128000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000459"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not want to be unfair to the hon.
Lady, either. However, I think that she wants me to send the Bill team
out to look for the unintended consequences of outlawing discrimination
against something that she cannot
define.</div><a name="0906128000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000460"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I would simply say that the disadvantaged
socio-economic group would be a disadvantaged socio-economic group in
terms of poverty.</div>
<a name="0906128000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000461"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me make two points. I have reason
to believe that I am a member of a group that would be
socio-economically disadvantaged compared with the group that the hon.
Lady is a member of. She would have to give me her lunch from time to
time, if we enacted the provision, to put me right. It is not an
unchangeable condition; it is not a characteristic. We want to
encourage people no longer to be in disadvantaged socio-economic
positions. We do not want to give them a right to stay there. It does
not fit at all with any of the other characteristics. We need to root
out the causes of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>socio-economic inequality, and that should be done not on an individual
basis, but on a basis such as that set out in clause
1.</div><a name="0906128000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
will the hon. Lady define that? It is all very well to say, &#147;I
haven&#146;t defined it because I want the Minister to do so, even
though I think it&#146;s a crazy concept.&#148; Socio-economic
deprivation is a relative concept. I am certainly more
socio-economically deprived than the Queen, but does that mean that I
should have some special protection? Some of those present may regard
themselves as socio-economically deprived and may well take action, but
against who? Against me because I am richer? I come from a very
poor household, but do I still have some credit for that poverty, even
though I have crossed the class barrier? It is
impossible.</div><a name="0906128000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000462"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Forgive me, but I was simply trying to
demonstrate that the duty on public authorities to &#147;have regard
to&#148; socio-economic inequality is also difficult to define. It
was a probing amendment. Anyway, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0906128000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="0906128000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000463"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I beg to move amendment 182, in
clause 4, page 4, line 15, at
end
insert&#151;</div><a name="0906128000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;carer
status&#146;.</div><a name="09061233000018"></a><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">An amendment
to outlaw discrimination against
carers.</i></div><a name="0906128000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
rise without much confidence that the amendment will gain the
Minister&#146;s favour, but I look forward to further interventions
from the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, because she has
added a bit of spark to the proceedings and is clearly determined to
keep us on our toes. I am sure that she will play a full part in the
Committee in future, even in a constructive way.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> I meant that without any irony, which
I am incapable
of&#151;probably.</div><a name="0906128000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question is whether carer status needs more explicit protection under
equality law. This is a probing amendment, so the Minister need not
unleash the full thrust of her argumentation on the principle involved.
The amendment is a way of getting at, and giving her a chance to say,
how the Bill provides sufficient, which to my mind means significant,
protection from discrimination in work and elsewhere for those who have
carer status. Now is perhaps not the time to debate the issue in
detail, and I am not inviting the Committee to discuss the case of
Coleman in detail, but there clearly has been some doubt about whether
one who cares for a disabled person is protected by the existing
disability protection in our anti-discrimination law. Is the Minister
confident that the status of men and women who care for people who
would not necessarily be described as disabled, but may be isolated,
young or even neonatal, is sufficiently covered in existing law, in the
Bill or in what she hopes the courts will interpret in the Bill based
upon the European directive that underlies
it?</div><a name="0906128000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not seek to make any party political points, because I think that we
all recognise, particularly during carers week, how much work carers
do, how much they save the country in doing it, what valuable work they
do and how important it is that those of us involved in public policy
protect them from any greater disadvantage than that that in which they
often find themselves, even though they willingly undertake their work
because of the need to care for family members. I think that we all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>share that view, but I seek reassurance from the Minister that she is
confident that the Bill provides protection for that important group of
people.</div><a name="0906128000316"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="0906128000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000464"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman strongly argues the
case for carers. There is no doubt about their good work, their
importance and the commendable position that they occupy in the
community. It is carers week and there has been a debate about carers
in Government time today, between 12.30 and 2 o&#146;clock. The
Government recognise what carers do and how valuable they
are.</div><a name="0906128000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rightly,
the starting point when looking at what constitutes a protected
characteristic for the purposes of the Bill is to consider who a person
is rather than what they do. The analogy is clear so I do not need to
set it out, beyond saying that everyone has a sex, belongs to a racial
group and has a sexuality. Some people subscribe to a religion or
belief, some consciously do not, and some people have a disability. One
might say that those are part of the core characteristics that make us
what we are and, apart from religion or belief and gender, are
ultimately not a matter of choice. They are qualitatively different
from being a carer. We do not think that we could add to the protection
and support that we firmly intend to give carers, demonstrated by the
steps that we have taken, today and historically, by giving carer
status a branch in the Bill. In no way does that diminish the often,
even now, undervalued service that carers perform.</div>
<a name="0906128000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman knows about the Coleman case. A young woman&#151;I assume
that she was young, but I have not seen her&#151;with a disabled
child went to the European Court, after exhausting the remedies here,
due to the way that she was treated by the firm she worked for. I am
sorry to say that it was a law firm that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>used to instruct me. The court established that there was such a thing
as discrimination by association with someone with a protected
characteristic. In that case, it was discrimination on the basis of her
association with her disabled child. We looked at what to do about the
judgment, and decided that it was a good principle and that we should
not merely take on the European Court&#146;s judgment but extend the
principle further across strands. That will help carers of disabled
people
straightway.</div><a name="0906128000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other relevant strand is age. People will be protected against being
discriminated against because of their association with somebody in a
particular age group. We think that we have taken a major step forward
and the best way to support carers is through such protection, together
with the panoply of things such as the right to request flexible
working, the right to careers advice and the emerging right to have
breaks. The addition of further legal ground in respect of
discrimination would not help them. They are a most deserving community
that we intend to continue to champion and we are glad that we are able
to do so through the mechanism in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="0906128000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906128000465"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response. It
provided the reassurance, which many want to see, that the
Government&#146;s view is that the needs of carers are adequately met
and it explained why their position is different from many of, if not
all, those with protected characteristics. On that basis, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
