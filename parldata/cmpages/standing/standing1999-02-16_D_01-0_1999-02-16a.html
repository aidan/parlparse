<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security </B><P>
(Mr. Stephen Timms): I beg to move.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Social Security Contributions 
(Transfer of Functions, etc.) Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet 
on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock 
and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock, 
except for Thursday 18th February, when the Committee will meet 
at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
First, I welcome all hon Members to the Committee. In 
particular, may I welcome you, Mr. McWilliam, to the 
Chair? In the past, you and I have discussed a variety of 
matters, although not, as far as I can recall, social security. 
I am delighted that you are in charge because you will 
guide our deliberations with a firm and fair hand, as ever.
<P>
I also welcome the hon. Members for Grantham and 
Stamford (Mr. Davies) and for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), 
who will speak on behalf of the Opposition parties. We 
will shortly be joined by the Economic Secretary to the 
Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West 
(Ms Hewitt), who will share the burden of ministerial 
contributions to the Committee. At the moment, she is 
speaking at a conference in the City.
<P>
I am pleased to say that the hon. Member for Newbury 
supproted the Bill on Second Reading, although the hon. 
Member for Grantham and Stamford did not. It will be 
interesting to discover Conservative Members' position 
on the matter this morning, given the confusion that 
appears to surround it. It became clear on Second Reading 
that the shadow Chancellor, in the excellent Deregulation 
Task Force report, strongly supported the Bill's thrust. I 
commend that splendid document, into which we may 
well dip during our deliberations, to those Conservative 
Members who have yet to read it.
<P>
Primarily, the Bill will combine the collection of all 
national insurance contributions with that of income tax. 
At the moment, 94 per cent. of national insurance 
contributions are collected by the Inland Revenue, along 
with PAYE or schedule D tax. It is therefore sensible to 
combine the organisations as well.
<P>
Secondly, the Bill will enable the newly integrated 
organisation to improve customer service to employers, 
employees, self-employed contributors and others. For the 
first time, customers will be able to sort out all tax and 
national insurance affairs through a single organisation.
<P>
Thirdly, the Bill will bring together the 
decision-making and appeals functions for tax and 
national insurance contributions within a single 
organisation That is a sensible provision, given that many 
issues, such as employment status, are common to both 
functions. New appeals on contributions matters, which 
the Government introduced in the Social Security Act 
1998, will therefore be heard by the tax appeal 
commissioners.
<P>
I was intrigued to notice that the hon. Member for 
Grantham and Stamford signed up to a report by the tax 
law review committee that was published last February, 
which calls for the merger of the national insurance 
contributions disputes procedure with the tax appeals 
system. That report, which I have studied carefully, is 
another splendid document. As far as I can see, it contains 
no minority report or dissenting note. Of course, the bill 
will bring about the very measures that the committee, 
including the hon. Gentleman, sought. I hope that he will 
reflect that point in this comments this morning.
<P>
Fourthly, in the long term, we will gradually align the 
rules governing tax and national insurance contributions 
to simplify the system and reduce employers' costs. We 
will also streamline enforcement methods and thereby 
deal with non-compliant employers and contributors in a 
more efficient and cost-effective manner.
<P>
Fifthly, the powers of inspectors to check national 
insurance records are being transferred with Contributions 
Agency officers. The powers have been in existence since 
the national insurance scheme was established in 1948 and 
have not been a problem for employers in 50 years. The 
main change is that we are decriminalising the offence of 
delaying or obstructing an inspector and aligning it with 
the tax civil penalty system, but we are not extending the 
powers from national insurance contributions to cover tax.
<P>
Sixthly, concerns have been expressed elsewhere that 
the Bill could result in an ever-increasing exchange of 
information on the affairs of contributors and taxpayers 
between my Department and the Inland Revenue. I can 
reassure the Committee on that. The Bill protects flows 
of information that are necessary to maintain services, but 
goes no further on information sharing. The Benefits 
Agency must have the information on contributions that 
it needs to pay out benefits out benefits punctually and 
accurately. That flow is properly protected. The fight 
against fraud needs to continue. We are committed to that. 
Measures to allow disclosure of information for that 
purpose are in place and will continue through explicit 
statutory gateways.
<P>
I am delighted that we have been joined by my hon. 
Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who will 
share the ministerial burden in the Committee. I look 
forward to informative and illuminating discussions. I 
hope that all Committee members will feel assured that 
our deliberations have been for the benefit of those who 
contribute to and depend on the national insurance system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): May I 
echo the Minister's remarks? It is a pleasure to be 
debating under your chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam, 
which is vigilant, forceful and fair. I have had the pleasure 
of serving under your chairmanship on several occasions, 
although I have not served on a social security Standing 
Committee before. I remember you presiding in a 
distinguished way over a Finance Bill Committee, which 
often deliberated for a long time, and a European Standing 
Committee, which was a source of considerable passion, 
especially on the Conservative Benches, in the previous 
Parliament.
<P>
I congratulate the Minister. Although there are not 
many things to admire the Labour party for, we must 
admire and envy the extraordinary information storage 
and retrieval system that it has assembled. I wish it was a 
good at running the national insurance records computer 
as it is at running its own computer, which allows party 
headquarters to keep efficient tabs on everything that we 
say. I realise that any obiter dictum that I may have 
uttered since the age of seven is probably recorded 
somewhere on its machine. It is Kafkaesque, but we 
cannot object; we live in a democracy and it is important 
that what is said in public life is a matter of public record.
<P>
Two points need to be made about the two quotations 
given by the Minister. He had great fun on Second Reading 
with the quotation of my right hon. Friend the shadow 
Chancellor. I have had no reason to discuss the matter with 
my right hon. Friend, but I remind the Minister that the 
report was compiled when my right hon. Friend was not a 
Member of this House. He had no representative or public 
responsibilities. He was a director of a distinguished 
investment bank and was made a member of the committee 
set up by my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon 
(Mr. Major), the previous Prime Minister, to represent the 
interests of the City and business. The committee included 
other business men and representatives of industry, 
commerce and the City and it was the responsibility of my 
right hon. Friend the Shadow Chancellor to examine the 
matter from the narrow business point of view. That is what 
the Government of the day expected him to do, because 
they took account of different opinions from many different 
sources and it was important for them to know what 
business thought about the matter. It would have been 
wrong for anyone in that position not to reflect the interests 
of his and similar firms.
<P>
There is a responsibility on hon. Members we have a 
representative function and a fiduciary responsibility to 
the electorate to listen to all the interests that are 
represented in the country and to take account of all 
representations and lobbying to decide what is ultimately 
in the net public interest.
<P>
The matter could be considered as a purely 
administrative reform. The Inland Revenue collects most 
national insurance contributions and we already have 90 per 
cent. of the effect of economy of scale for businesses 
dealing with one particular agency rather than two. The 
Government whom I supported introduced that measure. 
There could be scope for going further down that road so 
that the remaining 10 per cent. of the benefits of a potential 
merger of the two Departments would be achieved. If we 
considered the matter from that point of view, we might 
come to the conclusion being promoted by the Minister. 
There may be such a case to be made, but it is impossible to 
take the new Labour Government seriously when they 
make such a case. That is what is so insidious about the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> When the former Deputy Prime Minister 
appointed the Shadow Chancellor to chair the 
Deregulation Task Force, he did not appoint him to that 
position to pursue his narrow business interest in the way 
suggested by the hon. Gentleman. He said that he had not 
had the opportunity to discuss with the shadow Chancellor 
his view on the subject. On Second Reading, the shadow 
Secretary of State for Social Security told my right hon. 
Friend that there was no confusion about the shadow 
Chancellor's view. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor will demonstrate 
that when he votes tonight."	 [Official Report, 8 February 1999; 
Vol. 325, c.38.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to Hansard, the shadow Chancellor did not 
vote, so his views are crystal clear.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that hon. 
Members are not always able to be present to vote. I 
assure him that whatever the Government's position, the 
Opposition's position is seamless. I agree entirely with 
everything that my right hon. Friend the shadow 
Chancellor says on economic and fiscal policy and I know 
that he agrees entirely with everything that my hon. 
Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green 
(Mr. Duncan Smith), the shadow Secretary of State for 
Social Security, says on social and welfare policy. There 
is no doubt about that. The shadow Cabinet considers all 
such matters very carefully before a common position is 
announced and I hope that the Cabinet works in a similar 
way. My hon. Friend stated our common position very 
lucidly on Second Reading and the shadow Chancellor 
accepts that.
<P>
I was also in business before coming to the House and 
had the Government of the day called me they never 
did for advice on a policy matter, I would have assumed 
that they wanted to hear my views as a merchant banker 
in the City. I would have said that they should be doing 
x, y or z in the interests of the City and of keeping the 
eurobond market here, ensuring that we get a greater share 
of the derivatives market or international securities 
business and so on. By saying that, I would have 
discharged a double duty: a duty of frankness to the 
Government of the day, and a duty of representing the 
interests of my shareholders and the market of which I 
was part. There is nothing dubious about taking that line. 
It would have been odd if, in that situation, I had tried to 
second guess what the public interest was, as if I were 
already a Member of Parliament or of the Government. I 
hope that we do not have to dwell on this matter for too 
long, and that I have not damaged the Minister's favourite 
toy [Interruption.] He keeps fingering the report and it 
looks as if he is about to intervene again.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions, 
especially from Ministers, are to be deplored. Also, I read 
the Bill assiduously over the weekend, and references in 
it to the City of London are non-existent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> With your usual fairness, Mr. McWilliam, 
you acknowledged that it was not I who raised the subject. 
It would have been wrong not to have responded, since it 
might have appeared that, by my silence, I endorsed the 
statements that had been made.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
To return to the main theme before the Committee, the 
Opposition believe that the Bill is insidious insidious in 
the original Latin sense of the term, because, at first sight, 
it appears to be fairly benign, but it is in fact an ambush. 
You walk into it and find that you are trapped.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not walking into anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I got into trouble in the Chamber the other 
day for saying "you"	, Mr. McWilliam, but I meant it in 
the impersonal sense. It seems somewhat artificial to have 
to say "one"	 or to use the passive voice 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I accept the difficulty, but I did 
not make the rule, I only enforce it. The rule is that the 
word "you"	 refers to the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I accept your ruling, Mr. McWilliam, and 
shall start again.
<P>
The essence of the problem before the Committee is 
to elucidate an insidious Bill insidious, I repeat, in the 
original sense of the word. It is an ambush. It appears to 
be benign when one approaches it and when one sees it 
from afar. It appears to be a boring bureaucratic 
adjustment of no substantive significance something 
that should not hold the attention of politicians for more 
than a few minutes. [Interruption.] From that reaction, it 
is clear that that is the image of the Bill to which Labour 
Members are attached. That is precisely why we should 
be extremely wary, and why I am afraid that it is not 
possible to believe that the Government regard this as an 
administrative measure likely to produce greater 
efficiency in government.
<P>
If we were persuaded that that was the case, we would 
have supported the Bill on Second Reading, and would be 
spending very little time on it this morning. We would 
probably have finished our proceedings by the coffee 
break. However, we must consider the Bill against the 
background of the Government's extraordinary attack on 
the national insurance system. I might have expected a 
Labour Government to do many damaging things to the 
country, but I would never have expected them to set 
about undermining admittedly surreptitiously, but most 
effectively and systematically the national insurance 
system. That is what is happening, and it is a very 
serious matter.
<P>
For 50 years, everyone who has worked and paid 
national insurance contributions has believed, or has been 
brought up to believe, that, as a result, they would be 
entitled to certain non means-tested benefits. The 
Government have been undermining that system and have 
introduced a series of new benefits that are means tested, 
such as cold weather payments. Far worse and far more 
pernicious, they have been means testing benefits that 
were previously universal benefits to which anyone who 
had contributed would be entitled on a non means-tested 
basis. They have means-tested incapacity benefit beyond 
£50 and have abolished widows benefit and replaced it 
with a new means-tested benefit called bereavement 
benefit. Those matters will soon be discussed in relation 
to another Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman distinguish 
between time-limited benefits and means-tested benefits? 
The proposed bereavement benefit has no means-tested 
element; it has a time limit. The Government's proposals 
also extend benefits on a purely contributory basis to 
widowers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are now discussing 
proposals in another Bill, which I have also read. Those 
who serve on the Committee that considers that Bill will 
have the dubious privilege of serving under my 
chairmanship again. We have enough to do on this 
Committee, so we should stick to the Bill that is before us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, but provided that I have your support, 
Mr. McWilliam, to briefly correct in 30 seconds what 
would be a major misapprehension created by the 
Minister's intervention. No Opposition Member and no 
one in this country is naive enough to swallow the 
Minister's explanation. Clearly, time-limiting a benefit so 
that after six months you do not get it, and only income 
support 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As far as I am aware, I am 
ineligible for any benefit whatever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall try to change my turn of phrase.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has served 
under my chairmanship for years. He knows my views on 
the rules regarding language I am also uncomfortable 
with them, but they must and shall be enforced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> When one has contributed to the national 
insurance scheme for many years, one expects to benefit 
on the basis of the rules that existed when one contributed. 
Suddenly, without warning, a new Labour Government 
elected with a massive majority sets about the national 
insurance system with an axe, and destroys whole sections 
of it. One finds that a benefit to which one believed one 
was entitled as long as one qualified because of family 
circumstances or incapacity has been limited to six 
months, after which there is no benefit except a 
means-tested benefit. One naturally forms the conclusion 
that a universal contributory benefit has been replaced by 
a means-tested benefit after six months.
<P>
I described the treatment of widows benefit I know 
that Hansard will bear me out as the benefit having 
been abolished and replaced with a bereavement benefit 
that will be means-tested after six months. That is the 
reality. I hope that we shall not proceed in such a 
disingenuous way in this Bill or in the Bill to which 
you referred, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
If the Labour Government are determined, as they 
appear to be, to erode the national insurance system, and 
if their large majority makes that possible it may be that 
nothing can be done to stop them they should at least 
be honest. The parliamentary process should not 
contribute to pulling the wool over the eyes of the British 
public; it should contribute to greater public 
understanding of these dramatic developments. Some of 
the great social progress of the 20th century is being 
reversed in the last years of the century by a party that 
has been associated with the national insurance principle 
throughout the century until now. I was brought up to 
believe that that principle was a matter of consensus in 
British public life, and that that had been so since the 
coalition Government of the second world war. It is sad 
that that is no longer the case.
<P>
Against the background of the Government's 
systematic campaign to run down the national insurance 
principle and the national insurance system it is something 
of a fad the matter needs to be considered in a new light. 
People do not realise what is happening. Nothing 
illustrates that better than the Minister's intervention. We 
must realise that this is one piece of a pernicious 
programme. It was not announced to the British public in 
the election; it has not even been announced honestly, 
openly and retrospectively now. But it has been pursued 
with remorseless determination and we do not know how 
far it will go. I hope that we can embarrass the 
Government slightly and possibly discourage them from 
taking this programme further if not reversing what they 
have done at least slowing down the destruction of the 
national insurance system so that when we return to power 
there is enough to build on. If we achieve that, we will 
have achieved a major purpose.
<P>
We have a Government who, while running down the 
contributory principle and the national insurance system, 
publish a Bill that establishes a separate organisation to 
collect national insurance contributions, which used to be 
collected under another system with a different flow of 
funds and purpose. The organisation involved had its own 
integrity, funding and Department to run it. That is now 
being folded into the Inland Revenue. Everything else 
flows from that.
<P>
Some matters, which we will discuss shortly, look like 
details but are not. They contain nasty bugs, such as 
enforcement and the administrative measures needed to 
combine the two Departments for legal purposes, and are 
a part of a rolling programme to run down the national 
insurance system. Unless matters are viewed in that 
perspective, we cannot understand the significance of the 
Bill, in particular its timing and the way in which its real 
purpose is being disguised.
<P>
I am disappointed with the Minister. I know him well 
we have served together on Committees and the Treasury 
Select Committee. He is an able, forthright and open man. 
It is sad to see him enmeshed in the coils of this new 
Labour Government feeling that he has to go along with 
this project of disguising their real purpose. Perhaps in his 
heart of hearts he is ashamed to be a member of a 
Government who are attacking the national insurance 
system. One can only sympathise with the self-delusion 
displayed in his attempts to disguise the true reality of 
the provision.
<P>
I do not want to go into more detail now on the 
general principles behind the Bill, but we will have to 
revert to them. Your usual attention and alertness show, 
Mr. McWilliam, that what I am saying is demonstrated 
in fact. It will be reflected as we go through each 
clause of this pernicious Bill. It is right that I state at 
the outset the essential principles that have informed 
the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
I have no objection to the sittings motion. In your 
wisdom, Mr. McWilliam, you have changed the order of 
consideration. That does not matter unduly. You know 
much better than I do how we can modify the Bill in a 
coherent fashion.
<P>
I do not know whether we can say that the Sergeant at 
Arms has a sense of humour, but he has allocated to us 
the largest Committee Room. I am delighted that we 
manage to accommodate so many members of the public; 
I only wish that they could be brought a little nearer. As 
we try to rip some of the veils of subterfuge and new 
Labour spin doctoring from a sinister measure, it is 
important that the public should be given every facility to 
know what is going on and to look into the faces of new 
Labour Ministers when they make statements like the one 
that we have just heard.
<P>
I do not know whether it is in order for me to make 
such a proposal, Mr. McWilliam. I may be trespassing on 
the sacred ground of the Serjeant at Arms, and heaven 
knows what would happen if I did that. I might lose my 
office or my telephone might be cut off. If it is not out of 
order, would it be possible to bring forward the barrier 
that separates us from those who sent us here and who 
want to take part in our proceedings?

<B>The Chairman:</B> I take that last request as a point of 
order. I requested the Doorkeepers to put the rope across 
the Room so that people could move nearer. We have 
the pillars for the rope, but, unfortunately, the rope is in 
Committee Room 15 I say "the"	 rope advisedly. As a 
Committee is sitting in Room 15, the rope cannot be 
acquired at the moment, but it will be retrieved for future 
sittings. I apologise to the Committee for that.

Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Social Security contributions

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I apologise for my slightly late arrival this morning. I was, as you know, 
detained elsewhere.
<P>
I have written to you, Mr. McWilliam, about a previous 
interest. As the Bill transfers to the Inland Revenue not 
only the Contributions Agency but the new national 
insurance recording system NIRS2 I want to declare 
the fact that I worked for Andersen Consulting, the 
contractor on the NIRS2 project, from September 1994 
until March 1997. While Director of research for 
Andersen Consulting, I did not work on the NIRS2 
project, nor have I had any financial relationship with 
Andersen Consulting since I left its employment. 
Although there is no obligation on me to declare that 
previous interest, I wish to do so in the spirit of openness 
that characterises this new Labour Government.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the hon. Lady.
<P>
I remind the Committee that there is a financial 
resolution in connection with the Bill and it is available 
in the Committee Room.
<P>
I also remind the Committee that adequate notice of 
amendments should be given. Starred amendments will 
not be called, including starred amendments which may 
be reached on an afternoon sitting, having been tabled in 
the morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> On a point of order,
Mr. McWilliam. Following the hon. Lady's declaration of 
interest, I have an interest which I have not declared 
because I cannot conceive how it might be relevant, but in 
case we stray on to territory that may be relevant, I shall 
state for the record that I have declared in the Register of 
Members' Interests two remunerated outside interests: one 
as adviser to NatWest Securities, which is the investment 
banking arm of NatWest plc, and the other as parliamentary 
adviser to the Chartered Institute of Taxation. I also have a 
number of unremunerated interests, which are listed in the 
register. I cannot see at the moment how they might be 
relevant to our proceedings, but possibly they could be.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 
1; Schedules 1 and 2; Clause 2; Schedule 3; Clauses 3 and 4; 
Schedule 4; Clause 5; Schedule 5; Clause 6; Schedule 6; Clauses 7 
to 18; Schedule 7; Clauses 19 to 26; Schedules 8 to 10; remaining 
Clauses; new Clauses; new schedules. [Mr. Timms.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We do not come to any amendments 
until clause 7, so I remind the Committee that for those 
hon. Members who sometimes have difficulty in 
following what we are doing, there is a sheet showing the 
order in which I shall call the clauses and schedules.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer to Board of certain functions relating to </center></H4>
contributions, etc.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clause 1 is one of the key elements of the 
Bill, introducing schedules 1 and 2. Schedule 1 transfers 
to the Inland Revenue the day-to-day operational 
functions currently discharged by the Contributions 
Agency on behalf of the Secretary of State. Functions 
relating to national insurance contributions, statutory sick 
pay, statutory maternity pay and contracting-out matters 
will be exercised by the Inland Revenue from the day 
appointed for the operational transfer.
<P>
Schedule 1 amends the provisions of Acts which confer 
such functions on the Secretary of State and also other 
provisions, which make consequential references to his 
exercise of those functions. Functions conferred on the 
Secretary of State by the subordinate legislation in 
schedule 2 are also transferred to the Inland Revenue.
<P>
We intend that the day appointed for the transfer of 
operational functions under clause 28 should be 1 April, 
the start of the new financial year. Clause 28(2)(a) also 
allows regulations concerned with operational functions 
transferred under clause 1 to come into force on the 
passing of the Act, so that they can be in force by 1 April.
<P>
I want to draw the shadow Chancellor's views on this 
subject to the attention of members of the Committee, 
particularly Conservative Members although I am sad 
that so few of them have taken the trouble to attend 
especially in the light of the flight of fancy that we heard 
a moment ago. The shadow Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a massive and unnecessary burden for employers to have to 
cope with two separate bureaucracies for matters concerning payroll 
taxes. It is also a wasteful duplication of government resources."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Ministers should commit themselves now to a merger of the field 
forces of the Inland Revenue and the CA. Apart from saving public 
money, this would eliminate the burden of double accountability and 
interference for employers, and reduce the time needed to cope with 
workplace taxation. This issue has been endlessly debated in 
Whitehall. A decision should now be made."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister is praying in aid the 
argument that public money will be saved. What savings 
to public funds does the Minister expect to make from the 
merger of those two agencies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There will be savings in public money, 
but the key issue is to reduce the load on business. The 
words that I quoted were from the Deregulation Task 
Force report. The hon. Gentleman may recall I do not 
know whether it was his party's policy that he supported 
when it was in Government; I suspect that it was that 
deregulation was considered a good thing, as was 
reducing the burden on business. The previous 
Government did not do as much of it as the shadow 
Chancellor wished they had. We are pressing ahead with 
this sensitive and technical change to allow businesses to 
deal with a single organisation rather than two. It is a 
change that the whole Committee should welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am sorry to intervene again, but the 
Minister is adopting his usual technique I hope that it 
does not become too much of a habit in the Committee 
of trying to deflect the question instead of answering it. I 
did not ask about deregulation. Indeed, I am committed 
to deregulation. In the last Parliament I was a founder 
member and became vice-chairman of the Conservative 
Back-Bench deregulation committee.
<P>
I asked the Minister a specific question about the 
expected savings to public funds from this measure. I 
cannot believe that any responsible Government I know 
that this is not a responsible Government would come 
before the Committee and propose a measure, praying in 
aid the argument that there will be savings to public funds, 
without being able to give the Committee the figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am glad to note the hon. Gentleman's 
support for deregulation. To be consistent, he should 
support this measure. I imagine that he supports the work 
of the tax law review committee, of which he is or was a 
member, which has called for alignments of this kind.
<P>
There will initially be additional costs to the public 
purse as a result of the transfer. They are spelt out in 
paragraph 251 of the explanatory notes, which no doubt 
the hon. Gentleman has read. The details are there for him 
to see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Let me intervene 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I point out that what the 
Minister read out refers to the financial clause and money 
resolution, which should be properly debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
As the Minister rightly says, there is a passage in the 
explanatory notes on page 36 entitled, "The financial 
effects of the Bill"	, which sets out the costs. I distinctly 
heard the Minister quote from the document of which he 
is so fond, which was produced by my right hon. Friend 
the shadow Chancellor when he was a private business 
man during the previous Parliament, and which suggests 
that a merger of the Contributions Agency and the Inland 
Revenue, such as is now proposed, would involve 
substantial savings to public funds. I do not have the 
document in front of me, but if I have seriously misquoted 
it, no doubt the Minister will immediately rise to correct 
me.
<P>
The Minister prayed in aid that argument, using it 
almost in an interrogatory way to ask why the Opposition 
do not support the proposal, if it will result in savings to 
public funds. That is a very strange state of affairs. The 
Government produced a document, of which we are all 
aware, which suggests that there will be costs to public 
funds. Maybe there will be savings in the longer term, and 
perhaps those savings will more than discount the costs, 
so there is a positive present value, but that calculation 
has not been included in the document.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It has.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In that case, perhaps the Minister will 
explain exactly the net position. I shall ask again the 
question that I asked a few moments ago, to which we 
must have an answer. What net savings to public funds 
are anticipated as a result of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I hesitate to take up too much of the 
Committee's time on this subject, because the facts are 
clearly set out in paragraph 251 of the explanatory notes. 
I take it from your ruling a moment ago, Mr. McWilliam, 
that we should not spend too much time on this matter at 
this stage, but that paragraph clearly says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Early offsetting savings are estimated at £1.4 million in 2000-01 
rising to £5.5 million in 2002-03 and thereafter. Further significant 
savings are expected in the medium to long term."<P>

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We still do not know the net position. I 
shall quote the relevant two sentences of the paragraph.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The additional, transitional, cost of transferring the CA to the 
Inland Revenue is estimated at £14.8 million in 1998-99,
£17.4 million in 1999-2000 and £6.2 million in 2000-01."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are considerable amounts of money, totalling 
nearly £40 million. In addition, there will be policy 
development costs of £0.3 million and various other costs.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is estimated that expenses of £11.1 million will be incurred 
under section 78."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we add that amount, costs will total about £50 million. 
Then the note goes on to say,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Early offsetting savings are estimated at £1.4 million rising to 
£5.5 million in 2002-03 and thereafter."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So, for the period covered by the document, the net position 
is substantially negative by more than £40 million, on a rule 
of thumb calculation. Perhaps it will become so 
substantially positive thereafter that, on a present value 
basis, the taxpayer will benefit, although no one who reads 
the explanatory notes would know that. Indeed, anyone 
who reads the notes would be entitled to believe that the net 
position is negative. One would assume that if the 
Government had such a good argument, they would use it 
if it were true that, on a net basis, the Bill will produce 
significant savings to public funds.
<P>
I must ask the Minister to make the net position 
absolutely clear to the Committee. If he says that the net 
position will become positive after a certain number of 
years, will he set out the figures so that we can see to 
what extent that is so? That argument is key to the Bill, 
although not the most important one, which is the future 
and integrity of our national insurance system, and the 
Government's real intentions with regard to it. I would be 
prepared to pay several millions of pounds to preserve 
the national insurance system. The Minister has told the 
Committee twice that real savings, will be made, but he 
has not explained how the savings will be made. His 
figures add up to a negative "dissaving"	 an actual and 
substantial cost to the taxpayer.
<P>
I have been speaking for two or three minutes, during 
which time the Minister has, I hope, been able to think 
and consult in order to give the Committee a clear 
response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to 
the central issue, which is not the cost to the Government 
but the two separate bureaucracies with which employers 
have to cope with in respect of matters concerning payroll 
taxes. The shadow Chancellor rightly referred to that as a 
"massive and unnecessary"	 burden. The Bill will deal 
with that problem.
<P>
The explanatory notes to the Bill make it clear that 
savings will be made, rising to £5.5 million in 2002-03 
and continuing thereafter. That will of course lead to 
substantial savings to the Exchequer, but the central issue 
remains the reduction of the burden on business.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> This is not a satisfactory way for the 
Committee to proceed. I have raised a specific question 
about savings to the taxpayer. Instead of answering it, the 
Minister deflected it by talking about savings to business. 
Of course, savings to business should and will be 
discussed in due course, but my question was about 
savings to the taxpayer. The Minister is more than 
intelligent enough to understand the difference between 
the two. We are looking at different variables in the 
equation, which must be calibrated and quantified to 
decide whether, on a net basis and purely as an economic 
calculus, the Bill will represent good value to the public.
<P>
We need answers. If the Minister knows them, why 
were they not included in the explanatory notes? If he 
does not know them, how can he justify his confident 
assertion that there will be savings to the taxpayer? It 
would be extraordinary to overlook such a crucial matter, 
but perhaps that is why the figures were omitted form the 
explanatory notes. Perhaps they were omitted for another, 
perfectly justifiable reason. In either case, we should be 
given the figures and the accompanying explanation.
<P>
The Committee deserves to hear an answer to my 
specific question, rather than to another question, however 
interesting that question may be, and I hope that the 
Minister will now provide it.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the First 
schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We have started off on a thoroughly 
unsatisfactory basis. I am sure that those members of the 
public who are present, and who take the trouble to read 
the account of our proceedings in Hansard, will note that 
I have asked a specific question on the savings 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members may not refer 
to people who are beyond the Bar of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. Perhaps I 
may refer to the public as a whole. I am sure that all 56 
million of them will pay great attention to our 
proceedings. We must think of ourselves as a vicarious 
Athenian democracy, in which everyone else participates 
through the medium of his or her elected representative.
<P>
I do not wish to overemphasise the importance of our 
proceedings, but it is extremely significant that the 
Government have justified the provision partially and 
explicitly by reference to savings to public funds. They 
have advanced other excuses as well, which we shall 
probe with equal rigor. When we asked what the savings 
were, how they were calculated and what protections were 
in place we received no answer. It is clear that the 
Minister does not know the answer and has not thought 
about it. It is clear that there are no such savings; the costs 
are quoted in the explanatory memorandum. That means 
that that verbal inequation undoubtedly has a negative 
side. I do not know the net costs because we have not 
been told the full financial figures, but it is clear that there 
is a negative side. The burden borne by any other positive 
argument adduced by the Government to justify a 
fundamentally ill-conceived measure must therefore be 
correspondingly greater. That is the only logical 
conclusion than can be drawn.
<P>
What is the point of a Committee in which one is 
supposed to ask questions of the Government and expect 
clear and coherent answers if we do not get any answers? 
If the Government use their massive new Labour majority 
to steamroller the whole thing through and to say "Get 
lost, Opposition, get lost, public, and even the traditions 
of the House"	 [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled 
to be listened to by hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I have specific questions about schedule 
1. Paragraph 28(2, on page 21 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"so much of any interest recovered by the Inland Revenue by virtue 
of paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the Contributions and Benefits Act 
or paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to that Act as remains after the 
deduction by them of any administrative costs attributable to its 
recovery"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Who will arbitrate on the question of what are reasonable 
administrative costs of the recovery? We discovered on 
Second Reading and in graphic fashion this morning the 
extent to which the Government treat with contempt the 
concept of a separate national insurance fund, the integrity 
of which is at risk. Indeed, contributions to that fund will 
be the responsibility of the Inland Revenue. I have nothing 
against the Inland Revenue, which certainly until now 
has been extraordinarily well managed on the whole. 
Nevertheless, the culture of the Inland Revenue does not 
include any great regard for the national insurance fund. 
It is probably part of its culture to dislike or resent the 
presence of the national insurance fund. It is rubbing its 
hands with glee at the prospect of taking over the 
Contributions Agency, collecting all the money and 
merging operations into one. It no doubt believes that the 
next bite will be to take over the national insurance fund 
completely and merge it with the Consolidated Fund.
<P>
Many of the provisions in the schedules to the Bill refer 
to the relationship between the Consolidated Fund and 
the national insurance fund. The Committee must consider 
those provisions with great care. How will the 
administrative costs be determined? In the private sector, 
if there is an efficient market, there is a buyer and a seller. 
My experience of merchant banking taught me that if one 
charged a client too much he would take his business 
elsewhere, so the extent of fees, charges or commissions 
would be determined by the market. No market exists 
within the Government, however, which is sad. The 
Contributions Agency is to lose its independence, which 
was one of the checks and balances in the system, and as 
a result there will be nobody to protect the interests of the 
national insurance fund. The Minister will not be able to 
do so as he will be emasculated by the Bill.
<P>
On Second Reading, I spoke about paragraph 30(2) 
as you may recall, Mr. McWilliam which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such payments by way of adjustment as the Secretary of State 
determines (in accordance with any directions of the Treasury)"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is germane to the issue of the relationship between 
the Consolidated Fund and the national insurance fund, 
and it relates to the principle underlying all the points that 
I will make under this schedule. The purpose of the Bill 
is to make what remains of the Department of Social 
Security the creature of the Treasury and the Revenue in 
this context. Any powers that the Secretary of State retains 
are to be exercised on instruction from the Treasury.
<P>
It reminds me of when the Labour Government 
nationalised the Bank of England in 1945. I remember in 
my former professional capacity having to look at the 
Bank of England Act 1946, which was quite an interesting 
Act. In every paragraph the Treasury's consent was 
required, with phrases such as "as determined by the 
Treasury"	. It was obvious that the Bank of England had 
been turned into a Department of the Treasury. The 
Labour Government have now gone back on that. They 
have taken about 50 years to see the errors of their original 
way. What remains of Department of Social Security 
functions in this field will also be carried out at the 
Treasury's behest.
<P>
It is no use saying that the Secretary of State is the 
protector of the national insurance fund. He would have 
been up to now, but his powers are being exercised only 
in calls for direction by the Treasury and the Inland 
Revenue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): My 
hon. Friend may have put his finger on the answer to the 
question to which we have not received a reply. Why can 
the Government not quantify the administrative and other 
savings as a result of the schedule? Clearly, there is an 
intention to abolish the Department of Social Security, 
abolish its Ministers and abolish their entitlement to free 
cars and free trips on Concorde. Perhaps that would 
achieve considerable administrative savings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I cannot see any of that arising 
out of schedule 1.
<P>
Further to the speech that the hon. Member for 
Grantham and Stamford is making, I ceased to be a 
general commissioner some 22 years ago, so I am not 
taking his remarks as a criticism of the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Your past is so distinguished,
Mr. McWilliam, that it is difficult to remember all your 
various roles. Had I been aware of that, I would have 
been careful. However, you should interpret my remarks 
as an unknowing and, therefore, all-the-more genuine 
and appreciated compliment to the commissioners, 
because I have been defending the independence of the 
two systems that have existed until now the 
Contributions Agency and the Revenue, with their 
different appeal tribunals, different commissioners and 
so forth. it is worrying that these structures are now 
being fused into one. We all know that it is a takeover 
by the Inland Revenue.
<P>
As I have several questions for the Minster, perhaps he 
will note them down. He is an intelligent man, but he may 
forget them if I ask several in a row. He might even give 
into the temptation of pretending to forget some of them, 
if they are awkward to respond to who knows? If that 
happens, the purpose of the Committee will be subverted 
and the transparency of government, a phrase that I know 
new Labour likes to use, will be shown to be a sham.
<P>
Who determines the administrative costs, and what 
protection is there against the Revenue, which now has a 
management accounting system that is replicated in the 
private sector? It will be nice to be able to say, "That's 
all right. We can lay off a whole lot of these costs on the 
poor national insurance fund, which is there for the 
picking. We have been given this wonderful slush fund. 
Laying off some of our costs on that will be good for my 
budget. I can have more staff and more overheads."	 To 
do that is only human nature. That is why there are checks 
and balances in the system. I am not implying any 
dishonesty or maladministration. I am simply referring to 
the usual, almost respectable, bureaucratic instinct to 
empire-build [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a lot of chatter; I 
should like to listen to the hon. Member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Such an instinct is combined with the 
natural pressure of any cost accounting system in which 
people have delegated budgetary responsibility. Naturally, 
they want to recover their costs as far as possible from an 
outside organisation. They cannot recover the costs from 
the public without the danger that the public will object 
and appeal to the commissioners, who, in the best 
tradition that you represent, Mr. McWilliam, will give the 
public a fair hearing. However, they can apparently 
recover whatever they want from the national insurance 
fund. There will be nobody to say, "Wait a moment. 
That's not fair. You're taking too much money. What are 
you doing paying for all these limousines and computers 
out of the national insurance fund?"	 The Contributions 
Agency will not be involved; those left will be working 
for the Revenue, dependent on it for pay, rations, 
promotion and so on, and no doubt whipped into line. 
Ministers will have lost their powers and will be able to 
act only in accordance with instructions.
<P>
My second question relates to paragraph 30, on page 
22, which substitutes part of the Social Security 
Administration Act 1992 with the following subsection:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There shall be made out of the National Insurance Fund into the 
Consolidated Fund, or out of money provided by Parliament into 
the National Insurance such payments by way of adjustment as the 
Secretary of State determines (in accordance with any directions of 
the Treasury)"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that is not disingenuous wording, I do not know what is.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
What is the difference between
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such payments by way of adjustment as the Secretary of State 
determines (in accordance with any directions of the Treasury)"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and such payments as the Treasury determines? There is 
no difference. The Treasury will decide how much money 
it wants to take out of the national insurance fund. It will 
send an instruction, like people in business who send chits 
to accountants, for example, to pay the window cleaner. 
The Minister will handle that.
<P>
I do not exaggerate; there is no hyperbole. I invite 
Labour Members to read the text. New Labour has a vast 
majority. Can any of its Members tell me where I have 
gone wrong? What is the substantive difference between 
saying that such payments shall be made in accordance 
with Treasury directions, and saying that such payment 
shall be made by the Secretary of State in accordance with 
Treasury directions? There is no difference. The reference 
to the Secretary of State is purely disingenuous window 
dressing. All new Labour is doing is wasting public 
money by sending chits around Whitehall.
<P>
The Minister, whom the Secretary of State has 
delegated to do the menial task, has no option or right to 
say that I have a point. He cannot say that he is worried 
about the money and the defence of the national insurance 
fund because he has to observe Treasury directions. That 
is what the Labour Government did in 1945 when they 
emasculated the Bank of England. The Bank had to do 
whatever the hell it was told. If it was told to sell the gold 
reserves, it sold the gold reserves. It was staffed by clerks 
who acted like a computer would now, fulfilling an 
instruction mechanically. That is the Minister's position.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am having trouble 
understanding the hon. Member's line. I cannot find a 
reference in the Bill to the gold reserve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That was a brief allusion which took no 
more than about nine words. I have tried to be strictly 
relevant.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It was nine words, but it was nine 
words on more than one occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Labour Members are not intervening, 
Mr. McWilliam; someone has to play their role. They 
must be embarrassed by the Bill, I had expected one 
brave soul to rise to defend the Government if the 
hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. 
Miller), for example, wants to intervene, I shall give 
way and say that my interpretation is wrong. If I am 
right, however, then everything that I have said has 
been an understatement of the destruction of the 
independence of our national insurance system and its 
submission to the whims and fancies of the Treasury 
and the Revenue.
<P>
I have no idea whether the Minister will give me an 
answer. No Labour Member has given the slightest sign 
that I have exaggerated or misconceived the situation. 
They sit in stunned silence. No one call tell me where I 
am going wrong. I believe that I am not going wrong, and 
I ask the Minister to answer my questions. What checks 
and balances are in place to ensure that the determination 
of administrative costs in paragraph 28 is fair and 
reasonable? Secondly, and even more important, what 
protections are in place to prevent paragraph 30 being 
used at will to rob the national insurance fund?
<P>
I want answers to these questions. There are one or two 
things that Oppositions can do in Committees when they 
do not get any answers at all, and I think that you will 
agree, Mr. McWilliam, that it is in the interests of 
parliamentary democracy that we should not be unduly 
inhibited in doing those things. I mean that seriously. We 
expect answers. No doubt the new Labour Government 
can win any vote with their vast majority. They can no 
doubt make a horse the Secretary of State for Social 
Security, since one does not need to be anything more 
than a horse to observe the Treasury's instructions. The 
Treasury may put a jockey and a good bridle on the horse, 
but the jockey probably does not need a stick or spurs, 
because the horse will do what it is told. That is the 
position that we are now in.
<P>
I have a third question with which I want the Minister 
to deal. Why is there reference in the schedule to the 
Secretary of State? As the Secretary of State will be 
operating only under instructions from the Treasury, why 
is such a reference necessary? If the Minister were half 
serious, 10 per cent. serious or 1 per cent. serious, it 
would not be necessary. I fear that we have revealed that 
he was not serious when he said in the clause 1 stand part 
debate that he believed that there would be savings to 
public funds from merging the two agencies. If he were 
half-serious abut that, why did he not say "The role of 
the Secretary of State for Social Security and the other 
Ministers is bogus and purely mechanical; he just has to 
follow instructions"	.? We have no data on which we can 
protest or say anything at all. It has just been a waste of 
time. Private Secretaries will ring up one another, and 
paper will go around Whitehall completely uselessly, 
because the Minister will have given away any statutory 
power that he still has, and will have, until this pernicious 
Bill goes through, to defend the interests of the national 
insurance fund.
<P>
Why is there this proliferation of Ministers, this 
charade, this completely bogus role for Ministers who 
have no power to decide, question or resist? If they have 
such power, why is it not in the Bill? Perhaps the 
Government will table an amendment to satisfy us on 
that point.
<P>
This theme runs through the Schedule. There is hardly 
a paragraph that does not refer to such payments.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as the Inland Revenue determine"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In some cases the Secretary of State is substituted by the 
Inland Revenue or the Treasury; in some cases the 
Secretary of State remains, but he does what the Inland 
Revenue tells him to do.
<P>
It is a curious procedure, because, logically, the 
Secretary of State's role in this should be abolished. The 
Government should have the courage and honesty to tell 
the British people that that is what they are doing. The 
whole thing is being run by the Revenue, and there is no 
longer any distinction between the national insurance fund 
and the consolidated fund: the national insurance fund is 
simply part of the funds that the Revenue manages. What 
is more, the Revenue has the power, as we see it, to make 
disbursements out of the fund, to pay themselves expenses 
and all the rest of it. The Minister might say that the 
Government acknowledge that, but add, "But I am making 
some administrative savings to justify it."	 I would not 
accept that argument. It would not for one second be 
worth destroying the national insurance fund, even if 
administrative savings could be made, but at least the 
Government would say that they were doing so.
<P>
The Government are creating the worst of all possible 
worlds. They are destroying the independence of the 
national insurance fund, but are not telling the British 
public the truth about it. That is why the Bill retains these 
bogus references, as I have argued so far without 
contradiction to the Secretary of State. Thirdly, they are 
not even making administrative savings. If that is not a 
bad deal for the British public, I do not know what is.

<P>

<B>Mr. Collins:</B> May I begin by expressing my pleasure 
at serving for the first time under your chairmanship, 
Mr. McWilliam?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and 
Stamford made a powerful case for believing schedule 1 
to be sinister. He said, accurately, that it is pernicious. I 
want to ask the Minister a practical question about the 
timetable for implementation of the provisions in 
schedule 1.
<P>
I compliment my hon. Friend on his comments on 
paragraph 30 of schedule 1. He was accurate when he 
said earlier that he was understating his case. Throughout 
schedule 1, particularly in paragraph 30, there are major 
constitutional implications. I remember that when 
studying British constitution O-level in dusty rooms at 
school 20 years ago. One of the central guiding principles 
of the British constitution was that all Cabinet Ministers 
are equal, with the arguable exception of the Prime 
Minister, who is primus inter pares. All other Ministers 
are pares, or equal one to the other, yet paragraph 30 
contains a clear provision whereby the Secretary of State 
is to be directed by the Treasury. It does not specify who 
in the Treasury that will be. It could be argued that, as 
First Lord of the Treasury, it could be the Prime Minister, 
in which case there may be no major constitutional 
violation. But in the ordinary usage of legal language, 
directions of the Treasury would be interpreted as 
meaning either of the Chancellor of the Exchequer or of 
any other Ministers in the Treasury. The potential exists 
for one Cabinet Minister to issue instructions to another. 
That is a major constitutional departure and a breach of 
the principle of collective responsibility and collective 
Cabinet government. The potential also exists for junior 
Ministers outside the Cabinet for example, the 
Paymaster General to issue a direction to a Secretary 
of State.
<P>
I shall be interested in the Minister's opinion on that 
sinister and unique development. I wonder whether he has 
discussed the matter with his right hon. Friend the 
Secretary of State for Social Security and whether his 
right hon. Friend is content with the position. As a former 
Chief Secretary to the Treasury, his appointment to 
Secretary of State for Social Security was no doubt hailed 
as promotion that is how it was reported in the 
newspapers, spun no doubt by Mr. Alastair Campbell 
but perhaps it was not promotion; perhaps it was 
demotion. Perhaps, in the light of the Bill, any post within 
the Department of Social Security, up to and including 
Secretary of State, should be considered in the pecking 
order as being inferior to any post, however junior, in the 
Treasury. That might explain the extraordinary influence 
wielded by the previous Paymaster General, whose 
departure caused us all so much grief over Christmas.
<P>
I am worried about the constitutional implications of 
schedule 1. I hope that the Minister will tell us whether 
he has had specific discussions with his Secretary of State, 
whether he has received an assurance from the Secretary 
of State that he is content with the provision, and whether 
he sought advice from the various constitutional experts 
for example, those serving on the Neill committee and the 
Royal Commission set up to consider the future of the 
House of Lords. Even if one finds it undesirable, as I do, 
to put a Cabinet Minister in a position of subordination to 
another Minister, at least elected power is being made
subordinate to another form of elected power. However, 
paragraph 35(4), which relates to section 9(2)(b) of the 
Pension Schemes Act 1993, states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In subsection (4), for `Secretary of may, if he thinks' there is 
substituted `Inland Revenue may, if they think'."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, that will transfer power from an elected person, 
the Secretary of State, to the board of the Inland Revenue, 
which is unelected. Of course, there are legislative 
provisions that subject the board to the direction of 
Treasury Ministers. However, if the sole implication is 
that the provision is simply another instance of a Secretary 
of State being subordinated to his ministerial colleagues 
in the Treasury, why does not the provision state as much? 
In that case, it would have helped the Committee, the 
public and others concerned with the Bill if paragraph 
35(4) had stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`Treasury Ministers may, if they think'"	,
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
rather than the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`Secretary of State may, if he thinks'"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Instead, it states that there will be a transfer from the 
thought processes of the Secretary of State which may 
be clear or ambiguous to those of the Inland Revenue, 
in its infinite wisdom. That raises serious and wide public 
policy issues. It is another instance of a decisions hitherto 
taken by those who are accountable to the electorate being 
taken by those who, at best, are indirectly accountable to 
the electorate. The matter is serious and should give pause 
to all elected Members, who participated in an election in 
which a major issue was the then Opposition's cry against 
the growth of quangos and the transfer of power from the 
elected to the unelected.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
That is a sinister and serious development and I should 
welcome the Minister's comments on it. I hope that he 
can assure the Committee that he has consulted widely on 
the provision. Will he advise on the general Government 
policy on the appropriate level of decision making? When 
discussing such matters, hon. Members must bear in mind 
that people can go to prison for violating laws relating to 
taxation and national insurance. It is vital that all relevant 
decisions are taken by those who are clearly and 
demonstrably elected.
<P>
I promised earlier that I would return to a practical 
point that the Minister should consider, and I would like 
to fulfil that pledge. In speaking to both clause 1 and 
schedule 1, he said that the Government intend to 
implement the provisions of schedule 1 at the beginning 
of the next tax year April 1999. Serious issues arise 
from that timing.
<P>
As we know, 1999 is the year before the millennium. 
The Prime Minister himself has said on more than one 
occasion both in the House of Commons and on public 
platforms that businesses that use payroll and computer 
systems across the public and private sectors should 
ensure their readiness to tackle the millennium bug. 
However, the transfer of functions, which will have 
serious implications for Contributions Agency, Benefits 
Agency, Inland Revenue and Treasury computer systems, 
will take place only eight or nine months before the 
millennium bug may kick in. That is precisely the time 
when task forces should be rushing up and down in the 
Contributions Agency, checking their payroll systems and 
computer software to make sure that it is fully 
millennium-compliant. The transfers that schedule 1 will 
put into effect, and the timing that the Minister has 
announced, will distract the attention of the information 
technology specialists at the Contributions Agency and 
the Inland Revenue from what, surely, should be their 
more urgent task in the next few months: making sure that 
all their computers are fully millennium-compliant.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister can assure us that the 
Contributions Agency is so stuffed with brilliant 
information technology specialists, and that its record on 
dealing with new technology is so wonderful, that we 
have no reason to fear. However, sadly, that is not wholly 
consistent with the record of the Contributions Agency 
I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and 
Stamford agrees with me in introducing the NIRS2 
system. Probably, of all the Departments and agencies in 
Whitehall, the Contributions Agency is the last one that 
should be assumed to have every information and 
computer problem wholly under control. The 
Contributions Agency is the last agency that should be 
expected, in this year of all years, to take its eye off the 
ball of millennium compliance and spend its time 
worrying about integrating its computer system with that 
of the Inland Revenue. The record of the Contributions 
Agency on new technology is, frankly, appalling.



<P>
That is a powerful argument for saying that the 
provisions of schedule 1 should not come into force at the 
time advocated by the Minster and that 1999 is the wrong 
year in which to implement the transfer. Surely, it would 
be more sensible to wait a little. I should be most 
interested to hear what the Minster has to say about the 
training and commitment that will be required of IT staff. 
What assessment has been made of the software 
implications of schedule 1? What consultation has there 
been with the private sector? Have the provisions of 
schedule 1 been specifically checked with the 
Government's millennium compliance task force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> My hon. Friend is making a very 
strong case. Does he agree that the speed of the proposed 
transfer is a little indecent, even suspect? Has it occurred 
to him that one reason for the Bill might be that things 
are in such a mess that the Minister and his colleagues 
are desperate to get shot of all this rubbish as quickly as 
possible, so that another Department can take 
responsibility for it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting 
point. He may be a little more cynical than I am perhaps 
not. That might be the reason. We know that the Secretary 
of State has got into all sorts of difficulties trying to 
explain the timetable for resolving the problems relating 
to NIRS2. He originally said that it would take a matter 
of weeks; more recently, he said months and, more 
recently still, that it could be far off in the future. He does 
not know when it will happen.
<P>
My hon. Friend might be right. The reason why the 
Government have decided to trigger the provisions of 
schedule 1 may simply be so that the Department can 
get shot, to use his phrase, of the problem as rapidly as 
possible certainly well in advance of when the Secretary 
of State might be hoping to impress the Prime Minster by 
his record in the Department, in the hope of gaining 
further promotions in years ahead. It would be especially 
worrisome if that were so. I hope that the Minister can 
give the Committee a categorical assurance that no wish 
to be rid of the NIRS2 problem entered into the 
calculations of the Department and Ministers in deciding 
when schedule 1 would come into force.
<P>
There is a further difficulty with the Minster's choice 
of April 1999 as the date on which the schedule will come 
into force. Earlier, we heard a very interesting 
conversation between my hon. Friend the Member for 
Grantham and Stamford and the Minister on the subject 
of net and gross costs. I was interested that the Minister 
did not refer to what Baroness Hollis said in another place 
at the end of last year when she confirmed that the costs 
were likely to be £16 million or £17 million in each of 
the first two years, and possibly several million pounds 
thereafter.
<P>
The Government have chosen to start the process in 
1999. If they start to incur what, on their own admission, 
are significant costs during the handover period, surely 
they would prefer to do that in a year's time when, 
according to the economic cycle, the British economy will 
be more able to bear the implications of additional public 
expenditure. But what is the economic prognosis for the 
calendar year 1999? The Government's over-optimistic 
estimate is that growth in 1999 will be significantly down 
on growth in 1998 and about half of what they inherited 
in 1997. The consensus of independent forecasters expects 
growth in this calendar year to be negligible, possibly 
non-existent or, on a technical interpretation, even going 
into recession.
<P>
The Minister must clarify what consideration was given 
to whether these expensive provisions, which are likely to 
result in expenditure of more than £32 million in the next 
two financial years, should be introduced when the United 
Kingdom economy is growing more slowly than at any 
time in the past eight or nine years, and far more slowly 
than most other western industrialised countries and the 
European average. Is this the sensible time to trigger 
provisions in schedule 1 that have such serious 
expenditure implications for public finance?



<P>
The Minister has raised major questions. Will he 
reassure me that concrete discussions between his 
officials, those in the Treasury and the agencies involved 
and the Government's millennium-compliance task force 
have taken place on the ability of the Contributions 
Agency's existing system to cope with the millennium 
bug, and that the transfer under schedule 1 will not 
complicate those provisions? Will he also reassure me on 
the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for 
Grantham and Stamford, that a desire to get rid of the 
NIRS2 project did not lie behind the decision to trigger 
the provisions relatively early, in the lifetime of this 
Parliament? Finally, will he confirm that the Government 
have given proper consideration to the impact that the 
additional public expenditure will have on the UK 
economy at a time when it is growing so slowly?

<P>

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I had no intention of speaking now because 
this is an administrative measure that makes eminent 
sense. But having heard words such as "bogus"	, 
"charade"	, "sinister"	, "pernicious"	 and "disingenuous"	, 
none of which appears in the Bill 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman 
is not referring to any member of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I take your point, Mr. McWilliam. I was 
merely quoting the words used by Opposition Members 
who have clearly forgotten that in 1995, a joint working 
party was set up between the two Departments. Hansard 
records a number of exchanges between myself and others. 
The then Secretary of State for Social Security, the right 
hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), 
recognised that there would be closer integration of the two 
Departments. I was interested in the matter, as I am sure you 
were, Mr. McWiliam, and pressed the Secretary of State on 
data protection issues that were consequent on the merger 
of such systems. He agreed that changes needed to take 
place, which they have following the European directive 
and primary legislation.
<P>
It is interesting that such a bogus, sinister, pernicious 
and disingenuous charade of a Bill has attracted only 
50 per cent. of Opposition Members on the Committee 
to attend. It cannot therefore be that important. To 
clarify matters for the hon. Member for Grantham and 
Stamford, I should say that the detailed computer notes 
in my hand did not come from Millbank but arrived at 
quarter-past 10 o'clock when I was sitting at the 
Members' terminal in the Library. One can find some 
interesting matches between the words "Lilley"	 and 
"computer"	 by searching the text of Hansard; indeed, 
some relate to issues raised by hon. Members.
<P>
It is inappropriate for the hon. Member for Grantham 
and Stamford to suggest that the Bill did not have some 
origins in the thinking of the previous Government. The 
thought process that resulted in the Bill has had currency 
among officials in the Department since the working party 
was set up in 1995.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> If it is the hon. Gentleman's contention 
that the Bill stems in a long clear line from the 
previous Government's work, how does he reconcile that 
with a Minister's written answer to the House in 1995. 
That answer stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It was concluded that the overlap between the Revenue and 
the agency did not warrant an amalgamation of the two 
businesses. In addition, any efficiency gains would be outweighed 
by transitional costs and disruption to both departments."	 
[Official Report, 14 June 1995; Vol. 261, c. 516.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That was the previous Government's position; it is a 
contradiction to say that the Bill stems from that position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> We can exchange comments for ever about 
who said what to whom in the previous Government. I 
could cite a huge number of contradictory instances, 
which I would be happy to show the hon. Gentleman 
outside the Committee, but I do not want to detain the 
Committee unnecessarily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It is not part of my purpose in the 
Committee to defend the previous Administration we 
are not interested in a historical exercise but, in the 
interests of fairness, I must take up this point. The 
previous Government examined the possibility of merging 
the two departments for which there may be internal 
bureaucratic pressure, as I have hinted and conducted a 
proper study including a cost-benefit analysis. They 
concluded that it did not make sense and that the costs 
exceeded the benefits in financial terms. I put that point 
to the Minister as forcefully as I could in the stand part 
debate, although he spectacularly failed to respond. Does 
the hon. Gentleman not recognise the distinction between 
what I have described and his claim of complicity with a 
future Government who might take exactly the opposite 
decision to that taken by the previous Conservative 
Administration? There is no evidence for his assertion; in 
fact, the evidence is against it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman rises, 
interventions should merely be interventions. That last 
intervention was somewhat long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> To answer the hon. Member for Grantham 
and Stamford, if the principle was worth examining 
during the previous Government, It is improper to 
describe the Bill as bogus, a charade, sinister, pernicious 
and disingenuous. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it 
both ways.
<P>
I now move on to the latest report from Taskforce 2000, 
which the Opposition are fond of using as their source. 
The report describes the DSS as well prepared for the 
consequences of the millennium date-change problem. 
That is interesting given some of the extremely complex 
issues faced by my hon. Friend the Minister and others in 
the Department, resulting from contracts signed by the 
previous Government. Let us be clear: that is the root 
cause of the problems that we face. Even the hon. 
Gentleman's friends in Taskforce 2000 are clear about the 
progress that has been made.
<P>
As someone who spends a great deal of time studying 
these matters, I am confident that the progress that can 
result from the Bill can be achieved without any 
additional risk to the integrity of computer systems. Some 
problems need addressing, and I know that my hon. 
Friend the Minister is working hard to address the 
problems that he inherited from the previous 
Administration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the 
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston for that 
well-informed, illuminating, concise and to-the-point 
contribution, which will have refreshed the whole 
Committee.
<P>
I do not need to detain the Committee long in 
responding to the few points of substance in the two 
speeches that preceded my hon. Friends's. I appreciate 
that the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale is 
quite a new member of the House, but social security 
legislation and regulation-making powers are all under 
Treasury direction. Indeed, the language in schedule 1 
simply reproduces the language long used in social 
security legislation and does not change in substance any 
of the points that hon. Members suggested were being 
changed.
<P>
The Secretary of State for Social Security retains policy 
responsibility for benefits, including statutory sick pay 
and statutory maternity pay. He retains operational 
responsibility for the Benefits Agency's benefits, and so 
needs, and will continue to have, access to the national 
insurance fund.
<P>
As regards the point raised by the hon. Member for 
Grantham and Stamford, the language used in paragraphs 
28 and 30 is lifted straight from the Social Security 
Administration Act 1992. He queried particularly the 
point about the Secretary of State being under the 
direction of the Treasury. It follows the existing wording 
of the subsection being amended, section 165(1) of that 
Act, which was introduced by the previous Government. 
It refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such payments by way of adjustment as the Secretary of State 
determines (in accordance with any directions of the Treasury)"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The schedule makes no change to the substance either. 
The checks and balances in the organisation are precisely 
as they have been since 1992, and in many cases long 
before that, and no problems have arisen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> the Minister has just told the committee 
that the language of paragraph 28 is the same as in the 
Social Security Administration Act 1992. However, 
paragraph 28 explicitly says that that shall be "amended 
as follows"	. The Minister cannot get away from the fact 
that there is new wording there. What is the purpose of 
that new wording and what protections will be in place to 
prevent the national insurance fund from being milked 
unduly by the Revenue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The wording has been changed, because 
we are transferring the Contributions Agency from the 
Department of Social Security to the Inland Revenue. 
That is why the schedule is required. As my hon. Friend 
the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston rightly said, it 
is a technical exercise which requires extensive changes 
to the wording. the substance and, in particular, the extent 
of the Treasury direction are not being changed.
<P>
The protections offered in regard to the administrative 
costs attributable to recovery are precisely as they have 
been sine the 1992 Act was introduced. Responsibility is 
being transferred from the Department of Social Security 
and the Secretary of State to the Inland Revenue, which 
need concern nobody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It does concern me. It is a fundamental 
principle that when Parliament is legislating, it should 
examine such matters afresh and decide whether it is 
satisfied with simply replicating the wording of earlier 
Act. The Minister started by saying that nothing had 
changed, but he has now acknowledged that the wording 
has been amended. Will he answer my question: what 
checks and balances will prevent the Revenue from 
overcharging the national insurance fund for the expenses 
referred to in the schedule?
<P>
Irrespective of precedent, we must satisfy ourselves that 
we are happy with the law that we are discussing. I am not 
happy when the Minister refuses to answer my specific 
question: what are the protections?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The Inland Revenue is accountable to 
Treasury Ministers and Parliament in exercising this and 
every other function. The protections are the same as 
always. In substance, they have not changed from the 
position introduced in the 1992 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I want to move on now; we have spent 
enough time on that issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. It is 
not for a Minister of the Crown to decide how much time 
the Committee spends on a specific issue. The Minister's 
comment was arrogant and I wonder whether, on 
reflection, he might like to withdraw it.



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It struck me that the hon. 
Gentleman asked the Minister to give way and the 
Minister declined to do so. That is any hon. Member's 
right. What he said is a matter for him.
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Westmorland and 
Lonsdale raised a query about paragraph 35. He was 
concerned that the effect would be to substitute unelected 
civil servants for the elected Secretary of State. In fact, 
the provision covers the exercise of an operational 
function, not a policy-making function. In practice, that 
function is carried out by unelected civil servants in the 
Department of Social Security on behalf of the Secretary 
of State. Again, there is no change to the substance of 
what is happening.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford 
suggested that the Secretary of State was being made 
subject to the direction of the Inland Revenue. That is not 
so and nothing in the schedule puts the Secretary of State 
in that position. I can confirm that the Secretary of State 
is entirely happy with all the provisions of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale 
queried the timing. The transfer has been planned 
alongside Department of Social Security's information 
technology strategy. Stopping or postponing the transfer 
now would increase the problems and cause disruption by 
separating the transfer work from the other information 
technology changes. The date for the transfer was 
announced by the Chancellor almost a year ago, so there 
has been plenty of time to prepare for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and 
Neston referred earlier to Taskforce 2000. Will the 
Minister answer my specific question: has Taskforce 2000 
been consulted on the information technology 
implications of the transfer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Taskforce 2000 has reported on the whole 
range of millennium compliance issues affecting the 
Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere 
Port and Neston reminded me that it specifically credited 
the Department of Social Security as being well prepared 
to face the millennium problem. That is also the case in 
respect of other private-sector agencies that have 
considered the matter. The Department of Social Security 
and all its agencies, including the Contributions Agency, 
have done very good work and continue to do so in 
preparing computer systems for the millennium. It is vital 
that they continue to operate through the millennium 
period because so many people depend on them. 
Taskforce 2000 has commended the work of the 
Department and regular reports are made to Parliament on 
the preparations being made throughout Government for 
the millennium bug problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister said that I was wrong and 
that the schedule refers not to the submission of the 
Department of Social Security to the Revenue, but only 
to its submission to the Treasury. I refer him to paragraphs 
24 and 25. Paragraph 24 says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In section 121(5) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 
for `Secretary of State', in each place where it occurs, there is 
substituted `Inland Revenue'."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 25 says that the regulations that will be made 
by the Secretary of State will be, thereafter,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`made with the concurrence of the Inland Revenue'"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and the paragraph continues at (b),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for `for the purposes of his functions' there is substituted `or the 
Inland Revenue, for the purposes of their respective functions'."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`made with the concurrence of the Inland Revenue'"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
has exactly the same effect as the other phrase that I

Again, the Government are using different formulae to 
pull the wool over people's eyes. the reality is that the 
Department of Social Security has become an executive 
clerks' branch of the Revenue or the Treasury. Whether 
the Government say that something can be done only 
with the concurrence of the Revenue or that it must be 
done on the authorisation of the Treasury, it all adds 
up to the same thing: the Revenue and the Treasury 
are running the show. There should be no marks for 
trying to hide the reality of the picture, which is grim.

<P>
I am even more concerned about the fact that, once 
again, the Minister declined to answer my question. Is this 
how we are going to scrutinise the Bill, clause by clause 
and schedule by schedule? It will be an historic case, 
quoted in the constitutional textbooks my hon. Friend the 
Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale has read them all, 
although I have not had that privilege primus inter pares 
and the rest of it. It will be remembered that, in February 
1999, a Bill went through the House of Commons, 
disguised in new Labour wrapping as a purely 
administrative measure, but which actually had a very 
pernicious effect because it was a blatant attack on the 
integrity of the national insurance system. It will be 
memorable for the fact that, as each clause and schedule 
was debated, the Minister declined to answer questions. 
Last time, the question was about costs. This time, it is 
about protections.
<P>
It is no use saying that the problems already existed, or 
that the previous Government should have done 
something about it. The Labour Government are now in 
power, and I am asking them what they are doing about 
it. In fact, I am asking what might be thought of as an 
even softer question: whether the Minister is satisfied.
I did not even receive an answer to my factual question 
about what protections there will be. We are wasting our 
time and our constituents' time, and we are wasting public 
money by having a debate in which the Minister 
declines because he is either unable or unwilling, but
I suspect because he is unwilling to answer questions.
<P>
The Minister is probably unwilling to answer questions 
because the answers might be embarrassing and might 
reveal the real reason for the project, which is to drive a 
coach and horses through the national insurance system. 
The Government are pretending that that is not the case, 
so they befuddle the debate by using different words and 
phrases to describe the same thing. They try to hide the 
fact that the Secretary of State will have no power by 
saying that he will do things under directions from the 
Treasury of the Revenue, by going off at a tangent and 
talking about previous Administrations and about what 
people did in the private sector before they became 
Members of Parliament. That may all be amusing, but we 
must deal with the substance of the debate and decide 
what the real nature of the Bill is.
<P>
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Conservative 
party's interpretation of the Bill is correct. I dare say that 
many Labour Members are not especially proud to be 
serving on this Committee because the Bill will do great 
damage to the integrity of the national insurance system. 
The Labour party used to believe in the national insurance 
system as strongly as we did. In that respect, it is a sad 
day.
<P>
There is a second issue that should concern the 
Committee. Even if these proposals go into the wrong 
direction, we should know what the reality is because we 
have had an open debate and the proposals have received 
proper parliamentary scrutiny. The British public could 
them make up their minds whether they like the fact that, 
contrary to all the general vibes and rhetoric, and 
completely unforseen in any manifesto commitment, the 
new Labour Government set about the national insurance 
system as soon as they came to power. The British public 
must be clear about that and they can make their decision 
at the next election. I have a good idea what that decision 
will be. That is how democracy should work. However, it 
is the Committee's role to elucidate and clarify. If we 
cannot amend, we must at least elucidate.



<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> In support of my hon. Friend's powerful 
case that we need greater elucidation from the Minister, 
one reason for the lack of straightforward answers from 
the Minister on the Government's policy in respect of the 
national insurance fund, and why they were not clear 
about it in the run-up to the general election, is that 
Labour's plans to change the national insurance system 
were commonly supposed to have been central to its 
defeat in the 1992 election. That is perhaps why they are 
not being as level and straightforward as they could be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> When the history of the later decades of 
the 20th century in Britain comes to be written, the great 
theme may well be that the Labour party found it 
impossible to win power when it revealed its real plans to 
the electorate, so it fastened upon a brilliant way of 
winning power. They hired extremely expensive and 
clever spin doctors such as the Mandelsons, the 
Campbells I am sorry for the right hon. Member for 
Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) and the rest of their 
cohorts, and somehow disguised reality by packaging it 
attractively so that people would swallow it without 
realising what it was. There is no doubt that it has worked, 
but I trust that it will not work for much longer. The 
Minister is very much in that mode. I am sorry about that, 
as I think that it goes against the grain of his basic 
character. He is avoiding and evading key questions. He 
is doing it again here.
<P>
I do not want to hear a long historical disputation, and 
nor do the public. They do not want to know what private 
citizens believed before they came to the House. They 
want to know what the Government are about, they want 
to know the effect of the schedule and they want the 
answer to the question that I have just asked the Minister.
<P>
Here we have a national insurance fund entirely at the 
mercy of the Revenue. There are no checks or balances 
and the Secretary of State and the Ministers are 
withdrawing from responsibility in this area. The previous 
formulation may have been excessively weak. If we had 
been discussing the matter in 1992 or 1952, we might 
legitimately have tabled amendments to strengthen the 
protections. That is a perfectly good argument to deploy. 
However, in those days, there was a strong Department of 
Social Security which was regarded as the guardian of the 
integrity of the national insurance system. That has gone 
and Ministers have given away their powers or accepted 
that they will exercise them only under the directions of 
the Treasury or I think that I have got it right of the 
Revenue in certain cases.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are now on the third round 
of the same questions and arguments. It is tedious 
repetition and I must direct the hon. Gentleman to desist. 
He has asked his questions, he can invite the Minister to 
reply, but he cannot ask them a third time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Even if I do not get an answer,
Mr. McWilliam, It seems to me to be an essential part of the 
functions of the Committee to insist on one.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am bound by standing orders. 
The standing order bans tedious repetition. If the hon. 
Gentleman asks the same questions twice and then starts 
to ask them a third time, whether or not he is satisfied 
with the answer, it is still tedious repetition and he must 
desist. He must obey my ruling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It would not have occurred to me in years 
not to obey your ruling, Mr. McWilliam. However, this is 
an interesting point, because "tedious repetition"	 is a 
phrase that is often used 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will not brook a challenge to 
my chairmanship or my direction on tedious repetition. I 
have ruled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> May I make an observation on the 
principle?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may not 
make an observation, because, by making an observation, 
he is challenging my chairmanship, and he may not do 
that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I would not do that, Mr. McWilliam. I am 
certain, however, from everything that you have said and 
the context in which you have said it, that you did not 
have in mind that I was wilfully wasting the time of the 
Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I make it clear to the hon. 
Gentleman that I did not have in mind that the hon. 
Gentleman was wasting the time of the Committee? I had 
in mind the standing order that directs me to rule out of 
order an hon. Member who makes repetitive points or 
arguments, however long or short they may be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I have had a 
certain amount of experience of being on Committees in 
the House, but not, as I have already said, on a Standing 
Committee considering social security legislation. I have 
never encountered the same difficulty in getting answers.
<P>
Mr. McWilliam, you know the question that I have put 
to the Minister. The Minister now knows the question. He 
understands why I have repeated it as many times as you 
have allowed me to get away with it so that there can 
be no doubt about what the question is. If I do not get an 
answer to another question, I want an answer to that 
question: what are the protections? Will the Minister first 
describe them and, secondly, tell us why he is not 
strengthening them, given that the traditional role of the 
Department of Social Security as the protector of the 
national insurance system is being changed and, indeed, 
destroyed by the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. 
Would it be possible to record that, once again, the 
Minister explicitly declined to answer that question?

<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of functions under subordinate legislation</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Second 
schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am amazed by the Government's 
conduct in the Committee. It is clear that they do not think 
it necessary to answer questions as they can use their vast 
majority to steamroller Parliament. I do not know why 
they bother with Parliament. Perhaps we shall reach a 
point when they decide not to do so.
<P>
It is extraordinary that the Minister has nothing to 
say to introduce the schedule. I was respecting the 
conventions. You know me, Mr. McWilliam. I believe 
in parliamentary courtesies and conventions. It was my 
intention to let the Minister speak first to his own 
schedule, rather than to pre-empt him by getting my 
remarks in first. That was the origin of the confusion 
after which you kindly I hope all members of the 
Committee will think rightly allowed me, nevertheless, 
to speak, despite my momentary hesitation. I assure 
you, Mr. McWilliam, that I shall not hesitate again. 
Equally, I shall ask questions without expecting an 
answer from the Minister. We are in a new ball game. 
It is not Parliament as I knew it or as my hon. Friend 
the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale, who 
studied political science, knows it. It is very worrying.
<P>
As the Minister is no longer prepared to defend the 
Bill and does not answer questions, one wonders what the 
public who follow these matters, as I hope they do, will 
think. If the Minister refuses to answer questions here, he 
will certainly manage to avoid answering questions from 
the public or the press, as that is much easier, and there 
will be no illusions about how things are going.
<P>
I want to ask a number of questions. The Minister 
might as well get on with this ministerial correspondence. 
He has no intention of answering my questions because 
the answers would no doubt be embarrassing to the 
Government. I shall try to do my job as the Opposition 
spokesman, even if the Minister is not doing his job of 
defending his Bill.
<P>
I shall start with the beginning of schedule 2. We have 
already transferred in schedule 1 a large number of the 
functions that are created for the Secretary of State for 
Social Security as a result of primary legislation. We are 
now transferring the functions in secondary legislation. 
Some 20 pieces of secondary legislation are listed in the 
schedule, many of which involve more than one 
regulation, so the total is probably nearer 50, yet the 
Minister had nothing at all to say about that, which is an 
amazing commentary on British democracy in 1999. he 
hoped that he could say nothing, a Division would be 
called and the Government's majority would allow the 
provision to go through with no scrutiny and no questions. 
That is frightening.
<P>
Some hysterical comments have been made recently, of 
which I do not approve, on the relationship between new 
Labour and past totalitarian Administrations, but the 
reality is worrying. It results from new Labour's 
corruption by the intoxication of its spin doctoring and 
its success at manipulating the message. The Government 
believe that they can get away with anything because no 
one knows the meaning or substance. All political parties 
should try to resist the intoxication that comes with an 
enormous majority.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have two points to make. 
First, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the word 
"corruption"	, because the honour of any Member of the 
House must not be impugned. Secondly, it was ruled long 
ago by a previous Speaker that no Member of the House, 
whatever the evidence to the contrary, can be intoxicated. 
I invite the hon. Gentleman to speak to the schedule.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I was using the word, "intoxicated"	 in a 
purely metaphorical sense and the word "corruption"	 in a 
philosophical sense. As always, Mr. McWilliam, I shall 
observe your guidance and speak strictly to the detail of 
the schedule.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whether the hon. Gentleman 
was being philosophical or not, I invite him to withdraw 
his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall, of course, withdraw both 
comments.
<P>
The schedule is complicated. The first item refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"All the regulations except regulations 36 to 39, 41 to 42 and 44."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know that the object of the schedule is, in principle, 
to transfer Department of Social Security functions to the 
Inland Revenue. We strongly disapprove of that principle, 
but I shall not go into the general arguments now.
<P>
One or two regulations and functions have mysteriously 
been left behind. I do not understand the logic of that. 
For example, regulations 37 and 38 of the Social Security 
(Contributions) Regulations 1979 are omitted in the 
schedule. They deal with the re-allocation of benefits and 
late contributions. Regulation 40, which is left in the 
schedule, deals with late class 2 contributions voluntary 
contributions made by the self-employed. There is no 
logic in that.
<P>
The same applies later in the schedule, in lines 32 and 
39, which refer to regulations covering pensions. All are 
transferred except one or two, which are left in. We 
cannot accept that with no word of explanation from the 
Government. It is a shocking discourtesy. It is also very 
suspicious that the Government want to nod the schedule 
through without explaining to the public the logic of the 
apparent anomalies. If there is some logic, surely 
Parliament is entitled to know what it is.
<P>
The Government should not wait for me, a 
Conservative spokesman, to put the matter on the record. 
I do not suppose we shall receive an answer because the 
Government are not in the business of answering 
questions in Parliament. Nevertheless, what we have 
witnessed this morning is deeply shocking. I make that 
point seriously and with no element of hyperbole. I should 
say to the Minister that this is an extraordinary way to 
conduct a Standing Committee. I hope that this conscience 
troubles him in the hours and weeks to come and that he 
realises that this is not the way to conduct his 
parliamentary career, whether from the Front Bench or 
elsewhere.


<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> If the questions raised by my hon. Friend 
can indeed be answered by the Department or by 
reference to the Minister's briefing pack, it seems curious 
that the Minister is not prepared to share that information. 
Alternatively, if that information has not been properly 
prepared, those who will provide claimants with legal 
advice, and the Contributions Agency and Inland Revenue 
officials who will implement the regulations, will be 
unable to act on the basis of proper and clear advice. In 
that case, the legislation might prove unenforceable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend is saying bluntly that the 
Government are behaving in either a shifty or an 
inefficient fashion and I, too, can draw no other 
conclusion.
<P>
The Minister should have explained to Parliament the 
rationale if there is one to explain for decisions on 
what will and will not go to the Treasury and the Inland 
Revenue, even though, as we have discovered, those 
powers will be exercised under the Treasury's direction. 
Had he done so, I could have probed any gaps that his 
explanation might have left and answered any questions 
that it might have raised. Opposition and, indeed, 
Government Committee members could also have asked 
sensible questions because the system would have been 
working properly. The Minister's response would have 
won or lost the argument, irrespective of the outcome of 
the vote. That difference is an important aspect of the 
system. In the House of Commons, winning arguments 
makes a lot of difference it is not just a question of 
winning votes. The Minister needs to be told that, because 
the new Labour philosophy is that one can advance 
whatever rubbish one likes because the vote will always 
be won.
<P>
That is not how Parliament should work. Indeed, if it 
continues to work in that way, people will begin to 
question the point in having a Parliament. Instead, one 
might as well have an elected dictatorship. Once every 
five years the winner of the general election could 
programme a computer, which would spew out the desired 
legislation of the Government of the day at the push of a 
button by their Prime Minister or Chief Whip. That would 
dispense with the need to spend time bringing people 
together in this place. What would be the point in 
allowing the press and public to come here, or in spending 
public funds on publishing the Hansard account of the 
House's proceedings?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Because of his persistent 
irrelevance, from which he must desist, I am showing the 
hon. Gentleman a grey card, although metaphorically it 
is yellow.
<P>
<B>Mr Davies:</B> I have perhaps anticipated a little what may 
happen next. I have asked questions which I believe you, 
Mr. McWilliam, will agree are entirely in order. You will 
also agree that it would be in order and, indeed, in the 
best traditions of the House that they should be answered 
seriously. I hope that I retain the right to catch your eye 
again if the Minister's responses are in any way 
inadequate. I shall now sit down in the hope that the 
Minister will respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> For the record, I have fully answered all 
the points of substance of which there have not been 
many that Opposition Members have raised.
<P>
Where necessary, the schedule will transfer 
responsibilities from the Secretary of State to the Inland 
Revenue to effect the provisions in the Bill. The 
contributions regulations that will not be transferred are 
those relating to benefits, rather than to contributions. The 
understanding that the hon. Member for Grantham and 
Stamford displayed of the Social Security (Contributions) 
Regulations 1979 was therefore defective. The benefit 
functions will not be transferred but will be retained by 
the Department of Social Security.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We have not heard the rationale for 
retaining statutory sick pay and maternity pay, for 
example, in the hands of the Department of Social 
Security. Why retain those benefits rather than others? 
Has consideration been given to merging the whole of the 
Department of Social Security with the Treasury to make 
it part of the Treasury or Inland Revenue? Given that the 
Benefits Agency, which is responsible for handling out 
the money, is a separate next-steps agency, perhaps it too 
could report to the Treasury. There are so many anomalies 
that it makes little sense to continue with a separate 
Department of Social Security.

Schedule 2 agreed to.



<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of other functions to Treasury or Board</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clause 2, together with schedule 3 which 
it introduces, is a central plank of the Bill. It transfers 
policy responsibility for national insurance contributions 
to the Treasury and Inland Revenue, and responsibility to 
control the management of the national insurance fund to 
the Inland Revenue. The policy functions are set out in 
schedule 3.
<P>
Hon. Members may wonder why some functions are 
transferred to the Revenue and others in fact, most are 
transferred to the Treasury. We have replicated the split 
in tax law where day-to-day matters are the responsibility 
of the Inland Revenue and powers to affect tax liability 
are reserved to the Treasury. Although the clause and 
schedule 3 shift items to the Inland Revenue, they are 
principally concerned with the day-to-day running of the 
national insurance fund.
<P>
The move to transfer policy responsibility for national 
insurance contributions to the Treasury and Inland 
Revenue have been widely welcomed. For example, in its 
representation in advance of the coming Budget, the 
Institute of Directors said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We welcome the transfer of the Contributions Agency to the 
Inland Revenue and the planned transfer of national insurance policy 
to the Revenue. The policy transfer is essential: without it the 
Contributions Agency transfer will deliver only a small fraction of 
its potential benefits because the Revenue will still have to apply 
two sets of policies based on different principles."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At the outset of our proceedings, the hon. Member for 
Grantham and Stamford declared an interest on behalf of 
the Chartered Institute of Taxation. I do not know whether 
it took his advice before it submitted representations on 
the 1999 Budget, but he may be interested to know that 
it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are pleased to note that the Inland Revenue and the 
Contributions Agency are to merge their field forces. However, we 
regard this as being the first step towards the integration of the 
policies of the two Departments."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That view is sensible and proper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Perhaps it was a good thing that I declared 
my interest in the Chartered Institute of Taxation. I had 
no idea that it was going to be mentioned and I do not 
recall being consulted by it on that matter. Had it 
consulted me, I would have given it what was known in 
my City days as best advice. It would not have been 
obliged to take it, nor would my relationship with it alter 
my judgment of what is in the public interest. Perhaps I 
should have declared a negative interest. There is no skin 
off anyone's nose if the views of the Chartered Institute 
of Taxation are opposed to mine on this subject. We all 
have to do what we think is right.



<P>
It would be churlish not to thank the Minister for giving 
the Committee the courtesy of an explanation, albeit brief, 
of why he is introducing the schedule. He did not go into 
great detail on the hesitation surrounding the transfer of 
the policy functions. The decision was taken by his boss, 
the Secretary of State for Social Security the Minister 
will correct me if I am wrong during or immediately 
before the Second Reading debate. Therefore, to some 
extent, the decision was sprung on the House. That relates 
to my hon. Friend's point on which I intervened in his 
support about the nasty sub-plot to the tragic drama of 
the surreptitious and deadly attack on the national 
insurance system. Ministers in the DSS may be so worried 
about their conduct of the Department's business over the 
past two years, and especially the shambles of the national 
insurance records system computer, that they may want 
to get shot of it as soon as possible.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
My first point about the clause is that it repeats the 
approach of schedule 1 and spectacularly proclaims the 
humiliation of the DSS. Even where the DSS has some 
remaining functions, it is merely the executive arm of the 
Treasury or the Revenue.
<P>
Secondly despite the Government's claim that the Bill 
is a minor administrative measure it introduces through 
a schedule an enormous number of legislative changes 
that, had I not protested, I fear the Government would not 
have explained. Legislation affected will include the 
Social Security Act 1986, the Social Security 
Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the Income and 
Corporation Taxes Act 1988 the main taxes Act as we 
refer to it the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Jobseekers 
Act 1995, and statutory sick pay legislation. All those 
measures will be changed at a stroke without individual 
discussion as you would acknowledge, Mr. McWilliam, 
it was difficult to obtain agreement to even a brief 
discussion of the aggregate changes.
<P>
It is a frightening aspect of the modern world. I 
acknowledged that Conservative Governments did not 
have clean hands in that regard a tendency towards 
having more secondary legislation and less parliamentary 
scrutiny has been a feature of the past generation. I think 
you have heard me say before, Mr. McWilliam, under 
your chairmanship of Committees on statutory 
instruments, that the way in which secondary legislation 
is reviewed is profoundly wrong. It barely deserves to be 
described as legislation it might better be referred to as 
a diktat or "ukase"	.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> My hon. Friend is making a powerful case 
on the inappropriate nature of the measure. Does he agree 
that, whatever the general merits or otherwise of transfers 
of regulatory powers under secondary legislation, it is 
difficult to defend the transfer of policy-making functions 
and that is difficult to reconcile with the principle of 
ministerial accountability to the House of Commons for 
policy formulation?

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend makes two powerful 
points, one of which I shall follow up in a moment.
<P>
Momentous changes are being made we have made 
that absolutely clear this morning behind a screen of 
minor administrative change. I must say to my hon. Friend 
that I would expect hon. Members on both sides of the 
Committee and perhaps Labour Members in 
particular to be suspicious when a Minster comes to the 
Committee to defend a measure involving national 
insurance by virtue of a quotation from the Institute of 
Directors. Extraordinary things are happening when the 
Labour Government regard the Institute of Directors as 
the body that is most concerned about preserving the 
national insurance system, and when the best they can do 
to support their proposals is to pray in aid the Institute of 
Directors. The whole country, both the Opposition and the 
Labour party, are right to be doubly vigilant in those 
circumstances.



<P>
Two important questions arise from the schedule not 
detailed, nitpicking questions. The first my hon. Friend 
the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale touched on 
this is the question of parliamentary accountability and 
responsibility.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I help the hon. 
Gentleman? At the moment, we are discussing clause 
stand part, but the hon. Gentleman's point arises from 
schedule 3, to which the clause gives effect. The clause 
does nothing else, so if the hon. Gentleman wishes to 
persist with his arguments, will he please do so when we 
debate schedule 3? Otherwise, we may have a very 
general debate about why we should not give effect to 
the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I understand entirely, Mr. McWilliam. Of 
course, that dilemma is frequently faced in the House.
<P>
Because we are so dissatisfied, we shall vote against 
the clause, but it would be more logical to be able to set 
out our arguments as to why we find the schedule, to 
which the clause will give effect, obnoxious, before 
voting against giving it effect. I suppose that if we win 
the vote on clause 2, we shall no longer be able to talk 
about the schedule; but then we shall be so pleased about 
having destroyed the schedule that we will not complain 
about not having the opportunity to reveal the 
perniciousness of the Government's intentions as 
represented in it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon Gentleman has 
answered his own question about why we conduct the 
debate in that way. That is why it is so constructive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In the light of your guidance,
Mr. McWilliam, I shall cease to comment on the matter. 
I trust that other Committee members will have the 
opportunity to catch your eye, if they so wish, during the 
clause stand part debate. I may revert to some of those 
points during the stand part debate in relation to the 
schedule if we are defeated in the vote on the clause. 
However, it would be nice to think that the arguments that 
my hon. Friend and I have adduced have been sufficiently 
persuasive to convince the majority of Labour Members 
to vote against the clause, and thereby to spare the 
embarrassment of the Minister, should he have to defend 
the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> I want to take this opportunity to pose a 
question to the Minister about something that the said 
during the clause stand part debate. He said that the 
Government thought that there was merit in merging 
policy relating to national insurance and taxation. I should 
like a simple answer to the question of whether he 
believes that there is merit in merging the tax and national 
insurance systems throughout the income scale.
<P>
Question put, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of other functions to Treasury or board</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this Schedule be the Third 
Schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Again, we have the same try-on by the 
Government, who do not want to debate the schedule. Let 
there be no doubt about it it will be evident in the 
Official Report the Government do not want to debate 
these schedules. They have been trying to use their 
majority to steamroller them through. That is becoming a 
hallmark of the Government's conduct in the Committee, 
which is disgraceful.
<P>
We have just seen the third occasion we have 
discussed only two clauses on which the Government 
refused to answer a question. My hon. Friend asked a 
clear question: what is the logic of transferring the policy 
functions from the Department of Social Security and not 
transferring the Department altogether? That is a pertinent 
question central to the Bill. The only excuse that the 
Minister might have, which I would accept if he chooses 
to use it, for not giving us an answer is that he hoped to 
win the vote on the clause and intended to use the debate 
on the schedule. The trouble was that had I not jumped 
up when I did, there would not have been a debate on 
the schedule.
<P>
The Minister did not use the opportunity to explain the 
rationale of the schedule. He does not want to use the 
opportunity in the Committee to explain the rationale of 
the Bill as a whole. Perhaps one of the eager beavers on 
the Labour Back Benches who wants to earn some 
brownie points with the Whips will jump up and tell me 
if there is any other explanation for the Government 
declining to take the opportunity to explain the rationale 
of a Bill in Committee when the purpose of the 
Committee is to explain the rationale of each clause and 
schedule of that Bill. Either there is no rationale or the 
Government are ashamed to explain it.



<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the 
Minister's extraordinary failure to answer my question, 
which clearly arose from his earlier comments on clause 
2 stand part, creates uncertainty for many taxpayers 
and employers? The Minister will not say whether the 
Government plan to integrate the tax and national 
insurance system all the way up the income scale, and 
people who plan their own tax affairs and those of their 
employees will be uncertain, confused and worried at 
the Minister's persistent failure to answer 
straightforward questions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members may or may not 
be happy with the Minister's responses, but I shall assist 
the hon. Gentleman by saying that the debate on the 
sittings motion is the customary broad debate that reflects 
the Bill's Second Reading. That was the only time when 
the rationale of the Bill could be debated in Standing 
Committee. Once we come to the clause by clause, line 
by line debate, we are discussing the details of the Bill. 
That is the procedure in Standing Committee and I am 
forced to insist that the Committee proceed in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Of course, that is how the Committee 
should proceed. The initial sittings motion is when general 
points can be made, but we could not have anticipated 
then that the Government would not use the opportunity 
of debate on individual clauses and schedules to explain 
the rationale of those clauses and schedules the detailed 
provisions. You will accept, Mr. McWilliams, that I have 
been asking specific questions about the rationale of 
individual clauses and have received no response.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I assist the hon. Member 
by saying that the Chair is tied by Standing Orders? If the 
hon. Gentleman is dissatisfied and wants to revisit the 
thrust of the Bill and its policy, he may do so on Third 
Reading. That is now the only stage at which he may 
do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is how the system should work and 
we can already anticipate some general comments that 
must be made on Third Reading about the Government's 
conduct in the Committee.
<P>
I said that I could see no reason for the Government to 
decline to explain the rationale of a clause, or a schedule 
that is allowed by a clause, unless they are ashamed of 
that rationale or there is no rationale. I shall try again, 
because it is our duty not to give up. I shall ask a number 
of questions and we shall see what answers we get.
<P>
My first question was anticipated by my hon. Friend 
the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale on clause 2 
and refers to schedule 3. What is the rationale for taking 
the policy functions away from the Department of Social 
Security? Most of us had a clear image of the Department 
of Social Security as a Department in Whitehall 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I adjourn the 
Committee, may I inform the Committee that the Room 
will be locked so hon. Members may safely leave papers 
here.
<P>
With reference to the point made by the hon. Member 
for Grantham and Stamford this morning, I am assured 
that the area below the aisle will be roped off so that 
members of the public can see and hear what is 
happening.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the 
Committee without Question put, pursuant to the 
Standing Order.
<p><ul>Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
