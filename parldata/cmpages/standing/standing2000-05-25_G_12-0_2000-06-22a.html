</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> There is some similarity between the subject of reasonable powers of inspection that we discussed in previous debates and the inspection of adoption and fostering agencies. The amendments would introduce an element of reasonableness. The Association of Directors of Social Services has advised me on current practice for rights of entry to private fostering and adoption agencies. The Children Act 1989 and related guidance do not make the situation clear and the association thinks that we have an opportunity to clarify matters. It advises inspectors to try to persuade private foster carers to allow entry when it has been refused, but if they are very worried that a child might be at risk of harm, section 48 of the Children Act gives them an ultimate right of entry. The consensus is, however, that social workers do not have the right to enter foster carers' homes without consent. The Bill extends the powers of inspectors to obtain entry to adoption and fostering services.
<P>
Amendment No. 228 is a probing amendment. It would set a limit on such entry and inspection so that it could take place only at a reasonable time of day. If inspectors are worried that a child is at risk, a knock at the door in the night would be disturbing for everyone, including the child. However, there would have to be a safeguard for inspectors who need to know what is happening at night.
<P>
Amendment No. 230, which is also a probing amendment, calls on the Minister to specify reasonable notice time in regulations. It is designed to introduce some reasonableness into the power of inspection by the registration authority. We are strongly of the view, as expressed in amendment No. 231, that inspectors should report their presence to someone in a position of authority when they arrive, at the very least to comply with health and safety regulations. It is important for someone who is intrinsically a stranger to the set-up formally to record his or her presence on the site. When I enter such an establishment, I am required, as a member of the public, to sign in and sign out. That allows the manager to know how many people are present if there is an emergency. It is not an unreasonable request.
<P>
Initially, the amendments seem analogous to the amendments on clause 29, but we think that it is worth repeating some of the discussions about fostering and adoption services, not least because in current practice there is a consensus that social workers do not have the right just to barge in. They are mindful of the need to obtain consent before undertaking an inspection. It would be helpful to clarify, in debate, how things stand. The amendments present an opportunity to establish what is a reasonable power of inspection by the new registration authority.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> To some extent, the hon. Lady was right in pointing out that the amendments are similar to those that we dealt with on Tuesday. For the reasons that I gave then, they are unacceptable.
<P>
The hon. Lady referred particularly to amendment No. 231, about notifying the manager or other person in charge on arrival. That would normally be the right way to go about things, but this is a question of what to specify in the Bill. The amendment refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the manager or other person in charge.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How would that be ascertained practically? The hon. Lady is sensible and practical and will understand that that wording could cause inspectors some difficulty and has the potential to compromise their ability—albeit in extreme instances—to take necessary action to deal with a risk to the safety and well-being of people in, for example, a care home. I am sure that we would all want the inspectors to be able to take such action, and although the amendment is superficially attractive, it could set up difficult hurdles. I do not want to labour the point, but, although it is possible to agree in theory with her proposed solution to the problem that she has identified, it would create further difficulties. For that and other reasons it is best to keep such an amendment off the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Lady referred in her opening remarks to continuing confusion about the right to enter premises. We debated that issue on earlier clauses and I had hoped that I had made the circumstances permitting entry to property clear. The inspectors have no power to make forced entry to premises. She implied that there is some confusion about child protection powers under the Children Act 1989. I do not agree. The provisions are very clear about the powers available for people to enter property to safeguard the welfare of children. The relevant powers are under sections 47, 48, 46, 102, 62 and 64 and some are exercisable only by constables. They are specific and I am surprised that she perceived any confusion. In any event, those powers have no bearing on the functions and responsibilities of inspectors employed by the National Care Standards Commission. Those are two separate issues.
<P>
Amendment No. 361 is a new amendment. It is fairly daunting to realise that at least 361 amendments have been tabled. I am sure that there will be more, to which we shall, as always, look forward. The hon. Lady's point in this instance is perfectly fair, but can be dealt with differently. It is unlikely that commission inspectors will need to access computers in private dwelling houses when they inspect local authority fostering and adoption services. The power will almost always be exercised to ensure that inspectors can check records held on a computer and, in just about every case, the computer will be in local authority offices. It is possible that, on rare occasions, the commission will want to access computers in people's homes; for example, if someone works from home. 
<P>
If the commission wants to access computers in private dwelling houses, it will always have to give reasonable notice and would normally carry out the inspection during daylight hours. I cannot accept the amendment because it is not right to exclude any possibility of such powers being exercised outside of daylight hours or without reasonable notice. Of course, the concept of daylight hours is problematic and would make it more difficult for inspectors to perform their work during the winter, but I cannot understand why we would want to introduce a seasonal difference in relation to the inspectors' powers. There might be some explanation for that, but we have not yet heard it.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. I have tried to give the hon. lady some reassurance about the circumstances in which those powers could be exercised, and, in tabling amendment No. 361, she has identified an important point. However, it would be a mistake for the Committee to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister, but have some residual concern, especially in relation to private foster homes. I am concerned because the inspection powers will allow access into the privacy of someone's home. I want to confirm that the Minister is comfortable with the prospect that inspectors might have a right of entry into a private dwelling house to gain access to people's computer equipment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The Minister is shaking is head, so perhaps we need some clarification on that point.
<P>
To return to some parallel powers, I carefully examined the amendments to the Food Standards Bill. I know that I have referred to that before, but there are some parallels between the inspection powers in that Act and the question of rights of entry on the part of inspectors of a registered authority. I noticed that the wording of the Bill does not include a phrase such as ``at a reasonable hour''. Food Standards Agency inspectors approach their inspections in a thoroughly reasonable way and the matter is not left to guidance. We must look carefully at whatever guidance is issued, although we can accept that if the Association of Directors of Social Services says that the present guidance under the Children Act 1989 is unclear and needs clarification, the situation needs to be improved. May I trouble the Minister to make clear the position regarding private foster homes, because the provision will take inspectors into private dwelling houses, and I want to be sure that the privacy of the individual will be protected?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. lady referred to private foster homes. My understanding is that the purpose of the amendment was to deal with situations in which an employee of a local authority worked from home and, as part of that employment, used electronically stored data, to which the National Care Standards Commission might want access. We shall have an opportunity later to consider private homes of foster carers, but I assumed that her amendment referred to local authority employees who work from home. However, perhaps it is wider than that, so let me try to reassure her again. There is no question of inspectors having the power to enforce entry. Inspectors will be able to gain access to private dwelling houses only with the consent of the person concerned, so the commission would have to ask to be allowed in to inspect the data on a computer, and the person would have the right to refuse entry.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I will have to press the point. Perhaps I do not understand the clause correctly. It refers to adoption and fostering services, but I had thought that the reference to premises that might be used by the local authority in the discharge of its relevant functions could include a private fostering or adoption agency, which might be run from a private home. Some agencies are small and the amendment was designed to protect private individuals from intrusion into their homes.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady is genuinely confused. She is now talking about the premises of voluntary adoption agencies, which is a completely separate issue. I am getting more confused about what she wants to discuss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I am getting confused too. My reading of the Bill was that the reference in subsection (1)(b) to premises used by a local authority in the discharge of its relevant functions would include the private home of a foster carer, where a child is being fostered as part of the discharge of the local authority's functions. Will the Minister say whether that is correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Other amendments are coming up that will allow us to discuss that. There will be an opportunity for National Care Standards Commission inspectors to have access to the homes of private foster carers, because that is entirely appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister answer my specific question? Does the reference in subsection (1)(b) to premises used by a local authority for the discharge of its relevant functions include a private home in which a child is fostered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> My advice is that it does not include the private homes of foster carers. I hope that that reassures the hon. Lady, at least in part.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Then we have genuinely misunderstood. In reading Bills, one always tries to think what they might do in practice, and I think that the misunderstanding arises from the fact that private agencies often carry out the relevant functions of a local authority. For that reason, it makes no sense to press the amendment, but we shall have an opportunity to return to the issue of private foster carers and private foster homes, and when we reach that part of the Bill, we shall be able to seek protections for individual privacy.
<P>
I remain disappointed that our efforts to introduce a provision to require entry to be made at a reasonable time of the day have been unsuccessful, because there will now be some inconsistency between the inspections carried out by Food Standards Agency inspectors and commission inspectors. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 229, in page 20, line 10, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A person who proposes to exercise any power of entry or inspection conferred by this section or section 42 shall if so required produce some duly authenticated document showing his authority to exercise the power.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to provide some protection on both sides. To require an inspector to produce proof of identity on arrival at an establishment that carries out adoption and fostering services is in the interests of both that individual and the establishment that is being inspected. There is a clear precedent for that in the Food Standards Act 1999, with which there are close parallels in relation to powers of entry and inspection. Under section 14(7)(a) of that Act, an inspector is required to,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>produce his authorisation before exercising any powers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, there is a clear legal precedent to require proof of identity. Why is that so important? As we argued during debates on that Bill, it is naive to think that the arrival of an inspector will not cause concern in the establishment that he is visiting. If members of the public are about, questions will be asked about who the person is, why he is present and all the rest of it. During an earlier sitting, we were told about a set of premises that had been inspected 11 times in one month. One can understand the growing public concern about why the inspections are occurring, which explains in turn why the press often become interested in them and why difficult circumstances can develop. In their quest to get to the bottom of a story, investigative journalists have been known to gain entry to premises on a pretext and by not being what they seem. The inspector should be able to produce proof of identity, which would guard against press intrusion and clarify matters both for the inspectorate and for inspected establishments. The amendment has a legal precedent and is perfectly reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I fully understand the amendment's purpose. If the hon. Lady studies subsection (5), however, she will see that it is already achieved and that the amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I would need to read that provision carefully in order to be completely satisfied that such a requirement is included in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> To make it easier for the hon. Lady, I remind her of clause 29(8), which contains an equivalent requirement for an inspector to produce authenticated proof of identity.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> As that is the case, the amendment is unnecessary and I thank the Minister for his clarification. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): I beg to move amendment No. 277, in page 20, line 10, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1B) In carrying out its functions under subsection (1) in respect of a local authority's relevant functions in relation to a child who is subject to a care order, the registration authority shall seek the views of the court which made the care order.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with one of the growing number of instances in which there is an interface between the courts and the Executive that works fine in one direction but not at all well in the other. It is a fact that about three fifths of children in care are or have been the subject of court proceedings. Obviously, the rest have not been the subject of such proceedings. Many of the children in both categories have care plans for adoption, which is what interested me in the key point, which is that the children in whose lives the court has been involved—whether through a formal care order or not—tend to do better. The 1998 study ``Someone Else's Children'' has been referred to several times. It shows that children who have been the subject of court proceedings benefit from better record keeping, assessment, decision making and, critically, care planning. As the Minister knows, the study took 27 local authorities into account. Judges are specialists in such cases, as are the lawyers who participate in them. They build up a huge amount of expertise and are able to make a considerable contribution to child welfare cases. They take a hands-on approach in planning for children and are a considerable national resource.
<P>
The problem that the amendment would address is that the court is unable to have any further involvement after the children leave it. An experienced family barrister who works in London was kind enough to give me a briefing about the matter. She said that she was amazed that a judge could summon a director of social services to court, perhaps more than once, to discuss a care order. A judge can make sarcastic asides about 11 previous care orders on which the court had received pledges from the same social services director to take a particular course of action, not one of which was followed through. Judges know which are the bad local authorities, yet they still have to listen to the social services director make pledges in regard to the 12th, 13th or l4th case and then watch them walk out of court in the full knowledge that nothing will be done.
<P>
The remedy originally proposed to me would have given huge and swingeing further powers to the courts. My suggestion is much more moderate, not least because the original suggestion would not have been in order but also because it may appeal more to the Government. All we ask for in amendment No. 277 is that, when the commission and its counterparts carry out their functions in relation to children who are subject to care orders—that is a high proportion of children—the registration authority should at least be encouraged to talk to the courts and to ascertain their view of how the local authorities are carrying out the duties that have been imposed on them—duties with which many of them agree.
<P>
I do not think that it is a secret that I spend a large part of my time in the House attacking the courts. I have probably made more attacks on judges than any other Member of Parliament—so much so that I am probably the only one to have received hate mail from judges, including complaints to the Lord Chancellor. I do not often argue that the courts should have greater powers. I do not suggest that the courts should have an overriding power. However, the family courts have a huge body of expertise and are arguably the most effective, because a small group of specialist judges and lawyers spend almost all their time working on family law.
<P>
Having given the courts those huge powers to determine what should happen, is it atrocious that Parliament should have given them absolutely no power to follow the cases through. Nor is anyone else required to ensure that they are followed through. This moderate little amendment simply says that the registration authority should talk to the courts to find out whether their directions are being carried through by social services departments.
<P>
The Minister will expect me to end with my usual health warning. I have no doubt that he will open with a sentence on the fact that the amendment has technical drafting problems, but I am sure that he will then deal with the real, substantive problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I should put the hon. Gentleman out of his misery. I have no technical objections to the amendment—at least, none that I am prepared to share with him. Once again, he makes a number of important points. It is probably true to say that his general concern is about the quality of the care planning process and what he described as the occasional disconnection between what is offered or promised to a child and what materialises. We all share that concern; we want looked-after children to be provided with the best possible care and support to help them get on with their lives. However, there are a number of problems with the hon. Gentleman's proposed solution.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman slightly misunderstands the responsibilities of the National Care Standards Commission. In a nutshell, his concerns were about the individual care plan and its application to the individual children being looked after by a local authority. It will not be the job of the commission to monitor the implementation of individual care plans. The amendment assumes that the commission will be doing that, but it will not. It will be looking more generally at the competence of local authority services—the qualities and qualifications of staff and so on. It will be trying to take a big view of the service and its ability to look after children rather than of its decisions in relation to particular children in local authority care.
<P>
We envisage that that aspect of what must be a rigorous inspection process should properly be the responsibility of the social services inspectorate. Its staff would be the right people to examine decisions on individual children as part of the inspection of a service. The National Care Standards Commission would pay attention to the organisational competence of the service rather than to the taking of care planning decisions on individual children. The hon. Gentleman probably has the wrong people in his sights. He has identified the National Care Standards Commission as needing to consult the courts. However, the consultation would relate to a function that the commission was not carrying out under the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other problem with the hon. Gentleman's amendment is one that he identified—that, having made the care order, the court would have no continuing responsibility for monitoring the enforcement of the care plan. The hon. Gentleman might want to tackle that issue in the context of other legislation. The Bill is not the right context. Once the care order is made, the local authority assumes parental responsibility for the child and for ensuring and promoting that child's interests, welfare and development. The hon. Gentleman is familiar with those duties. It would serve no obvious purpose to return to the court to ask for its comments about the implementation of the care plan, given that the court would not at that stage have jurisdiction or competence to intervene.
<P>
I agree strongly about the need for children to progress quickly through the care system and not to drift. The hon. Gentleman and I share assumptions about that. There have been too many well-documented cases of children, sometimes with particularly difficult backgrounds and needs, drifting needlessly in the care system in a way that damages their long-term prospects. We intend to tackle that, partly through our work on adoption and partly through the quality protects programme. In essence, those problems perhaps need to be dealt with on a different footing from that proposed by the hon. Gentleman. I do not disagree about the need for the work, but the hon. Gentleman has probably not chosen the right vehicle for it. I hope that he will be reassured that the Government are conscious of the problems that he has identified and are working to find solutions to them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> The Minister has made a characteristically constructive response. Of course, he is right. The issue of rebalancing power between the court and the Executive if that is appropriate, should be discussed in another forum. I accept that difficulties arise in that context, because managers must manage, but it seems strange that the court has no ability ever to act in individual cases, even if it is clear that its decisions have been completely disobeyed.
<P>
The amendment could be modified slightly to allow for what the Minister has said. The essential point made by barristers who do the relevant work, and particularly vehemently by the lady who briefed me today, is that every family court judge knows exactly who the bad boys are among the local authorities. Individual cases furnish examples, but I do not suggest that the National Care Standards Commission should get stuck in to many individual cases. I suggest that judges should be able to say, ``The following six authorities have let us down again and again in the past year or two, and 17 case studies show that those authorities consistently promise in court to take certain action, but walk away and take no notice.''
<P>
I accept the Minister's wider point, but talking to the courts would be useful for the National Care Standards Commission and its counterparts. I am not a lawyer and research, in which I am helped by very busy people, is a struggle, but as far as I can tell, nothing in the Bill would allow those bodies to consult the court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman's latter point is right. He might be right technically—nothing in the Bill will mandate the National Care Standards Commission to talk to local magistrates or the local judiciary—but such a provision is not necessary. There is nothing to stop the commission inspectorate making such contacts if it thinks it right to take that action in relation to a particular inspection. There is nothing to stop the local judiciary expressing its concerns about the performance of a particular local authority to the commission, which would welcome and gratefully receive such information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I welcome the Minister's final point. I am not entirely happy with the matter, but by putting that remark on the record, the Minister has opened up an option for judges to write to the commission. I am sure that they will welcome that chance. I thank him for his reply and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
( ) interview in private the lay visitor adviser appointed by the local authority to any child in care.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Amendment No. 232 concerns situations in which an authorised inspector undertakes an interview in private with an employee of a local authority. We seek to follow the good practice of employment law by which employees are able to take someone with them into an interview that might lead to disciplinary proceedings. That is a good precaution, providing a witness and chaperone if the interviewee is of one sex and the interviewer of the other. That would prevent a situation in which the employee felt intimidated. Being interviewed in private by an inspector from the registration authority could be a charged situation. The interview might include questions seeking information about a failure to comply that could ultimately lead to deregistration, penalties, or, in the worst-case scenario, as we saw in a previous clause, imprisonment. Such interviews are serious. It is important that the employee has the right to take somebody into the interview with them.
<P>
Amendment No. 233 relates to a different type of interview, but one that could, none the less, be important in terms of inspectors carrying out their responsibility to study the work of establishments and, in particular, to follow up concerns that they might have. The amendment would introduce the idea of interviewing in private lay visitors. Lay visitors are not necessarily local authority employees and so would not be caught by subsection (2)(b), which enables the interviewing in private of those people. Lay visitors to such an establishment might have intelligence that would throw light on the question of compliance and on what might have been going wrong there. That would be a helpful addition to the capacity of the inspector to conduct his responsibilities, and to get to the bottom of what is happening, when studying an adoption and fostering service. We hope that the Minister will welcome the suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for introducing the subject. I confirm that we would expect the commission to want to talk to lay visitors in the way in which she described. There is no need specifically to refer to that in the Bill. The commission has a general power to interview, subject to consent, anyone whom it considers relevant. Directions to the commission could set out the need to include independent visitors in that process, but that is not necessary. Interviews with lay visitors should be a standard part of the inspection process. I agree that such interviews should take place, but if we stipulated that in the Bill, we would have to marry the failure to comply with an interview with a specific offence of obstructing the commission. The hon. Lady's amendment would make it an offence for the lay visitor not to agree to be interviewed, but we can achieve the same effect without amending the Bill. We will ensure that lay visitors are included in the inspection process.
<P>
Amendment No. 232 could be unnecessary and unreasonable. Superficially, it seems sensible, but the hon. Lady might have confused two different interview scenarios. The routine interview will take place as part of the standard inspection of premises. It is reasonable to expect the inspectorate to talk to staff and residents or patients as they inspect the home or agency without having to stop and pull back from the conversation if the person says, ``Sorry, but I want someone else to be present.'' The amendment would introduce an unnecessary level of bureaucracy. I am sure that that is not her intention.
<P>
I imagine that the hon. Lady has greater concern about the second type of interview, which is the more serious scenario. That interview would occur when a commission inspector believes that a breach of regulation has occurred or some other offence has been committed by the person he wants to interview. If an inspector believes that an offence might have been committed, he will be required to administer a caution as part of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It is clear in the code of practice for PACE and the legislation that a person who has been cautioned has the right to insist on being accompanied or represented by someone else. The interview would have to be conducted under such circumstances. There is provision for that scenario and the amendment is redundant. As for the more routine interview, the safeguards in amendment No. 232 would be unnecessary and over-bureaucratic and could get in the way of effective and professional discharge of the commission's responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The Minister rightly read my mind. I was thinking about the latter example of a highly charged situation in which something is seriously afoot. The difficulty is that the general power to interview could apply to both situations. It is our job to think about how arrangements will work in extreme circumstances. The Opposition have to test the durability of the Bill and think through situations in which it might be weak. The Minister has satisfied me that employees will be clear about the question of caution. They will not be in a position to incriminate themselves if they are clear that the interview has proceeded to a formal stage at which they are entitled to have a third party present.
<P>
The Minister's explanation of the ability to interview lay visitors is also fine, but the instructions to lay visitors must make it clear that they could have a pivotal role in obtaining information. We do not want to deter people from taking the role of lay visitor because of the threat that not giving an interview might be an offence. That is obviously not the purpose of the amendment.
<P>
I shall withdraw the amendment so long as it is made clear that the role of lay visitors could include, among other things, being interviewed to provide a critical insight into the workings of such establishments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to take the Minister back to our exchange during an intervention a few moments ago. I do not want to labour the point, but it is vital to our understanding of this part of the Bill works. It seems to me that there can be no doubt that the phrase in subsection (l)(b)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>premises which are used . . . by a local authority in its discharge of relevant functions<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
must include the home in which a child in the care of a local authority is put on a fostering placement. The Minister said that he was advised that that was not the case.
<P>
I have watched the Minister often enough to know that, when he prefaces a remark with the words ``I am advised that'', he has at least a scintilla of doubt. I have spent the last few minutes rereading clause 41, and no construction can be made of the provision that would allow me to arrive at the conclusion that a private home used by a local authority for the fostering placement of a child in its care would not be caught by that definition. By what process of reasoning does the Minister conclude that the definition in subsection (l)(b) clearly and unambiguously excludes such premises?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I relayed to the Committee the advice that I was given about the meaning of that provision. The specific explanation that the hon. Gentleman asks me to provide might better be given in writing—I should certainly be happy to do that.
<P>
Our view is based on the intended operation of the clause—on what we had in mind when we constructed it. However, I should make it clear that we shall be setting national minimum required standards for local authority adoption and fostering services. We envisage that the minimum standard for this part of the Bill will be that the homes should be suitable or appropriate—or another similar term. The local authority must clearly be obliged to ensure that its foster care homes are suitable for the purposes of looking after looked-after children. As I said, we envisage that being covered by the national minimum required standards. It is not an unreasonable jump of logic.
<P>
We would probably want local authorities to make it clear to foster carers and potential foster carers that the National Care Standards Commission, when inspecting local authority fostering services, would want to be sure that the national minimum required standards will be met. The commission would then have the opportunity, in conjunction and co-operation with the local authority and the foster carers, to inspect foster carers' homes to ensure compliance with the national minimum required standards for the suitability of the foster care premises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is the Minister telling us that those visits would not be made under the powers given by clause 41?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Our understanding is that clause 41 does not relate directly to private care homes. The hon. Gentleman may be suggesting that there would be no sanction in the event of a local authority not allowing visits to or inspections of foster care homes, but that would not be true. The local authority might have obstructed the work of the commission in relation to the discharge of its statutory responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister may very well be right, but the specific point is whether the inspector who arrives at the private home of a foster carer would knock on the door using the powers given to him under clause 41(2) or under some other power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not think that it would be under clause 41(2), as I said in answer to the intervention of the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman). It is not our understanding that clause 41(1)(b) covers the homes of foster carers. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. I want to make it clear that there might be circumstances in which it would be reasonable to expect the National Care Standards Commission, working with the local authority and foster carers themselves, to visit private foster homes. That provides an important method of ensuring that local authorities comply with any national minimum standards that apply to the suitability of private foster care homes. Most people of good will and common sense would accept that such a provision is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification. He has made it clear that visits to private dwellings, which are being used for the purpose of fostering children in local authority care, will not be carried out under the powers granted by this clause, but that such visits will probably be necessary, and that they will be made under different arrangements. That answers many of our questions because the powers granted to inspectors by clauses 41 and 42 are significant and include the ability to enter premises at any time and to seize documents. The implication of excluding the homes of foster carers from the definition in subsection (l)(b), but making separate arrangements for inspectors to visit those homes, must be that they will have less draconian powers. We have clearly misunderstood or been misadvised about the extent of the definition of premises used by a local authority in its discharge of relevant functions. On any common-sense legal interpretation, that would appear to include the homes of foster carers who look after children who are in local authority care. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that, for the avoidance of doubt and the clarification of ambiguity, he might consider introducing a subsection (l)(c) to make it clear that the reference to premises used by a local authority in the discharge of its relevant functions does not include the private dwelling of a foster carer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am certainly happy to consider doing that if necessary. I confirm that commission inspectors will have no right of entry into private foster care homes under this Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Under this Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Under this clause. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is raising a substantive point, because the clause is part of the Bill.
<P>
Under the Bill, there is no power that gives commission inspectors any right of entry into a private home where a child is being fostered. However, I would not want the Committee to reach the conclusion that a child who is being looked after in a private home will have no proper safeguards or access to welfare, because that is not the case. Under the Children Act 1989, there are extensive powers to ensure that children are not at risk. The hon. Member for Meriden referred to several provisions of the Children Act that would allow a child to be removed from a foster home if he or she was likely to be exposed to any danger.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister referred to the Children Act and to the powers that would allow inspectors to enter a private dwelling house if a child was in danger—
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If I may just finish, then the Minister can explain.
<P>
How does the Minister intend to enforce the national minimum standards that relate to the homes of foster carers if, as he just said, the inspectors will have no power under the Bill to enter such premises?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood my reference to the Children Act. Nothing in that Act gives inspectors who work for the National Care Standards Commission the power to enter. The powers to enter a home and remove a child from danger are essentially the powers given to a constable and are part of the child protection measures in the Children Act.
<P>
The Bill contains provisions to enforce national minimum standards. For example, if a local authority were to obstruct the commission in carrying out its inspection functions, charges could be brought against it, if that was thought to be appropriate. The whole point of the exercise is to allow the commission to decide whether a local authority's fostering and adoption services are adequate. If the commission decides that they are not—a complex range of factors will inform the commission's opinion, possibly including the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman—it will report the fact to the Secretary of State, who will have responsibility for taking any follow-up action. There is no chink in the Bill or drafting defect that will prevent the commission from ensuring that it can exercise its powers effectively and form an appropriate view about local authority standards. The Bill makes ample provision in both those areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry but I must press the Minister because I cannot agree that there is no chink in the Bill. National minimum standards for care homes will be laid down, which will include the minimum sizes of rooms and similar such matters. Inspectors will have the power to enter, get out their tape measures, and report back, but how will they be empowered to ascertain whether national minimum standards have been complied with in the case of premises used by foster carers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks me to talk about a hypothetical, inspection of local authority services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Fine; as long as the hon. Gentleman understands that it is hypothetical. He is asking me to put myself in the position of inspectors who are inspecting all sorts of different homes in different parts of the country. Let us cut to the chase. If a local authority denies inspectors access to private foster care homes and will not facilitate the inspection process, the National Care Standards Commission will be likely to draw only one conclusion.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's understanding of the Bill is correct. It is certainly incorrect to say that the commission would be powerless to draw any inference from the fact that it was not allowed to carry out an inspection of a private foster care home. We must be clear that the agencies to which we are referring are local authorities. Hopefully, no reasonable local authority acting in the best interests of the children in its care will tell the inspection team that it cannot look at any home in which children are placed. That is not a likely scenario.
<P>
We have the opportunity to deal with those issues under the provisions of the Children Act that relate to foster placement. For example, we could use the regulation-making power under that Act to require foster homes to co-operate with the commission, which is similar to the way in which they are currently required to cooperate with local authority services. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to leave the Committee today thinking that we have not considered that issue because it has been carefully considered. We want to ensure that children in foster care placements receive the safeguards and security that a proper system of inspection can guarantee.
<P>
We got into some difficulty this morning because the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Meriden thought that the Bill directly covered the homes of private foster carers. That is not the case, but we are sure that the regulatory arrangements that we have in mind will make it clear that National Care Standards Commission inspectors can take a view on whether it is possible for private homes to comply with the national minimum required standards of adequacy and sufficiency.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I cannot agree with the Minister that the matters have been considered in detail. He appears to be manoeuvring around the problem and trying to find a way of patching up a loophole. Until he came riding in with the idea of Children Act regulations, which seem a bizarre means of trying to make the Bill work properly, he gave the impression that he would rely on contracting arrangements between local authorities and foster carers. He spoke repeatedly about local authorities obstructing the inspectors and finding themselves in trouble. His clear implication was that local authorities had to empower inspectors to enter the private dwellings of foster carers.
<P>
It might be possible to construct a system in which the contract between the local authority and the foster carer contains a provision requiring the latter to open his home at all hours without notice or at specified hours with some notice. If the Minister is happy to use contracting arrangements to enable the inspectors to get to the point at which the care is delivered, why does he not believe that it is necessary to use such arrangements in relation to care homes, for example? Local authorities that place residents in residential care could build into their contracting arrangements a right to inspect the premises or to have them inspected on their behalf at any hour of the day or night.
<P>
According to the argument that the Minister is currently deploying, there is no basis for some of the other clauses. I cannot understand the reason why the inspection arrangements for national minimum standards for foster care homes and the arrangements to ensure compliance with such standards in other areas are so inconsistent. The Minister has not explained that inconsistency, which appears to be a weakness in the Bill's structure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman, whose current position is inconsistent with the views that he expressed earlier. I understood that he wanted to ensure that the private homes used by foster carers were not inspected and registered by the National Care Standards Commission. He is now arguing that they should be inspected and registered by the commission. During debate of the first amendment that was considered, which I moved and which applied to clause 1, we made it clear that we did not want to construct arrangements that could require the private homes of foster carers to be registered directly with the commission and inspected by it. Such arrangements would involve pointless bureaucracy and would not advance the interests that we are all here to pursue.
<P>
I accept that I may be making my point in a cack-handed way and I can see that much of the current argument has evolved during discussion. I must point out, however, that there is a way of developing the work of the National Care Standards Commission in the manner that I have described and that it is consistent with the approach that we have adopted. Fundamentally, the Bill seeks both to regulate and to inspect against a set of national minimum required standards only when it is necessary to do so. We do not feel that it is necessary to register the individual homes of private foster carers and I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman's implication that we should do so. I thought that he was happy with the earlier suggestion that they should not be registered as individual children's homes. The interests and well-being of children can be secured in a variety of ways and through the procedure that I have described. The Children Act contains extensive powers and part III provides, for the first time, powers to regulate and inspect fostering services against a set of clear national minimum required standards, which will include the adequacy of the homes provided by private foster carers. That is the right approach.
<P>
We must balance the need to regulate and to impose burdens, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman would describe it, against finding opportunities to do things differently. I think that we have made the right judgments in drafting the Bill and there is nothing to suggest—if there is something, lurking in the Department, I have not seen it—that there is any proposal for us to regulate and inspect private foster care homes against a discrete set of national minimum standards. No one has put that to us, although the hon. Gentleman suggests that we consider it. He might perceive the balance that we have struck as complicated and inconsistent with other provisions in the Bill, but I do not agree. Our stance is consistent with the rest of the Bill. A line has been drawn in the right place between what we regulate, what we inspect and where national minimum standards are set. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is on to a good innings. He has alerted himself to a problem that I do not see as a problem.
<P>
I do not see that the debate is now serving any useful purpose. I can offer reassurance, to my hon. Friends at least, that our proposals are perfectly consistent and chime perfectly with the Children Act. They do not extend the burden of regulation unnecessarily where it would not be useful. Our measures, together with existing powers, will enable us to ensure that the system works effectively, which is what we shall do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not agree that the debate has served no purpose; it has served two purposes. The Minister has clarified what the Bill does not make clear and has had an opportunity to work out how the provisions will be put into practice. He seems to have evolved his thinking in the past 10 minutes.
<P>
It is not entirely clear to us how the provisions will work, but no doubt it will become clearer when we see draft regulations. As the Minister said, this seems a complex and tortuous way to achieve what is necessary, but I accept that it is difficult to achieve a balance between an excessively intrusive regime and the desire to establish proper safeguards. We shall wait to find out the detail of how the regulations will put the provisions into effect. In the meantime, I urge the Minister to consider the possibility that clarification is needed. The inclusion of foster carers' homes in the definition of premises is not something that we dreamed up. It was based on advice given to us from a reading of the Bill. The Minister may on considering the matter think that it would be useful to clarify it.

Question put and agreed to.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 235, in page 20, line 39, leave out `he considers necessary' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`is reasonable'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Amendment No. 234 is a probing amendment. It would qualify the authorised person's power to require ``facilities and assistance'' from a member of an adoption and fostering service by inserting the word ``reasonably'' before the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>necessary to enable him to exercise his powers under section 41 or this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to know what facilities and assistance would be reasonable.
<P>
Copies of records have been cited as examples of information that an inspector would examine. Indeed, those might need to be taken away, especially if they had initially been on a computer and needed to be reproduced. We want to know whether requiring the person running the adoption or fostering service to do mounds of photocopying for the inspector would be reasonable. We are interested in the question of staff being provided to assist with the inspection. Much of the emphasis of an inspection would be on what was physically provided in an establishment. It would be unreasonable to require too many employees to assist in an inspection if that meant that they were off the job that they were there to do in the first place. The amendment probes the Minister on what would be reasonable assistance of an inspector.
<P>
Amendment No. 235 relates to subsection (2)(b) on the taking of measurements and photographs and the making of recordings. When we debated clause 30(3) we sought reassurance that measurements and photographs could be taken only when reasonable. We seek a repeat of the assurance that the measure would pertain to buildings and that individuals, and certainly not individual children, would not be identified. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) sought that safeguard.
<P>
There have been recent examples of clandestine recordings in health care establishments. In one instance in north Staffordshire, parents under suspicion of harming their children were unaware that recordings were being made. Children appeared in those recordings. We have a real concern; safeguards need to be built in. I hope that the Minister will give the same assurances that he gave under clause 30.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am happy to give the hon. Member for Meriden an indication of the way in which the powers will be used. Local authorities are well used to the social services inspectorate carrying out inspections and to making available facilities and assistance in that regard. They often make available a locked office with desks and telephones when necessary. Authorities also make available information about their policies, procedures and performance indicators, and the files of service users, foster carers and others. They help to arrange interviews with everyone whom the inspectors want to see. They might organise focus groups with young people. The commission inspectors will need such facilities and assistance. I am sure that local authorities will co-operate to ensure that facilities are available.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 235, photographic and recorded evidence from a local authority premises might be required to show whether inappropriate storage facilities for confidential records were provided. We do not need the proposed provision. The commission and its inspectors are under an obligation to act reasonably. It will be possible for us to ensure that that happens, if we need to, through our powers to issue directions. The hon. Lady is right to draw attention to the fact that the powers should be exercised reasonably. They will be, but we are not starting from a zero-sum base position. Substantial practice is already involved in inspections and we would expect that practice to form the basis of the new functions.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I thank the Minister for his examples, which were helpful. Two things must be guarded against in the guidance. The facilities provided and requested must be effective. We know from relatively recent history that inspections have sometimes not unearthed quickly enough what they should have done. That is why, unfortunately, several inquiries have revealed where guidance has been lacking. I take it as read that the Government will have learned from those experiences.
<P>
Safeguards sometimes go too far. The guidance should provide for effective assistance to inspections and not make excessive demands. So long as the guidance sits exactly between the risks—between Scylla and Charybdis—I am satisfied and so beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 239, in page 20, line 40, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A person so authorised who seizes or removes any document or other material or thing in accordance with subsection (1) shall issue a receipt in respect of any items seized and removed.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have discussed the receipt for articles, but I remain convinced that transparency is important documents are removed, especially if that is a prelude to an inquiry. The movement of information and evidence that might be used against individuals who could face a prosecution should be clear. The Minister said in our debate on clause 30 that it would be part of the guidance. Perhaps we should have debated this amendment then, because I should like a similar assurance for this clause. If computer equipment, film evidence, tape recordings or information technology equipment are removed to be used as evidence, there should be clear documentation on who has done what, where it has gone and where it will be kept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady has asked me to repeat the assurance that I gave in our debate on clause 30. I can certainly do that. A receipt will be provided in such circumstances. If it proves necessary, and I do not expect that it will, we will take up powers to issue directions to the commission and require it to be done.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I have received the assurance that I need. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 236, in page 21, line 3, after `functions', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within twenty eight days of the inspection'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to tighten the clause as it relates to the production of a report that is submitted to the registration authority by the inspector. The amendment suggests that a report should be published within 28 days of inspection. A shadow can hang over an establishment if production is delayed. A report will either say that everything is in order and the regulations have been complied with, or that there has been failure to comply and there is a serious shortcoming. The longer the delay, the longer the shadow rests over the inspected establishment. The example was given of an establishment that received 11 inspections in a month. That blight would last until the report was published and it became clear which direction the establishment was taking. The amendment tries to constrain the time that it takes to prepare a report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I think that all would agree that the commission will have to produce its reports as quickly as possible. The hon. Lady referred to a blight hanging over an institution, but the issue of delay goes much wider. It involves the public's right to know about the quality of regulated services. An unreasonable delay in publishing the reports would impede that right to know. The reports need to be published as quickly as possible in the interests of the institution and the public.
<P>
I took the hon. Lady's comments to mean that it is a probing amendment. She is not serious about requiring a report to be produced within 28 days. Instead, she wants the Government to say how the commission will perform its work efficiently, effectively and in the public interest. It might be difficult to comply with a 28-day limit for reasons outside the commission's control. We must focus on ensuring that the commission's reports are produced as quickly as possible. However, some facts might require further verification and checking, which could cause the commission some difficulty.
<P>
Other problems might also arise. Failure to provide the information at the time requested could mean that the commission finds it impossible to meet the 28-day deadline, through no fault of its own. There are ways and means, as we say in this place, of ensuring that the commission performs its functions effectively and efficiently. We will expect it to tell us how it intends to discharge such aspects of its functions and we have power to monitor and enforce those standards. We expect it to work publicly and to communicate clearly to service users and providers on the time scale according to which it would usually expect to produce a report.
<P>
In most cases, the report should be produced within the 28 days to which the hon. Lady referred. It is hard to imagine many circumstances in which a longer delay would be reasonable. Such a delay might sometimes be acceptable, however, which is why the flexibility provided is necessary—although I am sure that the hon. Lady and I are at one about the prompt delivery of reports. We will make certain that the commission ensures that the work is done effectively. We have a range of mechanisms to ensure that that happens—the direction-making power, the annual accountability review and performance management of the commission. We will ensure that the hon. Lady's concerns are addressed as part of that wider process.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> It is clear that the Minister is well intentioned on extracting the report and on making it available for the public interest and for the people who are directly involved. Subsection (4)(b) contains the little phrase ``without delay''. Perhaps that phrase should have been included in paragraph (a), which deals with the sending of a copy of the report to the local authority, to ensure consistency and to avoid misunderstanding. I take on board the Minister's remarks and his assurance that instructions will be given and that a delay should not occur. As I have drawn that confirmation from him, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 237, in page 21, line 4, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) No report prepared in accordance with subsection (4)(a) shall contain any material capable of identifying any individual child'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This simple amendment is designed to elicit from the Minister the same commitment that he gave during discussion of clause 30, when he said that regulations or directions would ensure that any report prepared by the registration authority would not identify, or contain material that could identify, any individual child. I am sure that he will be able to give the same assurance now, although we would have preferred the arrangements to have been included in the Bill. The Health Act 1999 contains similar provision about the non-identification of individuals. I shall be happy to ask leave to withdraw the amendment if the Minister can assure us that such protection will be afforded by direction or regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I can certainly give the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge the assurance that he is seeking and which I gave during discussion of amendment No. 224, which applied to clause 30. If it is necessary to do so, we will not hesitate to use our powers to issue directions to the commission to ensure that inspection reports do not name the people who are receiving services from registered providers or, indeed, inspected bodies, which are covered by part III.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and where the Secretary of State has instructed the Social Services Inspectorate to investigate the performance by the said local authority of its relevant functions and has instructed another local authority to take over the relevant functions of the said local authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to strengthen the action that follows inspection. When I read the clause, I felt that it lacked an element that is included in other legislation but which could be inserted into the Bill to ensure that the people who read it when it is enacted are clear about what action could befall a local authority following inspection. Clause 43 outlines a scenario in which a local authority fails substantially to satisfy the regulatory requirements. Such a failure would be very serious.
<P>
I was a member of the Standing Committee that considered the Bill that became the Local Government Act 1999, and I remember that several sittings were taken up discussing what would happen if a local authority had failed in the exercise of its duties. That Act gives the Government the far-reaching power to direct another local authority to take over the functions of the failing authority. I would like such a provision to be made explicit. The power has been on the statute book for a while, but as far as I am aware it has not yet been exercised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady made a similar point about the Children (Leaving Care) Bill on Second Reading yesterday. Those powers have been available to the Secretary of State for only two months, so it is not entirely surprising that they have not yet been used.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I cannot quite rest comfortably, because I am aware that some local authorities have been failing for some time.
<P>
I seek an assurance that the Minister would use the powers under the Local Government Act to direct an authority to take over another if it was clearly seen to be failing. That is especially important in relation to the functions and services provided to vulnerable adults and children. It is not acceptable to allow a failing local authority to continue inadequately. Making the power explicit would add extra force to the options available to the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not entirely sure what effect the amendment would have. However, I do not want to debate its technical deficiencies. I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw it, and I do not want to prolong the debate by discussing exactly what she had in mind. I believe that she is referring to the best-value powers under the Local Government Act 1999, but that is not clear in the amendment. She may be asking me to say something about the Secretary of State's preparedness, following an adverse report by the National Care Standards Commission, to consider using best-value powers to remove the adoption and fostering service from the local authority. The amendment refers to it being placed with another authority, but the Secretary of State might want to use other options.
<P>
I can give the hon. Lady the assurance that she seeks. If a local authority fails to provide a competent adoption and fostering service, and the welfare and well-being of children is put at risk, it is important that we should use our powers under local government legislation. The hon. Lady will be aware of the protocol between the Government and the Local Government Association on the exercise of best-„value powers. We would expect to use that route, but we have made it clear to local authorities—it is the general understanding—that in serious cases, when the need to take action is imminent, we shall not hesitate to use those powers, especially if it is necessary in order to safeguard the welfare and well-being of children. That, essentially, is the position. We will always take into account the interests and well-being of the children when using best-value powers in that context.
<P>
We have for the first time an opportunity to inspect properly and regularly local authority fostering and adoption services. The social services inspectorate is clearly not able to undertake that function annually, as the National Care Standards Commission will. It is important that the additional inspection function is established and that it works effectively.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The key to the matter, and why part I is different to part II, is that the enforcement responsibility for ensuring that standards are being complied with is the Secretary of State's and not the National Care Standards Commission's. The commission will not have the power to deregister a local authority adoption and fostering service; those services are not required to register in that sense.
<P>
The potential seriousness of a decision to remove from a local authority its function in that area is why we felt it necessary and right in principle for the decision to be the Secretary of State's. The consequences are extremely far reaching, affecting substantially perhaps hundreds of children. There are other considerations, especially in relation to the use of best-value powers.
<P>
If the hon. Lady wants an assurance that we will use our best-value powers if necessary, I give her such an assurance. We will use those powers when necessary to protect the welfare and well-being of children in the event of a local authority failing properly to meet its statutory responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I heard what I wanted from the Minister: he would not hesitate to use his powers under the best-value arrangements, albeit following the LGA's protocol. I was also pleased that he said that he would contemplate outside organisations, many of which have good reputations for taking over adoption and fostering services if a local authority was found to be failing substantially in its provision.
<P>
We are not talking into thin air. The Department's circular of 28 August 1998 observed that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Many local authorities achieve high standards.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a number . . . demonstrate a lack of consistency and co-ordination.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Without doubt, the quality of service provision varies hugely between local authorities. The inspectorate will be studying that matter closely. We are not talking hypothetically but about real disparities between the ways in which local authorities exercise their functions. The capacity to use the powers under best-value is thus important. The Minister has reassured me that he would use those powers in the event of an authority under performing. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 238, in page 22, line 27, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) as to the procedures for verifying the fitness of such persons in accordance with paragraph (a) above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The amendments come back to an earlier discussion about consortiums, which often work locally in the provision of adoption and fostering services. We were concerned that those working in consortiums might be missed out of the loop when an attempt was made to ascertain fitness for work in the delicate area of the exercise of fostering functions. Those people are not local authority employees, but the clause talks specifically about persons checked as fit to work for local authorities. We were not completely certain about the nature of the working relationship between workers of voluntary organisations involved in consortiums and local authorities. They would be working for a local authority, for sure, but would not be employed, paid or answerable to a local authority. We are concerned to ensure that all those who might have contact with vulnerable children through fostering functions be thoroughly checked as fit for such work. That is the amendments' purpose and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Meriden may want to make further comments about her amendments. She seems to have a slight misunderstanding about the consortiums. Her amendments are not strictly necessary.
<P>
There are about 10 consortiums in England, covering about 40 per cent. of local authorities. They are not separate legal entities or legal organisations in the sense that a local authority or a voluntary adoption agency is. As a result, anyone employed in a consortium would have to be working either for a local authority or a voluntary adoption agency. Regulations governing their fitness for the work would therefore already apply. If the hon. Lady were correct in saying that consortiums were separate legal entities employing people directly, her point would be a fair one and there would be a loophole in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> When, later today, we debate provisions on voluntary agencies, I expect that all my concerns will be satisfied. We have tabled amendments to make sure that equally stringent fitness checks will be applied to volunteers as to others working in the relevant settings. At that stage, the two strands will come together. I accept the Minister's explanation on amendment No. 240 and shall seek leave to withdraw it. I wanted also to deal with amendment No. 238, but perhaps I should do so on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Lady is entirely within her rights to speak to amendment No. 238, which was grouped with amendment No. 240. Of course, it has not been moved. The hon. Lady may move it formally if she wants it to be put to a vote, but it is perfectly in order to discuss it now.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I just want to speak to amendment No. 238. I shall not move it formally.
<P>
The amendment deals with what we perceive to be an area of failure at the moment. We want to improve the procedures for verifying the fitness of persons to work with vulnerable individuals. An example of the shortcomings in the system will convey to hon. Members the seriousness of the matter. In a well known case that came to court in Liverpool last year, an employee of Lambeth local authority was found guilty of child abuse. He had managed a children's home in Lambeth and, interestingly enough, applied to be a foster parent in Wandsworth local authority. Wandsworth ran its customary checks and discovered that the applicant had committed sex offences. It informed Lambeth local authority and it was six months before the latter ran any checks of its own. In that time, the individual was allowed to continue to work. When the case came to court in Liverpool, a series of other problems were uncovered.
<P>
That example demonstrates that not all local authorities are as rigorous as they should be in checking the credentials of those who work with vulnerable adults and children. Our amendment is intended to flag up the weakness in the system and to bring about an improvement. It is vital to prevent disasters of the kind that occurred in the Liverpool case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady will be aware that subsection(1)(a) will allow regulations to be made as to the persons who would be fit to work for local authorities in connection with fostering. I reassure her that, as part of that provision, we shall expect local authorities to verify that a relevant person is fit. There would be no point in introducing a regulation relating to fitness for the purpose if we did not also set out some of the steps that the local authority will be required to take to verify fitness. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that her legitimate point about verification will be covered by the regulation-making powers in Subsection (l)(a).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. We just wanted to ensure that the procedures would be followed. Guidance needs to be made trebly clear to local authorities, so that any failing authorities can be picked up. With that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): This is an extremely important clause in an important Bill. The regulations for which it provides have the potential to improve enormously the quality and range of placements that can be offered to looked after children. It is fundamental that the regulations should attend closely to the training, experience and qualifications of foster carers, and should also provide for the proper remuneration of foster carers. The rates that have been recommended by the National Foster Care Association are crucial in that context. I really hope that, in promoting sound models of foster care and good professional practice, the Government will recommend that local authorities employ professional foster carers, who are paid a professional rate for doing a skilled and important job. In that way, those foster carers who attain certain standards and qualifications may be properly remunerated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree with the Government's aspiration, expressed last night on Second Reading of the Children (Leaving Care) Bill, to ensure, as far as possible, that children in care lead lives that simulate those of children who are fortunate enough to live with their natural families? Does he really think that professional foster carers would further the achievement of that objective?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Yes, I do. There is clear evidence that if we want to offer foster care to some of the most needy, demanding and challenging young people, it is inadequate to expect that they can be maintained within a family that is simply remunerated for looking after them. If we really want to extend the range and quality of foster placements, we must train and support foster carers properly, which includes paying them a proper rate for the job. It is completely unrealistic to suggest that we can do otherwise. A large amount of fostering will always be taken up by decent, honest, ordinary families, basically volunteering, but if we really want to develop fostering and ensure that it can meet the needs of the most demanding children, we must pay proper rates and provide appropriate training. There is evidence that if we not prepared to do so, we will not be able to recruit or retain foster carers.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We must recruit more foster carers and rid the service of its Cinderella overtones. We must assess the ability of potential foster carers to do the job efficiently and effectively and we must train and support them well. We should look on foster carers as true partners in the process of bringing up children and listen to what they say because they often know the children for whom they care far better than anyone else. We must also remunerate appropriately those foster carers who have particular skills and qualifications, who are vital to ensuring that the system works well.
<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) because I was about to make exactly the same point. Foster children are not an amorphous mass; they have specific needs and can be extremely challenging. Different skills are required to look after different children. When the Select Committee on Health examined the issue, it was sure that although the majority of children would fit into a normal home atmosphere, others would benefit from a more intensive home situation that could not be supplied by a normal home. Such children often drift into institutional care, which is unnecessary, less desirable and much more expensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman say that he agrees with the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre because I cannot work out the difference between professional foster care and a children's home. Paying professional people to look after children, seems to me to be the same as a children's home. Surely, the essence of fostering is that it simulates normal family life.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is a very good intervention, to which I would welcome the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): Can we agree that, in providing a range of services for young people, some children require specialist foster carers who can prevent that child from moving into a residential setting? Such people require specialist training and might have additional qualifications, so we might need to pay them a bit more. If we put that element with all the best qualities of a foster home, we have the scenario to which my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre was referring.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Whether that constitutes the establishment of a small children's home, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge suggests, is an interesting question because it would be necessary to pay more for such a placement. I would not want to go down that route because that would institutionalise the situation unnecessarily. There must be some halfway house between the two. I look forward to the Minister's response to that interesting question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I had not intended to say anything about the clause because it merely provides the Secretary of State with regulation-making powers. We have had a much wider debate about the importance of foster caring as a service to children. We have also heard the supplementary argument about the professionalism or otherwise of foster carers. 
<P>
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre would accept, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) has done, that we need foster carers in all shapes and sizes. My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford referred to children with special needs who might require the professional support of a foster carer. That is common sense. Children have a variety of needs, some of which are complex and specific, such as multiple disability. I am sure that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would concede that in such cases it would be appropriate to make use of that professionalism.
<P>
Foster carers come from all walks of life. We will organise a major recruitment campaign later this year to get more foster carers into the foster care service. We will make it clear that foster care is a flexible term. For example, it could cover a person who is prepared to provide respite care over a weekend while a child's parents resolve relationship issues or deal with other pressures on the family. All sorts of foster carers are needed. We are taking active steps to recruit more people into the service.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre made a reasonable point on the rates at which foster carers are remunerated. There is common consent that that is of concern. I hope that we can address the issue when we have the benefit of examining the outcome of the current spending review.
<P>
We are working actively with local authorities. We published for the first time last year a set of minimum recommended standards on recruitment, training and support for foster carers for local authorities to work towards. The big issues of policy, practice and resources need to be resolved if we are to ensure that children get the security that they expect from a local authority. They should not be moved from placement to placement, which is too often the experience of many children. We should be able to provide them with a stable family environment, as far as that is possible, within which they can grow up, prosper and thrive. It is also worth bearing in mind that most foster care placements are short term. That is good. It means that families have been reunited, which is a positive result. Some foster placements are for longer, which we need to work with and develop.
<P>
The clause is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre said, important and modest. It provides important new regulatory powers that we intend to use to support the work of the National Care Standards Commission. I hope that there is consensus on it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I have been listening carefully, but the Minister has not said when a foster placement will be more like a placement in a small children's home. Where in regulations will that be set out? Will it be a matter for the commission or the contracting authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We have dealt with that issue. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is still concerned about it. A foster carer's private home will not be treated as a children's home. That was resolved by the first Government amendment that I moved. We do not need to return to that debate. It was a mistake to raise the issue of professionalism in that context.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I was clear that foster placements will not be treated as placements in children's homes, but the way in which the hon. Members for Lancaster and Wyre and for Runnymede and Weybridge described the placement raises the question of who determines when a placement is a foster placement or one for a small children's home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Essentially, that will be a decision for the local authority. We are having this discussion because of a misunderstanding. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre referred to professional foster care. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge thought that my hon. Friend meant that a placement with a foster carer could be converted to a placement in a children's home. That is not the case. The definition of a children's home is clear and we have clarified the situation in relation to the homes of foster carers. The issue is how we treat foster carers. They provide a professional service to children, for which they need to be properly trained and managed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am not trying to prolong the debate, but trying to answer my own question. The Minister correctly interpreted the concern that I expressed in my intervention. Would the distinction be that a foster carer takes on 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week responsibility for a child? I intervened on the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre because when he spoke about professional foster carers I had in mind people who were working normal hours. It may be a simple misunderstanding.

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I think that there is a misunderstanding. It was nice of the hon. Gentleman to answer his question, as it will save me a lot of time and effort. A concordat to that effect would be a good way to ensure that we make progress.
<P>
The definitions are clearly spelled out. There are many sorts of fostering placements; it would be wrong to assume that every foster care placement involves care for 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Some placements are for the weekends only or for those days in the week when the natural parents or those with parental responsibility are not able to look after the child. The definition of children's homes—foster homes have been excluded from that definition—was dealt with satisfactorily in earlier debates. I am sure that there will be no confusion about when a home is a children's home and when it should be treated as a foster care home. That is straightforward, and I hope that we have resolved it satisfactorily.

(b) any other matter connected with the provision in England of Part III services.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would insert similar words to those found in clause 7(5)(a), but appropriately modified. It would allow the commission to act as a watchdog, to adopt a strategic monitoring role, and to report to the Secretary of State if changes need to be made to the national minimum standards in order to secure improvements in the quality of part III services provided in England.
<P>
We would prefer such reports to be published. The gap between identified needs and the Government's willingness or ability to meet them would therefore be clear for everyone to see, and the report could be openly debated. The Minister made it clear in earlier debates that the Government would set their face against that, and that they do not support that view. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that he would not have a problem with the commission so reporting to the Secretary of State to secure improvements in the quality of part III services and, accordingly, that he has no objection in principle to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I certainly accept the hon. Gentleman's argument. I tried to find a way to accept the wording of the amendment, because it would save a lot of time. Sadly, I cannot because there is no definition of part III services. One will certainly be needed if the commission is to advise the Secretary of State on how changes to the standards might improve the quality of the services. I accept the hon. Gentleman's argument and confirm that the Government accept the amendment in principle. If he is patient, we shall table a suitable amendment to give effect to what he has asked us to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I wondered whether, by lifting the precise words from clause 7, I might avoid falling foul of technical deficiencies. I had rather assumed that part III services were self defined as services provided under part III, but that is far too straightforward for the legal process to accommodate. Although the amendment may be technically deficient, I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the principle. I look forward to seeing his amendment on Report.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 242, in page 22, line 40, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The regulations under subsection (1) may require the annual return to include an up-to-date list of qualified potential adoptive parents according to criteria set by the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With this relatively small amendment, we are trying hard to persuade the Minister to bring about a significant change. A new situation is created by the requirement on every local authority to make an annual return to the registration authority. It would be possible to establish a national register for adoption as part of that process. By giving the Secretary of State the power to establish a set of national criteria for prospective adoptive parents, on which they would qualify or fail, we could remove at a stroke the considerable inconsistencies between locally set criteria, which are sometimes the cause of great heartbreak to couples seeking to adopt. For example, the maximum age at which a parent can adopt can cause great heartbreak if a couple find that they would be eligible if they moved to a neighbouring authority. Perverse criteria are sometimes set that preclude couples from being able to adopt.
<P>
Two tools—the establishment of a national register of qualified adoptive parents, and a national set of criteria for adoption—would be powerful new instruments and would improve substantially the situation under adoption law. It is no secret that, in 1996, the previous Government sought formal reform of adoption law. The Government are minded, through the deliberations of the Prime Minister, to bring about such a reform, although my information is that that would not be before 2003. Here is an opportunity in 2000 to do something about a situation that, it is generally agreed, needs substantial improvement.
<P>
It is lamentable that less than 4 per cent. of children in care are adopted. Of the 54,000 children in care, 46,000 have been there for six months or more. Adoption from care is fraught with delays and discrepancies. The situation could be improved by giving the registration authority information through the annual return on where the vast bulk of qualified adoptive parents are available and by the Secretary of State introducing transparent, across-the-board criteria that would apply from the top of the country to the bottom. That would help to remove the anomalies of political correctness. I am sure that there is not a member of the Committee who has not been visited by prospective adoptive parents complaining about their experience of trying to adopt, about the barriers put in their path or about the criteria that seem unique to their particular local authority and have denied them their heart's desire of adopting a child.
<P>
We realise that such a change would be far reaching but hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the intention and will see the potential for establishing and regularly updating a list of qualified adoptive parents by the process of an annual return. That would get the adoption situation moving, and that needs to happen. The Secretary of State is uniquely well placed to establish the criteria. They could be the subject of a parliamentary debate so that there was support for a sensible set of criteria on which the qualifications for adoptive parents could be based. That would remove a great deal of the present heartbreak. We hope that the Minister will take the proposal in the constructive spirit in which it is made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I am sorry that I missed most of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden. We had progressed further than I had realised. The Minister will not be surprised to hear that I strongly support the amendment. I shall make only three points, as I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden, who has a considerable knowledge of the subject, has already made a powerful case.
<P>
First, the existing forms are, de facto, very nearly national. There is no statutory requirement for any adoption agency—whether it is in the local authority sector or the voluntary sector—to use the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering forms. However, the vast majority of agencies do use these forms, which have become the standard. In my view and that of many adoptive parents or prospective adoptive parents, the form is extremely unsatisfactory. The director of BAAF and I have had friendly discussions and arguments about the form's contents in both public and private forums. It is being reviewed, but I am sorry to say that the word on the street is that it will become longer rather than shorter.
<P>
You would restrain me, Mr. Gale, if I were to speak about the form in too much detail. However, it is worth pointing out that only one aspect of a national register should have a lot of detail and that other aspects should have a great deal less. Detail is needed in ensuring proper checks in the vetting of prospective adoptive parents. The referees section of the current form, which in many ways is the most important check, contains no reference whatever to obtaining referees for partners of single prospective adopters. Admittedly, such people form only 5 per cent. of the total number of adopters, but they are none the less significant. Almost all single adopters are women and overwhelming evidence shows that abusers, who are nearly always men, are, if anything, more likely to be abusers if they are not married. In the light of that fact, it is extraordinary that the lengthy, detailed and intrusive form contains such a large hole. A national system already exists, but it has no statutory backing and is, in my view, unsatisfactory. Felicity Collier and BAAF are considering the form and they have taken the trouble to come to Parliament and to hear hon. Members' views. Once again, I see that the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre, who was part of the conversation with them, is present. I hope that they will take some of our views on board. In arguing for the adoption of a national register, I find myself in the unusual position of calling for the nationalisation of something that already is national, although Parliament has no say about its organisation.
<P>
My second point concerns the gap between the de facto situation and the situation as it is perceived. Currently, couples or individuals who are seeking to adopt a child can go to a local authority anywhere in the country. Unfortunately, however, the vast majority of adoptive parents and prospective adoptive parents do not know about that elementary fact and nobody informs them of it. Most potential adoptive parents who go along to their local authorities have interviews in which nobody tells them that they can go down the street and talk to another local authority if they are having difficulties with their own.
<P>
Over the years, I have corresponded with and spoken to many deeply unhappy prospective parents who have had terrible experiences with local authorities. Two particular cases remain in mind, in which the adoptive parents went down the road to another local authority. In one case, two lovely children have been adopted. In the second case, a child is close to being adopted, but through another agency. The people in both cases said, ``If we had had any idea earlier in the process that we could have stopped dealing with these wretched people, who kept on asking us more intrusive and unreasonable questions, we would not have wasted all that time and heartache with the first authority.'' None of the questions to which they referred had anything to do with police checking and abuse, or with any of the filters that I mentioned earlier. Surely it is obvious that a national register would deal with that problem.
<P>
My third point is obvious and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden has already spoken about it. The process would be made more efficient by the establishment of a national register. We saw the other day that 1,300 couples are sitting in the system on various local authority lists. Why should not that information be held on a national list? I am sure that more than 1,300 people would be on that list if national criteria were in place. Many suitable parents who have been rejected for one petty reason or another by the more difficult local authorities would find their way on to a national list.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I agree with what the hon. Gentleman says. Does he agree that BAAF has made a major contribution to ensuring that people who are approved as adoptive parents are given opportunities to adopt children throughout the country by running the publication ``Be my Parent''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have traded some fairly strong words with BAAF over the years. From memory, I think that Felicity Collier took over as director of the organisation about four years ago. Although I disagree with her on the matters that I have mentioned, I pay tribute to her efforts to spread publicity and to distribute it nationally. Indeed, I have spoken up in the press in favour of a television campaign that she played a significant role in initiating. Although others argued that there was an emotional price for the children concerned, the campaign struck me as constructive and it has borne significant fruit.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Some moments ago, the hon. Gentleman said that I would rule him out of order if he strayed too far into these matters. I know that the Committee appreciates the hon. Gentleman's concerns, but I have read and reread the amendment and the clause and I cannot see any reference to a national register. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to return to the arguments that are contained in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I had almost completed my remarks. I and other hon. Members would welcome any move that the Minister can make to improve the spreading of information and practice on a national basis.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> We have had a valuable debate and I listened to your ruling on it, Mr. Gale. The proposal of an up-to-date list of qualified potential adoptive parents that is drawn up according to criteria that are set by the Secretary of State spells out the need for consistent national criteria for approval as an adoptive parent. I hope that those criteria will be produced and that they will be rigorous and consistent. I am worried by the shopping around of prospective adoptive parents. It is one thing being a potential adoptive parent, but the second hurdle is being accepted as a parent for the adopted child. The amendment is an enabling proposal for the Minister, as it would allow him to ensure that a list is published. If it would advance some of the discussions that are currently under way, I would welcome it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> As you rightly said, Mr. Gale, the amendment could enable requirement by regulation of inclusion in the annual return provided by the National Care Standards Commission of an up-to-date list of qualified potential adoptive parents. I understood that the hon. Member for Meriden was seeking to establish something that could loosely be called a national register of adoptive parents. I do not want to labour the point, but the amendment would allow a national list of qualified potential adoptive parents to be published.
<P>
I was delighted that the hon. Member for Canterbury finally came out of the closet and revealed himself as a socialist. That was good news for Labour Members. He is—I think—welcome to join us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I thought that socialism was forbidden in the new model Labour party.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We had better move on. I think that that debate would be out of order. I have never seen a comprehensive definition of socialism, but it is certainly not in the amendment.
<P>
I have some specific points to make on the amendment before addressing the wider concerns. It is important that we are clear about the purpose of clause 46, which relates to local authority services. The amendment would not cover prospective adopters who were approved by voluntary adoption agencies. It is questionable whether the list would be truly comprehensive.
<P>
There are other problems with the amendment and the route that it would take. The hon. Member for Meriden wants the initiative implemented quickly. As the National Care Standards Commission will not be established until April 2002, the first annual report will not be until 2003. The first sight of the national list would be three years from now. That is a long time to wait for it to come into effect. I am not sure that we would want to wait that long. The amendment would also tie the updating of a list to an annual cycle. Why would we want to do that? If we want the benefits of a national register to be available to local authorities and children, we would not want to restrict its updating to an annual process which would delay and restrict its efficacy unnecessarily.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is considering whether there should be a national register as part of the review into adoption practices that was undertaken in the spring. He will make the Government's proposed action clear next month. The idea of a national register has been around for some time. There are strong arguments in favour of such a register and there is a debate on whether it would be an effective way of speeding up the process of matching children with adoptive parents, which is what we want to achieve. The focus of the review has been to answer two questions: first, is it possible to ensure that more children can be adopted from care—I think the answer is yes—and, secondly, what are the precise measures to bring that about?
<P>
I can tell the hon. Member for Meriden that a national register is being considered as part of the review. The Government's position on that will be made clear in the near future. I do not disagree with her about the benefits that could accrue. They have been clearly spelled out, but for the three or four reasons that I have given, it is the wrong way to proceed. If we built in unnecessary delay, the national register would not be comprehensive enough. As I said, the report would not be available for at least three years. If we decide to have a national register, we would want to introduce it slightly quicker than she proposes.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The bit that really encourages me is that the Minister is not hostile to the idea of a national register—indeed, quite the reverse; he seems to want to proceed more quickly. The amendment was the only way we could squeeze the idea into current legislative proposals. I confess to the weaknesses in the proposal, but it brought an interesting response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady is right on one level. The Bill presents a possible legislative opportunity to introduce a national register. However, we might not need a legislative framework if we decide to develop a national register. She can be assured that there will be an opportunity to introduce a national register, if that is what we decide to do, but on a slightly quicker time scale.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> It is getting better and better. We might not have to wait for an unwieldy legislative process. We hope that the Prime Minister will come down on that side next month.
<P>
The Minister did not mention nationally set criteria, but I hope that it will be part and parcel of establishing a national register—one should flow from the other. The Government seem to have a sense of urgency in bringing about the aims that I tried to articulate of removing those inconsistencies and getting things moving. The debate has therefore served a useful purpose. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

(c) the earliest practical registration of all social care workers'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to tease from the Minister a timetable for the registration of social care workers. It is obviously of great concern, not only to the people being cared for but to the carers. They should have some idea of the time scale of what, to some, will be a challenging and threatening situation. Many people are used to being registered, but others find the concept of having to undergo special training, and perhaps passing tests, somewhat of a challenge. It would help if the Minister could give us an idea of the timetable, which must, by now, be firmly fixed in his mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful again to the hon. Gentleman for allowing a short debate about an important matter. He will know that the social care work force is about 1 million strong and that registering everyone will be a major task. As a new body, the General Social Care Council will need to approach it a step at a time. We expect the council to go about its job as quickly as possible, representing and reflecting the priorities that we have set. Registration in England will be based on qualification but, as hon. Members have repeatedly said, only about 20 per cent. of the current social care work force have recognisable qualifications. Therefore, about 80 per cent. of the work force have no readily available basis for registration. Training and qualification levels will need to be greatly increased before registration can progress.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would like to know how we intend to proceed. Most professional social workers are qualified, and they will be registered first. Another priority is to train residential child care staff to train for NVQ level 3, which we shall fund. We intend to start registration of that category of workers in 2002. Managers of care homes are another priority. We want to start the process of registering those important groups of workers at the earliest possible date.
<P>
The wider issue of training the social care work force is being addressed in a number of ways. We have the benefit of the draft training strategy, produced by the national training organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister talks about managers of care homes, but there were two definitions in the Bill—managers of care homes and people carrying on a care home. Does he envisage at least one person being registered in respect of each care home that does not have a manager as defined in the Bill, who would be the person carrying on the care home?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> There will almost certainly be a manager in every case.
<P>
It being twenty-four minutes past Eleven o clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
