Mark Hoban to open the
questions.</div><a name="091208118000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5757</b><a name="091208118000405"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): This morning we spent quite a
lot of time talking about financial stability, and reflected on the
fact that under the Banking Act 2009, the Bank of England was given the
objective of financial stability. Under the Financial Services Bill,
the FSA would be given the same objective. Will either John or Andrew
say who they believe is responsible for financial stability? Who would
take the lead role?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div><a name="091208118000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="091208118000406"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Mudie</b> (Leeds, East) (Lab): It is the one who speaks
first.</div><a name="091208118000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> That is exactly what we were thinking. So
Andrew will
speak.</div><a name="091208118000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> I think it will inevitably be a joint
enterprise between the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA. Each of us has
different levers available to us to take action in support of the
financial stability objective. The aim of the Council for Financial
Stability is to enable effective co-ordination of the different action
by the different
authorities.</div><a name="091208118000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> I absolutely agree with that. The aim of the
Council for Financial Stability is to co-ordinate and bring some
clarity to the questions that have been asked about the combined roles
of the Bank, the FSA and the Treasury. We both prospectively will have
an obligation that refers to financial stability. The Bank&#146;s
obligation is to contribute to the maintenance of financial stability.
With the powers that we have, &#147;contribute to&#148; is what we
can do. We cannot, on our own, deliver financial stability. It has to
be a co-operative effort, and that is what the council and the
co-operation between the FSA, the Bank and the Treasury is intended to
achieve.</div>
<a name="091208118000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000407"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But is there not a risk that we are no further
forward with the new council than when we had the standing committee?
In that committee, no one seemed to have formal responsibility for
financial stability. Now, it appears that everyone has formal
responsibility. How will the new arrangements make it better and more
effective?</div><a name="091208118000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> I think it becomes clearer the more we
explain how we can bring our individual powers and contributions to
bear. Clearly, the FSA has the actual statutory responsibility for
regulating the vast swathe of financial institutions in this country.
We are involved in providing liquidity insurance, oversight of payment
systems on a statutory basis, and what the Governor has referred to as
the funerals&#151;the resolution authority&#151;in the event of a
bank failing or coming close to failure. The Treasury in turn has it
own powers and responsibilities. I do not think you can say that a
single person can bring together all those powers and co-ordinate them,
but the council itself can, which is the intention of clause
1.</div>
<a name="091208118000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> May I add to that? We, for our part,
recognise that our role in relation to financial stability is, in some
senses, a secondary one to the other authorities. If there were to be a
disagreement as to what would be needed for financial stability, it is
inconceivable that we would wish to second-guess the views of the other
authorities in that respect. Our role is to contribute, but not
primarily to lead the development of a financial stability
strategy.</div><a name="091208118000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000408"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Whose responsibility is it to lead the development
of that strategy? If you are taking a secondary role, is it therefore
the Bank or the
Treasury?</div><a name="091208118000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> Each of us is required to produce a
strategy. Under the Bill, the FSA is required to produce and deliver a
strategy, to agree it with the Treasury and discuss it with the Council
for Financial Stability in relation to its financial stability
objective. That reflects the powers of the FSA and how the FSA will
contribute. The Bank has already been asked under the Banking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>Act 2009 to deliver, and consulting the Treasury, the court to agree, a
strategy for the Bank itself to contribute to financial stability,
using its own
powers.</div><a name="091208118000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">All of us
have to go through the process, first, to find what we mean by
financial stability, which is often a debated subject and which we take
to mean ensuring that the financial system contributes effectively
and in a consistent and resilient way to the intermediation
between savers and borrowers and in markets. We develop policies using
our powers to help to ensure that, but contributing is what the Bank
can do through its own measures. The co-ordination&#151;overall
responsibility&#151;must lie with the council, as it has in the past
when people have brought their powers together in the standing
committee under the tripartite
arrangements.</div><a name="091208118000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000409"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Most commentators would say that the tripartite
committee did not work very effectively. What guarantee is there that
the new council will work more effectively, given that you, John, seem
to be saying that the Bank makes a contribution and that Andrew is
saying that the FSA has a secondary role? I am not clear that we are
moving to a better place as a consequence of that in terms of
clarifying who actually takes the lead on these
matters.</div><a name="091208118000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> There will be more clarity about how the
council works. If it has not already, the Treasury will publish a
statement that will constitute its terms of reference and the way in
which it operates. There will be transparency about at least some of
its proceedings where confidentiality does not get in the way. There
will be more accountability in the sense that people will see more of
what is happening in the council than was the case in a standing
committee, and that brings its own
discipline.</div><a name="091208118000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000410"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not sure that I am yet persuaded of
that.</div><a name="091208118000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> I think that I am suggesting that it would
be better&#151;if not necessarily a
guarantee.</div><a name="091208118000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000411"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Do you think that there is someone who is first
among equals in the three-way
committee?</div><a name="091208118000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> The obvious answer is that only one person
in that committee is directly accountable to Parliament, and that is
the
Chancellor.</div><a name="091208118000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><a name="091208118000412"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): There seems to be
a surfeit of strategies and a deficit of responsibilities, but we
remain to be convinced&#151;we may well be in the fullness of
time&#151;about the practicality of the new tripartite. When the
Treasury Committee was in Europe last week, we interviewed at least one
financial stability committee, which had agreed that the governor of
the Central Bank would chair the tripartite. Why do you think that the
Chancellor should be the one to be the chair?</div>
<a name="091208118000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> If I may chip in, the obvious reason is
that, as we have seen over the past couple of years, the kinds of
issues that are at stake in relation to financial stability are ones
that affect the economy of the country as a whole, both in terms of the
impact on the real economy and the fiscal impact of any rescue package.
That overriding stakeholder interest of the Government and the
Chancellor is one that fully justifies that role in the
tripartite.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="091208118000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000413"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I think that I accept that. What additional
information or macro-prudential tools will be available to the new
council that was not available to the old
tripartite?</div><a name="091208118000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> There has been a debate to which the FSA and
the Bank have both now contributed&#151;through the Turner report and
the Bank&#146;s paper on macro-prudential supervision&#151;on the
macro-prudential tools and the possible uses of alternative ways of
influencing macro-prudential policy. However, we are still at the stage
of thinking about the kinds of tools that would be used. The ones
identified so far are essentially tools that are wielded by what you
might call the micro-prudential regulators but used for slightly
different purposes&#151;for leaning against the credit cycle, as some
people would put
it.</div><a name="091208118000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> My take is that the tricky issue is not
lack of information or risk assessment, it is deciding how much
importance to place on a range of different risks, all of which may be
huge and unquantifiable in terms of potential impact and likely
incidence, and deciding against that background of a range of risks
across the globe what action, if any, should be taken by the different
members of the
grouping.</div><a name="091208118000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000414"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> So, it is not a lack of information, it is not a
lack of risk assessment, it is a lack of
action.</div><a name="091208118000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> I would say that it is the inevitable
difficulty in deciding what action if any to take when you have a range
of different risks, any one of which may prove to be either highly
significant or completely
illusory.</div><a name="091208118000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000415"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Do you accept that the tripartite partners come
from three very different spheres: one is a regulator, one a central
bank and one a politician. What is the likelihood that they will always
agree?</div><a name="091208118000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> It is positively helpful that each comes
from a different sphere of responsibility and area of interest. We as a
regulator have our regulatory responsibilities and, hopefully, insights
into how the industry operates. The Bank has its wider economic
standing and the Chancellor brings to the picture a sense of the
politics of what is acceptable and the intergovernmental side. They
have a common interest in the new council in producing the right
outcome. Actually, that diversity of opinion and communality of
interest ought to provide a good
result.</div><a name="091208118000048"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091208118000416"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> How do you see the Council for Financial Stability
working with the Monetary Policy
Committee?</div><a name="091208118000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> They have different objectives. The Monetary
Policy Committee is focused on monetary stability&#151;currently an
inflation objective set for it by the Chancellor&#151;and it uses
tools, essentially the interest rate tool but more recently
quantitative tools, in order to achieve that. The Council for Financial
Stability is addressing a completely different question. The objectives
are related in the sense that financial instability makes it less easy
to manage a monetary policy, but they are different and it would be
quite wrong to confuse how the tools were used and the
objectives.</div>
<a name="091208118000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091208118000417"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> So, those two organisations will work entirely
independently of each other in a silo mentality.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div><a name="091208118000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> They do not work in a silo mentality. The
Monetary Policy Committee, after all, has a Treasury observer present
on it, and so does the Bank&#146;s financial stability committee. The
attention of the Treasury observer is principally, apart from informing
the Treasury, to enable the Treasury to inform the Monetary Policy
Committee about fiscal policy. When the committee was first formed,
there was a question about how fiscal policy and monetary policy were
to co-ordinate. Clearly the principals&#151;the Chancellor, the
Governor, the chairman of the FSA&#151;are involved in at least two
if not three of the different functions: fiscal, monetary and financial
stability. The council is bringing together the people who take the
decisions across the whole range of monetary and financial
policy.</div><a name="091208118000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><a name="091208118000418"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): The FSA currently has
responsibility for financial education. The Bill sets up the consumer
financial education body&#151;although I am sure that will not be its
title eventually. Will that mean that the FSA will cease to have a
responsibility for financial education? The relationship that the FSA
will have with the new body is not entirely clear, since the FSA has
responsibility for setting it up.</div>
<a name="091208118000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> Thank you for asking that question. I
think that you are right that one continuing relationship and role in
relation to financial education will be through our involvement in the
governance mechanisms for that new body. It is also the case that,
inevitably, from time to time we may come across particular issues as a
regulator that we think need to be publicly known. For example, a
number of years ago we warned about the dangers involved in precipice
bonds and it is conceivable that there may still be issues of that kind
to which we will want to alert the public directly. I am clear that it
is designed to be a single financial education body, just as we are
designed to be a single regulator. We will hand over our financial
education work lock, stock and barrel to the new
body.</div>

described as being based on that used for the Financial Ombudsman
Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, both of which
are represented at the table today.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000420"></a>Mr.

the kind of people or bodies that would be represented on the body and
what responsibility they may have within it.</div>
<a name="091208118000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alex
Kuczynski:</b></i> I can only speak for the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme. In terms of our present governance and
accountability arrangements, we are established under the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000. There is a scheme manager. We are a
limited company, limited by guarantee. We have a combination of
executive and non-executive directors. The
non-executive directors are public interest appointments. They are not
appointed to represent particular constituencies or interests. We are
accountable to the FSA in our operations. We provide annual reports and
other
reporting&#151;</div><a name="091208118000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000421"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> So there is an accountability link.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div><a name="091208118000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alex
Kuczynski:</b></i> There is, but the decision-making is
independent, so operationally we are independent from, but accountable
to, the
FSA.</div><a name="091208118000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Thomas:</b></i> The position in the Financial Ombudsman
Service is similar but not identical. The Financial Services Authority
appoints our directors, an annual report is made to it and it also
approves our budget. We are slightly unusual in that we are a
quasi-judicial body. The ombudsmen are deciding cases and are,
therefore, not members of the board.</div>
<a name="091208118000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000422"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> That line of questioning has not left me a huge
amount the wiser. Where does budget setting lie within the new body. We
heard about one model there. Would it lie with the FSA? Where would it
lie?</div>
<a name="091208118000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> May I suggest that we write to you on that
specific point? As we speak, I notice that schedule 1, paragraph 7
indicates that the body is to adopt its own annual budget, which the
FSA is to approve.</div>
<a name="091208118000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000423"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> So it is approved by the FSA. On the appointment
process, we have a model in which the appointment is through the FSA
and a model in which it is through, presumably, public advertisement.
Which model will be followed?</div>
<a name="091208118000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> The model is set out in the schedule to
which I directed your attention a moment ago. Paragraph 2
states that the members of the board are to be appointed by and liable
to removal by the
FSA.</div><a name="091208118000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000424"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> So the FSA still has a pretty active role in this.
You distanced yourself somewhat on the first question, but you are
firmly stuck into it by appointing the people and setting its
budget.</div>
<a name="091208118000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> We have roles in relation to the body in
appointing its board and in approving its budget. That is the same for
the other organisations represented here, but they operate
independently, and it is my expectation that it will be the same in
relation to this case. They are not appointed as representatives of the
FSA; they are appointed according to paragraph 2(3) on terms designed
to secure their independence from the
FSA.</div><a name="091208118000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alex

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000425"></a>Mr.

that passed through to this body?</div>

two sources of funding set out in the Bill. One source would be levies

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000428"></a>Mr.

draw into this body, bearing in mind that there are many&#151;and I
am one of them&#151;who would criticise the FSA for how it has been
carrying out this function on its

likely to appear self-evident. We will be looking for people in whom we
have confidence from a variety of different areas of expertise and who
will be able to deliver the operational objectives of the new

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091208118000429"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000430"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Talking to the Financial Ombudsman Services and the
FSCS, the FSA has power of appointment and you produce an annual report
to it. How much involvement in practice does the FSA have in your
day-to-day activities? Presumably, as a quasi-judicial body, the FOS
has very little input from the FSA in its day-to-day activities. Does
that also apply to the
FSCS?</div><a name="091208118000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Thomas:</b></i> That is certainly correct in the case of the
ombudsman service. Board members are appointed by the FSA on terms
required to secure their independence. The ombudsmen are appointed by
the FOS board on terms to secure their independence, so there are two
levels there before you get to assigned
cases.</div><a name="091208118000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alex
Kuczynski:</b></i> Yes, a similar structure applies to FSCS.
The directors are appointed on terms that secure their independence
operationally from the FSA. Decision-making on claims for compensation
is independent of the FSA but we do work closely with the FSA on issues
of common interest. On the development of policy, there is a memorandum
of understanding with the FSA. We do work closely with it but not in
terms of making decisions for
us.</div><a name="091208118000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000431"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Mr. Whittaker, do you envisage that the

consumer
body?</div><a name="091208118000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew

80</b><a name="091208118000432"></a><b class="B">John</b><b class="B">
</b><b class="B">Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): Before going on to some
general consumer protection issues, I want to pick up a couple of
points on the consumer financial education body. Do you not see a
conflict between what the body might want to say about financial
dealing and the duties it has in the Bill to maintain stability and
confidence in UK financial markets? Does it go into this with its hands
tied?</div><a name="091208118000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> That is probably for me to
answer. The essence of what people will gain from having an independent
body of this kind is confidence in its independence. I expect that
there would only be very rare occasions when the advice that it might
be inclined to give could threaten financial stability. You might
imagine, for example, that if it were worried&#151;as people were a
couple of years ago&#151;about the financial position of Northern
Rock, it would think twice about advising consumers to pull out their
money, because of its obligation to take into account the impact on
financial stability. I imagine that that kind of situation would be
very rare indeed.</div>

</b><b class="B">Howell:</b> There is a question that follows on from
that. We have the details of the consumer financial education body, but
the one thing we do not have is an idea of what success would look like
for that body. Do you have a view of what that would
be?</div><a name="091208118000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> I think that success in
relation to consumer financial education, as we see it, will inevitably
be something that is measurable primarily over longer periods. We did a
baseline survey in March 2006 on the financial education position of
the community at large at that time. We envisaged that making
significant inroads into that could perhaps take a considerable number
of years as people gradually became more aware of financial issues. I
do not think there is any quick and easy way to measure the success of
the body. We envisaged when we did that baseline survey in 2006 that
perhaps after five, 10 or 15 years people would do a similar survey and
try to get an impression of what had changed against that base line.
Certainly, we envisaged it as being something where the real fruits
would be measurable only after a period of
years.</div><a name="091208118000086"></a>

</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> I think that you would
probably be aware that we aim in the interim to measure the immediate
deliverables of the body so that a particular task that it is
undertaking, such as the pathfinder project, will be independently
assessed by experts in the area. There are some measures. One is always
slightly sceptical about measures of this kind in terms of penetration
of schools with consumer education information. Those are perhaps
secondary measures, but they are in an environment where what we are
trying to measure ultimately can only be measured over a relatively
long period. They are a substitute for the wing and a prayer that you
envisage
here.</div><a name="091208118000088"></a>

have submitted evidence is that there may be a difficulty in ensuring
that decisions are made only on consumer protection grounds. Is this a
concern and how will you deal with it to make sure they are so

</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> There are two sets of
provisions on consumer redress in the Bill. One is about collective
proceedings, which obviously involve a court-based process, and the
other, which I think is the one you are primarily focused on, would
involve a quasi-legislative process. This is a process that would be
undertaken by rules. There would be a process of public consultation on
those rules. We would be bound by the statutory objectives in the Bill
in setting those rules. There are also a number of specific
requirements about the approach that rules are to take, for example, on
the extent to which they need to mirror what the courts would decide.
However, inevitably, there will be judgments about the way in which
those rules are formulated. I recognise that those judgments will leave
some people saying, &#147;I would have got more if you&#146;d taken
a different
judgment.&#148;</div><a name="091208118000090"></a>

of complaints, particularly in the evidence submitted for Second
Reading about the

</b><b class="B">Hoban:</b> May I pursue the issue of the consumer
redress scheme? There are already plans in section 104 of FSMA for
similar arrangements. Why are you seeking the removal of those powers

</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> As you say, there are
provisions in section 404 of FSMA on this subject, but those powers
have never been exercised. They involve quite a complex process of an
assessment by the FSA, a report to the Treasury, and then a
parliamentary process. This is a more direct process involving standard
rule-making by the FSA. We think that it will be speedier and more
flexible than the process that is currently in the
legislation.</div><a name="091208118000094"></a>

</b><b class="B">Hoban:</b> In section 404(1)(b), it appears that there
does not have to be legal action or a court case as a prelude to
setting up this consumer redress scheme. How are you going to ensure

identify that, in some of these cases, powerful interests will want to
be able to challenge an approach that we would take that could involve
them paying out large sums of money by way of consumer redress. We are
required by this legislation to track what we think a court would be
likely to decide. It would be possible to have a judicial review by any
affected party on the basis that we had misdirected ourselves about
what a court would be likely to decide. That will be quite a high
hurdle for us to get over, and we will need to do our best to do
so.</div><a name="091208118000096"></a>

go through will be a different one from that which is used in court
proceedings, where interested parties are represented by counsel acting
in court, and there are a number of appeal mechanisms. In our case, we
would have a legislative process, cost-benefit analysis, formal
consultation and the scope for judicial review&#151;a judicial review
that could be an appeal. That is different from a court process, and it
is potentially contentious. We believe that it offers an alternative
method of resolution that could be speedier and more efficient than a
court process. It is also worth saying that a process of this kind
could be useful after a court decision. If you envisage that the
Supreme Court had decided the other way in relation to bank charges,
you could still envisage that a process of this kind would be useful as
a mechanism for organising the repayment or the
redress.</div>

</b><b class="B">Hoban:</b> Mr. Thomas, presumably this would
actually reduce the workload of the Financial Ombudsman Service, which
at the moment seems to be the point of contact for most consumers when
there is a systemic issue such as mortgage endowments or mis-selling?
Are you content for this responsibility to pass to the

</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Thomas:</b></i> I am not sure that we see it as
responsibility-passing. When FSMA talks about the ombudsman, the
language is very much about doing what is appropriate in the
circumstances of the individual case, and the whole design of the
ombudsman model is based on looking at individual cases. As you will
see from our written evidence, more than half the cases that we have
dealt with since we were established relate to only six individual
products. Deciding those many thousands of cases on a one-by-one basis,
without being able to have regard to the more across-the-board economic
and strategic issues that a regulator is able to have regard to, is a
rather uncomfortable position for the ombudsman to be placed in and,
indeed, on occasions we are accused of being a quasi-regulator in
consequence of the number of cases we may be deciding in a particular
area.</div><a name="091208118000100"></a>

</b><b class="B">Celia</b><b class="B"> </b><b class="B">Barlow</b> (Hove) (Lab): I am
particularly interested in addressing my question to Mr.
Alex Kuczynski. How do you think the banking sector will react to the
proposal in the Bill that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
pay for the cost of activity up front under the special resolution
regime, then gets it back from the
banks?</div><a name="091208118000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alex</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Kuczynski:</b></i> The Banking Act 2009, which
came into force earlier this year, allows for two options for
contributing to the cost of resolution through the FSCS, which can
either be at the point of resolution or at the end of the resolution.
In the one example that has been dealt with under the new
legislation&#151;Dunfermline building society&#151;the arrangements
invoked by the notice from the Treasury were for a contribution at the
end of the resolution process. Once the Bill&#146;s authority has
been resolved, there could be a contribution from FSCS at that point. I
am not sure that there is any great change under the proposals in this
Bill to that contribution. These proposals deal primarily with the
interest attached to those costs, rather than the prospect of the banks
and the financial services sector contributing before or at the end of
the resolution process.</div>

</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> Perhaps I could chip in as
well. I imagine that anything to do with the costs of the financial
compensation scheme is likely to be a sensitive issue with those who
will be paying the costs. However, there is an important safeguard in
the legislation, which is that the amount that can be paid by way of
the costs of handling a special resolution is limited to the amount
that would have been paid if the company concerned had gone into
insolvent liquidation and compensation had had to be paid.</div>

<a name="091208118000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> Yes, indeed there are. There
are provisions that enable us to disqualify people as a penalty rather
than merely for prevention. There are provisions that enable us to take
both fining action and withdrawal-of-authorisation action and a number
of other provisions detailed in the Bill.</div>
<a name="091208118000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="091208118000444"></a><b class="B">Mr.</b><b class="B">
</b><b class="B">Hoban:</b> There is a significant increase in your
powers in the provisions on disciplinary powers. What has given rise to
your demand for such powers? What circumstances have you identified,
which you could not address in the recent financial crisis, that those
powers will enable you to address?</div>
<a name="091208118000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> I would draw a distinction
between powers that were needed in a financial crisis and powers that
are needed as a result of the more intrusive approach to regulation
that we have taken over the past two years. In the course of the
financial crisis, those particular enforcement powers were not as
significant, because such powers tend to be used after the event rather
in the heat of a crisis. The enforcement powers arise out of the
determination of the FSA over the past two years to be a more effective
supervisor than perhaps it was in the past, and to have a
credible deterrent effect on the industry&#146;s conduct. These are
part and parcel of that more credible deterrent effect, rather than
directly being powers that were needed in the
crisis.</div>

would like to return to the issue of the Council for Financial
Stability and address two questions that have already been raised.
First, who is in charge of the council? May I summarise what I think I
heard at the beginning, then perhaps Mr. Footman or
Mr. Whittaker could tell me whether I have got it wrong? The
FSA is to have a secondary role, the Bank of England is to have a full
role, and the Chancellor is to have a lead role as the only elected
politician. Have I got that right and, if not, could you correct me
where I have not got it
right?</div><a name="091208118000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> I would say that, as a
high-level summary, that is probably a fair reflection of what we said.
We could all add more detail and qualify it in particular ways, but I
would say that we were particularly emphasising a secondary role in
relation to macro-prudential
issues.</div>

bodies with particular powers, and the Chancellor chairing it for the
obvious reason that, as I said, he is the person who is accountable to
Parliament for the operation. His is the sponsoring Department for the

Bank of England and he has a leading role in this body. I remember the
question that was asked in the Treasury Committee two years

He always chaired the standing committee; he chairs
this.</div>

impossible to have somebody with a secondary role and somebody with a

</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Whittaker:</b></i> We would probably put it in
different terms. We would probably say that each has its own role and
we respect the roles of the others. For our part, in relation to
financial stability&#151;not in relation to regulation generally, but
in relation to financial stability&#151;we accept that we do not have
the lead role.</div>

&#147;hierarchy&#148; is causing a lot of trouble. Why do I not

particular point I made on financial stability was that, in relation to
that particular function, we see our role as

This is a committee that co-ordinates between two particular bodies to
whom powers have been delegated by a statute, and the Treasury, which
is the co-sponsoring Department for both. The Chancellor chairs it and
it is an attempt to bring together bodies whose powers are different,
but which interact with one another.</div>

that you have both given in evidence this afternoon. I am trying to
relate the two of them and get a grip on how this body will work. I
will give up on equality and hierarchy, since they both seem to be
particular obstacles. Is the principle of a lead role for the

102</b><a name="091208118000456"></a><b class="B">Mr.</b><b class="B">
</b><b class="B">Tyrie:</b> Basically, what we now have is a committee
with&#151;although you do not like the word
&#147;hierarchy&#148;&#151;a clear line of different
responsibilities between people, which puts someone in the lead and
someone else in a secondary role, but that is not in the Bill. I will
move on, but if I may say so, that sounds quite a
mess.</div><a name="091208118000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Speaking
of mess, I would like to come to the issue of powers and
responsibilities in this feat. The Governor of the Bank set out, in
front of this Committee, the current position on his statutory duties
for financial stability. He said that he wanted to be absolutely
crystal clear that we in Parliament understood that the Bank of England
can do no more than publish reports or make speeches in fulfilment of
its duty. He added that if we were content with that, that was fine by
him, but what we cannot do would be to turn around afterwards and say,
&#147;But you had the statutory responsibility. Why did you not do
something?&#148; Is there any power given to the Bank of England in
the Bill to try to deal with the Governor&#146;s
concern?</div><a name="091208118000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Footman:</b></i> I think he would have gone
on&#151;if not in that quote that you used, then elsewhere&#151;to
say that the Banking Act 2009 gave the Bank formal statutory
responsibility for payment system oversight and a formal responsibility
for bank resolution.</div>
<a name="091208118000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><a name="091208118000457"></a><b class="B">Mr.</b><b class="B">
</b><b class="B">Tyrie:</b> Would the Governor tell me that those two
new powers address his concern that powers and responsibilities are not

</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Footman:</b></i> In relation to those, we have
powers set out in the 2009 Act. I think the Governor was making a
broader point that in relation to financial stability as a whole, his
responsibilities are to contribute, and his formal statutory powers are
limited to the two that I have
mentioned.</div><a name="091208118000137"></a>

105</b><a name="091208118000459"></a><b class="B">Mr.</b><b class="B">
</b><b class="B">Tyrie:</b> No. My question is on the issue of
fulfilment of your duty for delivering financial stability. In respect
of your statutory duty to deliver financial stability, is the Bank now
content that the powers and responsibilities, which were not aligned,
are now
aligned?</div><a name="091208118000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Footman:</b></i> I stress again that our
responsibility is to contribute to, within the powers we have, the
maintenance of financial stability. Our responsibility set out in the
2009 Act is not to deliver financial stability, and it cannot be, for
the reason that you have
given.</div><a name="091208118000141"></a>

106</b><a name="091208118000460"></a><b class="B">Mr.</b><b class="B">
</b><b class="B">Tyrie:</b> So when the Governor comes before us on the
next occasion in the Treasury Committee, on which I serve, we will ask
him that question, and you are confident that he will say, &#147;I am
happy now; I am
content.&#148;</div><a name="091208118000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">

is absolutely

</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">Footman:</b></i> I am not sure about
contentedness. It is a simple point: on financial stability, we are
expected to contribute, not deliver it. We have certain powers through
which we will contribute, but we cannot contribute through other
powers, because we do not have them. It is not a question of our being
cross that we do not have them; it is just a fact that we do not have
them.</div>

109</b><a name="091208118000464"></a><b class="B">Lindsay
Roy</b> (Glenrothes) (Lab): I cannot agree with the hon.
Gentleman that we are talking about a chance set of remarks. They were
made quite deliberately to highlight the issues. Whatever the
relationship&#151;whether it is a hierarchy or whether there is
parity&#151;it needs to be teased out further; it is a complex
set-up. Can you summarise for me the key benchmarks by which we could
gauge more effective working and success through the Council for
Financial Stability? What key things would summarise that for us?
Mention was made of openness. What
else?</div><a name="091208118000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> This is a body to co-ordinate, and one
measure would be whether we appear, either in normal times or in times
of crises, to be co-ordinated and whether we think we are. Another
measure is whether we speak with one voice or many voices. You keep
hearing us speaking with many voices, even though Andrew and I think
that we are speaking more or less with the same one. It is difficult
for three people, all giving speeches in evidence, to say exactly the
same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>words, but broadly we should be saying the same things, or approaching
things in the same way. Those would be measures of success for a body
that is there to co-ordinate, as it says in the Bill.</div>
<a name="091208118000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> To add to John&#146;s comments, the best
way to see that a tripartite organisation is working is by what it
produces. The members of the tripartite organisation&#151;the
Treasury, the Bank and the FSA&#151;have worked very effectively in
recent months and years on the asset protection scheme, on
recapitalisation and, indeed, on some of the individual company
decisions that we have needed to
take.</div><a name="091208118000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000465"></a>Lindsay

portfolio, in terms of success
criteria?</div><a name="091208118000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> If I may say so, it is always very
difficult to conclude that financial stability has been successfully
achieved. Although you may have a long period during which you do not
have financial difficulties, concluding that financial stability has
been achieved does not necessarily follow from the fact that you do not
have problems. Financial stability in essence requires more than a
period without difficulties. It requires confidence that mechanisms are
in place to deter difficulties. As you do not know all the risks you
are mitigating against, you will always need to be chary of anyone who
tells you that the system is working as well as it can, and that we
have it all sorted. There is always more that can be done. There are
always better ways than the ones that we have achieved at the
moment.</div><a name="091208118000154"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000468"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> You have made me a bit happier than the Minister
did this morning. I was unsure of where we were, in terms of who was
responsible for financial stability and in terms of the role of the
Chancellor. It is clear that the Chancellor is chairing the body and
will take the decisions but, from what I have heard this afternoon, if
you would only admit it, Mr. Footman, the FSA is the body
that we shall look to in the future for financial stability. The Bank
has a very minor role. It would be better for you to admit that,
because if the FSA gets it wrong, you are clear of all the problems. If
you continue to sit in a meeting and say, &#147;We are equal
partners&#148;, you are an equal partner without responsibility. You
can only take the rap, but cannot do anything about things. Am I
wrong?</div><a name="091208118000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> If I may be allowed an observation, one of
the lessons of the past two years is that even if we do not do banking
supervision, we are still assumed widely to be responsible and are
blamed. We have had that in spades at the Bank, 10 years after
supervision moved
elsewhere.</div><a name="091208118000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are involved in financial stability, there is no question about that.
We are involved in providing liquidity, and liquidity insurance, to the
banking system through our operations. Those things are not based on
statute, but on the operation of our balance sheet. We are also
involved with statutory powers in the small ways that I mentioned. All
of that we bring to the table in the Council for Financial
Stability.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div><a name="091208118000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
supervision, when it comes to statutory powers we are very small. Look
at the bulk of the legislation and compare it with the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, which relates to the FSA. However, we
have an interest because: financial stability is the environment in
which monetary policy operates; our balance sheet is used to provide
liquidity insurance to the banking system; and we are involved in

you.</div><a name="091208118000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

Financial Stability&#151;but as I said at the beginning, it also
leaves us with a sense that whatever happens, we are to blame. If you
ask a taxi driver who was to blame for anything, they would largely
say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s the Bank of England, innit?&#148; So
we have carried quite a lot of the can for Northern Rock and other
things&#151;because we are
there.</div><a name="091208118000163"></a>

that&#151;let me deal with the FSA and consumer protection. You
reckon that the new body is independent of the FSA. If there was a
country, and we from this country appointed its board, set up its
budget, appointed its staff and appointed a reviewer to determine how
well it spent its money, would you call that country
independent?</div><a name="091208118000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew

115</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000471"></a>Mr.

116</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000473"></a>Mr.

board, you do the budget, you collect the body&#146;s
money&#151;you charge it for collecting its money&#151;you appoint
the staff and you appoint someone to go in and review it, in terms of
value for money. Do you think that anyone objectively reviewing that
body could say that it is independent of the
FSA?</div><a name="091208118000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> Yes, I do. Those are accountability
controls for which we are responsible. One point I would pick you up on
is that we do not appoint the staff of the new body&#151;or will not
do so when it is in
place.</div><a name="091208118000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091208118000474"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b>
Sorry.</div><a name="091208118000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> We will not be appointing the staff of a
new body. The staff of the new body will be appointed by the members of
its board. We shall appoint the members of its board, but they will
then independently select who they want to have as the staff of the
body.</div><a name="091208118000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091208118000475"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> So, the board will appoint the staff&#151;all the
staff.</div><a name="091208118000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew

financial education issues in the FSA will be transferred.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div><a name="091208118000175"></a>

okay.</div><a name="091208118000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew

118</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000479"></a>Mr.

you say after eight

Whittaker:</b></i> I would just go back a little bit to
clarify what I said. We have an objective relating to financial
awareness in legislation that has been in force since 2001. There was a
major project set up, which was broader than financial awareness and
went into issues of financial education. That was set up within the
last few years, but the baseline from which it will work was set in
March 2006, rather than back in 2001. So the assessment of what
progress is being made will be effectively an assessment from 2006.
Going back to what difference have we made, I personally am not best
placed to give you details of what we have done, but I would be happy
to write to you on
that.</div><a name="091208118000183"></a>

119</b><a name="091208118000481"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): If it was your choice,
you would not call the body the Council for Financial Stability, would
you? You have just told us that you cannot ensure financial stability.
So why is it called the Council for Financial Stability? I am still
struggling to see what you actually do, or hope to
do.</div><a name="091208118000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

does?</div><a name="091208118000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000482"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="091208118000187"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> It does&#151;or, I think, is intended to
do&#151;simply what it says on the Bill, which is to co-ordinate
between authorities that have separate, but slightly interlocking,
powers. That is a normal thing for a co-ordinating body to
do.</div>
<a name="091208118000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000483"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> But it is called the Council for Financial
Stability, is it not? You have said in your evidence that you cannot
ensure financial stability, so why are we wasting energy on calling it
the Council for Financial Stability? It sounds almost Soviet:
&#147;The Council for Financial Stability and Building
Tractors&#148;. Why are we giving it this title when clearly that is
not its
purpose?</div><a name="091208118000189"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> I do not have any particular views as to
its name. I am happy for it to be called the Council for Financial
Stability or any other suitable name. In indicating that financial
stability is very difficult to achieve, I was not intending to indicate
that it was not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>extremely important to do all that you can to
achieve it. You may draw comparisons with climate change. Climate
change may be a huge issue, but that does not mean that you should not
do what you can to prevent it. I think that, in current circumstances,
it is highly important to do all we can to achieve financial stability,
even though there may be risks that we face that are very tricky to
handle.</div><a name="091208118000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000484"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> But in practical terms, what are you going to do
to try to ensure financial stability? Clearly, you need to be able to
understand and identify the risk inherent in the financial instruments
with which banks are trading. That is what caused the current financial
crisis. It is no good saying, &#147;Well, when we have another
Northern Rock we&#146;ll do things differently&#148;, because
Northern Rock was the fever that presaged the plague. By the time
Northern Rock had gone, it was too late&#151;the chain reaction had
started. What are you going to do differently to ensure that we do not
have financial institutions taking on huge amounts of risk that you do
not, or did not, understand, and that they clearly did not
understand?</div><a name="091208118000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> To answer that, it is important to start
with the causes of the financial crisis. The causes of the financial
crisis&#151;extensively and, in my view, very convincingly set out in
the Turner report&#151;are not simply about individual misconduct or
mismanagement in particular institutions. They are also about huge
economic forces, and particularly financial imbalances between the west
and China. Those have caused China, as a nation of savers, and the US,
in particular, as a nation of borrowers, to create financial dynamics
that eventually proved to be highly destructive. That is, if I may say
so, an important illustration of why it is important that financial
regulation does not just look at micro-prudential issues and individual
issues within firms, but also looks at the wider economic environment,
taking into account the kind of contribution that the Bank of England
must make.</div>
<a name="091208118000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
very happy to accept also that there is a very significant role for
regulation, but, in the past, as we have said in relation specifically
to Northern Rock, regulation was not done as effectively as it could
have been. A huge amount of work has been done since the internal audit
report we published on our supervision of Northern Rock, in order to
strengthen the way in which supervision is conducted. We have taken on
more than 100 additional supervisors over the past year or so. We have
reorganised supervision and have put in place major training
arrangements. We have started to interview, for the first time, senior
people who are being appointed to the boards of institutions, and we
have done a huge amount of work on governance. We have started being
more intensive and intrusive in our approach to supervision, by
starting to challenge business models, and by looking at where the
money is coming from within individual firms and what their exposures
are. I am conscious that I have answered very comprehensively, but I
want to emphasise that we accept that supervision was not done
effectively, and that we are doing a lot to improve
it.</div><a name="091208118000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000485"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> To be fair, many economists were saying that there
was an enormous trade imbalance between China and America, and that
there probably were no acts of misconduct. We must not allow ourselves
to think that these bankers were doing anything illegal. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>They were creating hugely complex, highly leveraged financial
instruments, and failed to price risk. They did not understand what was
being traded, and neither did the FSA. Surely, in future we need to
understand how risk is being priced within major financial
institutions. It is not a question of misconduct. If there is
misconduct, you lock people up, of course; that is a failure of a
firm&#146;s compliance department. But the issue is all about not
understanding where risk lies within financial institutions and the
economy. How are you going to ensure that banks explain to you exactly
what they  are
doing?</div><a name="091208118000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> Just to pick up on that last point, I
think it is both about getting banks to explain the way their business
models work and the vulnerability of those models, and also, at the
highest level, about looking at risks in the wider environment. In the
FSA&#151;in the Bank as well&#151;we have assessments of risks, and
the one that we have discussed today is only one. Any of those risks
could be hugely problematic if it were to emerge. The key thing, as you
rightly say, is to be able to understand the risks and to translate
that understanding of a risk into an understanding of how that risk
might emerge in an individual institution, and then to try to take
action to prevent it from doing
so.</div><a name="091208118000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000486"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Going back to the new intrusive and inquisitive
role, will that include on-site inspections by teams going into
banks&#146; head offices and branches, both in this country and
abroad?</div><a name="091208118000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> Potentially, yes. That primarily tends to
be done not through a &#147;bank examiner&#148; model of the kind
that has been used in the US&#151;often with a resident supervisor in
an individual banking institution&#151;but by a focus on analysis,
with the senior management, of the issues in the
organisation.</div>
<a name="091208118000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
125</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000487"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> So you are not going to have individual supervisors
within large branches, and you are not going to rely only on a
tick-box, desk-top assessment, but you are going to include on-site
inspections by teams as and when required. Will you have the resources
to do
that?</div><a name="091208118000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> That is a fair question. As with everyone
else, inevitably our body has to be choosy about how it uses its
resources. The choice we have made at the moment is that we should
focus on the institutions that have the highest potential impact, so we
are looking particularly at the largest banks and insurers. I think
that members of the Committee would agree that it is sensible in any
environment of risk or constraint to try to focus resource where the
risk seems to be largest. No jurisdiction could sensibly invest the
money that would be needed to have a regulator at the shoulder of
everyone doing every transaction. What is needed is a smarter approach,
in which you try to look at the strategic issues and the business model
and its vulnerabilities. When you identify those, you should be ready
to be firm in indicating the problems that you see and in trying to
stop
them.</div><a name="091208118000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
126</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000488"></a>Mr.

127</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000489"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b><b class="B"> </b>Mr. Thomas, do you think that in
the Bill, it might have been a good idea to bring together the current
credit control, or consumer credit, aspects of the OFT into something
more co-ordinated? We could leave everything with the FSA and the
financial ombudsman, so that we did not have this split of
responsibilities between the FSA and the OFT when it came to consumer
issues.</div>
<a name="091208118000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Thomas:</b></i> We have a close working relationship with
both the FSA and the OFT, and that issue has not caused us any
practical problem at all in dealing with cases in both those areas, or
with bodies that are regulated in both those areas. However, the recent
Supreme Court judgment talked about looking at the pricing of a current
account&#151;whether it was in credit, in debit, or varied between
the two&#151;as a single package. That obviously raises some
interesting questions about the future shape of regulation, but those
are matters of policy, which I do not think are for an ombudsman to
comment on.</div>
<a name="091208118000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000490"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b><b class="B"> </b>Do you think that the average consumer
understands why the OFT operates one part of the banking package and
the FSA is responsible for another part of it?</div>
<a name="091208118000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Thomas:</b></i> Our awareness research shows that actually
only a minority of consumers are aware of the existence of the FSA or
the OFT, let alone what they respectively do. There is clearly a great
deal of&#151;I am trying to avoid the word &#147;ignorance&#148;,
but you know what I mean; there is a great deal of it out there among
consumers about how things are regulated. They just have confidence
that there is a regulator, without knowing who it is or why it
is.</div>

132</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000494"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Some of us sat through the Banking Bill, which gave
the Bank a financial stability responsibility and led to the

Does this Bill have any operational implications on that body and how
it works?</div>
<a name="091208118000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> No, I do not think so. Obviously, the
financial stability committee reviews the analytical material that
comes out of the financial stability area of the Bank, which itself is
to be reviewed by the Council for Financial Stability. So the FSC will
be conscious of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>interest of the co-ordinating body, but operationally, no, the Bill does
not have any implications, because the FSC monitors the Bank&#146;s
use of its resolution and payment systems oversight powers, it looks at
the Bank&#146;s regulation of Scottish and Northern Irish note
issues, and it recommends the Bank&#146;s financial stability
strategy, within the powers that it has. I do not think that anything
in this Bill affects that directly.</div>

134</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000497"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I ask Mr. Whittaker a couple of
questions about some of the powers that the FSA is getting under the
Bill, and the new regulations to prohibit or require disclosure of
short selling? You had what some would argue was quite a restrictive
regime in place early in the financial crisis. What was wrong with the
legal basis of those powers that requires a different set of powers
now?</div>
<a name="091208118000218"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> Thank you for asking that question. As you
will know, the powers that we used last autumn required us to
characterise short selling as market abuse. Those powers are currently
subject to a sunset clause and are potentially going to be affected by
a European directive. The Bill enables us to ban short selling without
having to categorise it as market abuse. It therefore enables it to be
done without being impacted by any changes in
Europe.</div>

<a name="091208118000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> I think that it will be in specific
institutions. I do not envisage it being exercised against an
individual or a short seller.</div>
<a name="091208118000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
136</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000499"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The other area, which we have managed to avoid
commenting on so far today, is remuneration. Will you explain the
powers to do with seeking to take over employment contracts?</div>
<a name="091208118000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> Yes. I should start by saying that we are
happy with the powers proposed in the legislation. We have an existing
code of conduct in relation to remuneration. It focuses on methods of
remuneration, to ensure that those that are used are not ones that
promote risk. The new legislation would provide an additional backing
to that kind of code&#151;specifically, if it were incorporated in
the form of rules&#151;that would enable provisions that we had bound
by rules then to be ineffective. It would not be a retrospective
effect. It would apply after the date on which the rules come in to
contracts that are made after that date. We do not see any virtue in
retrospection. Indeed, we see a positive virtue in provisions
encouraging people to formulate their contracts in a way that complies
with the code&#151;that complies with the
rules.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div><a name="091208118000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
137</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000500"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> To be clear about it, if someone had an existing
employment contract that was in breach of your code, you would not seek
powers to tear up that contract, or does it relate only to future
contracts?</div>
<a name="091208118000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> Yes. In that situation, it is conceivable
that there would be other action that we would want to take. We might,
for example, be concerned about the exposures that would result to the
firm from that contract of employment. Therefore, we might ask for
additional supervision of a trader who was incentivised in a way that
we believed was dangerous, but the effect of this clause would not be
to make that an unlawful term.</div>
<a name="091208118000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
138</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000501"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to pick up Mr. Footman on the
concerns that he touched on in response to Mr.
Tyrie&#146;s questioning. You referred to the concerns that a bank
has about the resolution and recovery plans set out in the Bill. Would
you elaborate on those a
little?</div><a name="091208118000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> Yes. This is a point that I referred to in
the short paragraph that I sent to the Committee earlier. Developing
living wills, as they are colloquially called, is one of the priorities
for both the regulators and for the resolution authorities, and in this
case we are the resolution authority. Recovery plans are for banks that
have got into difficulties but are being helped, managed or overseen
out of it by the regulator. Resolution plans are for the resolution
authority, which will need to have a very strong base of information at
very short notice that tells it about the possibilities that exist for
resolving a bank&#146;s affairs; the constraints that may exist as a
result of the bank&#146;s structures, domestically and abroad; the
kind of loan books that it has; the sort of risks that it is running;
and particularly the way in which its balance sheet is structured. That
is a mass of information that the resolution authority
needs.</div><a name="091208118000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
slight discomfort with the Bill is because the process of collecting
all the information is entirely with the FSA. With the best will in the
world, operating through someone else to get something that you need is
less efficient than trying to do it directly. For that reason, at
various points we have asked for the bank to have a direct power to get
information from the financial institutions, consistent with the
statutory powers that it has. More widely, you can see that in the Bank
of England Act 1998 we have a power to get monetary statistics from the
banks. The FSA obviously has powers to get information from the banks.
In the Banking Act 2009, under the payment system oversight, we have a
power to get information from payment system operators. We have another
power to get information from the Scottish and Northern Irish banks in
relation to our regulation of their
activities.</div><a name="091208118000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the special resolution authority role, we do not have an information
power, and we would like to have one directly. We would find it more
productive and helpful to do so. That is not to say that we cannot work
with the FSA. At the moment, we are working with the FSA across a small
number of firms on resolution plan piloting, which is starting now and
running into the first quarter of next year. That is happening, but our
preference&#151;we have expressed this to the Treasury and I think
people here know about it&#151;would be to have a direct power to get
information from banks, or to have an ability to insist that the FSA
get it for us rather than have to ask for it. Obviously, the FSA has
its own constraints on asking for information from banks&#151;Andrew 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>can explain this&#151;because there are regulatory codes that it has
to comply with when it asks for information, and the fact that the Bank
of England wants it is not always a compelling reason for getting it.
If we had the power, the fact that the Bank of England wanted it would
be an overwhelming reason for getting it, and that is the concern that
lies at the background of what I
say.</div>
<a name="091208118000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
139</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000502"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Why have you not been given this
power?</div><a name="091208118000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Footman:</b></i> Because the FSA has argued that it is the
single regulator and there needs to be just one interface with the
banks. If there were more than one interface, it would cut across the
FSA. Andrew, you can put that better than I can.</div>
<a name="091208118000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Whittaker:</b></i> John has put our concern very well. The
process of ensuring that a bank is stable and able to be rescued and
recovered is part and parcel of what a regulator needs to do, so we
think that it would be a confusion of responsibilities and
accountabilities if the bank were to have a direct power that enabled
it to start going into that. However, just to provide some reassurance
on the second concern that John raised, I believe that the fact that
the Bank wanted information about a living will would be a perfectly
good and sufficient reason for us to obtain that information. The Bank
is the clear stakeholder on the preparation of a resolution plan
because it is the resolution authority.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
140</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000506"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I ask you all about the new collective
proceedings powers set out in the Bill? Is the fact that we are relying
on consumers to act collectively to enforce rights&#151;if they have
them&#151;in financial services, which is the one of the most heavily
regulated sectors in the UK economy, a sign that regulation has failed?
I just get a sense that someone is not doing their job properly, and is
relying on the courts and on consumers to do the job on their behalf.
Is it a sign of regulatory failure?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div><a name="091208118000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> It is certainly the case that the
regulator is not doing its job, as we can see from  the
evidence on payment protection insurance and the persistent mis-selling
and lack of action. It created a situation where the Financial
Ombudsman Service was overwhelmed by claims, of which some 89 per
cent., I think, have been upheld. It is undoubtedly the case that there
are
problems.</div><a name="091208118000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
FSA is trying to tackle the issue, but the regulatory process takes too
long to address a number of such problems, which is why we are
supportive of the measures on collective redress. It would enable
consumers to get their entitlement to funds. After all, to be in the
process, a firm has to have broken the law, and action needs to be
taken to address that. The case has already been proven against it, and
the question now is whether it is going to be relieved of its
ill-gotten gains, and either return the money to consumers directly, or
return it in some other way that ensures distribution under consumer
protection measures.</div>
<a name="091208118000242"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> I think that there have been failures in the
past, but we see it as a package of redress measures, which, taken
together, are extremely important. We particularly welcome the proposal
for collective proceedings with an opt-out procedure, which will
redress a great imbalance for older people, who often are not in a
position to make a complaint themselves if they are socially isolated,
if they do not have support, if they are immobile, or if they just do
not have access to the available forms of information. We therefore
strongly support those aspects of the Bill.</div>
<a name="091208118000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> I think that the strengthening of section
404 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which is proposed
in the Bill, will make it somewhat easier for the FSA to intervene. I
would hope that the availability of this option would encourage them to
do just that. As Peter says, however, the ability for an organisation
or individual to take collective action or set up a collective action
in respect of payment protection insurance, for example, which seems to
be drifting on, would be a useful power to make available to
consumers.</div><a name="091208118000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
141</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000507"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Adam, you are chairman of the Financial Services
Consumer Panel, and the Financial Services Bill seems to cover a wide
range of topics. Is there something else that should be in the Bill to
keep the FSA up to the mark so that we do not have to get consumers to
take financial services providers to
court?</div><a name="091208118000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> I think that the FSA has changed its
behaviour in the last year. There has been a restructuring and a couple
of people who have more of a consumerist background have joined the
board: that can only be encouraging. The FSA is clearly more willing to
take enforcement action. The real issue here is to ensure that the
leadership in the FSA takes its consumer protection objectives
seriously and that it has the tools to do the job. In some cases, we
see in this Bill proposed changes that will give it more certainty
against legal
challenge.</div><a name="091208118000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
142</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000508"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Peter, I understand that Citizens Advice is quite
content to have either the opt-in or opt-out process, whereas Which?
would rather have an opt-out process. Why are you agnostic on
that?</div><a name="091208118000379"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> I think we would like an opt-out. The way in
which the legislation is drafted gives the courts the power to decide.
In most cases, we would prefer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>opt-out, so we do not have to marshal and herd
potential claimants in. But it seemed to us that the legislation had
taken that into account, so it was not such a hot point for
us.</div>
<a name="091208118000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> One of the reasons for our much
preferring opt-out is that, after all, we are one of the few bodies,
and perhaps the only body, that has actually taken action under this,
with JJB Sports. Our experience of that process has affected our views
on the best mechanism. We found that, despite quite a lot of media
attention, it is difficult trying to get people, when you are at the
end of the process of regulatory enforcement, to remember that they
bought a football shirt several years ago, that they had a receipt
showing they paid for it at the time, and to be bothered to do
anything about it.</div>
<a name="091208118000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means
that it is incredibly difficult, if it is opt-in, to get people
involved. We ended up with fewer than 1,000 people claiming, out of the
many hundreds of thousands who had been mis-sold in that instance. So
we think that the danger is that, if you do not have opt-out, you will
just have continued weak take-up, and it will not be a deterrent to
firms from taking this action. After all, it is about ensuring that
firms are discouraged from illegal activity because they know that they
will not get away with it&#151;and if they do not get away with it,
they will have to reimburse or pay into some other fund. So the
deterrent is really important. Opt-in does not offer that
deterrent.</div>
<a name="091208118000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
143</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000509"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> May I turn to the financial education body that is
being set up? Some&#151;including me&#151;have criticised the
current activity of the FSA as being simply about shipping shedloads of
material into various places, but without measuring in any way the
effectiveness of the various actions that it is taking. Do you share
that
view?</div><a name="091208118000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I think that the FSA has done
a good job of piloting a financial education and capability process;
there was nothing before it started doing it. I agree that it has
tended to over-claim its successes, but the individual pilots have been
quite successful in terms of the behaviour changes they have observed.
The panel is enthusiastic about this development. We think this is a
good development that will provide a useful way of getting consumers to
engage with the industry and to encourage them to save and to take out
protection that they might otherwise not be doing. We see falling
take-up of things such as protection at the moment.</div>
<a name="091208118000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that for it to be effective it now has to be separated from the
regulator. There is a potential conflict of interest between the
regulator&#146;s role in terms of working with the industry to make
it effective in the way it delivers consumer protection but
also protects the system, and an education body that has to represent
the consumer and go potentially beyond what is within the proposed Act.
As an example, I would like to see consumer education bodies writing
documents that say things like, &#147;A good bank will reply to a
complaint within two weeks, but within the law it has to do it within
eight weeks.&#148; The FSA would say that eight weeks meets the
requirement and anything more is
unnecessary.</div><a name="091208118000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
144</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000510"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> When you say that the panel welcomes this new body,
would not one of the critical determinants be the degree of
independence it actually had? I do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>know whether you were present for the discussion about the model of how
the FSA related to this new body. Are you satisfied that it would be
genuinely independent in its
functions?</div><a name="091208118000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> I was not present for the discussion. We
are concerned about the wording, which requires the body to pay regard
to maintaining confidence in the financial system and maintaining
stability, which potentially could be used to restrict what it is able
to do. We think that if it is to be effective and trusted by consumers
it must be able to confront the industry and confront bad
behaviour.</div><a name="091208118000254"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
145</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000511"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Which may indeed involve making quite robust
statements about the quality of various services, which could in theory
have some bearing on that broader financial stability. What about the
Government&#146;s model of the people who are on this new body being
appointed by the FSA? It is not very clear who they might be or from
what pool they might be drawn. I attempted to get the FSA to say a
little bit more about whom they might be looking for to occupy these
roles and got about as dead a bat as could be manufactured. Is there
more that you could say about the kind of people that one ought to have
on a body of this kind genuinely to guarantee its
independence?</div><a name="091208118000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> There are two things to say.
First,  the board of the Financial Ombudsman Service is
appointed by the FSA and it has exhibited considerable independence. I
think it is a matter of the people you have rather than necessarily the
appointment process. There are undoubtedly some very good people with
consumer experience around. One would like to see the leadership coming
from that sort of person. One of the issues for the FSA&#146;s board
is that it has been dominated by people who work within the financial
services
industry.</div><a name="091208118000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
146</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000512"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Yes, but there is another part of this, which is the
word &#147;education&#148;. The material I have observed from the
FSA delivered direct or through personal finance education on its
behalf in the education field does not stand the test of mass pedagogic
engagement. In other words, just getting people to use them as
educational tools is way beyond them. They are materials best suited to
reasonably well set up, well established and highly motivated people
rather than for bulk activity. Would it not be useful to have people
who have some genuine experience of delivering this as a service,
perhaps to the unwilling, certainly the ignorant, rather than some
idealised
consumer?</div><a name="091208118000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter Tutton:</b></i> The Citizens Advice service has built up a
lot of experience of doing exactly that, of using materials produced by
the FSA and others and delivering them to people who need them. Our
strategy for financial education is based on lower-income adults in
households where we often find people who are subject to bad practice
and being ripped off by financial services, and who need a lot of help
to understand financial products and services and even basic skills
such as budgeting. For example, we have a strategy of 14 regional
financial capability forums, which bring together about 700 different
organisations, so we are acting as a conduit between those materials
and front-line workers in places such as housing offices and various
different organisations. The strategy is not just about providing
materials, but about how you provide an interface on the ground with
people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>as consumers, as well as with people who consumers go to for help and
advice. We reckon that we have managed to reach about 200,000 people a
year by doing
that.</div><a name="091208118000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
are absolutely right that to concentrate on education is the wrong
thing. I think that we need to ensure that a new body has a strategic
view and is able to build on what we already have. We hope that that
will provide a step change in the kind of services&#151;advice, not
just information, services&#151;on things that can help people
understand it, and advice and information services where people can be
talked and helped through decision making.</div>
<a name="091208118000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
147</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000513"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> May I give a concrete example? The FSA distributes a
great tome on financial products to expectant mothers and seeks to
educate them on that. I cannot believe that such a tome is of huge
value to most people who receive it, other than as a way of propping
open a door. From your positive remarks, you presumably hold such
products in higher esteem than I
do.</div><a name="091208118000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> I think that the point here is that what is
important with a new mother is whether they are getting the benefits
they are entitled to and whether there are other needs for financial
products and so on. We try to provide a holistic service. Producing
good materials can help; they can be a tool for our advisers to work
through with someone&#151;it saves us having to print
them&#151;about all the things they need to think about and the
things they might be able to do to help us. I think that you are right:
all printed materials need to be proofed to make sure that they work,
are understandable and so on. But the key thing is how they work with
advice services for those who need help to interpret them, in which
case they can be
useful.</div><a name="091208118000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
148</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000514"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Finally, if you look at the FSA reporting of that
particular area of activity, you will see that it shows huge numbers of
various achievements, as in, &#147;We have reached x number.&#148;
On Second Reading, I quoted an example in which there was a figure of
the number of children who had been reached by FSA materials of some
kind or another, which appeared simply to multiply the number of pupils
by the number of schools on its list. Does there not have to be a
sharper or more rigorous engagement with the qualitative impact of what
these bits of paper and often expensive teaching materials are actually
achieving?</div><a name="091208118000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> I absolutely agree. That was the point that
I made at the beginning. I think that the FSA has been overclaiming
what it has been doing, which does it no favours. But if one takes a
more focused view of the individual pilots, I think it has come out
quite well. The issue now is to ensure that if money is being put into
it&#151;</div><a name="091208118000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
149</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000515"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Just to nail that down, the FSA representative was
going to write to us about what the large pathfinder pilot on generic
advice had been shown to have achieved, but you may be able to tell us
that
yourselves.</div><a name="091208118000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> I happen to have met with money guides from Age
Concern in the north-east and north-west of England today. The numbers
that we have reached so far have been much smaller and in the
thousands. But looking at the impact, as opposed to reach, on
individuals, the sorts of face-to-face advice service that they have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>been able to offer has been extremely encouraging. Not only are people
coming in when a threatening life event happens, but there are also
indications that people are now starting to be reached in a proactive
way. For example, older people who would not have previously thought
about it are now starting to be encouraged to look at the financial
products on offer, perhaps notice that all those products are with one
provider, and are given the confidence and knowledge to shop around.
That is the absolutely essential service that I think the new financial
education body will need to
offer.</div><a name="091208118000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> May I just say on the governance point
that your point on the diversity of perspectives and interests that are
brought to the table is very well made? That is why we think it is very
important that it has a lay chair and a majority of independent
members. This is a great public service and it is not something that
should be captured either by the industry, by the regulator or by
consumer groups. It needs to have all these representatives brought to
the table so that we can get a true understanding and interaction, not
just let it become a tool of any one
constituency.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
150</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000516"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> May we turn to the provisions of clause 27, which
is all about these credit card cheques and such? It seems quite
sensible because there has been some problem. Is it or was it a serious
problem? If so, is it now being properly addressed with the provisions
that are contained in the
clause?</div><a name="091208118000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> I think credit card cheques are a problem.
You need to locate them generally in the whole question of credit cards
and their relationship to debt. We deal with about 1.9 million debt
problems a year. Credit cards have for a long time been the single
biggest problem area of debt that we deal with. There are about 300,000
to 350,000 different credit card debts every year. We see cases of
people with really bad multiple debt problems&#151;&#163;100,000
spread over 20 products. Credit cards are always a big part of that
multiple credit card use. So there is a
pattern.</div><a name="091208118000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000517"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Was that including
cheques?</div><a name="091208118000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> I am coming to cheques. Credit card cheques
are part of a pattern of credit card practices which are unhelpful and
harmful in some cases to consumers. The specific things about credit
card cheques are that there is some evidence from research to suggest
that they are linked to over-indebtedness. They tend to be larger
transactions. We have seen some cases where people in financial
difficulty have resorted to using credit card cheques to help them try
to make ends meet, which has made their debt problem worse. They tend
to be more expensive. They are often charged as cash transactions with
other levies. They do not contain the same sort of protection as
section 75 protection. The other big issue is the unsolicited issue. So
these measures are not trying to ban credit card cheques per se. What
we and other consumer groups have called for is an end to their
unsolicited issue. If consumers find them useful, they can ask for
them. The problem is when they are sent to consumers and they have a
damaging effect. That should stop.</div>
<a name="091208118000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
152</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000518"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> So it was a serious problem and you are happy that
the provisions in clause 27 will go as far as you would wish?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div><a name="091208118000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter

unsolicited
issue.</div><a name="091208118000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000519"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> You would not suggest banning them
altogether?</div><a name="091208118000273"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> I do not think we can make that case. If
consumers have properly explained to them what they are and they want
them, we can leave it at that.</div>
<a name="091208118000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> I would agree entirely with that. Let
us not pretend that there is great consumer demand. In 2008, 292
million were sent out and only 0.9 per cent. were then used. Most of us
are sent these cheques and then there is the fraud risk and all the
rest of it. They are a product in search of a market. They are only one
part of the problem of irresponsible lending. We welcome that move. We
were very disappointed that there has not been a move on unsolicited
credit limit increases, for example. Although at a public event last
summer the Prime Minister committed to banning unsolicited credit card
cheques and unsolicited credit card increases, that has not come
through. We think that is a similar serious problem, because in my own
experience and the experience of everyone I talk to, these limit
increases are not used primarily as a way of getting people used to
credit and extending it through. They are given to you when you are in
debt. They are not given to you until you are near your credit limit
and then they are given to tempt people into further debt. We would
like to see those go on an unsolicited basis as well. One of the things
we are calling for in the passage of this Bill is to ask each of the
Front Benches to make it clear that they will take action against
unsolicited credit increases as well. At the moment the industry has no
incentive to come to the table. If all parties indicate that they will
deal with this problem, the industry will have to come to the table and
tackle it
itself.</div><a name="091208118000275"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000520"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b><b class="B"> </b>Let me get this right. You would quite like
a provision within the Bill which not only banned the unsolicited issue
of credit card cheques, but unsolicited increases in credit card
limits?</div><a name="091208118000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> Either in the Bill itself or for each
Front Bench to indicate that they would take action subsequent to the

voluntarily.</div><a name="091208118000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
155</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000521"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I have failed singularly with all the other
witnesses today, so you are my last hope. Do you think that there
should be some provision within the Bill to do away with the anomaly of
the Office of Fair Trading looking after some aspects of consumer
credit, such as consumers&#146; concerns with their bank and so on,
and the FSA looking after other bits? Would it not make some sense to
take away from the OFT the bit that it looks after and give it all to
the FSA, so that it is all with the FSA and everybody can be happy that
that regulator looks after
everything?</div><a name="091208118000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter

am agnostic about where it lies, but I would like credit regulation to
lie in one place. Where the best place is I am relatively agnostic
about.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="091208118000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
156</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000523"></a>Mr.

place.</div><a name="091208118000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> Indeed, and the consumer panel would
support the view that the best place to put it would be with the FSA as
far as the firms are concerned with which they have an ongoing
supervisory relationship, which is essentially the large banks. The
reason for doing that is that they are in there supervising them
already. They have conduct risk supervisors looking at deposit taking
and savings and investments. It makes complete sense to have them look
at the issuance of credit. They could stop a lot of those practices if
they had the necessary powers to do
it.</div><a name="091208118000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
157</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000524"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> So is it a bit disappointing that that is not
tackled in the Bill?</div>
<a name="091208118000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> It is disappointing. We would like to see
it tackled. We would also like to see the FSA being asked within
section 3 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to pay due
regard to value for money, which we think would enable it to deal with
some of those particular issues and the extraction of profit that has
gone on with products such as payment protection insurance, which
encourages mis-sales.</div>
<a name="091208118000285"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> We deal with an awful lot of consumer credit
problems. It is not so easy. Moving it all into one place is not a
simple question of picking up credit from the OFT and plopping it into
the FSMA. They are very different regimes. Both of them have their
strong points and their weaknesses. If you did that, consumers would
lose some powerful protections under the Consumer Credit Act
1974.</div>
<a name="091208118000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that
comes to pass and there seems to be a growing consensus on putting
everything in one place, we would say, again, that we are quite
agnostic as to where it goes. We would say that the OFT has a lot of
experience in consumer credit, the relationship to trading standards
and the long tail of credit that you would have to think about. Aside
from that, I would not discount its expertise and its growing use of
its powers under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 to bring to book some bad
traders who have caused consumer detriment. As well, you need to think
about that rather than just moving it in the Bill. We would not want to
lose some of the provisions such as the unfair credit relationships
test, the time orders and things such as the early settlement
discount.</div>

As I understand it, they have a principle; principle 6, I
believe. But a principle does not create a right of private action in
the same way as the unfair credit relationships test under the Consumer
Credit Acts, so you would not be able to use it, say, as a defence if
you were taken to court by a creditor. You would not be able to
mobilise it in quite the same way. It is a regulatory principle rather
than a necessary consumer redress principle. You could argue that the
FOS can take it up with its own fairness things, but there are cases

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
160</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000528"></a>Lindsay
Roy:</b> I want to return to financial education. I agree
wholeheartedly with Mark: the acid test is about, &#147;So
what&#148;? Product, yes, quantitative measures, yes, but surely it
is about process and qualitative measures. Improving financial
education is not only laudable, it is an imperative, but there are no
magic bullets or quick fixes. Are you aware of any notional or national
targets, or any benchmarks for improvement over a time scale? Would you
not agree that it is vital that we know how we might measure success
and, en route, how we might monitor progress towards that
success?</div>
<a name="091208118000294"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> As far as I am aware, targets and
benchmarks have not been set. The FSA is on record as saying that it
proposes to repeat its financial capabilities study, but that it does
not expect to produce a significant change quickly. That suggests that
they reasonably do not expect to see much next time around. If you look
at the sort of changes that we would like to see, there are really two
components. The first component concerns what is happening to defined
benefit pension schemes and with the rather alarming drop off in
protection&#151;life insurance and other kinds of insurance. A very
quick fix has to be put in place to encourage people to start saving
more and to protect themselves better. The longer term is definitely
educational and is about producing a generational shift in how people
behave. Both of those things have to be done, but we should set the new
education body some aggressive targets to change behaviour. If that
body does not achieve those targets, we will have to look and see
why.</div>
<a name="091208118000295"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> May I pick one particular area in
which&#151;if one takes Adam&#146;s approach to be the sensible
one&#151;you could actually measure progress? It would be to look at
annuities and how people shop around for them on retirement, which I
understand from Age Concern&#146;s money guides today, is actually
proving to be quite an issue for people with low incomes, who are
drawing small pension funds on retirement. That is an area where it is
possible to track the numbers shopping around and buying elsewhere. Of
course, it is difficult to tell what the right answer is. Some people
who shopped around might have been better off staying with their
existing provider. However, if one looks at market activity in that
sort of way, and also in regard to consumer education and
guidance&#151;there is a spectrum of need there&#151;you can start
to create a virtuous circle. It is not just about explaining the
industry to consumers, but consumers, through this
mechanism&#151;through the education body&#151;feeding back to the
industry about broader issues. The education body would not see them as
the voice of the consumer, but we think that they should have a
specific ability, in the Bill, to be able to make public
statements.</div>
<a name="091208118000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> The other thing is that we are not
necessarily starting from scratch. I said earlier that the CAB service
has been doing various bits of financial education work for quite a
long time and we have those pieces of work evaluated&#151;we get
external valuation. For instance, we were involved in the OFT Save Xmas
campaign and that was evaluated. Nearly 40 per cent. of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>the people participating had positive changes in
their savings decisions. Various other projects have gone back some
time after they have had some education done to them, as it
were&#151;participating in a project&#151;and asked people how that
has changed how they made decisions about savings and financial
products, and you can show some improvements.</div>
<a name="091208118000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lot of the
work that we do at the moment is funded by the private sector. To get
that money, we need to be able to demonstrate outcomes; we need to
demonstrate exactly what you are arguing&#151;that there is an
effect. The new body should look at how people have evaluated things,
the idea of having a strategic vision of what it is trying to achieve,
but that being based on some of the things that already exist. There is
evaluation work going on. We have a number of projects that have had,
or have, ongoing evaluation. A lot of the work going on on the ground
will now have that evaluation. That is something that the body needs to
take
on.</div>
<a name="091208118000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
161</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000529"></a>Lindsay
Roy:</b> And the evaluation is informing new proposed
development.</div><a name="091208118000299"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> Yes, there is
feedback.</div><a name="091208118000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> I would just like to add to that. The FSA
has, as we have heard, involved a number of bodies already delivering
advice to consumers. If that is going to be effective, it should act as
the lead body for all sorts of advice, so that there is some
co-ordination and they work together. I am thinking particularly about
pensions. For this body not to be able to give advice on pensions would
be a considerable failure, because most people see that one of the key
things to save for is their pension, so it should be a one-stop
shop.</div><a name="091208118000301"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> Helping people to understand what they
are buying has two dimensions. One is about educating people, so that
they know what they are getting, and shopping around and all the rest
of it. The other end of the funnel is about simplifying the products
and making them more transparent. I am always reminded of the fact that
in the days when we had VCRs, none of us could ever programme the VCR.
That was not solved by teaching us how to programme VCRs&#151;it was
solved by the industry developing products that did not need to be
programmed. It strikes me that there is much more that needs to be done
by the industry to simplify its products and to identify real
competitive edges, rather than identifying a number of features that
differentiate products but are not truly different, and competitive
benefits. The industry needs products that consumers with a
comparatively low degree of further education can understand. If we are
asking people to understand the products that are widely sold out there
when we are into many years and generations of education, more can be
done from the other end by the
industry.</div><a name="091208118000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
162</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000530"></a>John
Howell:</b> May I pursue that point? I asked the FSA what
success looks like for the consumer financial education body, and I
received a rather woolly answer; there was nothing precise there. I
want to put essentially the same question to you. The problem that I
have, of course, is that it is very easy to try to measure that success
in targets that lead to output-generated measures. What we are trying
to achieve is outcome-generated measures and outcome changes. Can you
try to put that in a broader context to show how you will get that
agreement between you, as a focus and a pressure on the new education
body so that it achieves real outcomes?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div><a name="091208118000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> I am trying to think about this. I think that
there are three levels to helping and supporting consumers with
financial services. The first is what you could call financial
capability, where your outcomes would be to ensure that all consumers
have at least a basic working understanding of the basic financial
terms. We see people who do not understand what an interest rate means
and or that it is good in savings and bad in credit and so on. We get
people coming into citizens advice bureaux saying, &#147;I&#146;ve
got this loan agreement, but what does it mean?&#148; Or they might
say, &#147;It is a secured loan,&#148; but they do not really know
what a secured loan is. We get people who have been sold things like
PPI&#151;payment protection insurance&#151;and they do not even
realise that they have been sold PPI, or what it does, and so
on.</div>
<a name="091208118000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there are
some outcomes there that you can look at. You can look at people who
have participated in things and ask how their perceptions have changed,
or you can do survey monitoring, and so on. You do that to look at
basic levels of understanding about financial skills and financial
knowledge. In addition, we may start to see in the longer term that our
levels of debt inquiry go down, because people are more aware of the
risks of debt and perhaps more able to budget, and things like
that&#151;some very big-wheel things.</div>
<a name="091208118000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
financial education provides what is called generic financial advice;
getting consumers ready to market. Do consumers have a better idea? For
instance, in credit, which is an area that I work with a lot, do people
understand the features of the credit card and what is unique about
that product as opposed to other products? Do they understand what they
would use that product for, as opposed to what they would use a
different type of product for? You can look at and measure how
people&#146;s understanding of those types of questions
changes.</div>
<a name="091208118000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
part is where things go wrong. Can we get people to understand that, if
things go wrong, they should come for advice earlier and get their
problems sorted more quickly? We can measure that as well. Very few
people come for advice about debt before they are actually in crisis;
people come when they are in crisis. If they had a better
understanding, we could get them in earlier and it would be less
expensive and harmful for them. We can measure that too.</div>
<a name="091208118000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">So you can
see that kind of progression of different levels of intervention. You
can look at each of those levels to see how people&#146;s perceptions
have changed as a result of an intervention. That is a bit woolly, but
I hope that it is not as woolly as the answer you got
before.</div>
<a name="091208118000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091208118000531"></a>John
Howell:</b> It is more precise than the FSA. You are ahead
there.</div>
<a name="091208118000309"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> In our sector, we have 350 Age Concern centres
around the country, most of them offering some form of information and
advice service. We are very aware that we need to prove to our funders
the value that our centres are delivering, so our centres are
developing ways of quantifying their value, for example, in terms of
benefit take-up. We would hope and expect that benefit take-up would
increase considerably, but it might also be possible even to come up
with other measures, for example, a measure of the number of people
making a will. There are quite a lot of smaller measures like that one
that we can use as targets. Indeed, perhaps even 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>budgetary savings could be measured. By taking a sort of
subject-by-subject approach in our research, we certainly hope to
demonstrate our worth.</div>
<a name="091208118000310"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> We must remember that the FSA kicked this
thing off only a few years ago and there is some evaluation going on.
The next stage is to build a proper evaluative programme to track the
short-term measures that we discussed to make change. That is quite
feasible to do, and it should be built into the requirement for
evaluating the performance of this body. Coming back to the point that
I made earlier and that we have discussed, we must build into that
evaluation a qualitative measure that the body is acting in an
independent way and as an effective consumer advocate in areas where
people need to be
educated.</div><a name="091208118000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
163</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000532"></a>John
Howell:</b> May I move on to a question about credibility? We
touched on the credibility of the educational products of the new body
and on the need for credibility in the board of the new body. We also
heard that the FSA was intending to take the current educators in the
FSA and move them lock, stock and barrel to the new body. Given the
patchy nature of the success of its educational efforts over the past
few years, does that really provide the credibility that the new body
needs?</div><a name="091208118000312"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> I find it hard to give a view on that
because, as I said earlier, it is very difficult to run the body in the
way in which we would like while we are part of the FSA. There are
undoubtedly some good people doing good work. They have had the last
couple of years of a large budget to spend, but it is difficult, given
the fact that the primary focus of the regulator has been on issues to
do with the system, not issues to do with consumer education, to see
what they might be capable of if it were entirely up to
them.</div><a name="091208118000313"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> May I pick up on confidence and financial
stability&#151;the issues to which the new body must have regard? I
really believe that there should be a counterbalancing duty to act in
the best interests of its users. Indeed, we have found that a lot of
people have gone from the third sector, for example, into the Financial
Services Authority, so the structural move of the whole body outside
will be quite an important signal to users that it is an independent
body. That is why it is very important that it should not have the word
&#147;authority&#148;, for example, in its title. It can often put
off people who are very reluctant and distrustful of
authority.</div><a name="091208118000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
164</b><a name="091208118000533"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): I am curious. We have
talked a lot about the changes that will be brought about by the Bill,
but I am interested in the earlier comments, which were certainly made
at the Treasury Committee, about the impervious nature of the Financial
Services Authority to consumer interests, and whether or not the
provisions in the Bill will take the FSA further away from the consumer
interest and whether we should be thinking in the Bill about doing
something to ensure that the FSA itself has a consumer voice within it.
I would be interested to hear the views of the panel.</div>
<a name="091208118000315"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> I think that we have been conscious since
the beginning of this year of a change in the FSA&#146;s approach to
meeting its objective for protecting the consumer interest. We have
higher-level discussions that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>are more concerned with policy issues than we have had in the past, and
we have seen a considerable change in its approach to enforcement and
in its willingness to confront the industry on issues that we think are
important. At that level, there has been a big change in the
FSA.</div>
<a name="091208118000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The extent
to which the change will be maintained in future if the climate moved
back at some point towards being more favourable to a light-touch
approach is not clear. If we look at what was happening three or four
years ago, there was a lot of pressure on the FSA not to over-regulate,
and we have seen the effect of that. I do not by any means think that
the change is guaranteed but, as we have seen&#151;certainly in the
past year&#151;there has been a very big change in the way in which
the FSA has approached dealing with consumer
protection.</div><a name="091208118000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
165</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000534"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> But that, in a sense, has been a response to market
conditions and the failures of regulation of the past. What I am
getting at is that one of the things we are removing is the
FSA&#146;s public awareness duty. Which? is a perfect example: you
have called in the past for direct consumer representation on the board
of the FSA. Should we at least consider ensuring that the FSA does not
become less consumer-friendly as a result of the passage of the Bill?
How could we go about doing
that?</div><a name="091208118000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> We have been encouraged by some change
in attitude&#151;or statement, if you like. We were pleased to see
two individuals appointed to the board recently who come much more from
a consumer perspective. We were disappointed that they were there as
individuals and it was not a formal introduction. They are but two
members of a board, although they are a voluble two, so perhaps they
will have more than their fair share of air
time.</div><a name="091208118000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
hope that it is not just window-dressing, because there are still some
fundamentals in the FSA&#146;s activities that need to change. The
biggest one for us&#151;so much of the problem stems from
this&#151;is around transparency and the narrow interpretation that
the FSA has of its powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act
to name those firms entering enforcement. We absolutely understand that
the FSA would not want to name firms that are under some form of
discussion or investigation, but when you are into enforcement, you
have gone beyond that
point.</div><a name="091208118000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to my mind what is a ridiculous case&#151;although that implies
a degree of amusement, which is far from the situation&#151;in which
four firms are going through enforcement over how they deal with
mortgage arrears but, because they are not named, the judges who are
looking at those firms&#146; repossession actions are unaware that
the FSA has any problem with how they are behaving. What we shall end
up with is what we had with that company that was named: people losing
their houses because the judges at the time did not know that the firm
was not behaving well. Enforcement came too late for those
individuals.</div><a name="091208118000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
certainly feel that there is a case to say something. We took an
opinion from Queen&#146;s Counsel, which was that the FSA interprets
its powers too narrowly. We have written to the Chancellor and others
asking, in the pre-Budget report, for the formal instigation of a
review of the FSA&#146;s interpretation of those powers. From that
refusal to name firms that are causing problems in the market, in the
name of ensuring the stability of those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>firms, we think so much else follows: so many of the problems of PPI
mis-selling, or our difficulty in advising the consumers we interact
with to avoid firms or a particular product. If the FSA was more
proactive, a large part of the problems that we all see further down
the line would go
away.</div><a name="091208118000322"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
166</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000535"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> May I come to Citizens Advice for a moment? A very
positive statement was made by the chief executive of the FSA, about it
taking more robust action to protect a consumer, among others. Yet, if
I reflect on the decision not to name and shame, that would appear to
suggest that the industry still has too much influence on FSA
decisions. How does Citizens Advice look on
that?</div><a name="091208118000323"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> I think we would agree with that. More
prosaically, the point about openness is important. We found two things
with the FSA. First, it is still learning to regulate a lot of the
things that we deal with: general insurance or PPI, together with
mortgages, are two big areas of consumer detriment that it has taken on
relatively
recently.</div><a name="091208118000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
things from PPI are instructive. First, when the FSA found problems in
the market, its initial approach was to write to the firms and ask them
to change. After a year, the firms had not changed. What we have seen
is a progressive type of thing&#151;people saying, &#147;Okay, we
have to do something a bit tougher&#148;. What would be useful for
us&#151;and this is the point&#151;is a measure to deal with the
FSA not being tough
enough.</div><a name="091208118000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
FSA approach was a bit like Sergeant Wilson from &#147;Dad&#146;s
Army&#148; saying, &#147;Would you mind awfully changing?&#148;
rather than, &#147;You have got to change and be better.&#148; What
triggers do people like us have to say to the FSA, &#147;No, you need
to do more; there are still problems.&#148; There are no external
triggers to make them do anything; they move at the pace they want to.
When the in-fashion thing was light touch, the FSA was light-touch; now
the fashion is more regulation, so there is more regulation. In a
year&#146;s time we could be back to light touch. Both those
positions may be wrong; what we want is effective regulation when it is
needed.</div><a name="091208118000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
first, what are the external triggers to make that happen? Secondly,
how open is the FSA? The FSA does an awful lot of good research work in
its thematic reviews, but it does not say much about the outcomes. With
the mortgage arrears thing, we know that they have taken a firm into
enforcement for things such as treating people badly with arrears
management and also for overcharging them for arrears charges. But we
do not have a very public statement saying what is fair in arrears
charging and what is not.</div>
<a name="091208118000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think
that there are things&#151;this goes back to the public awareness
point, the public education point&#151;that the FSA needs to be
better at, informing consumers and people like us about what it is
doing and the outcomes of what it is doing. If it says, &#147;This
firm has been fined for overcharging people in arrears, and this is why
we think they are overcharging&#148;, we can advise people we see and
say, &#147;Look, you may be being overcharged as well&#148;, and we
can complain about that.</div>
<a name="091208118000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
triggers are there to ensure that people like us, who get oversight
from people like you, stay regulated? Also, how can we make FSA be more
open and ensure that they actually say what they are doing, why they
are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>doing it, and have they looked at things like mortgage arrears targets
and if they have, what outcomes did they come to, and what do they
propose to do next? It is about setting that agenda, so they cannot
move along at the pace that suits where they
are.</div>
<a name="091208118000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
167</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000536"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> There have been many suggestions about things that
the FSA could change, and no doubt a dialogue is going on with various
organisations and individuals on how that should happen, but is there
anything that we can do in this Bill to assist in that process? I would
like to hear your comments.</div>
<a name="091208118000330"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> Section 348 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 is about the power that the FSA has to release
information. There is always an argument about how far it can go in
publicising information that it collects as a regulator and which may
or may not be fair to put into the public domain. To give some clarity
in that area would enable it, as an example, to give the names of
companies that are going into enforcement. As Peter said, that would be
a very big step
forward.</div>
<a name="091208118000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
168</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000537"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Thank you. I turn again to Which? You said earlier,
in relation to unsolicited or unrequested credit card cheques, that a
tiny number of people seem to take up the offer. Let me act as
devil&#146;s advocate for a moment. Let us assume that those
consumers are acting rationally. Even though they pay more and the
terms are worse, when they look around, they find the offer better than
anything else that they can find on the market because of their
vulnerability. Why should we bother getting rid of unrequested credit
card cheques?</div>
<a name="091208118000332"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> There are a number of reasons, and two
of them stand out. First, you have 296 million cheques going out every
year that have details printed on them, and the fraud implications
alone of that I would not like to contemplate. They are sent as a
separate letter, so you do not know you are getting them until they
come in the post, and a number of us are concerned about that
dimension.</div>
<a name="091208118000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
thing is the implications that that can have for individuals. For what
you propose as devil&#146;s advocate to be valid, there would have to
be a conscious, planned decision for an individual that that was the
best form of borrowing. That is not how it works with these
cheques.</div><a name="091208118000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
169</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000538"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Do you have any evidence in that
regard?</div><a name="091208118000335"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> My colleagues here will have more
direct evidence. To describe the psychological process, I think that
they are designed to be much more for someone who is
suffering&#151;possibly in debt, and certainly in financial hardship.
A cheque arrives through the post, and you are able simply to fill it
out for &#163;1,500&#151;a large amount&#151;and to cash it. It
is a temptation to see that as an easy way out, and I would argue that
that is psychologically more important than the idea that it is a
planned form of borrowing.</div>
<a name="091208118000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
170</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000539"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Perhaps whoever wants to respond further will take
on board the point about unrequested credit card limits. I believe that
it is much more important, and I suspect that it looms much larger. How
important is it that we consider not only credit card cheques but
credit card limits?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div><a name="091208118000337"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> It is very important. Here is an example: a
case from a CAB of a 70-year-old woman whose 81-year-old husband became
ill with cancer. They were put into a cycle of supplementing their
pension income by using credit cards. Every time they got to the limit,
it was raised by the creditor, and they were also sent credit card
cheques&#151;this pattern of practices was mentioned
earlier&#151;so they ended up horrendously in debt. You are right.
The point about credit card cheques that was made by Peter is that
people are being encouraged into borrowing, but they have not had time
to think about it properly and it might be harmful to them. That
applies even more so, I suppose, to credit card limit increases and
limit increases on other running account credit products, including
store cards and perhaps
overdrafts.</div><a name="091208118000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
range of different credit products have a limit that can be raised by a
lender unilaterally. We have seen case after case of people&#146;s
limit being raised, particularly when they are in financial
difficulties. We see people slowly going into a spiral of more and more
debt and then they get into using one credit card to pay down other
credit cards, an overdraft or a loan and, before you know it, you are
completely out of control. There is a pattern, and part of that is
unsolicited increases in credit card limits, which means that people
are getting more into debt and they are not being advised as to the
risks of that. Often they are in financial difficulty and the credit
card company is responding to that financial difficulty by saying,
&#147;Well, have some more credit.&#148; There is a pattern of
quite destructive
practices.</div><a name="091208118000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a general point, the unsolicited issue of credit is the kind of
practice that we need to address if we want to deal with the debt
levels we have seen over the past 10 years. So you are
absolutely right that credit limits in running account
credit&#151;credit cards in particular&#151;really need to be
addressed
urgently.</div><a name="091208118000340"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> The response the industry will give you
is, &#147;Actually, we use this. We give people a little bit of
credit and when they show they can manage it we give them a little bit
more, and it&#146;s a safe way into having a credit history.&#148;
What we are proposing does not prevent that practice at all. We are all
suggesting that people are told, &#147;This is how we want to manage
your account, so you can opt in to having your limit increased in this
way.&#148; That is still perfectly acceptable and that would be
permissible under what we propose. It is this other behaviour that
would be outlawed. The truth is that that is where they make their
money, so they do not want that bit
outlawed.</div><a name="091208118000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
171</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000540"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> May I turn to the consumer financial education body,
because someone mentioned earlier the inadequacies of the previous FSA
regime? There was a lot of discussion when the FSA was created by the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 about how much of the funding
available to the FSA should go into this area&#151;it was 1 per cent.
or 2 per cent., and that bedevilled it. What can you produce with 1 per
cent. or 2 per cent.? Nothing but a few pamphlets to be distributed
around. Although the amount has increased over the years, the success
has been to garner funding from other sections to wider your remit.
What are your views about how we can have a sophisticated funding
regime that will mean that this new body can rise to the challenge?
There is a significant challenge in respect of what we are asking it to
do in the longer term.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div><a name="091208118000342"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> Stability of funding is a key issue. Ad hoc
figures that increase and decrease a lot from year to year are probably
less easy to manage in terms of funding this sort of work than a stable
funding stream, because the set-up costs of any financial education
project can be high. It is important that the authority has the powers
to take in funding from a wide range  of sources, including the
credit industry, to lever in funding from other sources, potentially,
and to have a co-ordinating role to ensure that the money is used in
the most efficient way by drawing together all the different strands of
activity across the various bodies that are interested in this
area.</div><a name="091208118000343"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> It is the co-ordinating role that is
important, because there is already a lot of money being spent, or
being proposed to be spent, in this area and it should be joined up in
an effective
way.</div><a name="091208118000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
172</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000541"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> On that point&#151;I do not know if anyone has any
views&#151;I was particularly concerned because the industry,
clearly, will be a major funder for this project and that will probably
start off reasonably well. However, if the industry feels that the
challenge is such that it needs to increase the level of funding, I
suspect that it will begin to be more difficult to persuade. How do we
ensure we do not get bogged down in that sort of
difficulty?</div><a name="091208118000345"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> I think that the point that was made
earlier about evaluating the performance of this agency is quite
important, because the industry will fund it if the effect of the
agency is to get people to use the industry. If they do start saving
more and they do start buying protection, it has to be a very effective
way of promoting the industry. So, one would assume that the two things
are joined up. It is in the interests of consumers and it is also in
the interests of the industry&#151;as long as there is
competition.</div><a name="091208118000346"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> My colleagues who work in this area say they
have had long-standing relationships with some financial services
providers. We have been working with Prudential for nine years,
Barclaycard for six, and Nationwide and Abbey for three. So, there is
clearly an appetite among financial services providers to work with
people like us on financial education products. We have been working
for them for many years and producing outcomes that work, which we then
evaluate.</div>
<a name="091208118000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are
right that the industry will gripe if it thinks it is putting in money
that has nothing coming out of it. On the other hand, there are clearly
firms that see the benefit of this and are willing to invest money in
it. In relation to that kind of co-ordination view, hopefully what we
can do is to encourage more of that or lever in more money that will
support the good work that these firms are doing. Probably key to how
we evaluate it is that we have to demonstrate it is doing good stuff.
It is a case of building on a willingness that is certainly already
there.</div><a name="091208118000348"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
173</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000542"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But is it not the case that what will happen is
that businesses that currently fund your projects, Peter, on a
voluntary basis, will now have to contribute through the levy? That
will be an increased payment compared with the amount they currently
pay to the FSA. They will say, &#147;Well, we&#146;re paying
enough. We&#146;re giving all this money that&#146;s going towards
the CFEB so, CAB, we&#146;re going to cancel your
funding.&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div><a name="091208118000349"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> That is why the co-ordination approach is
very important, because there is already quite a lot of money going
into this and it is a matter of using it effectively. It should not be
an either/or situation, to the extent that the bodies actually regard
what the CAB is doing as a good job. It should carry on doing it and
continue to get funding. I would not like to see a situation where we
are simply switching funding from one organisation that is very
efficient to one that might be very
inefficient.</div><a name="091208118000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
174</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000543"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But that is the potential outcome here,
isn&#146;t it? Do you think that the Bill should be amended so that
where people are making a voluntary contribution towards the
initiative, they should be credited against their levy
payment?</div><a name="091208118000351"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> Well, that is not quite how it happens at
the moment, but last year, I think, the FSA put &#163;25
million into consumer education out of a total levy of whatever it
was&#151;a little more than 10 times that. So, in a sense that is how
they are now being represented and how the money is being spent. The
money may transfer, but that levy is in a sense already present within
the FSA&#146;s
budget.</div><a name="091208118000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
175</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000544"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> I do think that careful thought needs to go into
this. To take my own constituency, I have been to two different
schools: one where HBOS is doing its bit for consumer
education, and one where Barclays is. That is going on all over the
country, and it is all done voluntarily. We see it as part of
those firms&#146; overall effort to burnish their
reputation&#151;understandably so. But what happens when you start to
levy them to do that as a matter of course? Will they then say,
&#147;Well, all that other stuff goes by the wayside&#148;? There
needs to be some very careful consideration to make sure that we
maximise the amount that is going into that
area.</div><a name="091208118000353"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Tutton:</b></i> I suppose that the advantage of the levy is
that it does give us stability, and it will also probably provide a
greater resource. In terms of the credibility of the new
organisation&#151;this point was raised earlier&#151;we would like
to see a step change in the provision of consumer education and in the
way that consumers can be helped better to understand financial
products, so that they do not get into terrible difficulty with things
like debt and mis-selling. That probably is not going to come about
through putting in money here and there, welcome and productive though
that is. Those are things that you need to balance against each
other.</div><a name="091208118000354"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> I also think that this issue is about an
independent trusted source, which is something that an individual brand
cannot necessarily provide. That is very important to rebuilding
confidence in using the industry. If I were running that kind of
business, I would be very interested in funding something that was
genuinely independent, and that would draw people into our business who
would otherwise not come
in.</div><a name="091208118000355"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> May I also pick up one of the issues to do with
smaller, voluntary funded schemes? Unless a large amount of money is
devoted over a long period of time, too often the aim is to produce a
particular resource that is easy and relatively cheap, without the
follow-through. That is really where we need to turn this whole thing
around, so that we have that co-ordination and can actually build it
into the evaluation.</div>

176</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000546"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> Some unkind people might look at key aspects of the
Bill&#151;such as the tripartite committee, for example, which did
not work and which we are trying to make better&#151;and they might
say that what the Bill proposes is the same committee, but with a
different name.</div>
<a name="091208118000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jane, in
your evidence you say that although the Financial Services Authority
has done good work in putting financial capability on the map, an
independent body is now needed. Given that an independent body is
needed, some unkind people will say, in relation to the Bill,
&#147;Well, they said we are taking this duty or responsibility away
from the FSA and giving it to the new body, but the new body is
embedded in the FSA.&#148; The staff will, the FSA assures us, be
transferred lock, stock and barrel, and there is even mention of the
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 in
the Bill. The FSA is appointing the board, and it is allowing the
Chancellor to have a say in appointing a chair and a deputy. It is
collecting the levy&#151;and charging the board for doing
so&#151;setting the budget and reviewing how efficient the body is. I
asked the FSA how independent it regarded that to be. You would not
have to be unkind to say that it does not sound very independent at
all. Why are you so enthused about this new era in the
field?</div><a name="091208118000359"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> That is one reason why we think the new body
should have a duty to act in the interests of its users: to buttress
that
independence.</div><a name="091208118000360"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
177</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000547"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> You say that that independence has to be
buttressed, but the FSA is appointing the board. The Committee has
heard evidence assuring us that the appointment of the staff would be
by public advert, coming through the FSA. I am not sure there is
anything in the Bill that states that the board will actually sit down
to interview and appoint staff. I presume that the human resources
function in the FSA will do that. The whole thing appears to be an FSA
body with a different name. Where do you think that independence is
going to come
from?</div><a name="091208118000361"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> I must admit that we had thought that it should
be operationally independent of the FSA, and certainly that would
include the HR
function.</div><a name="091208118000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091208118000548"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> Have you seen something in the Bill that I have
not?</div>
<a name="091208118000363"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> No. The other thing I would pick out is the
annual plan. The body does have a duty to consult widely on the annual
plan, including with consumers. Looking beyond the governance
structure, the other reason why we think an independent body is
necessary is that people externally see that sort of Government-led and
regulator-led body and decide that it is another body that they do not
want to engage with.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
178</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000549"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> I think that we can all agree&#151;no, we could
not all agree&#151;that there is a strong case for an independent
body, but I keep coming back to the question: is this what you call an
independent
body?</div><a name="091208118000365"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> Perhaps I could cast a little light here.
First of all, the people who have been working on this in the FSA do
have a lot of knowledge, so it would be a pity to lose that. What you
are really talking about is the leadership in this particularly area.
Those in the leadership have to see themselves as independent champions
of the consumer, and the question is whether the FSA appoints those
kind of
people.</div><a name="091208118000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="091208118000550"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> It is a good question, isn&#146;t
it?</div><a name="091208118000367"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adam
Phillips:</b></i> Yes. Those people should be appointed by a
Nolan process, so that there are independent people involved in the
appointment. As I said about the Financial Ombudsman
Service, which is similarly tied to the FSA, with that body they seem
to have created a relatively independent board, which has caused them
some stress at times. If they pursue the same process, it should be
quite
acceptable.</div><a name="091208118000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of who else it would report to if it was not part of the
FSA, you begin to look around and you can see that it could be aligned
with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills or the
Treasury.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
179</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000551"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> May I just ask you about that because you have led
me on to a very direct question? If we were setting this body up and we
forgot the history of it, but knew that there was a lump of money that
was going to be able to be levied on the industry to set it up, would
you embed it in a Government Department or
agency?</div><a name="091208118000371"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> I can answer that. In our response to the
Thoresen review, we argued for an independent body to start with, but
it was a pragmatic decision. I think that we have been consistent all
along in wanting that independent
body.</div><a name="091208118000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
180</b><b class="B"><a name="091208118000552"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> In paragraph 17 of your evidence, you say that
proposed new schedule 1A to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
must ensure that there is strong consumer representation. I think that
is sensible advice or a sensible request. Does the Bill give you full
confidence that that will
happen?</div><a name="091208118000373"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Vass:</b></i> I think we would like specific consumer
representation on the board. That is an area where we have raised some
concerns.</div><a name="091208118000374"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Vicary-Smith:</b></i> We would like to see it written into
