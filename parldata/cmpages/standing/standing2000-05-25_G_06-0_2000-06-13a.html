</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 5, in page 5, line 18, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The commission shall make information about Part II services provided in their locality available to local authorities, health authorities and community health councils.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> As this is the first time that I have served under your chairmanship of a Standing Committee, Mr. Illsley, may I say how much I look forward to our proceedings? We expect to make good progress this morning.

<P>
The amendment is concerned with making information available. The clause states that information should be made available to the public which, according to the explanatory notes, should be provided to support consumers of part II services. We support the intention, but how will information be made available to the public? We discussed the star rating system in the constituency of the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs Humble). That is one way of presenting information to the public, because it gives an idea of the range of services that are available in care establishments, but how will information be made available in a wider context? Will there be a tabular or classification system of grading services to give the public an idea of what they might expect from different establishments?

<P>
As someone whose father is approaching the age of 92 in residential care, I know only too well how important such information is for offspring who are trying to find the best establishment for a member of their family. They need to consider where their relative will be most comfortable and what services will be available that address his or her specific needs. For example, chiropody services are important for older people with diabetes. Will the information be available in libraries or will I have to request it from the local authority? Will the National Care Standards Commission proactively publish, on a national and regional basis, information that is readily intelligible to members of the public so that it helps them to make choices about care provision?

<P>
The amendment would make such information available to health authorities, which I am sure is the Government's intention, but there should be no doubt about that. Health authorities need to have access to information because they are party to choices about where people receive specific types of care. It is clear from amendment No. 5 that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) is thinking along the same lines. Other groups have a duty to provide care to the public and to help them to make the right choices. That amendment specifically mentions community health councils, which we support in their quest for the information that will enable them to advise members of the public on the right place to receive service. I have found in my constituency work that any interaction with the CHCs tends to be restricted to cases where a complaint has been made about the quality of service received. If the CHCs have good-quality information, that could prevent the problems that we as constituency Members of Parliament become involved in. It is important that the different authorities should have access to information.

<P>
Will health authorities and community health councils be privy to the results of inspections of individual providers? What process will ensue when inspectors find a problem? How rapidly will health authorities and community health councils be informed of the detection of a problem? This is an important point. If there is too long a delay between detection and information being passed on to those in a position to prevent others from facing the same problem, the result will be more complaints.

<P>
The main thrust of the clause is to promote the improvement of services. That aim reinforces the need for bodies such as health authorities to be provided with the information collected by inspectors. In that way, best practice can be disseminated from one establishment to another. Overall improvements will be made if the bodies responsible for raising standards are kept informed. I look forward to receiving practical answers from the Minister on how the public will be informed. It is all very well to declare in the Bill that the public will be informed, but sometimes it is hard to locate or obtain information. I hope that the Minister will answer in practical terms how that can best be achieved.

<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I very much follow what the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman) has said, but on balance I prefer amendment No. 5, as it is slightly more specific. The Bill contains a commitment to the publication of information for England. As Members of Parliament, we are well aware of national reports. They arrive in beautiful, glossy form and contain tables that are often meaningless other than as part of trends surveys that give an overview of the nation. As an individual Member of Parliament, I am more interested in information relevant to my locality.

<P>
Amendment No. 5 specifies that information should be made available on a local basis to the local authorities, the health authorities and the community health council. The Isle of Wight has a good, positive community health council, which is interested not only in complaints but in quality. The Bill would make a valuable contribution if it resulted in the public being informed on local matters through their public representatives. I hope that the Minister will be more specific than the commitment made in the bland phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make information about  services provided in England available to the public.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could be a totally meaningless exercise. I hope and trust that the Government intend to produce something more useful.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> Like the hon. Member for Meriden, I look forward to your stewardship of our proceedings, Mr. Illsley.

<P>
The amendments have been tabled with a friendly intent, to try to extract more information about the Government's intention to publicise information that will be available to the commission. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight said that he preferred amendment No. 5 to amendment No. 119. I prefer clause 7 to both.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Is that perhaps because the Bill does not commit the Government to doing anything other than making a bland report?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is not a fair analysis. I want to set out my thoughts on the amendments. Both amendments are unnecessary, because, as the hon. Gentleman said, the commission is under a duty to make information about part II services public. That will include making information available to health and social service providers and to other organisations such as community health councils. Local authorities are already under an obligation to publish information on social care and related services in their respective areas under the caring for people policy guidance issued in 1990 under the previous Administration. That guidance has been reinforced in the Government's better care, higher standards initiative, which is to be strengthened in the forthcoming fair access to care services initiative.

<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden asked a number of specific questions about the Government's intention to make such information publicly available. The information will certainly include full details about the services covered by the Bill. She asked whether information about chiropody services would be included, which is certainly possible. All that information will be available on the internet and freely accessible at the 80 English offices of the National Care Standards Commission. Information will also be sent to anyone who requests it.

<P>
The hon. Lady asked whether the information will be available in public libraries; I hope that it will, because it would be a positive and useful step. She also asked whether reports on individual care home inspections will be made public. She might not have had the chance to read clause 30, but she will find that subsections (5) and (6) deal with that matter. We shall further discuss the adequacy of those provisions when we reach that part of the Bill-perhaps next week.

<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight was labouring under the impression that we were reluctant to make provision in the Bill for information about part II services to be made publicly available and that we had produced a bland clause that did not commit the Government to anything. He misreads the Government's intentions and the Bill. We want that information to be publicly available. Making it as widely available as possible would serve a useful purpose. We would certainly expect the National Care Standards Commission to discharge its duties under part II in that spirit. There is no purpose in constructing new legislation that would deny the public access to important information. We want the commission to be open and proactive in its dissemination of information. I hope that the amendments were intended as probing amendments to try to extract information about the Government's intentions. I hope that I have been able to reassure both hon. Members about our intentions, and I hope that they will not feel it necessary to press the amendments to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for letting me down somewhat gently on clause 30. He is aware, I am sure, that the Opposition work on slender resources and that our life is somewhat hand to mouth. However, I hope to return to the matter when we reach clause 30, because my experience of debating the inspection processes instigated under the Food Standards Act 1999 is that, in practical terms, quite a lot of things can be done to ensure that members of the public are aware of why an inspection is occurring and of its consequences.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Although making reports available on the internet is undoubtedly the way forward, quite a lot of older consumers are not conversant with modern information technology and are therefore unlikely to use such resources. I am pleased to hear that the information may be available on request, but consumers of such data often look for them in their public library. I still contend that the National Care Standards Commission will have to find a simple way, such as a star rating system, of helping ordinary people to understand what may be expected. Chiropody was mentioned. An older person may choose an establishment that offers chiropody services, but may not be aware that he or she will have to bear a cost because the local authority no longer pays for that treatment. Such details can be very important to somebody who is deciding which service to use.

<P>
The Minister is right: the amendment is designed principally to probe the Government's intentions. Funnily enough, I did not see it and amendment No. 5 as mutually exclusive. I am certainly not in the business of a rather childish game of whose amendment is better.

<P>
In the light of the Minister's assurance that health authorities will be a recipient of the information, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am almost reassured by the Minister, who correctly said that local authorities were under an obligation to take note of published information relating to their areas. Indeed, clause 30 specifies publication of individual inspections. Amendment No. 5 would ensure that the National Care Standards Commission publishes data that can be related to a locality, as the Bill does not specify a duty for the commission to publish data that are relevant to the local authorities and organisations that it lists. Will the Minister give me an assurance that it will be required to tabulate and list outcomes of inspections and investigations for individual localities? If he does so, I shall be reassured.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In view of the fact that debate on the amendment has continued after the hon. Member for Meriden asked leave to withdraw it, the Question must now be put.

<P>
Amendment negatived.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 123, in page 5, line 22, leave out ``States's'' and insert ``State's''.-[Mr. Hammond.]

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and the Commission shall publish any such advice or information given.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 124, in page 5, line 23, leave out ``give'' and insert ``publish''.

<P>
No. 129, in page 6, line 5, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(12) In this section, a requirement to publish advice or information given to the Secretary of State shall be interpreted to mean making that advice or information widely available to representative organisations likely, in the opinion of the Commission, to be interested in it and placing a copy of it in the Library of the House of Commons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) is fast gaining a reputation for keeping the Ministers in fear of not getting legislation triple-checked. It is good for such details to be picked up.

<P>
The amendments are designed to increase transparency in the operation of the National Care Standards Commission and its interaction with the Secretary of State. It is important that, when the commission is asked by the Secretary of State to give information, that information is published and others are clear about why it is being given. The motivation behind a request for information by the Secretary of State should be clear. Why was information asked for and what did it reveal? What can others learn from the exchange of information between the Secretary of State and the commission?

<P>
One of the overall aims of the clause is the improvement of the quality of services provided; transparency can only be helpful. Other providers might be affected by the information sought, gathered and acted on. They could change their way of operating if they were aware of exchanges of information. They might prevent adverse consequences due to a delay in making changes or an unforeseen error in the interpretation of regulations that they had sought to apply.

<P>
Amendment No. 124 would require a small change to make it explicit that information should be published. The amendment serves as another example of our drive for transparency. Why should not all providers know what advice has been given by the commission to the Secretary of State, especially if the information concerned changes that would secure improvements in part II services?

<P>
Such a provision might serve as an early warning mechanism of changes to minimum standards. There are bound to be changes to minimum standards as the parties learn together in the early years of the commission's operation. The earliest signal of changes might be an exchange of information between the Secretary of State and the commission. We know from ``Fit for the Future'' that standards might entail costs to service providers, who might have to change the structure of a building or the way in which a service is provided. The earlier the warning of an impending change to a standard, the better. Service providers would be able to budget for making adjustments before the change became mandatory and would be able to spread costs over a longer period.

<P>
Amendment No. 129 would ensure that information collected was made as widely available as possible to representative organisations with an interest in that information. The Opposition might be classified as an interested party. We have sought to ensure that a copy of the information is placed in the Library.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady referred to the House of Commons Library. What about the House of Lords Library?

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The point is valid. I have no objection to that Library receiving information as well. I rarely think of going near the place because I do not have access to it. Our spokesmen in the Lords are in the same position as us. We would heartily welcome a Government amendment to that effect.

<P>
The early phase of the introduction of the National Care Standards Commission will be critical. The importance of amendment No. 129 stems from the fact that hon. Members and Members of another place will want to examine closely the working of the Bill that we will have had a part in enacting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does my hon. Friend agree that the important point on which to probe the Government concerns whether information given to the Secretary of State should be available not only to interested parties but to Members of Parliament who are charged with scrutinising the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> That is absolutely right. What we are debating is an empty box; we have little idea about what the regulations will consist of. My hon. Friend has reminded me that we shall effectively be conducting retroactive scrutiny of the outworking regulations to which we currently have no access. Above all, as part of our drive for transparency in the working of the National Care Standards Commission, and given the history of the areas over which it will have inspection jurisdiction, the improvements that we know need to be made in services, and in particular those for children, should be brought to light. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views about a drive to increase transparency in the way that the Secretary of State interacts with the National Care Standards Commission.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I welcome the conversion of the Conservative Front Bench to the cause of freedom of information and open government. The spirit behind the amendments is excellent and we support them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Charitably, I assume that the amendment was tabled not with the intention that the words concerned should be included in the Bill, which would be a mistake, but to obtain an explanation of how the Government intend to proceed. We expect the National Care Standards Commission to want to operate openly, and its annual report and other communications will provide it with opportunities to do so. However, it is a generally important principle that in some cases advice of the kind that the hon. Member for Meriden has referred to would need to be given to the Secretary of State in confidence. She is a business woman and will understand the need for commercially sensitive information, for example, to be communicated between the commission and the Secretary of State. The amendment would make that impossible.

<P>
I do not say that what I have outlined would be a routine problem, but it is something that members of the Committee should tackle openly and honestly. That can be done in a way that preserves the spirit of openness that pervades the Bill. I hope that other, later amendments will probe our intentions in this regard. I am happy to discuss the issue. There is a way of preserving openness in the commission's operation while enabling it to do its job properly. We can, I am sure, all think of instances in which we would want the commission to be able to advise the Secretary of State freely, without concern that the information would become publicly available at an inopportune moment and damage businesses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the Minister accept that, in the sectors that we are discussing, quite a lot of information is routinely gathered and published by private sector consultancies and are widely respected and quoted by the Government and other bodies? Does he acknowledge that, during the saga, or perhaps I should say fiasco, of the ``Fit for the Future?'' consultation process, we saw the damage that can be caused when ill-founded rumours and suppositions circulate? Does not that support the argument for transparency?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, it does, but we are discussing the Bill. The hon. Gentleman's objective need not be served only by the amendment. Any Government would want to operate in the same way, including any future Conservative Government, if one were to be elected.

<P>
<B>Maria Eagle </B>(Liverpool, Garston): That is hardly likely.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It may be unlikely, but that is what would happen.

<P>
Without wanting unreasonably to undermine Conservative Members' arguments, let me point out that in my position they would want to preserve the possibility at least of communicating advice confidentially to the Secretary of State. We do not expect the clause to work in that way routinely. We expect the National Care Standards Commission to operate transparently along the lines described by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. However, I am sure that, on reflection, the hon. Member for Meriden would accept the need, in some cases, for the advice to be available confidentially. The amendment would make that impossible, so there are good reasons not to accept it.

<P>
Even if we were to accept the principle, there would be difficulties in accepting amendment No. 129. They are not only of a drafting nature-I do not want to get involved in that argument. The amendment uses a narrow definition of the word ``publish''. The hon. Member for Meriden gamely overcame one difficulty by saying that she hoped that the House of Lords Library would also receive a copy, but that is not provided for. The National Care Standards Commission would probably want to provide information more widely than described in the amendment.

<P>
The amendments present a problem and I shall not advise my hon. Friends to accept them. I hope that the hon. Lady will understand that while we want the National Care Standards Commission to operate openly, we need, at least in the context of commercial sensitivity, and perhaps in others, to reserve the opportunity for it to advise the Secretary of State confidentially. Otherwise it would be harder for it to do its job properly.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> Of course I perfectly understand the Minister's point about the commercial sensitivity of some information. The last thing that I would want would be for a perhaps false accusation of failure of provision, against one of the many small providers-effectively family-run businesses-that provide the relevant care services to be widely disseminated before being proved. We believe in the principle that a party is innocent until proved guilty. The same principle applies to the Food Standards Agency: as soon as the inspectors arrive in the butcher's shop, no one wants to buy the sausages.

<P>
I entirely accept the need to be sensitive commercially. However, the spirit of the amendments is one of tackling the serious problems that have arisen in the past involving the covering up of gross failure and misconduct in service provision, especially in the care of children. A balance is needed to enable a torch to be shone into those dark areas without compromising the commercial operation of the care provider. I accept that the Minister will try to strike that balance.

<P>
I apologise for the inadequate drafting on the point about publication. However, it is encouraging to me that when the Minister pointed out my omission with respect to the question of a report being placed in the House of Lords Library, he said that the correct interpretation of the clause was that the Government intended wider publication. That is an important clarification and concession towards our principle that the information should be more widely available. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 5, line 28, leave out ``and'' and insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) the impact of minimum standards set out in any statements under section 22 on supply or cost of Part II services in England; and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It is important that the amendment be seen in conjunction with the arguments that my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden has been advancing for the widespread dissemination of the advice that the commission gives the Secretary of State. In particular, I am concerned about the advice that the commission may give under subsection (5). Under that subsection, it has the right to report off its own bat, as it were, to the Secretary of State on issues about which it is concerned. That power is distinct from the power to report to the Secretary of State on matters that he has directed it to examine. Having that power, along with a requirement to publish the advice given to the Secretary of State, makes the commission a powerful watchdog. Within the confines of the Bill, it will be able to study the environment in which it operates, identify problems that need to be tackled, investigate them, report on them to the Secretary of State and publish its findings. A considerable need exists for that role. Given the structures created by the Bill, that is a worthwhile role for the commission.

<P>
The amendment would inject into the list of areas on which the commission may advise the Secretary of State in subsection (5) the impact of the minimum standards set out in statements by the Minister under section 22. It should be remembered that those statements would not be subject to any parliamentary scrutiny. The amendment would allow the commission to advise the Secretary of State on the impact of such statements on the supply of cost of part II services in England. The amendment would mean that a body would exist to examine the impact of minimum standards, how they would affect the cost of the sector and what implications they would have on the availability of capital to providers. The commission might want to consider the wider impact of proposed staffing ratios or staffing requirements, given the considerable skills shortages not only in social care, but also in nursing.

<P>
Secondly, we wish to recognise the fact that quality costs money. The Government have given no estimate of the cost of implementation under the provisions of clause 22. Have the Government set themselves a self-denying ordinance-a maximum amount that they are prepared to incur by way of additional costs?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has used a similar argument on other occasions. Perhaps there is a simple explanation why that has not happened. The national minimum required standards may not have been finalised, so it is impossible to estimate their cost.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If the Minister is giving a steer as to why he has been reluctant to produce a global figure, then I am reassured by his words. That implies that he has costed individual standards and possible outcomes. Perhaps when we deal with clause 22, he may be able to enlighten us on one of the important issues that is not covered in the Bill; what it will cost and how it will be paid for.

<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to permit the commission to focus on the impact of standards on costs and, therefore, on likely availability, and allow the commission to report to the Secretary of State on that issue. It is a matter of transparency. The general public and service providers need to be able to compare minimum standards-either in draft form or promulgated-and what the commission says about compliance costs, with Minister's announcements on funding for local authority social services departments. That would give us an idea of a statement's net impact on provision. It is important to recognise that this is not a one-off exercise.

<P>
The Government will produce a comprehensive set of national minimum standards when the Bill becomes law. Attention will focus on those and a great deal of work will be done to establish what they are likely to cost. I have no doubt that the Department of Health and representatives of private sector providers who have to comply with the standards will produce widely different estimates. A semi-autonomous body that is a separate source of information on possible costs would help to inform what might become a polarised debate.

<P>
The initial statement will not be the last. Governments will want to develop the standards and issue additional statements on previously excluded services. It is important that there is a mechanism to attach a proper estimate of costs to the standards. Amendments to clause 22 might address that issue, but the Committee should consider the wisdom of giving the commission the power to report on this matter to the Secretary of State and, as the drift of our earlier amendments implied, a wider audience.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I understand why the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment, but it makes me anxious because it would give the Government a commission to hide behind when they have to make political decisions on standards. The commission has an advisory role. Affordability should be the responsibility of Ministers. When we debated the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Meriden waxed lyrical about affordability not being part of its remit. It is equally the case that affordability should not be part of the commission's remit. Clearly, it is important, and it would be foolish for the commission not to have regard to the effect of the standards that it is setting, but affordability is a wider issue. Advice will be available from other sources. I firmly believe that Ministers must decide on standards and be accountable for their consequences when they appear in regulation.

<P>
I look forward to hearing the Minister's response. I understand the reason for the amendment, but I am anxious that it will not achieve what we want.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> If I accepted the amendment and if the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge found himself in my shoes, he would want to remove it from the Bill. I suspect that it is a classic Opposition-style amendment, designed to give the impression that the hon. Gentleman is in favour of a particular course of action-a course of action that is allowed to him only through the luxury of opposition.

<P>
I take it that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight is speaking against the amendment. I am grateful that he should have highlighted some of the inconsistencies in the Opposition's attitude to the amendment and to other provisions on which we have had similar debates.

<P>
The amendment would increase the remit of the commission's functions to gather information that does not fall naturally within its province. The impact of standards to be set under clause 22 will be assessed when they are published for consultation. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge rightly identified that as a proper responsibility of Government. We would obviously comply with the clearly established framework for carrying those impact assessments.

<P>
Developments in supply are related to a complex range of factors, some of which are unrelated to the national minimum standards. They might include changes in policy that take account of the preferences of service users. They might even include property prices and the availability of trained workers. In particular, cost factors, which are mentioned in the amendment, may relate partly to standards but also to other factors such as efficiency, competition between providers and the best value commissioning role of local authorities.

<P>
The amendment confuses the respective responsibilities of Government and the National Care Standards Commission. It is not the commission's job to draw up standards; it is the responsibility of the Secretary of State. It is the job of the Government, not of the commission, to provide a proper impact assessment. The amendment tries to shift that responsibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Do I take it that the Minister would be sympathetic to an amendment to clause 22 that required a Minister publishing a statement of minimum standards to publish with it a cost impact assessment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman made that mistake on Second Reading, when he and the shadow Secretary of State got their knickers in a bit of twist-I say that, Mr. Illsley, in the best parliamentary sense. They did not understand the distinction between the national minimum required standards and the Bill's regulation-making powers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Yes, we did.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> With respect, they did not. The regulatory impact assessment should be made in relation to the regulations that give effect to the national minimum required standards. The standards do not take effect on their own. They do not operate in limbo; they do not hang there and somehow magically take effect. They take effect through the regulation-making powers in clause 21. The hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand that. We shall publish the regulatory impact assessment when we publish the draft regulations that will give effect to the national minimum required standards.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> With respect to the Minister, clause 22(4) provides that the standards will take effect by being ``taken into account'' in a series of decisions that are made under that provision. If the Minister is picking me up on my use of language, perhaps I should not have used the phrase ``regulatory impact assessment''. If I had said minimum standards impact assessment, would the Minister be more favourably inclined to what I propose?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I would not and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not surprised at that. He is arguing that, at some point in the process, a proper assessment of the costs of implementing the changes should be made. It will be; it will be part of the regulatory impact assessment. We cannot possibly develop regulations outwith the existing framework for measuring the possible burden of regulations on business. We shall, of course, stick to that. I hope that Opposition Members do not doubt that.

<P>
The argument is about who should do the job and when. We are clear, as is the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, that it is the proper responsibility of Government, not of the commission, because it is not charged with the responsibility of devising the national minimum required standards. That work will be done, it will be published and everybody will have a chance to comment on it. The amendment is inappropriate and would require the commission to do work for which the Government are properly responsible. We intend to discharge that responsibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> With respect, I think that the Minister is presuming a little too much by telling me what I would do in his place. I do not have the fear of information that he attributes to me. The amendment would merely allow the National Care Standards Commission to bring information to the Secretary of State's attention and to place it in the public domain when it thinks that it is appropriate to do so. We are discussing a theme that is likely to recur, not only during the passage of the bill, but long after it has received Royal Assent and standards and regulations are being developed. The impact of minimum standards, as well as regulations about which the Minister also spoke, will be felt in the costs of a service and thus its availability, and/or in the prices that local authority social services departments will have to pay for it, which will, as a proportion of fixed amount of resources, define the number of placements that can be made.

<P>
We do not misunderstand the distinction between the statements of minimum standards. The Minister said that minimum standards would be incorporated by regulation, which means that they have two roles to play in the architecture of the Bill. They will be incorporated specifically through the regulations and through clause 22(4), which ensures that they will be taken into account in proceedings occurring in relation to various other procedures defined in the Bill. I take it that that means outwith the specific requirements of the regulations, otherwise the provision is redundant.

<P>
The Minister appeared to tell us that we could rest assured that regulations that specifically relate to the minimum standards will be introduced at some stage, accompanied by a proper regulatory impact assessment. I do not see that requirement in the Bill, but I am happy to accept his assurance that such an assessment will be made available before we debate the regulations, and that it will include the statement of minimum standards. Of course, that implies that the statement will be produced in its final form before we debate the regulations that give effect to it. The Minister appears to be reassuring us on all of those points, although he may want to clarify his remarks. I see that he does not. No doubt, we shall return to the issue when we debate clauses 21 and 22. I am grateful to the Minister for his comments, which will result in our having a better informed debate on those clauses. For the moment, however, it is expedient not to press the point, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 5, line 32, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Secretary of State shall by regulations define the respective responsibilities of the Commission and the Social Services Inspectorate and shall specify arrangements for co-operation between them.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is designed to clarify the respective responsibilities of the National Care Standards Commission and the social services inspectorate. I make no secret of the fact that the Association of Directors of Social Services has expressed to me its concerns about the need to clarify its current inspection role and the standing of that role within the new geography that will be introduced by the establishment of the National Care Standards Commission. Obviously, one of our aims is to try to prevent unnecessary duplication, but that does not mean that we think that there should be no duplication at all. Some may be necessary-the social services inspectorate may carry out its inspection from an angle that differs slightly from that of the commission-but there is a need to make clear their respective roles. That is why we would add to the clause a requirement for their respective responsibilities to be defined in regulation. We must be sure that the powers exercised by inspectors under the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 are transferred by a means such as the use of protocols, so that the power of the social services inspectorate to carry out necessary investigations is not weakened.

<P>
Opposition Members were a little concerned by an earlier debate about the structure of the National Care Standards Commission and devolution to local level. We are anxious that that might result in some degree of absorption of local inspection provision and that the local offices of the commission might eventually become indistinguishable from other facilities available locally. Such a structure would not encourage public perception of the commission as a new body that is being introduced to address shortcomings that have arisen previously.

<P>
How does the Minister expect social services inspectors and the commission's inspectors to co-operate at local level? Will those inspectors sometimes be the same people, because the current inspectors have been absorbed into the local commission office? How can we be sure that care providers will understand clearly that they are being inspected by the inspectors of the National Care Standards Commission, rather than those of the social services inspectorate? Any blurring of those lines will not help the credence that is given to the commission. Furthermore, providers will not be helped if they are not clear about the angle from which the inspection is conducted.

<P>
The amendment seeks to clear up the relationship between the social services inspectorate and the commission. The matter becomes much more pertinent in part III, but part II covers a number of inspections that are currently carried out by social services inspectors. That is why we think that it is right to discuss the relationship at this stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Again, I assume that the amendment was tabled in order to probe the Government's intentions, in this case by seeking to establish the respective roles of the National Care Standards Commission and its inspectors and those who currently undertake work on behalf of the chief inspector of social services and the social services inspectorate.

<P>
At the end of her remarks, the hon. Lady asked a specific question with which I shall deal first, while I still remember it. She asked whether we envisaged that the social services inspectorate would somehow transfer over to the National Care Standards Commission and operate under its umbrella in future. The answer is, we do not, for the simple reason that the social services inspectorate and the commission will perform discreet and separate roles. That is why the amendment is unnecessary, although I hope that the hon. Lady will be reassured if I explain exactly why that is so.

<P>
The commission's responsibilities are clearly set out in the Bill and in regulations made under it. Essentially, its main responsibility is to regulate social care services and private voluntary health care. In contrast to the social services inspectorate, it is a professional division of the Department of Health. It supports the Secretary of State for Health in carrying out the Department's work and exercising his statutory powers. The social services inspectorate is not a separate legal entity. The Secretary of State is already able to control the work of the inspectorate without the need for regulations. The amendment would give the Secretary of State new powers to make regulations even though the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge have spent the past 20 minutes arguing that the Bill should provide fewer regulation-making powers.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> To settle that matter, it is not that we are in favour of having no regulation: we recognise the need for necessary regulation, but we are not in favour of unnecessary regulation.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> With respect, the hon. Lady has misunderstood my point. We are not arguing about regulation but about regulation-making powers. The hon. Lady objected vociferously and articulately, but at some length, to the regulation-making powers in the Bill, but has popped up today with a new regulation-making power that is profoundly unnecessary because the Secretary of State already has the power to direct the work of the social services inspectorate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I dispute the Minister's suggestion that we have argued that point at length. I assure him that, so far in Committee, nothing has been discussed at length. In tabling specific amendments at this stage in the Bill's consideration to give the Secretary of State regulation-making powers, we are testing Minister's opinion on the subject, with a view to tabling a more specific new clause that does not involve the Secretary of State, but seeks to define the relationship between the social services inspectorate and the commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We look forward to the opportunity to debate such a new clause. I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman advice about drafting, but the social services inspectorate does not exist as a separate legal entity, so it would be very difficult to devise legislation that applies to something that does not legally exist.

<P>
We should be clear about another important difference. The social services inspectorate's key role is to assess the performance of local councils with social services responsibilities. The social services inspectorate will not inspect individual service providers. That is the commission's role, which is set out precisely in the Bill, so there is no doubt about the division of responsibilities. The SSI's role is clear. It will work under the specific direction of the Secretary of State. The role of the National Care Standards Commission is also clearly set out in the Bill, supported by the regulation-making powers of the Secretary of State. Therefore, I hope it is clear that the amendment is unnecessary. Of course the commission and the SSI will be expected to co-operate where that is appropriate, but that will be possible without the inclusion in the Bill of regulation-making powers. If the hon. Lady wants to avoid introducing unnecessary legislation, she should withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am reassured to hear that the two inspectorates will have discrete and separate roles. Those who are concerned about that will be pleased to hear that that is the Government's intention. However, I have a residual concern about some of the service provision covered by the Bill. The Bill makes it clear that, in relation to residential care homes and private providers, inspection is at arm's length, but when we come to adoption services, which are provided and inspected by the local authority, the roles become more blurred. I remain conerned about the need to make the distinction explicit at this stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I acknowledge that the hon. Lady has made a valid point about clause 40 in part III, but I suggest that the appropriate time to discuss that will be when we debate that clause. When we have that debate, we shall clearly set out the respective responsibilities of the SSI and the National Care Standards Commission, but it is unnecessary to do that in regulation-making powers.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> That was very helpful and just what I was hoping to hear. I shall take up the point again when we come to clause 40. With that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 5, line 33, after ``section'' insert ``and section 8''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 59 and 60.

<P>
Amendment No. 132, in clause 9, page 6, line 28, leave out ``registration functions'' and insert ``functions under this Act''.

<P>
Government amendment No. 61.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> We have had a considerable discussion today about the range of services and support provided in England. These amendments relate to the situation in Wales. The Committee will recognise that it is important that the National Assembly for Wales should have the appropriate powers to carry out its functions in relation to the regulation of care services in Wales. The Government amendments will give the National Assembly parallel duties and powers to those of the National Care Standards Commission in England.

<P>
Amendment No. 57 is somewhat technical, but it will ensure that the general duties of the National Assembly under clause 8 relate to part II services as defined in clause 7(7). At present, there is little information in Wales about the availability and quality of social care provision on which public money is spent. Through its work regulating care providers, the Assembly will be able to learn about the availability and quality of social care services in both the private and the public sector and will be able to tailor and target its information requirements to the particular circumstances of the social care sector in Wales.

<P>
(A1) and (A2) in amendment No. 59 will enable the Assembly to use the information that it gathers to carry out some of the recommendations made by the royal commission on long-term care. In particular, the Assembly will be required to encourage improvement in the quality of social care provision and to disseminate information about the services available to the general public and interested parties. That will enable the Assembly to inform users of the type and quality of care services and to encourage the improvement of services. I also hope that the information will be used to inform the Assembly in its wider capacity for reviewing and developing policy for social services provision in Wales.

<P>
I hope that the availability of such information will facilitate more general reporting to the newly elected Members of the Assembly on specific areas in the sector and to contribute to an annual report on the performance and impact of the Assembly in carrying out its regulatory functions. That will make a strong contribution to the Assembly's accountability for social care provision.

<P>
(A3) in amendment No. 59 will give the Assembly the flexibility to confer on itself by regulation additional regulatory functions under part II where those functions have been conferred on the National Care Standards Commission in England by the Secretary of State or by my hon. Friend the Minister of State. Decisions on whether to extend its agreed functions would be a matter for the National Assembly to consider.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): Will my hon. Friend confirm that this is the first step on the way to the National Assembly for Wales achieving the extremely laudable ambition of instituting a commissioner for children in Wales? The move would be good for the Government to support, but is the measure not a bit convoluted? Would it not be better for the Government to introduce legislation for a children's rights commissioner?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The amendments relate to the general scope of regulation and to the general powers that the Assembly will have under clause 7 and later associated clauses also to be amended. I will be tabling in Committee at an appropriate moment an amendment dealing with the aspects of the children's commissioner. That is no secret, because the Secretary of State for Wales has made an announcement to that effect. We can have a wider discussion of such matters then. I am sure, Mr. Illsley, that you would not want me to stray into that area now, although I would be happy to do so if you wanted me to. The issue is important and we will return to it. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) can raise his issues relating to Wales and to the rest of the United Kingdom then.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 60 and 61 are intended to improve the current provisions in relation to clause 9, with which we will deal later, which covers the Assembly's powers of inquiry.

<P>
I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. Having spent time in opposition, I recognise the Opposition's lack of resources. In drafting amendment No. 132, he has clearly noticed that the provisions of clause 9 as drafted are not right. They refer too narrowly to the Assembly's registration functions and so would exclude, for example, its responsibilities under part III for inspecting local authority fostering and adoption services and its responsibilities under part VII for inspecting welfare arrangements in boarding schools. I hope that he will accept that the Government recognise that the spirit of amendment No. 132 is correct and that he will agree that Government amendments Nos. 60 and 61 are more correct legally, because of the enormous backup at our disposal in Government. The clause will refer to all the relevant functions conferred on the Assembly by or under the Bill.

<P>
I hope that the amendments are straightforward. They clarify the roles and responsibilities to be conferred on the Assembly in parallel with the National Care Standards Commission in England. I strongly commend them to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The debate is slightly odd in the context of clause 7. Apart from the first minor technical amendment, the amendments relate to clauses 8 and 9 and touch on areas to which my probing amendment No. 131 also relates.

<P>
As the Minister has kindly acknowledged, amendment No. 132 was designed to address precisely the issue that Government amendments Nos. 60 and 61 now address. The powers to apply sections of the Government of Wales Act 1998 relating to inquiries were defined too tightly. They referred only to the registration functions of the Assembly, whereas they should have referred to all the Assembly's functions under the Act. I will be happy not to press amendment No. 132, because the Government have captured its essence. Without wishing to sound churlish, I say to the Minister that, given what he described as the enormous backup available to Ministers, it was interesting that such an anomaly could have crept through to this stage of the Bill's life.

<P>
I have more of a problem with Government amendment No. 59. That problem stems largely from the fact the the Minister of State, last Tuesday attacked me for apparently not understanding the principles of devolution. I have been thinking hard about those principles. The Government are seeking through the amendment not to broaden but to constrain the ability of the Assembly to give itself additional power through regulations. As the Bill stands, the Assembly will have the power to make regulations. Amendment No. 59 will constrain the use of that power to areas relating to clause 7 in which the Assembly seeks by regulation to give itself additional functions. The amendment refers to the specification of a function
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>corresponding to a function which, by virtue of section 7, is exercisable by the Commission in relation to Part II services provided in England.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
That suggests that the principle of devolution is that one gives an assembly that has the power to make regulations, such as the Welsh Assembly, the power to define its function, to go its way and to seek the best route for Wales. However, the Government seek to row back from that position by constraining the devolved assembly. The Welsh Assembly is told that it can go its way, make regulations and define functions, but only if they mirror those that the commission in England might be allowed to exercise. In the context of the Minister's chastisement of my understanding of devolution, that seems to represent breathtaking hypocrisy. I look forward to hearing how the Minister seeks to defend that stance. I also look forward to hearing what view Assembly Members take of that attempt by the Government to constrain the role of the Assembly and the scope of its exercise of functions.

<P>
Might the Government have been concerned that the Assembly could have sought to extend its interest to the areas inserted into clause 7 in another place? The Government have removed those additional areas, which dealt with subjects such as the role of the Commission for Health Improvement in relation to independent hospitals. Will the Minister tell us what he is worried that the Welsh Assembly might do in the devolved environment if he cannot control it through measures parallel to those in England?

<P>
The situation exposes the spin around devolution. It is good to devolve power so long as both ends of the equation are controlled-the end releasing power and the end taking it up. I am aware that the theme will be familiar to the Minister. It is good to devolve power until it looks possible that the people to whom power is being devolved might not do one's bidding. It then becomes prudent to constrain the exercise of devolved power by allowing it to be exercised only in a way that mirrors the power that central Government allow in England.

<P>
The case is made for amendment No. 59 being shabby and unprincipled. The Wales Office Minister made no effective defence of what he is doing. The proposal represents a tightening of the scope of the Welsh Assembly in relation to the Bill rather than a widening. The Minister said that the measure would give the Assembly flexibility. That suggests to me a widening of Assembly Members' scope for manoeuvre, but the measure would mean a tightening. 

<P>
The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre Valley made an interesting point in relation to the argument that will no doubt take place later about the children's commissioner and whether the amendment was intended to deal with that possibility. I do not want to intrude on what is essentially private grief, but the same thought had crossed my mind. I am interested to hear whether the Minister is seeking to take that route to allow the Welsh Assembly to introduce a children's commissioner.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> The hon. Gentleman seeks to enhance the title of my constituency, but it is Lancaster and Wyre only; the valleys are to be found in Wales.

<P>
We have no grief about the Government's action in response to the Waterhouse report and in support of the Welsh Assembly; it is a credit to the Government to want to protect children. It is a prime example of the workings of devolution in action. It is good stuff.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am interested that the hon. Gentleman now seems satisfied to confine his ambitions to Wales and that he should not want to deal with what seems to us to be a certain amount of grief over whether similar provisions should extend to England. We shall no doubt have the pleasure of discussing those matters at a later state of the Committee's consideration of the Bill.

<P>
Although we are happy to accept the Minister's assurances about amendment No. 57 addressing the powers of the Assembly in relation to inquiries, I am deeply unconvinced about the principles behind amendments Nos. 59 and 60. They are not in keeping with the Government's rhetoric about the importance of devolving power to the Assembly and giving it the maximum flexibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has indeed shown his lack of understanding of the devolution settlement. First, however, I shall deal with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre.

<P>
With regard to the children's commission, we shall have the opportunity later for a wide debate on the amendments dealing with Wales. The present amendments are not linked to the adoption of a children's commissioner in Wales, which we shall discuss later.

<P>
I should tell the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that the Government are working in partnership with the National Assembly on whether and how the regulatory powers should be conferred on the Assembly. The National Assembly and the Government agree on the way forward. The Assembly is happy and keen, and it supports the Government's intention. We want to maintain the compatibility of regulatory regimes yet still allow the National Assembly to examine and develop supportive moves in the care sector and have a Welsh dimension. There are differences, but we seek compatibility between England and Wales on the broad issues; however, the National Assembly will be able to consider a Welsh solution.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister confirm that without the benefit of the amendment, the Assembly would have all the powers that it is being given under proposed subsection (A3) and more, and that the amendment would reduce the scope of the Assembly's powers, not enhance them?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The amendment enhances the Assembly's powers. The Assembly has no powers conferred on it; indeed, it cannot act until Royal Assent is granted. We want to ensure that the Assembly has regulatory powers similar to those in England, which it can exercise in whatever way it chooses. The hon. Gentleman seems to be saying that the Conservative party wants to give the National Assembly powers to make primary legislation, and to extend its regulatory role without it being responsible to the House. We are setting down a framework whereby the National Assembly will be able to examine and consider the regulatory framework in the interests of Wales.

<P>
It may help the hon. Gentleman if I tell him that the National Assembly will take its regulatory powers seriously. The Assembly will have considerable power, including, in due course, being able to make affirmative or negative resolution orders.

<P>
Sixty Members were elected to the National Assembly in May 1999. It may have escaped the hon. Gentleman's attention, when he criticised the Government for devolving power, that the Labour party holds only 28 of those 60 seats, so we are devolving the power that my predecessor would have had in order to give the Assembly a wider involvement than the Government. Conservative Members are talking tosh about control freakery, but that does not come into the equation. We have devolved power; we have given the Assembly the right to make the regulations. The Assembly will consult on the regulations, debate them and vote on them. We are merely ensuring that those arrangements run in parallel with English arrangements, and that the powers that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister of State have in England can be exercised in Wales by the National Assembly in accordance with Welsh needs. That is an important principle, which I commend to the Committee.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Bearing in mind that we have had a long debate on various amendments to the clause, I hope that there will be no repetition of what has been said. I wish it to be a brief debate.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. I apologise for my unavoidably not being here last Thursday. It would have been helpful if Hansard for Thursday afternoon had been available. It is rather surprising that we still do not have a record of what was said on Thursday.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The point has been noted. It is obviously a matter for Hansard and the printers. We shall investigate the apparent delay. We shall now debate clause 7 stand part.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall not try your patience, Mr. Illsley, by speaking at length to issues that we have already debated. I have one specific, additional question, and now is probably the appropriate time to ask it. In the event of allegations of maladministration against the commission about the carrying out of its duties, which of the various ombudsmen will have jurisdiction?

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The debate on clause 7 has gone on for what seems like an eternity, but we will soon move beyond eternity to a brighter dawn-hon. Members should not take that the wrong way; I do not expect us to be here at dawn.

<P>
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration will have the role of ombudsman for the NCSC. Although the debate on the responsibilities and duties of the commission has been long, it has also been good. We have covered the subject extensively. Committee members should be clear about the purpose of clause 7, which is important for a number of reasons. Broadly, it gives the NCSC responsibility for services that fall within its remit, as recommended by the royal commission. It is important that the NCSC develops its functions. It is a new entity and its responsibilities should be clearly defined, as they are in clause 7, but in exercising its powers and responsibilities, I hope that it will exert a positive and beneficial influence on the development of part II services for which it has responsibility. The case for the clause has been strongly made.

The Minister told us that it is desirable to have a body of regulation that creates broadly parallel regimes. Although we might disagree about the implications for the underlying philosophy of devolution, it is clear that, in practical terms, the border between England and Wales does not prevent a healthy flow of people and services from passing between the two countries. Similar regulatory regimes can be beneficial, and two intelligent and well-meaning bodies setting out to achieve the same thing might elect to use similar routes.

<P>
I apologise to the Committee for the fact that amendment No. 131 is imperfectly drafted. Although it would create an internal inconsistency and a degree of redundancy, that should not stop us discussing the issue. The amendment relates to the asymmetry of the arrangements for England and Wales. It would lift the words of paragraph 17 of schedule 1-appropriately modified to take account of the Welsh circumstance-into clause 8, which applies to Wales. Mirroring the Minister's arguments in the last debate, we are testing how far those arguments go and to what extent he feels it is appropriate to prescribe for Wales a regime similar to that which is prescribed for England. Specifically, the clause's reference to fees in relation to England is more tightly defined than it is in relation to Wales: in relation to England, there is specific reference to training charges, while in relation to Wales, there is none. Will there be wider powers in Wales or-following the Minister's logic in introducing amendment No. 59-will there be no powers to charge for training?

<P>
The amendment proposes a question; to what extent does the Minister expect the charging regimes in England and Wales to mirror each other? Does the Minister expect training to be charged for in Wales on the same basis as in England? If not, does he foresee any market distortions, given that the border between England and Wales is open and people can move freely between the two countries? If training is free in Wales, but charged for in England, it is possible to envisage that little training will be carried out in the English border counties. The amendment is not aggressive in intent, but is intended to probe the issue.

<P>
I have genuine difficulty understanding how two separate aspirations, broadly parallel regimes of regulations and genuine devolution, can sit side by side. It is obvious that tensions will arise, and the amendment is intended to draw out the Government's thoughts on the likely outcome of those tensions. Anything that touches on the charging of fees and the recouping of costs is of particular interest to those that directly provide services. I look forward to some clarification from the Minister. We shall ask further questions if necessary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's approach and I hope my comments will improve his understanding of the situation.

<P>
I am acutely aware of the border, as I live four miles from it on the Welsh side. The border issue affects the daily life of my constituency, and it is a constant item on my agenda and in the range of questions facing me as a Member of Parliament for a border constituency. Therefore, I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concerns. The amendment shows a misunderstanding of the devolution settlement. I shall explain that shortly.

<P>
The amendment would have great effect, as it would mean the National Assembly for Wales would be unable to raise income from providers to cover the costs of the regulatory arrangements. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the Government's general policy is that fees payable by regulated service providers should cover the cost of that regulation. It is not the Government's policy to subsidise the independent sector by requiring less than the full cost. The amendment would mean that the National Assembly was unable to make those charges, therefore its budget would need to absorb the costs of regulation at the expense of other services such as health, housing and education. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has taken the trouble to cost the amendment, but we have, and it would result in an additional cost of 3 million, which is currently collected by regulatory authorities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am delighted that the Government have the resources to enable them to cost my amendment in the three days since they have had it, even though they have not yet been able to give the Committee any suggestion of the costs of various options for minimum standards or regulations. However, it was not my intention to do as the Under-Secretary says. I have already confessed to the inadequacies of the drafting of the amendment. I intended to lift the language from paragraph 17 of schedule 1. Perhaps the Minister will explain how the problem arises in relation to Wales, but not to England.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I will come to that key point. I just wanted to explain the effect of the amendment, however imperfectly drafted.

<P>
Paragraph 17 provides, for England, that fees may be charged by the National Care Standards Commission, but only with the Secretary of State's consent. A lack of understanding of the devolution settlement is apparent. For the National Care Standards Commission, an assurance is provided that the Secretary of State will approve the fees and charges. However, arrangements are different for Wales. Following discussion and consultation with the Government, an agreement has been reached in the National Assembly relating to its request for support from the Government on a different decision-making process. In Wales, the National Assembly will take on the regulatory task: for those purposes, it will fulfil the role of the National Care Standards Commission and of the Secretary of State; it is a corporate body. We have taken a decision, in conjunction with the Assembly, that the National Care Standards Commission in Wales will report to the Assembly, but be part of it. Therefore, the wording used in paragraph 17 would be superfluous.

<P>
There are different assessments and settlements for the administrative arrangements in England and in Wales. Clause 8 is correctly worded and gives the Assembly the power to charge fees only
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in connection with the exercise of any power conferred on it by or under this Act<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and only if the fee is reasonable. The Assembly was elected and is the democratically accountable body in Wales with respect to the matters that we are considering. Clause 8 correctly sets out the fee-charging arrangements analogous to those of the National Care Standards Commission. The powers in the two cases are similar, but are to be exercised in separate ways-in England by an arm's length National Care Standards Commission and the Secretary of State, and in Wales, a smaller country, by a democratically-elected body. The Assembly will take the decisions and examine, support and agree the regulations. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand the differences and appreciate that after the Bill is passed, the National Assembly will have control of fees and charges.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the effect of the Bill. Does the Under-Secretary envisage a regime of charging in Wales that differs from the one in England, or does he expect the National Assembly for Wales to decide, using its devolved powers, to mirror the charging regime in England?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> That raises two points. Fees charged by the Assembly must be reasonable-a term with which we are familiar. There will be full consultation on fees with the care sector, as well as with the Assembly's health and social services committee and with the Assembly itself in full plenary session, if it wants to consider the matter. Ultimately, the Assembly will set the fees, so I cannot speak about whether they will be different from those in England. The Assembly has power to discuss the issues, to consult on them and to set regulatory fees. Obviously, it also has power to have regard to the matters raised by the hon. Gentleman, who spoke about border issues and differences between England and Wales.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his honesty. He told us in a rather long-winded way that he could not possibly answer my question because he could not speak for the National Assembly, so let me try a different line of questioning. Does he think it desirable or undesirable to introduce a different charging regime, not only in terms of the level of the fees, but of the scope of what is charged for? I am thinking especially of training.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Ultimately, it is for the National Assembly and for the Government to determine the fees. I assure the hon. Gentleman that they will co-operate closely on such matters, as they have during the discussions hitherto. It is in nobody's interest to introduce wide variations in fees, because of the different regulatory regimes. In a sense, there will be teamwork involved in delivering what is best for consumers and owners in England and Wales. Ultimately, however, the National Assembly has the power to examine the issues and to make a decision in respect of Wales. Dare I say it, there will be democratic input in Wales into the fee levels and discussions once the consultation has occurred: 60 Assembly Members will have an opportunity to discuss the matter; indeed, the eight or nine Conservative Members will be able to participate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister is talking about a laudable opportunity for democratic input in the fee-setting process in Wales, but why does he think that the people of England do not need such an opportunity for democratic input into the process as it affects them?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> With due respect, the people of England can have the same opportunity in due course. Regulation is regulation; there are opportunities in the House to raise these issues, just as there are opportunities in the National Assembly. The hon. Gentleman looks scathing and cynical about that, but these are election issues. Elections have been fought in Wales and will be brought in the United Kingdom for the next Parliament. Both the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart), and the National Assembly Health and Social Services Secretary are accountable to their respective bodies. I remind the hon. Gentleman that my party does not have control of the National Assembly, so there can be wider discussion on the powers and responsibilities that we are delegating than would occur if one party had political control. The Department of Health and the National Assembly will co-operate and discuss these matters. Regulation-making powers on fee levels are conferred and the appropriate opportunities for discussion will be taken, both within the Assembly and outside.

<P>
The amendment would mean that fee levels could not be raised and that there would be a shortfall. It does not take into account the differences between the National Assembly and the British Government and the role that they each play in the bodies established by the Bill.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This short discussion has been useful and has raised some issues to which we shall return. As I said, I am aware that the amendment is technically defective, so I shall not take my arguments any further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 6, line 33, leave out from ``shall'' to ``be'' in line 35.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 135, in page 6, line 35, leave out ``that Minister'' and insert ``he''.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The clause deals with the establishment of public inquiries to consider any matter connected with a regulated service. It is important for such inquiries to be set up correctly, and the amendments would make a couple of small but significant changes to the provisions that deal with them.

<P>
Inquiries will occur when serious circumstances have arisen, an example of which is given in the explanatory notes. They state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if a consultant surgeon working in a private hospital was found to have unusually death rates among his patients, the Secretary of State could set up an inquiry to investigate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will not like me for asking him a question that goes back to one of our basic tenets, but I must put it to him: why should not the same circumstances apply in respect of a public hospital? With the application of clinical governance, we envisage that shortcomings in the performance of medical practitioners will become much more apparent to consumers of health care, whether public or private. That is one of the reasons why we have argued strongly that public and private health care should be regulated on a level playing field in respect of such shortcomings. Circumstances such as those outlined in the explanatory notes, in which the activity of a medical practitioner is found to have an abnormal set of outcomes, would cause considerable concern and might convince the Secretary of State of the need for an inquiry.

<P>
We believe that it is important to amend provision in respect of what happens after an inquiry is established. The purpose of both amendments is to empower the inquiry chairman-or the person who conducts the inquiry, whatever title he is given-to decide whether its findings should be published and to determine the way in which it should be carried out. If somebody has been empowered to manage the inquiry, he or she should also have power to decide the manner in which its outcome is published. In delegating power to the inquiry, the Minister should provide such an ability and not interfere with the outcome-interference that could involve preventing the report's publication. If a matter is so serious that a public inquiry is called for, the outcome of that inquiry should be published. Without the amendment, the Secretary of State can decide not to make the outcome public. In the light of the history of inquiries into health care shortcomings, especially in respect of children, and with the legacy that remains as a framework, it is important that public inquiries held under the Bill's auspices should be conducted in a way that gives the public access to their outcome.

<P>
Investigation of a medical practitioner is a very serious matter. A large number of people can be involved in such an investigation, some of whom might be less aware that they are implicated in an inquiry if its details and outcome are not made public. The issue is topical, as the activities of some medical practitioners have recently come to public attention. We know from practical experience that it is only when they do come to public attention that other patients come out of the woodwork, after recognising the name of the practitioner, casting their minds back to their own experience and realising that they were part of the same pattern. If the pattern had been spotted earlier, their experiences and those of others, which may have led to an inquiry being set up to investigate, might have been prevented. It is important to recognise that if an issue is of such a serious nature that an inquiry is established, the public have a right to know its outcome.

<P>
We understand why the Secretary of State may consider it necessary to hold part of the inquiry in private. It is clear from the Waterhouse report and other inquiries into cases of child abuse that it is important to protect the victims. Only when it is possible to hold the proceedings in private do vulnerable people feel able to give evidence of their bad experiences. We understand the need for the chairman of an inquiry to call for part of the proceedings to be held in private. However, once an inquiry has been held, nothing that can be learned from it should be hushed up or withheld from the public domain. Therefore, the person responsible for holding the inquiry should be the one who decides the most appropriate method of publication of the inquiry's findings. That person, who has sat through the entire inquiry, is better placed than the Minister, who has not been present throughout and therefore depends on a report at second hand, to take the decision on the best way of bringing the inquiry's conclusions to the attention of the public.

<P>
I am sure the Minister will comment on the fact that our proposal reduces the powers of the Minister in some respects, but in others seeks to ensure that the Minister has the power to act. It is important that the delegatory powers of the chairman of an inquiry should run consistently through to the decision about the publication of the outcome of the inquiry; the chairman is best placed to make such a decision.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I support the amendment for all the reasons that the hon. Member for Meriden has outlined, and for another reason, which is that an inquiry affects not only the public, but the organisation and people in respect of whom it is held. It is a small world and, even if an inquiry sits in private, people will become aware of it. If the results of that inquiry are not published or published only in truncated form, it makes it difficult for those affected to raise objections to particular conclusions. It is important that full publication of the findings is made. Publication should be the responsibility of the chairman because, at the end of the day, it is the chairman who must justify the conclusions that have been drawn. If the power is handed over to Ministers, they will be able to claim that they acted on advice and, therefore, will not be accountable. Indeed, if they are responsible for publication, their response to an inquiry will not be covered by parliamentary privilege.

<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I want to clarify one simple point. I understand the hon. Gentleman's desire to get matters into the open, but does he accept that an inquiry chairman might not take related matters, such as the possibility of on-going criminal investigations or a successful court action, into account? That is an argument for the power not to reside with the chairman.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is a valuable contribution. Clearly, instructions to an inquiry chairman will take account of future prosecutions. That has been a significant consideration in the inquiries into railway disasters.

<P>
The essence of the amendment is that the person who leads the inquiry and whose name goes on the report should be accountable. The Bill does not provide that accountability for the public, those who are the subject of complaints or the people on whose behalf the inquiry has been lodged.

<P>
I support the amendment and look forward to the Minister's reply. If he is going to give hypothetical examples of why it is essential that Ministers have the power to determine the presentation of the report to the public, he should be specific. I cannot think of a circumstance in which it would not be in the public interest or the interest of the people who are the subject of the inquiry for the report not to be published in full.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I must be doing something right because the hon. Gentleman always finishes his remarks by saying how much he is looking forward to hearing my response. [
Interruption.] I think he is charming and polite, and I am grateful to him for beginning his remarks in that way.

<P>
I expect to reassure hon. Members on this matter. Amendment No. 134 is the more substantial amendment. It would require inquiry reports always to be published. Amendment No. 135 is the best grammatical amendment that hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has tabled. He has kindly taken time to scrutinise the Bill's grammar and phrasing. However, it is unnecessary; the meaning is clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry, but the Minister has missed the point. Amendment No. 135 must be read in conjunction with amendment No. 134. If amendment No. 134 changes the responsible person, the reference to ``he'' will be to the person who is conducting the inquiry, not to the Minister.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I stand corrected. I may have misunderstood amendment No. 135 but, as amendment No. 134 is more substantial, I shall confine my remarks to it.

<P>
Let me say at the outset that the Government are strongly committed to publishing inquiry reports. Our intention is that they will always be published. However, there could-my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) put this case well-be exceptional circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to publish a report immediately because it might prejudice on-going criminal investigations or proceedings. It is just possible that an inquiry report could contain defamatory material that it would not be appropriate to publish in that form.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is the very point. If we are to protect the individuals who are inquired into, it is important that the people who are holding the inquiry are accountable. It is a devastating process and accountability is paramount.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not disagree. However, the hon. Gentleman intervened a little early because I intend to explain the examples in more detail.

<P>
The scenarios are plausible, which begs the question of what happens if either circumstance arises. We believe that the wording of subsection (8) will cover those exceptional circumstances only. However, it goes substantially further than comparable health or social care legislation in committing the Government to publishing inquiry reports.

<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight and the hon. Gentleman who moved the amendment will be aware of the history of subsection (8). We amend it in another place to try to respond to the concerns that were expressed there. It is possible that the drafting could be improved to make our intentions clearer. We tried to do that by amending the provision in another place. I am prepared to try again to improve the drafting of subsection (8), but I emphasise that our strong view and our intention is that reports should always be published. We shall try to reflect that intention, if needed, in further amendments to the clause on Report.

<P>
I am at one with those hon. Members who have spoken to amendments to clause 9. I hope that I have been able to reassure the Committee, and particularly my hon. Friends, that the Government intend to publish inquiry reports. Subsection (8), even as it is drafted, goes significantly further than comparable provisions in other legislation. I must tell the hon. Member for Isle of Wight that there is no truth and no foundation for any suspicion that he might have that the Government are busily constructing arrangements that would allow us to bury difficult and embarrassing inquiry reports. That is not our intention.

<P>
The hon. Lady, the Member for Meriden, when moving the amendments, referred to what she thought was another example of inconsistencies between the Bill as it relates to independent hospitals and to NHS hospitals. She was unhappy with the fact that no comparable power allows a similar inquiry to be set up into the NHS. I assure her that that is not the case. Section 84 of the National Health Service Act 1977 empowers the Secretary of State to set up inquiries into the NHS, so the hon. Lady's concerns are not justified.

<P>
I conclude by saying that I am grateful to the hon. Members for Meriden, for Isle of Wight and for Runnymede and Weybridge. We are prepared to reconsider the provision. In the light of my reassurances about our intentions and about the drafting, I hope that they will not feel it necessary to take the amendment any further.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am glad that the Minister should finally have remembered that it was I who moved the amendment. If it is any reassurance to him, one knows that one has made it as a woman when the chairman of a meeting says, ``Now gentlemen''. If one is the only woman in the room, one is treated as an honorary gentleman and knows that one has been accepted.

<P>
I am pleased with what the Minister said. It was helpful and encouraging to hear that the Government's intention is entirely what we were trying to tease out with this probing amendment-that publication will be the norm. I am particularly pleased to hear that the Minister is willing to reconsider the drafting of the clause so that it makes specifically clear that the norm will be publication. That will entirely satisfy us.

<P>
Mention was made of a level playing field between private and public health care and inquiries into medical practitioners in the public sector. I entirely accept what the Minister said about the provisions of the NHS Act, but I seek an assurance that the norm for publication of reports of inquiries would be true also of that process. I should then be 100 per cent. satisfied that we have won what we set out to achieve. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 7, line 5, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) Any person who privately fosters a child under the age of 16 years for a consecutive period of 28 days or more without being registered under this Part shall be guilty of an offence'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The issue of privately fostered children was debated at length in another place. My amendment is the same as that tabled by my noble Friend Baroness David. She deployed solid arguments about why we should regulate properly and safeguard privately fostered children. She drew on the support of Lord Laming, the former head of the social services inspectorate, and on the recommendations in the Utting report. Utting said that he regarded the present arrangements as unworkable and proposed that private foster carers should be required to seek approval and registration from a local authority. We are considering the registration of such carers with the National Care Standards Commission. Utting said that childminders and providers of day services were required to gain such approval and registration before taking on children, yet those looking after children full time through private fostering could not. There is a contradiction in the situation.

<P>
The report drew on the conclusions of the 1993 social services report. It concluded that private fostering covered a wide range of situations in which potentially vulnerable children were being placed in the care of strangers without checks being undertaken on the adults' suitability to care for them. The way in which placements were made raised real concerns for the welfare of children.

<P>
Having set out the situation, I can discuss the Government's response in the other place and why we need to change the law to protect such children. Regulations under the Children Act 1989 require those caring for children under 16 for 28 days or more to notify their local authority of the arrangements. The local authority has no requirement to register those people, but has a requirement to look after the children's general welfare. A social worker would visit regularly. The authority can ban people from taking on such roles.

<P>
We do not know how many children are being privately fostered. Few carers or parents notify local authorities of such arrangements. Central records for children were discontinued as long ago as 1991, when the estimate was that 2,000 children were being privately fostered. The African Family Advisory Service estimated at about the same time that about 6,000 west African children were being privately fostered in the UK.

<P>
People providing private fostering are often poorly paid. I have worked in a team of social workers and colleagues have been responsible for visiting private foster carers. They have reported to me that carers are often paid meagre sums, sometimes as little as the average child benefit. My hon. Friend the Minister might confirm that the average UK foster payment is about 300. Those private foster carers were looking after children for as little as 10 or 15 a week.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman obviously has a great deal of knowledge about the subject and he has just quoted some figures that show a dramatic difference, but is it not true that, in the majority of cases, people are not motivated by money because their principal motivation for taking on the role is a wider interest in the welfare of the child and perhaps in a relationship with the child, the child's parents or community from which the child comes?

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I am reminded of something that the hon. Gentleman said earlier which rather surprised me. He said that quality costs money.

<P>
An argumant has been made that such children are mainly cared for within their families. That is not what the Utting report or the social services inspectorate said as long ago as 1993. The report by the race equality unit said that the cultural, racial and health needs of those children, referring particularly to west African children, were not properly cared for because they were not given appropriate placements. Therefore, there is considerable evidence to suggest that the hon. Gentleman's point is a long way off the mark.

<P>
As we strive to improve safeguards, we want to tighten the net for all children, be they in nurseries, pre-school education or residential homes. That is what safeguarding children is all about. We have so many regulations to require stringent inspections in relation to children who are being cared for in the daytime, yet thousands of children are left for years in the hands of complete strangers who do not notify the local authority and whom it is difficult to track down. Why? The answer may be because they are carrying out a family arrangement, but Utting and the social services inspectorate clearly said that that is not the case. Are they child abusers or social workers who have been struck off? Would such people come forward and notify the local authority that they were privately fostering children? Of course they would not. That is a gaping hole in the safeguards for children. We know nothing about the people who are doing the job, but colleagues have told me that such people avoid notification. Often, a social worker will have to visit a third party to find out whether someone is privately fostering a child. Sometimes people avoid notifying the local authority because they want to avoid losing benefits. We must ask why someone would want to avoid notification. There are several answers, but the answers raise question marks about the safety of children.

<P>
In the other place, the Government said that cases of private fostering were predominantly family arrangements. I look forward to hearing from my hon. Friend the Minister a little more about where that evidence comes from because neither the inspectorate nor Utting says that. It has been suggested that we could have a national campaign, but there have been campaigns before, to which the reports refer. We have had campaigns in local newspapers, shop windows, doctors' surgeries and schools, all the places one might expect to try to engage parents and raise awareness. That was an on-going campaign but it had little effect. People did not come forward to declare that they were privately fostering children, despite the fact that there were large numbers of children in the area. I worked with parents in London and around the M25 corridor, where people-the example of west African people has been given-would leave their children here for anything up to a couple of years. Within that area, it was convenient to find placements. I am unconvinced about how effective a publicity campaign would be. The people it would be aimed at would not want to hear the message or would not listen to it.

<P>
The Government need to answer two questions. Are they satisfied that privately fostered children are safe? Do the existing arrangements provide the same quality of protection as the excellent Bill does for other groups of children? If they do, I would welcome an assurance that they do. If they do not, private carers need to be properly regulated. What is the problem with proper regulation for private fosterers? Is it a can of worms? Would it be too difficult? Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister would ask the social services inspectorate to reconsider the view that it expressed as long ago as 1993. If he agrees with me, perhaps he could include in the Bill a requirement to regulate private fostering in the same way as he has given a commitment on day centres. My hon. Friend advised us that the Bill contains powers to regulate day centres. If the inspectorate came to the same conclusion, we should take the matter forward.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I support the amendment and the recommendation of my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw). Private fostering is in a dangerous mess and the responsibility for that lies with the previous Government, who failed to provide the appropriate resources. They cared too little about the issue to make sections 66 and 67 of the Children Act 1989 work. We should be clear about the matter. The position of children in private fostering causes great anxiety throughout the country. It is an area of confusion, in which regulations are not enforced. No one knows the full extent of the situation. The figures quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford show that this is a major issue for many children.

<P>
Many children come here from abroad. They are in particularly vulnerable circumstances. They are in a different country, a different culture, often living for many years in a private fostering arrangement that is unknown to the authorities, unregulated and not enforced. They are supervised, looked after-or perhaps not looked after-on a day-to-day basis by people who have not been checked, who are unknown to the authorities and who are not registered. Anybody with any common sense can recognise that a scandal is waiting to happen. The Government appear to have recognised that and they have responsed to ``People Like Us'', the excellent report produced by Sir William Utting. The proposals made in another place were extremely important, as they sought to promote awareness of the position of children in private foster care, to revise guidance and to check on local authorities' ability to monitor and inspect the sector. My hon. Friend's proposal complements those suggestions, as it gets tough in order to protect children and their rights. The Bill contains some excellent measures.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify one point, which relates to the Government's intention to remove the exemption for small children's homes and to children who are not being cared for by a relative? Does he believe that the circumstances that he is describing would fall within the definition of a children's home set out in the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> It is certainly not my understanding that they would fall within the definition of a children's home. In fact, I think that they are specifically excluded from that definition, which we discussed earlier.

<P>
As I was saying, the Bill contains some excellent measures to protect children who are living away from home. Fundamentally, we are discussing matters on which the Government need to act. I think that they are developing a tremendous programme for children who are living away from home as well as for children in general. They have shown that they are prepared to back children's rights with significant legislative action and resources.

<P>
Yesterday evening, I was in the Chamber, where I spoke strongly in favour of the Government's line on supporting children's rights to an education by being prepared to imprison and to fine severely parents who wilfully stop their children attending school. The measure was opposed by an alliance of Conservatives and Liberals, and even by one or two Government Members. If I may say so, it was quite a wet alliance, which failed to realise the importance of the issue.

<P>
The issue under discussion is even more important, as it is about the protection of children who are living in extraordinarily vulnerable circumstances. It is essential for the Government to strengthen the provision contained in the Children Act 1989 and to support the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> As a paid-up member of the wet tendency, I am happy to follow what has gone before. When he responds to the debate, will the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford comment a little further on the scope of his amendment? The difficulty is that there is no definition of private fostering. We know what official fostering is, as it is administered through an agency or a local authority and a regulatory framework on it makes complete sense.

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> A definition is contained in the Children Act which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a privately fostered child' means a child who is under the age of sixteen and who is cared for, and provided with accommodation by, someone other than-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) a person who is not a parent of his but who has parental responsibility for him.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is extremely helpful; being a Member of Parliament is clearly a learning experience. The definition that we have just heard makes my point, as it could include anybody who takes over the role, no matter for how short a time. My wife and I took in children from less-advantaged backgrounds for two or three weeks during the summer, when our family was younger. We were happy to take over parental responsibilities at that time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> The period specified in the amendment is 28 days.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Indeed, I have seen the 28-day specification. I cannot, however, see the logic of the earlier definition or of the 28-day definition that is contained in the amendment. Child abuse happens-
