Steer? Please introduce yourself for the
record.</div><a name="09030572000009"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I am Sir Alan Steer. I was a head teacher
until I retired last July and I am currently adviser at the Department
for Children, Schools and
Families.</div><a name="09030572000010"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030572000348"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Nick Gibb has the first
question.</div><a name="09030572000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">250
1</b><a name="09030572000349"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Thank
you for coming today. We all share your ambition to raise standards of
behaviour in our schools. We believe, as you do, that that is paramount
if we are to raise standards of
education.</div><a name="09030572000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning, some of the teaching unions came along and said that they
wanted a more general search power than the one in the Bill, which
specifically extends the power of teachers to search for certain
illegal items, drugs and so on. They wanted a more general power to
enable them to search for any item that might cause harm, either to
pupils or to staff in the school. Do you agree with that
view?</div><a name="09030572000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> Yes. The search power came about when I
chaired the practitioners group in 2005. One of our concerns was that
the legal position of teachers was not as clear as everybody thought it
was. It was based on case law going back to the 19th century. One of
our recommendations was that the right of teachers to discipline pupils
should be put into statute. You need to see things in that context.
Under what became the 2006 right to discipline is the right to require
children to empty their pockets and produce goods. What was rather more
specific was the power&#151;not a duty&#151;to search against
consent for items of a really serious nature. Weapons were the most
obvious items and so went in first. In conducting this review, I came
to the view that weapons are rarely found in schools. It is far more
common to find stolen property or alcohol. If teachers did search for
those items without consent, they had to be protected the following
morning from a subsequent litigious parent or awkward family saying
that they had exceeded their powers.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div><a name="09030572000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have
been happy with a more general power, and I included that in my report,
although I did highlight alcohol, drugs and stolen property. However, I
was advised&#151;and accepted that advice because it was not my
decision&#151;that there would be legal issues with a totally open
right of search. I cannot comment on that. That was the advice which
was, in a sense, subsequent to my report, which said that there ought
to be search powers focused on those three items. I understand there
would legal concerns and possible difficulties with totally open search
powers.</div><a name="09030572000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000350"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> That is a helpful response which I will raise with
Ministers when we interview them next week. The examples cited this
morning were things like cigarettes or violent pornography, neither of
which are in the list in clause 229, but they could be as harmful as
alcohol or
knives.</div><a name="09030572000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> Personally, I would not see it like that.
The things that I would be most concerned about are those that are now
covered in the power to search without consent. I would assume that
under nearly all circumstances one could cover things like cigarettes
in the power of discipline in the Education and Inspections Act 2006. I
do not want to repeat my earlier comment. I am advised that it would be
unwise to have too broad a definition of what to search, because there
would be
difficulties.</div><a name="09030572000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000351"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Can I ask you about reporting? Again, concerns were
expressed this morning that the provision in the Bill is very
prescriptive: they have to report to parents. An example was cited of a
child who might have done something wrong at school: force is used and
the school is required to tell the parent. The head or the teacher may
be aware that that child comes from a violent home. The report could
trigger another violent episode. The unions felt that there should be
some discretion for head teachers not to report an incident of force
against a child in those circumstances. Would you agree with that?
Should we amend the Bill to take that into
account?</div><a name="09030572000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I would not agree with that. It is worth
reminding everyone that the report to a parent need not come directly
from the school. In the case you outlined, perhaps it could come
through social services. You could bring in other agencies if you were
really concerned about a child protection issue. In fact it would be
your duty to take certain steps to activate the child protection
procedures. I was a head teacher for 23 years, so I see
things very much with a head teacher&#146;s eyes. I was also a
parent. If there has been an incident involving my child which has
required restraint to be used, I would be fairly militant about the
fact that I, as a parent, needed to know that. I accept that the
example you gave could occur on rare occasions, but there are ways
around that. The need for parents to be engaged in their
children&#146;s education, discipline and upbringing overrides
that.</div><a name="09030572000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000352"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> In your fourth interim report, you say that you are
concerned about the lack of focus in a number of behaviour partnerships
on the level of fixed-term exclusions. You go on to say that some
schools have high numbers of repetitive fixed-term exclusions. I have
noticed in recent years that the number of fixed-term 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>exclusions has been rising inexorably while the number of permanent
exclusions has fallen. Why are schools engaging in repetitive
fixed-term exclusions, rather than turning to permanent exclusions in
those extreme
circumstances?</div><a name="09030572000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> That is a difficult one to speculate on.
The thrust of the work in which I have been engaged since 2005&#151;I
came to it as an experienced head teacher rather than someone with huge
expertise, although possibly one has acquired a bit
subsequently&#151;is to try to move the handling of behaviour in
schools into a more intelligent way to produce a good result. In other
words, you change that child&#146;s behaviour and help that child to
overcome their problems and become a good citizen. What concerns me is
using strategies that clearly do not work. If a child is repeatedly
given fixed-term exclusions, a reasonable assumption would be that what
you are doing is not working. You might need to look at other
strategies. A permanent exclusion might be appropriate. It is hard to
speculate. Perhaps the schools should be permanently excluding the
child, but they are not doing so. It may be that the child has other
issues that are not being addressed such as special needs issues or
social issues relating to home circumstances. It could, perish the
thought, be that the school needs to look at its practices, which are
not working with that child. We need to be just as concerned about
fixed-term exclusions as we quite rightly are about permanent
exclusions. They are both of equal
significance.</div><a name="09030572000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000353"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Where a permanent exclusion is resorted to, do you
have a view about the type of education that those children should have
to help them tackle their behavioural
problems?</div><a name="09030572000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I addressed this back in May in my second
report when we looked at alternative provision. I think that this is a
major area for development. I was very pleased when the &#147;Back on
Track&#148; paper was produced. One could say that children who fall
through the net often really do fall through the net. The case of a
child in Sussex hit the headlines this week. Such children lack
champions. They are difficult children to deal with and there are no
easy solutions. I would hate to sit before the Committee as the man who
has easy solutions. There are no easy solutions in such circumstances,
but there are pointers that can improve the
situation.</div><a name="09030572000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need a range of provisions. One of the problems is that we sometimes
have a one-size-fits-all provision when a range is needed. We might be
talking about children with mental health problems. The quality of
support services for children and adolescents with mental health
problems is of serious concern to me and to head teachers nationally.
There is a range of things with which we have to deal: it might be
pregnant schoolgirls, or it might be scar-faced Harry. We must broaden
what we do. Pilots were launched in the autumn that will be very
interesting. It pleased me that a range of provisions were included in
those pilots. I hope that we will look at them and learn from
them.</div><a name="09030572000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
concern over pupil referral units is that they can get blocked. If the
basis is that it is possible for some children to turn their behaviour
around and reintegrate, there is obviously an appropriate time for such
children to receive in-depth intervention before going back into the
mainstream. Other children may have such severe behavioural problems
that they will never go back into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>the mainstream. That would not be fair on the mainstream, nor on the
child, because they simply would not cope. Too many PRUs keep children
for too long, particularly in the younger age range. They do not act as
remedial units that support local schools by helping children to cope
with their problems before putting them back into the mainstream.
Children are getting stuck, and when that happens, there is no capacity
for new children to come in and get the support. The long-winded answer
to your question is that we need a range of provision. Provision must
be more geared to the needs of the individual child than it is at the
moment.</div><a name="09030572000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030572000354"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Thank
you.</div><a name="09030572000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><a name="09030572000355"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): It is very nice
to meet you, Sir Alan. May I backtrack to the powers to search? I
believe that there was going to be a full evaluation of the powers to
search for weapons. Has that taken place? I read your letter to the
Secretary of State, but it was not clear whether there had been a full
evaluation.</div><a name="09030572000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I think that I will have to pass on that.
An evaluation has taken place, and I understand that to date no child
has been searched for a weapon against consent. I am afraid I cannot
say how far beyond that the evaluation has
gone.</div><a name="09030572000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000356"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I will move on to a more detailed question. This
morning, one of the unions felt that the requirement in the Bill on the
number of staff who must be present could be rather onerous. Two
members of the same sex might be needed on a school trip, but before
the trip, you would not know which sex was needed. There would not
necessarily be four members of staff on a trip. Will that requirement
work in
practice?</div><a name="09030572000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I understand the point, and it needs to
be thought about. A lot of what is recommended is a form of protection
for teachers. I will not avoid the question, but on the reporting
issue, I see reporting to parents as a huge protection for teachers. As
a teacher, I would not have wanted to restrain a child without making a
proper record of the occasion. If an accusation was made against me two
or three weeks or two or three months later, I would not have had
anything to put
forward.</div><a name="09030572000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
same is true of the point you raised. When searching a child, which
might require some form of bodily contact, you would be unwise not to
have another person present because of the danger of a subsequent
complaint. I take your point and recognise the difficulty. The only
answer I can give is that there are so many things in school life that
require you to adjust according to the circumstances. Some things may
not be possible that would be possible under other circumstances. That
is a slightly woolly answer, but I think that it is close to the
truth.</div><a name="09030572000031"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000357"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> That is probably an area that we need to revisit
to ensure that the measure is practical&#151;thank you. On the
behaviour and attendance partnerships, does making something statutory
necessarily make it work
better?</div><a name="09030572000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I think that the development of
partnerships in schools is one of the most exciting possibilities. It
is something we have been searching for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>in the system for a good number of years, and it is certainly very much
in line with the thinking behind the children&#146;s plan. My concern
is that we can approve of the concept of partnership&#151;it is a
word to which we can give nothing but approval&#151;but when we
scratch it we sometimes find that it does not actually
exist.</div>
<a name="09030572000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
opinion, schools need to work in partnership. I was an autonomous head
teacher for 23 years and loved it&#151;well, I was an autonomous head
teacher for 18 of those years and loved it, but for the first five
years I was not. I would never want to take that autonomy away from
schools, as it has been beneficial for them and for children. Autonomy,
in my book, has to exist within certain parameters, and we should tell
schools that we expect a certain minimum element of co-operation,
because that not only meets the needs of children in the wider
community, but is helpful for schools.</div>
<a name="09030572000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested in the concept of schools creating the capacity to be able
to pick up problems through joint appointments between them, as
suggested in the children&#146;s plan. As a head teacher, I could
have used a psychiatric social worker but would not have been able to
keep them in full-time occupation. However, if I had been in
partnership with three or four schools and had easy access to someone
who could pick up problems and then perhaps help the child or school
through the system, the benefits would have been enormous. I think that
it is right and proper to say to schools, &#147;Yes, you ought to
work in partnership.&#148; I do not think they should do that at too
high a level, because the autonomy of schools is very important, but
they have to work inside a community. They are not just separate items
but are responsible to the community and to each
other.</div><a name="09030572000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000358"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Following on from that, are all the necessary
players who might be part of that specified in the Bill? For example, I
do not think that pupil referral units are
specified.</div><a name="09030572000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> No. However, I gather that PIUs will be
included&#151;this is where I will flail a bit&#151;through
subsequent guidance.</div>
<a name="09030572000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000359"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I have one final question. This morning, one of
our witnesses commented on that and suggested that it might be possible
for one school not to pair up and almost not to be chosen for the team,
as it were. Is there a danger that you might get some really strong
partnerships, but that perhaps the school that needs to be supported is
left out on the
edge?</div><a name="09030572000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I agree with you, as that is a danger. I
noted that the document, &#147;21st Century Schools&#148;, which
came out before Christmas, referred to the involvement of the local
authority in helping to guide the formation of partnerships. That might
be necessary in time, because the last thing you want is a partnership
with all those who, in a sense, did not need to be in partnership with
all the ones that needed to be on the outside of that. That needs to be
looked at to ensure that it does not
happen.</div><a name="09030572000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b> My apologies for being
late, Mr. Chope. The Bill, as currently drafted, relates to
secondary schools, and I wonder whether you thought that we should go
wider and include primary schools.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div><a name="09030572000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I did consider the issue of primary
schools and behaviour partnerships but concluded that, unless one was
careful, they would become such large and unwieldy organisations. I
have described the concept of partnerships as exciting, and my
fantasy&#151;it will not be me who is engaged in this in five or 10
years&#146; time&#151;is that you will have groups of schools
working much more closely together, and I very much want that to be
cross phased. The example of efficiency resource use shows that it is
often the small primary school that can least afford to get the
specialist services. I have worked in partnerships, and in my
experience we worked in closest partnership with our primary school.
However, with regard to the initial development, one should get
one&#146;s behaviour partnerships going in a manageable number
without making them so large that they would possibly be unwieldy. That
was the
thinking.</div><a name="09030572000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000361"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Carrying on with the behaviour partnerships,
obviously you have been around a great number of schools, and
presumably you have examples of good practice. What would be the best
way for us to disseminate that good practice throughout the
partnerships?</div><a name="09030572000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I saw some outstanding practice. I saw a
practice in Leeds and one in Waltham Forest&#151;I think it was in
the report&#151;that actually made me quite emotional. The quality of
what was being done for some really quite troubled children between
schools was exemplary. As I said, it was quite an emotional experience.
I think that there is a very fine balance between the Government
setting the parameters for things to happen and getting too much into
micro-management. I might be accused of too much micro-management with
the recommendation on the compulsory element of schools in
partnerships, although I do not accept that. We need to create a
situation for schools and then enable and encourage them to run with
it. You will find outstanding examples of such practice. This is
something that we always need to remember.</div>
<a name="09030572000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our
system, we have outstanding examples of good practice. Our problem is
that we have variation; we do not have consistency, which is a word
that I go on and on about in relation to all sorts of issues. That is
one of the things we need to put a driver on. However, we need to
create the baseline, parameters and expectations. It seems legitimate
for the Government to say, &#147;These are our expectations for a
state service&#148;, but then hopefully we can let the schools
develop and learn. I have found that some people are not only doing
what I have recommended in this review, but going much further than I
ever thought of. That is one of the joys of being in the educational
world.</div><a name="09030572000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000362"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I want to follow Annette Brooke&#146;s
question about the remarks this morning of our NUT witness. He said
that he was concerned about there being only one relevant partner, and
he mentioned using the local authority. Do you think that the local
children&#146;s trust board could have a role to play in this? Would
that be
effective?</div><a name="09030572000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> It could have a role to play, but that is
a difficult one to answer, because of course that is very much
embryonic. When we consider the role of children&#146;s trust boards
and the representation of head teachers it is looking into the future.
If children&#146;s trusts meet our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>aspirations for pulling together all the services around the child, it
would certainly be good, but that is very much speculating on a desired
outcome, rather than evidence that one can see at the
moment.</div><a name="09030572000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000363"></a>Sarah

included in the
partnerships?</div><a name="09030572000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> It is important that all schools are
included in partnerships. If some are not included, it will have a
devastating effect on everybody else and will be harmful to those
schools. Schools cannot be islands. The most dangerous situation for a
school is when it looks into itself all the time without outside
influence and support. In my view, if academies are to meet our
aspirations for them, which includes changing what are often very
difficult circumstances, they must also have things to teach. If they
meet that aspiration, which we hope they will, they will have expertise
and contributions to make to people in the community, too. Absolutely,
I think that all schools in an area need to be engaged with each other,
without removing their autonomy&#151;as I said, I was an autonomous
head teacher. I think that that is perfectly possible to
do.</div><a name="09030572000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000364"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):</b> In the
absence of other questions&#151;I would hate to be accused of hogging
anything&#151;I would like to know what the benefits are of changing
the name of pupil referral units and calling them schools for the first
time.</div><a name="09030572000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> They are educational institutions. They
are about children learning, not about putting them somewhere because
we do not know what else to do with them, which has sometimes been the
situation. Any child of school age ought to be in a school and the
concept ought to be of them learning. Why do we assume that because a
child goes to a PRU they are not capable of passing exams or doing
well? One of my closest educational friends, and the head of an
extremely able and high-performing school for children with emotional
and behavioural difficulties, went to an emotional and behavioural
difficulties school and, according to him, was illiterate until the age
of 15. We lose that concept. Right back in 2005, we called our report
&#147;Learning Behaviour&#148;. The whole concept is that the vast
majority of children are capable of learning, improving and removing
their problems. We have always got to hang on to that. PRUs ought to be
seen as schools; they are learning
institutions.</div><a name="09030572000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000365"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> This morning we heard John Bangs from the NUT
express concern about reporting the use of force. Do you think that
there is a significant danger, about which we should worry, of
situations whereby an incident has taken place in school and is
reported to a parent, who is consequently violent towards their
child?</div><a name="09030572000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> It is not a new problem. As a head
teacher, a situation would occasionally occur where one was aware of a
problem family and an issue would arise, which you jolly well knew that
the parents should know about. You would approach that situation with,
hopefully, skill and expertise. You would, perhaps, see the parent, or
make sure that it was presented in a certain way. As I said earlier, if
you were really concerned that that child was at physical risk, you
would be duty bound to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>taken certain steps already, under specific child protection procedures,
possibly involving social services or the educational welfare
service.</div>
<a name="09030572000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I do
not think that you should remove the&#151;in my eyes&#151;absolute
guiding right of parents to know whether their child has been
physically restrained. If my child had been physically restrained
because they needed to be, and I did not know about it, I would be
furious. It is an absolute right of parents to know what is happening
to their children in school. In those extreme cases, we have to be
skilful and clever in order to deal with them, but the absolute right
of parents to know what is happening to their children at school seems
to me
unanswerable.</div><a name="09030572000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000366"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Finally, this is a slightly dangerous question,
because I do not know what your answer will be. All members of the
Committee would acknowledge your expertise and the importance of the
work that you have done in your reports on behaviour. Is there anything
else, in the context of behaviour, about which we should legislate? Is
there anything that we have not done in successive pieces of
legislation that we use to implement our
work?</div><a name="09030572000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> The key things about improving the system
are sometimes the simple things which, because they are so simple, do
not excite us. I used the word &#147;consistency&#148; earlier and
I always use it when I do presentations to groups on behaviour. I often
say to them that the trouble is that it does not sound sexy. Our task
is to make the word &#147;consistency&#148; sexy. You say that to
people and they nod wisely, but they instantly move on and I feel that,
in their minds, they think that that is a bit boring. It is not boring,
it is hugely significant. There is so much research about the impact of
good quality teaching on children, especially the most vulnerable. It
is one of the most significant equal-opportunities issues that you can
think of&#151;who gains most from good quality teaching?</div>
<a name="09030572000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am going
around the houses to answer your question, but my answer is that our
task is to implement what we have got and do it well. As I said
earlier, we have got outstanding practice&#151;outstanding
practice&#151;but I understand that the variation in these schools,
not only between but within them, is one of the highest in OECD
countries. If we could only close that variation and lift the weakest
up to the standard of even the average, we would probably
meet&#151;and exceed&#151;all our targets. I actually think that it
can be&#151;I do not know if this is parliamentary language&#151;a
cop-out always to search for the big solution. We have the solutions;
we just have to get on and implement
them.</div><a name="09030572000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09030572000057"></a>

18</b><a name="09030572000367"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): Can we go back to the
question of whether primary schools should be included? I do not know
if you have had the opportunity, as part of your research, to look at
the work done in Plymouth by the Plymouth Excellence Cluster?</div>
<a name="09030572000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir

Seabeck:</b> It has been working for many years and has 26
schools&#151;primary and secondary&#151;engaged in dealing with
barriers to learning. That obviously includes behaviour, and it is very
successful. I know that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>there are a range of views on how to deal with pupils who, for many
reasons, do not learn or engage. I would say that there is some value,
having seen the specific work in Plymouth, in possibly including
primary schools. It does work. I hear what you say about a range of
views, horses for courses, having flexibility in the system and all
those sorts of issues, but I am not sure that primary schools should be
precluded.</div><a name="09030572000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> The Bill does not preclude them, does it?
It makes a requirement of secondary schools to be in a partnership, so
in a sense there is flexibility in areas such as
Plymouth.</div><a name="09030572000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

in?</div><a name="09030572000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> Part of my thinking is that schools are
in partnerships, but our problem is that they are in a huge number of
them, in all directions. My school was a specialist school in
technology and languages and also a training school; I was the leader
of the Redbridge network, which contained 56 schools, and there were
other links, too. The danger, as Estelle Morris said a few years ago,
is that too many relationships are a bit like bigamy: you cannot get a
deep relationship with anybody. Real partnership depends so much on
trust between
people.</div><a name="09030572000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
image is one of fewer schools working in partnership, but there is no
earthly reason why combinations could not be put together. I cannot
imagine a successful system that does not engage with, and link the
different phases of primary or further education. If we want genuinely
close partnership, we need to think about the optimum number of
relationships that a school can have and meaningfully carry them
forward.</div><a name="09030572000064"></a>

Seabeck:</b> I hear what you are saying and appreciate that
there is some flexibility in the system. What I do not want to see as a
result of this is partnerships that work quite well now, but are
perhaps beyond an optimum size, having to change the way that they
work. There has to be some sort of
flexibility.</div><a name="09030572000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I agree that that would be ludicrous. We
want to build on what is working well and not impede it in any way. As
I said earlier, a problem with writing reports and making
recommendations is that you can find somebody who is many miles beyond
you before your pen even hits the paper. One has to accept that degree
of humility as
well.</div><a name="09030572000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000371"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Finally, may I go back to the issue of PRUs? I am
sure that we have all visited our local PRUs, but I had not picked up
on the issue of blocking&#151;it is a bit like bed blocking in the
NHS&#151;where young people are kept in a PRU because there is
nowhere else for them to go. Of the children covered by your research,
can you put a percentage on those with mental health
problems?</div>
<a name="09030572000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> No I cannot, and it would be misleading
for me to suggest that I could. All I can give you is my judgment that
there are far more significant mental health problems among children
with behavioural difficulties than we recognised in the past. Some of
that has been cultural; as a head teacher 15 to 20 years ago, it was
extremely difficult to get the medical profession even to recognise
mental health issues among the young. I understood why&#151;they did
not want to label the child 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>too early, but the other side of that coin is that needs were not met.
The issue that receives the most vociferous reaction from head teachers
up and down the country is their disappointment at the interaction
between schools and children&#146;s and adolescents&#146; mental
health services, particularly the length of time before a child is
seen. It can take nine or 12 months to get an
appointment.</div><a name="09030572000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000372"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> I actually think that this is a serious
issue.</div><a name="09030572000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> It is an extremely serious
issue.</div><a name="09030572000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000373"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> There are a number of young people with
borderline mental health issues, which, if they are not identified and
supported, become much more serious as they go through the school
system. Again, in my own locality, I have had real difficulty trying to
find out why the percentage referred to experts by schools is so low
compared with voluntary drop-in places, which are much more willing to
identify mental health problems in young people. I got the answer that
you have just given, namely that they were worried about stigmatising
people. There is an issue here,
however.</div><a name="09030572000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I think that there may be another
issue&#151;this is pure speculation so it need not be given any added
value: if a service is unresponsive and you do not get a reaction for
nine months or a year, it does not encourage a school to make
recommendations. Another point, which links to a key element of the
2005 recommendations, is that these children need&#151;I always use
this term&#151;champions, somebody who will help them through the
system. As a head teacher, it was often extremely depressing to see
coming across my desk papers relating to a child for whom an
appointment with CAMHS had not been kept by the family. The child
therefore got struck off the list and you were back at the ludicrous
mad hatter&#146;s tea party for another 12 months. The
role of people such as parent support advisers is really important in
schools. Those people have the capacity to assist the family and the
child through what is often a complicated and hostile world. I want to
avoid typecasting, but we are talking about families and children who
find life difficult and need that bit of extra support, which can often
come from schools if they have the
capacity.</div><a name="09030572000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><a name="09030572000374"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): How strong
is the link between poor teaching and poor
behaviour?</div><a name="09030572000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> There clearly is a link between poor
teaching and poor behaviour. That can be taken as a given, in a sense.
The Ofsted chief inspector, Christine Gilbert, said that in January, I
think. My view is that standards of teaching are generally good.
However, I do not think that we get the benefits of the sum of our
parts and there are major development possibilities there. The culture
in English education is too disparate. I am not preaching a Stalinist
policy, but it is really important in a school that a group of
professionals get together and identify their common practices so that
they can support each other and make much more of an impact through
their individual efforts. That is of huge benefit to teachers and
children. I told you that I go on and on about consistency, and at the
press of the button I will come back to
that.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div><a name="09030572000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, there has
to be a link between poor teaching and bad behaviour. However, it needs
to be said&#151;I want to say it loud and clear&#151;that schools
are rarely the cause of problems. They are pickers-up of problems and
they generally do that well. I am a bit defensive of schools. You might
think that I would be because of my background and I accept that, as I
accept that I am defensive of young people. The outside world has a
very harsh and sometimes unkind attitude towards schools. You can find
schools that are the author of their
problems&#151;absolutely&#151;but that is not common. Generally
schools pick up problems in society and they usually do that well. We
need to ensure that that message goes
out.</div><a name="09030572000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000375"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am not sure whether you entirely answered my
question, interesting though your answer was. I asked how strong the
link was. You said that it is a truism that there is a link, and also
that the problems contribute to bad behaviour. But is it a strong link
or a relatively weak
one?</div><a name="09030572000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I think that it is a strong link if
teaching is substandard. That was as true for me 40 years
ago&#151;my wife tells me it is 45 years ago&#151;in my grammar
school in Oxford as it is now. If a teacher is not capable of teaching
to a reasonably high level, children will
misbehave.</div><a name="09030572000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000376"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> That is where I wanted to get you to, because it
then becomes a clear question of whether too few poor teachers are
removed from the profession. The tendency is for them to move from one
institution to another and, as one head teacher said to me, &#147;The
further away the bad teacher is going the better their
reference&#148;. If there is a strong link, as you say, between poor
teaching and poor behaviour and you are trying to increase consistency,
surely one of the central things that we should do is separate teachers
into those who already do a good job and those who do not, and divide
the latter group into two categories of those who can be brought up to
a consistent, good standard and those who cannot. Those who cannot
should be removed. Are you ducking that issue in some
way?</div><a name="09030572000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I will try not to duck anything. Tell me
if I have and I will come back to you on
it.</div><a name="09030572000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is clearly a link between poor behaviour and poor teaching. That is not
the same as saying that the cause of poor behaviour is poor teaching.
As I said earlier, in the large majority of cases, schools
are less the authors of the problem and more the people dealing
with it. I have absolutely no problem with removing poor
teachers&#151;none whatsoever. If people are not doing the job, they
need to be moved out or, and&#151;I think that one has to accept this
before one gets too knee-jerk&#151;helped to become better, which has
to be a possibility. If we are talking about children being helped to
improve their performance, we must say the same about
teachers.</div><a name="09030572000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would say, and I hope that I put it correctly, that we must be
extraordinarily careful about seizing on poor teachers as a big
headline solution. If we want to improve and transform our system,
helping the average to become good is far more significant. We do not
have that debate. I suggest, though I have no experience in a company
or any other organisation, that, sure, you want to deal with the few
who are not very good&#151;and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>it is very few&#151;but to transform your school, organisation or
company you need to take the people who are okay and make them good. I
hope that I have answered the
question.</div>
<a name="09030572000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000377"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I do not feel that you have. The question is: are
we doing enough? You have said that it is not the whole picture and,
obviously, the big picture is to attract higher-quality people into
teaching, to motivate and to retain them. The number one aim is to have
the best possible people teaching and a culture that supports them and
gives them high status. The corollary of that is that we must be brave
enough to tackle those teachers who are not up to scratch. I think that
it is unfair to the Government to suggest that there are no programmes
to raise the general standard of those who could do better; there is an
effort to do that. However, there is a question about failures that you
do not seem to have answered: should more effort be made to remove
those teachers who cannot be improved? Would that help with
consistency?</div>
<a name="09030572000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I will do my best, but to pick up on your
point, I was not criticising the Government; if I was criticising
anybody, it was schools. Where you develop people is in the workplace.
Government can do huge things, but they cannot walk on water. It is for
the schools and organisations to do that and to accept responsibility
for it.</div>
<a name="09030572000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are we doing
enough to get rid of incompetent teachers? That is a difficult question
to answer. So much of it is not in the power of central control; it is
in the power of the local organisations and how they think about it. In
other words, you may find that the procedures are there, but, as in
many other cases, the question is whether they are being operated. I
have touched on that a little before.</div>
<a name="09030572000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030572000378"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> No one does.</div>
<a name="09030572000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I have said to people at the National
College for School Leadership that they need to look at their
leadership training to see why we have so much variation inside our
schools, and I think that they are open to doing that. It is a huge
leadership issue. If performance in your school varies hugely, you have
to ask yourself, &#147;Why is that. What does that say about the
leadership? What does it say about my leadership?&#148; I find it
difficult to answer your question specifically because it is a
difficult area. There is work to be done on creating awareness in
schools that they have powers to deal with poor-quality teaching, when
it occurs. I do not think that can be done on high from central

schools.</div>
<a name="09030572000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have more
rigour and accountability than we have ever had. I will not waste your
time with anecdotes, but when I started in 1985 there was absolutely
nothing about accountability and there was no interest in results.
There was none of that in the mid-&#145;80s. We have a very
accountable system now, If we have incompetents, we want to get rid of
them, but we also want to ask ourselves: when will we be satisfied?
What accountability system will ever make us relaxed and happy? You
could go on ratcheting up the accountability and never reach the point
where you are happy.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><a name="09030572000379"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): You are a very
successful former head teacher, so what about leadership? It seems
surprising that you can have a school that is failing or in deep
trouble, bring in a different head teacher and that head can turn that
school around in three or four years&#151;sometimes more, sometimes
less. There seems to be variation in the quality of head teachers. That
is not surprising&#151;there is variation in the quality of Members
of Parliament, for example. But what about head teachers who are
reaching their sell-by date, or those who, it transpires, are not
equipped intellectually or do not have the managerial ability needed?
Is enough being done to manage those circumstances and the people who
find themselves in such
situations?</div><a name="09030572000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> You are getting into areas of opinion. I
would not claim expertise in answering that question. There are
problems. I shall probably be drummed out of my professional
associations for giving you this answer, but it struck me as a nonsense
that I could become a head teacher at the age of 30 and that there was
no requirement for me to undergo any further professional training
until the day I retired at the age of 65. That seems a very odd way to
run a professional service. If I were writing a report on that area, I
would probably include recommendation on the
subject.</div><a name="09030572000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are infinitely better than we have ever been at preparing people for
headship, but there is still work to be done in schools on the
continuing development of teachers at the senior and middle-ranking
levels. Leadership is not only at the top, but in the middle, as well.
When talking about teacher training, we all have a tendency to head
instantly to initial teacher training. That is a mistake. My judgment
is that, although one or two tweaks might help, initial teacher
training is pretty good, as is the standard of teachers coming into
schools. What worries me is the training for people who are four, five,
10 or 15 years in. I hope that that touches on your
question.</div><a name="09030572000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
head teachers are removed from post than ever were before. Whether that
is enough is a matter of judgment. You are right that sometimes what is
needed in a school is not a magic wand, but the ability to see things
differently. It is possible in any organisation for the leadership to
be overwhelmed by the circumstances and to become unable to step back
and see what needs to be
done.</div><a name="09030572000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000380"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> A head teacher who is exceptionally good at
injecting discipline into a school in the first two or three years
might not have the skill set required to drive up academic standards.
Do you see what I am saying? We expect head teachers to be good across
the piece. Perhaps, when we are turning schools around, we should bring
in for shorter periods head teachers who have a specific skill set in
an area, but we should not expect them to stay there indefinitely as
their skill set begins to lack relevance to the challenges that they
face.</div><a name="09030572000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> That is an interesting point. I draw a
slight distinction in that that is perhaps more applicable to primary
schools than to secondary schools. A good secondary leader would
conduct an audit of skills and, if they had any sense, they would
appoint other staff to the leadership team who had expertise in the
areas that they lacked. That is standard practice in any leadership
team. That is rather more difficult in a small organisation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>such as a primary school because the leadership team is so much smaller.
Primary schools are therefore more
vulnerable.</div><a name="09030572000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
school improvement partner is a relatively recent development&#151;it
must have been brought in about five, six or seven years ago. That
provides support. My view is that there is still a place for head
teachers to have the support of somebody outside the inspectorial
world, such as a peer professional. There is a lot of research to show
that if you want to change people&#146;s habits, you should put them
together with a peer professional whom they
respect.</div><a name="09030572000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
failing heads, you cannot have a poor head teacher in an organisation
and they have to be removed. Nobody would deny that. However, the
immediate response to a bad set of results should not be, &#147;Out
you go.&#148; The same goes for children. Football management gives
us lessons to avoid rather than to
copy.</div><a name="09030572000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09030572000096"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><a name="09030572000381"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): In
interim report 4, you make it clear that early intervention is critical
to maintaining standards. You talk in some detail about sharing best
practice and resources across the school. Are LEAs well equipped to
deliver the outcomes that you want and will the Bill help in that
regard?</div><a name="09030572000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> The clauses here are outside that. I
think the answer is probably no. If we accept&#151;it is hard to
argue against&#151;that early intervention is the most effective way
to remove problems, we need to look at structures and ask whether they
support that concept. I am not sure that they do. You are listening to
someone who was a secondary head teacher. I think we may need to look
at whether our resources are pinpointed in all the places where they
would be most effective. One reason for my enthusiasm for behaviour
partnerships is that pooling expertise and resources makes early
intervention so much more possible. I am not convinced that we
currently have sufficient strength in early intervention. What I am
saying is very much on the lines of what the children&#146;s plan
says: it is an area to be developed. I hope it will
be.</div>
<a name="09030572000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000382"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Two short points on that theme. Would you say that
LEAs, in similar vein, have done enough to encourage behaviour
partnerships? Does the Bill encourage or oblige compliance in that
regard?</div><a name="09030572000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> LEAs have done a lot to encourage people
to sign up to the fair access protocol, which most schools do. I would
be somewhat sceptical about whether the fair access protocol means much
in reality in terms of behaviour partnerships, which is why I made the
recommendations I did. In many areas it is more a paper provision than
a reality, which is why in my view we need to go a step further to make
it
real.</div><a name="09030572000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000383"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Finally, is enough consideration given in the Bill
to encouraging best practice in FE and sixth-form colleges? Are LEAs
best placed to do that or should it be promoted through another
agency?</div><a name="09030572000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> I am going to have to pass on that one.
That was not an area of my report and is not within what I consider my
expertise. You might need to ask another witness that question. I do
not wish to give opinions that are a bit flaky.</div>

Blackman</b> (Erewash) (Lab): Sir Alan, I think we all agree
that the pay-off of having an effective behaviour and attendance
partnership is incalculable. You cited very movingly some good
examples, but you made the point that consistency and implementation
are vital. We have put those partnerships on a statutory footing, but
that does not necessarily mean that they will all be effective. We have
talked about the role of the local authority. Are there any other
levers, pressures or support that you think would play a part in
driving up the effectiveness of all these
partnerships?</div><a name="09030572000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> We have to look at the organs we have and
see how they develop. Ofsted is particularly in my mind as I make that
comment. Ofsted has to be a developing organisation; it must be there
to inspect a changing world. If we are establishing behaviour
partnerships we must expect some form of inspection accountability for
them. One would want to make that at an appropriate level. Like
everybody else, one shudders at unnecessary bureaucracy, but if we are
setting up those structures because we believe they are really
important, accountability systems have to go with
them.</div><a name="09030572000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000385"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I want to return in part, but not entirely, to
behaviour partnerships. A number of witnesses and representations from
the schools sector have suggested that the new duties upon them,
particularly the duty to co-operate and report to the children&#146;s
trust board, could be very onerous for them and they fear spending more
time than ever in meetings. In relation to behaviour partnerships, and
perhaps more generally from your long experience as a head teacher, are
those real fears about getting tied up, as teachers used to, in long
meetings with local authorities&#151;all talk and nothing
happening?</div><a name="09030572000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> That is difficult to respond to. I love
the teaching profession, I loved being a head teacher. If I could wave
a magic wand, I would go back to doing it instantly and be 10 years
younger. However, ours is a jolly conservative profession and I think
there is sometimes a natural reluctance to do
that.</div><a name="09030572000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot see why a behaviour partnership would be a bureaucratic
nightmare, and so on; I really cannot see it. If it did end up becoming
a bureaucratic nightmare&#151;I suppose that this is me dodging the
issue&#151;I would say that we are doing it badly. The whole purpose
of being in partnership is to solve problems and to reduce pressures
and stresses, not to increase them. If you are sitting in a meeting
that is a waste of time and a talking shop, I would leave if I were you
and do something different. I can see the fears and I understand them
and where they are coming from, but I would be bitterly disappointed if
what you said turned out to be the truth. I would actually think that
the partnerships had gone wrong and gone off the rails somewhere,
because the whole purpose of working together is to remove
problems.</div><a name="09030572000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dealing
with major behaviour problems in a school is enormously time-consuming.
I can remember once working out that a permanent exclusion took me
something like 21 or 24 hours of clerical work preparing it, and about
another 10 hours in appearing before various committees, and that was
all within a very short period of time. It was an enormous burden. We
want to balance such burdens against what you are trying to achieve. If
we can reduce other problems, which obviously
benefits  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>children, we also reduce the problems for ourselves. In answer to your
point, I can only say, &#147;I hope not&#148;. I cannot see why it
should be a
problem.</div><a name="09030572000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000386"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> One of my interests is how children are taught to
read. I read the Peter Hyman book, &#147;1 Out of
10&#148;, about the adviser who went on to become a teacher at
Islington Green school. He was looking at the children there who were
in detention and he was told by another teacher that 90 per cent. of
those children had problems with reading. From your experience, is
struggling with reading a contributory factor to the levels of poor
behaviour that we have in our secondary
schools?</div><a name="09030572000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Alan Steer:</b></i> You may be interested to know that Peter
Hyman was a history teacher for a year at my school, so I know him very
well and I have enjoyed reading his book and articles.</div>
<a name="09030572000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
what you say is absolutely true: struggling with reading is a
contributory factor. I do not want to avoid the question, but perhaps I
can broaden it slightly to encompass special needs, which I mentioned a
lot in that last report. There can be a clear link between behaviour
problems and unmet special needs. There can be a straight special needs
child who has emotional and behavioural difficulties; that is obvious.
However, there can be a wider spectre. If a child cannot access a
lesson it will impact on their behaviour. One can see that in
one&#146;s own life.</div>
<a name="09030572000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">When people
visited my school&#151;we got a lot of visitors and they were very
complimentary&#151;and they asked me what I would pick out as key
factors, I always picked out the special educational needs department.
I was worried that people might think that I was just giving them a
nice answer, because they would think that that was good, but it is the
truth. If you can deal positively with the children in your school who
have most difficulties, you make such an enormous impact on the school
culture. You reduce the amount of problems and the other key thing is
that, if you get the expectations right in the school for the least
able, you can sure as anything get them right for everybody else.
Seeing it the other way round, the &#147;What do you expect with
children like that?&#148; attitude is a cancer. That is not what you
asked me, but it is the point that I wanted to
make.</div><a name="09030572000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
answer to you is yes, absolutely. If children cannot access their
learning, why are you surprised when you get that sort of behaviour? We
can probably remember sitting in boring lessons in our youth,
occasionally, and not behaving quite as we would wish to have
done.</div><a name="09030572000114"></a>

question.</div><a name="09030572000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09030572000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><a name="09030572000390"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Maria Miller</b> (Basingstoke) (Con): Thank you for coming to
the Committee today. It is useful to have you here. This is an
important opportunity to look at how we can improve the effectiveness
of support for families and children throughout the country. The Bill
looks in particular at children&#146;s centres, children&#146;s
trust boards and the funding of nursery places. Concern has been
expressed by a number of organisations that there has been a great deal
of change in the sector over the last decade. Further change must be
carefully considered before it is put in place. There must be a focus
on how we can improve sustainability, make services more responsive to
local communities, improve our work with the private, voluntary and
independent sector and have a more effective partnership with health.
What would you do if you could change any aspect of the Bill to achieve
those objectives or others that you think are
important?</div><a name="09030572000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> A major thing I would do is specify
consultation with parents more clearly. Although it is generally
implied that that will happen, it is not specified in the Bill. During
our research on the development of parenting strategies we have found a
reluctance to consult with the users and a tendency to focus on the
providers when developing needs assessments. Often there is the will to
consult with parents, but there is a need for guidance on the different
methods that can be used to do that when developing services. Having
said that, there have been huge moves in that direction. Sure Start has
pioneered many ways of doing that. My advice is that we should develop
good guidance for developing the various
strategies.</div><a name="09030572000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> The first thing to say is that the Bill
contains much that is helpful. We have always firmly supported early
intervention and integration. The further work on children&#146;s
trusts and co-operation is enormously helpful. Children&#146;s
centres are, of course, what we do and great work is being done. There
is a question over whether we should do things differently or ensure
that what is done is factored in and strengthened. We must ensure that
we are talking about the development of the child rather than the needs
of the professional service around the
child.</div><a name="09030572000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been working in a fast-moving environment, but it has moved in an
evolutionary way. We have to get to a stage where some of the
difficulties created by the piecemeal system are cleared up. We must
enshrine something that is fit for purpose for the future. The work on
children&#146;s centres starts to do that. There should be a broader
link to services across the age range and we should link better with
services for over-fives. There must be continuing support across the
age range linked to early
intervention.</div><a name="09030572000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000391"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Are you therefore happy with the definition used
in the Bill of the sorts of services that children&#146;s
centres are allowed to deliver? Might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>putting those on a statutory footing make local authorities more
conscious of the need to keep within the
rules?</div><a name="09030572000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> We think that children&#146;s centres
are very positive, deliver the sort of support that people need and are
effective, so we suggest that enshrining them in a legal framework
would help. However, we would be really concerned to ensure that that
was an enabling framework. We believe that they need to be community
based, whoever runs them. Many third sector organisations find it
difficult to run such organisations, but they are important entities
that have an important role to play alongside statutory agencies.
Sometimes there is a bit of a pecking order involved. We would not want
to put something in place that only local authorities could deliver.
The majority of provision is currently delivered by local authorities,
and that might be a phase issue, but we want to strengthen the
requirement for local authorities to look more widely for providers who
are able to deliver. Certainly, we also wish to strengthen community
ownership and governance to ensure that the responsibility and power do
not lie only within the realm of the local authority, but that some of
that starts to be relayed much more through
communities.</div>
<a name="09030572000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000392"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> And not focusing exclusively on the
under-fives?</div>
<a name="09030572000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> There should certainly be strengthened
links between the work in the Bill about children&#146;s centres and
how that relates to work with children over the age of five, not only
to ensure a good transition, but to really play through the integrated
vision.</div>
<a name="09030572000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> The trouble about speaking after Anne is
that she says it all. This is a big Bill, and there is an awful lot in
it. Returning to your question, I echo the point about consultation
with parents but also think that it is important to ensure that there
are mechanisms to include children and young people in consultation. I
believe we should run a slide rule over the Bill to ensure that it
meets the needs of the most vulnerable children and young people,
because my organisation is essentially concerned with providing
services for the most vulnerable children and young people. They can be
the children who are missed because they have very low visibility and
can behave unpredictably, so there has to be a way of finding some
coherence and capturing those aspects</div>
<a name="09030572000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Someone
mentioned outcomes a moment ago. It is hugely important to ensure that
in everything to do with children and young people, particularly
because of the current shortage of money, we remember about
commissioning for outcomes within the context of early intervention, as
Anne said. We will not do that within the context of the Bill unless
there is coherence, simplicity and transparency in how measurement will
take place with children&#146;s trust
boards.</div>

responsibility for doing that. I agree with much of what Anne has said
and think that who provides that is a secondary consideration. Meeting
the needs of the most 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>vulnerable children and young people in a particular
locality has to be determined by what the locality throws up. The core
offer needs to be there, and we support the core offer as expressed,
but the flex that Anne described has to be there, because communities
are very different. As I have said, the most vulnerable children are
often very much under the parapet, so you have to look hard for them
and work quite assertively to find them and bring them into the
provision.</div><a name="09030572000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> Community provision is not a soft
option&#151;it is not about leaving it all to make its own way. It is

question. For my money, the important things are the ingredients of a
good children&#146;s centre: it is genuinely at the heart of the
community, it reflects the community, it involves the citizens of the
community, and it demonstrably puts the needs of children and their
families first in its arrangements. That means that different people
are best at providing services in different places. Prescription is not
helpful.</div><a name="09030572000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> And local authorities do not always
necessarily do it best. Some may find themselves as the predominant
provider by happenstance or because of the phase of the roll-out. Some
need to get running quickly, and local authorities are often able to do
that better than others, but we have to look at the next phase, which
is about opening up services and encouraging and supporting others to
become involved. Some small third sector organisations just cannot go
through lengthy commissioning processes, so there may be issues there,
too.</div><a name="09030572000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09030572000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><a name="09030572000395"></a><b class="B">Jeff
Ennis</b> (Barnsley, East and Mexborough) (Lab): Continuing on
the theme of children&#146;s centres, I represent a deprived
constituency. The children&#146;s centres are doing a fantastic job
in many of my communities. Sometimes they are attached to or next door
to a primary school, sometimes they are stand-alone facilities. Do our
witnesses think that that is a relevant consideration to the
establishment of future children&#146;s centres? Is there debate as
to whether they should be attached to a formal learning institution or
stand
alone?</div><a name="09030572000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> We did some research into
children&#146;s centres for the Department and found that several
work fairly effectively attached to schools, but there are obviously
reservations because of parents&#146; experience of schools. However,
the same anxiety was raised before we trialled another project, which
was on parent information sessions in schools. We trialled the sessions
in community centres as well, but it was the schools that parents went
to. Perhaps we can be a bit over-anxious about that connection. That is
all I have to
say.</div><a name="09030572000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> Many centres are based in schools, and
naturally so. Often there is space&#151;premises and so on&#151;and
often the impetus is there to do that. Whether centres are based at
schools or not, they have to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>firm links and good relationships with schools. This goes back to some
of the questions in the earlier evidence session about how to build
relationships with the wider community, but also how schools provide a
strategic link. When you are looking at how best to respond to
individuals&#146; needs, you need to take into consideration not only
the children&#146;s centre but also the
school.</div><a name="09030572000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point is that if you are looking at ongoing support for parents
while their children are in school, if you can pull out some of the
support from children&#146;s centres&#151;parent support,
specialist support and so on&#151;you can get to a situation where
you have much more ongoing family support system than you would if the
children&#146;s centre were separate. There is a big opportunity
there that we need to capitalise
on.</div><a name="09030572000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000396"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> Would a possible alternative viable model be to
site some of the new children&#146;s centres that will be established
with new health centres, for example, rather than in a school
setting?</div><a name="09030572000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> Yes, and some are run by health, are they
not?</div><a name="09030572000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> Yes, some are run by heath. Again, the key
is not to be prescriptive. We have children&#146;s centres that are
bang next door to primary schools. Actually, we have one that is in an
undersubscribed primary school. Half the building is now used for the
children&#146;s centre. It is what actually happens, the
relationships that develop between professionals and what the locality
needs that are the pre-eminent
considerations.</div><a name="09030572000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000397"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> But the local community needs to have a big say on
the location of the children&#146;s centres so that they have
ownership of
them.</div><a name="09030572000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i>
Absolutely.</div><a name="09030572000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> Yes, and the relationships need to be in
place. Sometimes you get a children&#146;s centre on a school site
but the relationships are not fantastic. Just because a centre is
plonked beside a school does not mean that everything is working
fantastically. There have to be strategic and operational
relationships.</div><a name="09030572000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000398"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> One final point on children&#146;s centres: do
you have a recommendation as to how outreach work could made be more
effective than it is at present? It is not specifically covered in the
Bill, but it is clearly a major
concern.</div><a name="09030572000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> I think that it is regrettable that it is
not in the Bill. Several things are not specified clearly enough in the
Bill, such as what co-operation means in relation to children&#146;s
trusts and how that would be effective, and what the definition of need
is in relation to children&#146;s centres. While one would of course
say that a local response was needed to address local issues or
preferences, there has to be some definition of the need if you are
asking the local authority to provide children&#146;s centres to meet
that need. Our research showed that outreach was viewed as one of the
most critical things that children&#146;s centres were doing. The
providers found it absolutely essential and were developing it a
lot.</div><a name="09030572000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> We feel that it is critical to think about
outreach in the context of children&#146;s centres. We run about 85
centres, and it troubled us that we were not sure whether we were
attracting the most disadvantaged 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>families into them. We have commissioned a national study to look at the
delivery of intensive family support services through our Sure Start
children&#146;s centres, and although we do not yet have the final
report our initial findings suggest very strongly that intensive
support can make a very positive difference to the lives of children
and their families in even the most challenging circumstances. We have
employed people explicitly to go and find the parents who are not
coming into the children&#146;s centres. The anecdotal evidence from
talking to parents and professionals&#151;health visitors and so
on&#151;was that people who already felt stigmatised in their
communities sometimes felt they could not go into the &#147;lovely
building&#148;&#151;that they would be unwelcome and excluded from
it. If we send staff to work closely with those people and develop the
relationship, they do come in. They realise that their perception that
they will be stigmatised is false. They quickly develop very good
relationships with members of the community who hitherto were not
there, and tremendous support develops between families. Some of the
most marginalised families engage very well once they are in, and that
is incredibly
encouraging.</div><a name="09030572000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> I agree absolutely that the outreach
function is very important and needs to be embodied in
children&#146;s centres. There are a couple of opportunities to pick
up on. First, there is the status of outreach workers. I am less
worried about the name they have been given than about their status.
They should be expected to work alongside multidisciplinary teams and
take their place alongside social workers and other specialist
professionals in identifying need and responding to it. Secondly,
because this provision has evolved organically, we have a mass of
people who deliver on a huge area of common ground but who have
different names. There are parent support advisers, outreach workers,
family support workers, and even health visitors and social workers.
There is a job to be done there in looking at how we can bring that
together in a much more coherent package of support workers for
families. Whether that is the job of the Bill is a different
matter.</div><a name="09030572000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09030572000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000399"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Focusing on the Bill, did you look particularly to
see whether there were any areas where there should be more mention of
bringing in the voice of children and young
people?</div><a name="09030572000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> There are some children&#146;s trust
advisory boards or children&#146;s trusts that already have parents
and children on them. Whether you would want to extend that and look at
how well it is working is an issue to at least be
considered.</div><a name="09030572000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> Certainly, in terms of the consultation that
I am pulling together on the children and young person&#146;s plan,
it is curious that they are not involved in that process. That would be
a relatively straightforward thing to drop into the
Bill.</div><a name="09030572000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> It is now commonplace for local
authorities to have well-developed systems to consult children and
young people from an early age, and there are also some quite formal
mechanisms in place to allow them to feed into decision making. There
is again an opportunity to enshrine this in some of the language around
children&#146;s trusts and the children&#146;s
plan.</div><a name="09030572000158"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030572000401"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Is this your last
one?</div><a name="09030572000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000402"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I think it might be. We have been looking at the
power to search from the school perspective but not from that of
children&#146;s rights. Are there any issues that we should be
debating on that proposal as far as children&#146;s rights are
concerned?</div><a name="09030572000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> My starting point would be a relationship
and culture of respect that goes two ways within the school
environment. If asked, children and young people would probably say
that it is fine to search them because a lot of them suffer from the
difficult behaviour of others, and children are usually quite strident
in those situations. Clearly, it has to be done within a culture of
positive behaviour and respect and one that bears that in mind
throughout.</div>
<a name="09030572000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> It is incredibly difficult and I would
agree. When we did our &#147;Step Inside Our Shoes&#148;
consultation about the use of guns and knives, we were surprised by the
extent to which young people felt the importance of their role as
victims and how little that was understood and thought about. Equally,
we learned how important it was not to patronise them but to explain
properly the reasons for doing things&#151;and to do it in a way that
was upfront and honest&#151;and to listen to what they had
to say and to do it with respect in the way that Anne
described.</div><a name="09030572000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000403"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I have one question on children&#146;s
centres and then I want to move on to a different area. The NUT
believes that every children&#146;s centre should have a properly
qualified early years teacher and that education should be the primary
focus of a children&#146;s centre. What is your view on
that?</div><a name="09030572000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> It should be one of the primary
considerations, but other aspects of well-being for a child of that age
clearly are critical. The proposal to have an educational expert is
sensible and there probably does need to be more of a link with the
education sector, certainly in relation to the advisory boards that are
considered for the children&#146;s centres. I would not say it was
the primary purpose. There is a big health function, after
all.</div><a name="09030572000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> There is a lot of evidence showing that an
early years teacher is helpful in reaching outcomes but, as has been
said, there are much wider outcomes within this. It would be a mistake
to place children&#146;s centres entirely within an educational
framework. An issue in the amendments concerns governing bodies. We
need to keep an eye on that. We are not thinking of school governing
bodies, we are talking about governance mechanisms that reflect
communities. We are not just throwing this in within the governing body
of a school. Educational outcomes are important as part of this, but it
goes much broader. I see children&#146;s centres as a vanguard
movement within the wider children&#146;s services. If we can get a
culture of seeing things in the round rather than in professional boxes
when children are very young, maybe we can start transforming schools
with a much more rounded approach.</div>
<a name="09030572000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> As Anne says, one of the great strengths of
good children&#146;s centres is that they are genuinely working with
the child at the centre of what happens. A lot of kids in our Sure
Start children&#146;s centres in some of the most deprived
communities have an awful long way 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>to go before they can even engage with some of the more traditional
approaches, even on early years education, because the issues involved
are resilience, well-being and building up their ability to receive, if
you like. Therefore, it seems to me to be a mistake to over-emphasise
health, education or any other discipline, because that loses the sense
of what children&#146;s centres are about.</div>
<a name="09030572000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, we have a lot of early years provision involving qualified staff
in our children&#146;s centres, and, if you are going to do that, you
certainly need to do it well, professionally, get the best possible
people involved and not do it on the
cheap.</div><a name="09030572000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000404"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> During your earlier evidence, Clare, you
were very passionate about the people who are left behind and our most
vulnerable young people, some of whom are in youth custody. Education
stops for such people, but what are everyone&#146;s views on the
proposals to change
that?</div><a name="09030572000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> I go back to my opening comments about
trying to find a way to run a slide rule over the issue and how we
manage to capture the most vulnerable people. I am delighted that you
have raised the point, because if there is any area in which we fail
young people, it is in getting them in and out of youth justice. That
is particularly true of young people with special educational needs who
have an unequivocal statement that gets lost as they move in and out of
the criminal justice
system.</div><a name="09030572000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all do ourselves a disservice in terms of the huge achievements or
attainments that could have been made by individual young people in the
face of enormous adversity. Nobody intends for that to happen because
of a short period in custody, but it does because of a disconnect in
terms of where the young people have gone, so everything is
disproportionately lost. There has to be some scrutiny of how we
maintain some continuity for a young person who is still a child.
Actually, this week, newspapers have reported the extent to which
prison governors and staff are not necessarily aware that SEN
statements still apply because children are
involved.</div><a name="09030572000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> That is right. Again, this goes back to
the core threads around the Bill in terms of ensuring that early
intervention is in place and that all areas of children&#146;s
services work strategically, including those that focus on youth
offending, which are often not involved in partnership discussions of
the mainstream kind that we are talking about, nor are they often
active partners in wider discussions. I therefore think that the Bill
is helpful in terms of support for the
individual.</div><a name="09030572000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> I support what the others say from the
same
perspective.</div><a name="09030572000173"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000405"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> My final question is do you think that our
proposals go far enough for young people in custody? Some people have
said that the Bill should state that young people&#146;s needs should
be met in exactly the same way as they would be in the mainstream. Do
you think that that would be practically
possible?</div><a name="09030572000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> We probably always say that you have not
gone far enough out of instinct. There could be some form of ambition
towards ensuring that, but practical circumstances clearly get in the
way of a lot of things, so you cannot have complete consistency across 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>the piste. The recognition that we are talking about children and the
principle of entitlement to support, whatever the circumstances, is
useful. Again, I stress the need to build partnerships and links. There
might be ways to ensure that and a wider, ongoing strategic plan,
rather than just when a child is in
custody.</div><a name="09030572000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000406"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> May I ask about children&#146;s trusts? I think
that everybody would like to see better partnership working for the
benefit of children, as well as commissioning on a common-sense basis.
Are you convinced that children&#146;s trusts are going to deliver
that? The very recent report from the Audit Commission said
that</div><a name="09030572000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is little evidence that children&#146;s trusts...have improved
outcomes for children and young people or delivered better value for
money, over and above locally agreed cooperation.&#148;</div>
<a name="09030572000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> I think that it is too early to make a
decision about that. It was unlikely that we would see an impact on
outcomes so soon after they had been introduced. They were not
introduced uniformly, or properly specified, and that is how we see
this provision now&#151;to put trusts on a clearer footing. I am not
sure that it will put it on a sufficiently clear footing, which is the
issue that I just raised.</div>
<a name="09030572000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
on the notion of bringing in schools, there clearly needs to be
guidance on how that would operate with so many schools, whether you
would have them in bundles and how they would co-operate. It is
specified in the Bill that the partners would adhere to the plan, but
it does not say how they would input into the plan. That is an area
that needs to be thought through. In the Audit Commission&#146;s
report, there needs to be thought about joint commissioning,
accountability lines and how it would tap into mainstream resources. My
own view is that it would be a shame to draw back from the tool of
co-operation at this stage. It is worth pursuing to see how it evolves,
but it does need more definition and you certainly want to maintain
individual service responsibility and accountability
lines.</div><a name="09030572000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000407"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am unclear from your answer whether you believe
that it is right to move on, given that we are at an early stage and
that there are doubts&#151;actually, more than doubts: the evidence
to date is that they are not working. Would putting them on a statutory
footing just be
symbolism?</div><a name="09030572000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> I would say that a significant
contribution to them not working is that they have not been implemented
in some areas. That was because they were not put on a statutory
footing in the first
place.</div><a name="09030572000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> Part of their failure is that they have
been quite conceptual. They have not even had capital letters at the
beginning of their names until recently, so it has been a concept
rather than a thing. I think that we would all support the notion that
services and people with responsibilities work together and that this
is a means to an end. It is a means to an end and it is not an end in
itself. I welcome the fact that they are being put on a firmer footing.
That should give greater direction and leadership to people who may, or
may not, think it is a good thing, or who may have their own ideas
about how it is done. I think that it can only help. I would want to
see them as enabling: they are there to make things happen and to work
more effectively.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div><a name="09030572000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">They are
hugely inconsistent at the moment and there is a lot to be done to get
them up to speed. What we should all bear in mind is the fact that the
scale of the change required to make them work is absolutely immense,
which is why it was no surprise that the report found that things were
not happening, or that things were not working fully effectively
everywhere. It is an enormous change&#151;a change of culture and
practice in every way. So yes, it is a big step to put them on a
statutory basis, but actually that is good and it needs to be followed
up by much bigger steps to make them
work.</div><a name="09030572000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000408"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Is this that step? Is this not taking the flawed
current model and putting it on a statutory footing without actually
giving the practical measures, such as enforcing the pool budget? If
you want this to be a genuine agency that will change and create joint
commissioning, surely it needs the power to do that. The Audit
Commission said that people turn up from their organisations and they
are not empowered to bring budget with them, they are not empowered to
commit their organisations in any way and nothing in this piece of
legislation will change that. Is that not true? Does that not give you
some concern? The Audit Commission&#146;s current position is that
they are well-attended talking shops that are not delivering. They
could become even better attended and they would still be talking
shops. Should we support that? It sounds like a step on the road to
something that is in fact qualitatively different from what we are
going to
get.</div><a name="09030572000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> My last comments were about needing that
scale of change to follow it through. If it were down to me, the answer
would probably be yes. However, it is not down to me. We also recognise
that there are lots of sensitivities. You cannot take people to the end
game instantly. They need time to put things together and each area
will be different. I will probably have to live in a pragmatic world
where things are taken a stage at a time. Absolutely, drastic steps are
needed to make this work. Pooling budget resources is a way to do that.
In the commissioning, there is some kind of thread about third sector
involvement and the involvement of children and young people. If you
start to create large entities with lots of structure and jargon, the
third sector just gets further away because it does not understand that
world. That thread must be built in, in whatever way is necessary, so
that there is an effective route in which the third sector can live and
flourish.</div><a name="09030572000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare

that.</div><a name="09030572000185"></a>

Stuart:</b> You might not. You might say that it is going to
be so large, so bureaucratic and so dominated by the public sector that
it is going to squeeze you out and there is nothing that you can do. By
its very nature, it will be a creature with which the third sector
struggles to engage. The third sector might not be able to turn up to
all of the meetings and sub-committees that will be set
up.</div><a name="09030572000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare

would not have any influence at
all.</div><a name="09030572000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> I support colleagues in saying that we
should front-foot what they are about and make it clear that this is
about improved outcomes for children. There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>is an awful lot of evidence to suggest that unless you involve the third
sector, particularly in finding the hardest to reach, you will not be
able to deliver on your
outcomes.</div><a name="09030572000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000410"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> All of you have talked about the needs of
vulnerable young people and children. I have a question prompted by a
briefing that we received from the Alliance of Inclusive Education,
which refers to the access that disabled children will have to
apprenticeships and mainstream courses under the Bill. From your
experience of working with young people, will the needs of disabled
children in accessing education be met by the
Bill?</div><a name="09030572000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> Are we sufficiently reminded of the needs of
disabled children by the Bill? No, I do not think that we are. I
thought that you were going to go on to talk about Sure Start
children&#146;s centres. Children&#146;s centres went up very
quickly and they are insufficiently accessible for disabled children in
terms of the physical plant. More importantly, there are issues to do
with how inclusive they are of disabled children in how they are
expected to
work.</div><a name="09030572000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
short answer is no because reminding us of those needs does not run
through as a golden thread. Unfortunately, we still need to be reminded
collectively of the importance of ensuring that there is inclusivity
for disabled
children.</div><a name="09030572000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> That is absolutely right. We have to err
on the side of inclusion and still need to be reminded. The starting
point for access to services has been very low. We are only just
starting to look at catching up. Until we catch up, there should be
special accommodation in the Bill to ensure that this issue is looked
after. It does not have that yet. It needs to be looked at again from
that
viewpoint.</div><a name="09030572000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> At the risk of making a really obvious
point, that includes disabled parents under a broad definition of
disability. There is an issue with accessibility for disabled
parents.</div><a name="09030572000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000411"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Thank you. Perhaps that is something that needs
to be probed further. Sorry, did Clem want to come in on the last
question?</div><a name="09030572000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> Yes, I did. It is about the link with
adult services and how there is no mention of that in relation to the
children&#146;s trusts. If you are a disabled parent, issues such as
that and how they would dovetail need to be considered. You had another
question.</div>
<a name="09030572000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000412"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> I do. It draws on the requirement to record use
of force in any circumstances in schools, which was discussed this
morning. Schools already do it. I would like to hear, from a
parent&#146;s perspective, how important it is for schools to inform
parents when their children are involved in incidents in which force is
required.</div>
<a name="09030572000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> My response is personal. On the whole, all
parents want it. They would be concerned if they were not informed,
unless it was frivolous. I cannot conceive that they would not want to
know.</div>
<a name="09030572000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000413"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I have two questions for Action for Children and a
brief question for 4Children. Action for Children has called for more
flexible approaches to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>apprenticeships, and, particularly, alternative pathways into
apprenticeships. How far does the Bill go in helping that ambition and
what are your doubts about the National Apprenticeship Service
delivering that flexible model?</div>
<a name="09030572000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> The Bill could be more explicit. I am going
to sound like a broken record, but we would always like explicit
recognition of how difficult it is for the most vulnerable children and
young people to get a toehold. That opinion is based on our experience
of trying to get young people in. They almost always respond far better
to the kind of opportunities that we can offer if they are the right
opportunities and they are tailored. It needs to be explicit because,
in terms of the quantum, it is a relatively small proportion of young
people, and unless it is explicit and up front, it tends to get
lost&#151;not deliberately, but that is what happens with universal
versus targeted truths. What was your second
question?</div>
<a name="09030572000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000414"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The lack of an explicit commitment to the
flexibility you seek may be reinforced by a National Apprenticeship
Service that makes the system more rigid, by creating a standard or
ubiquitous model for delivering apprenticeships and pathways
into apprenticeships, which would be injurious to your
ambitions.</div>
<a name="09030572000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> I am old enough to remember youth training
way back in the late &#145;70s and early &#145;80s when we had A
and B schemes. The B schemes tended to be for the less able and more
challenging young people, and the As had the fast-tracked schemes that
were relatively straightforward for people to get into. The trouble
with the B schemes, and with anything that tries to enshrine As and Bs,
is that you lose the ability to think about what an individual young
person needs, what he or she is bringing and how you harness, then
release, that young person&#146;s
potential.</div><a name="09030572000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
our experience in turning around the most difficult and challenging
young people&#151;getting them proper employment, not just a Mickey
Mouse qualification, so that they follow the same sort of career
pathways as most other people&#151;shows that doing so is absolutely
based on how much time, effort and energy you put into the initial
assessment and initial understanding of where a particular young person
is and what attainment and achievement means to them. It may not be
GCSEs at all, it may be relatively straightforward and simple things
that, disproportionately, elevate that young person&#146;s ambitions.
That needs to be understood. The fragility, if you like, of that needs
to be understood. &#147;Fragility&#148; is the wrong
word&#151;apologies. The right word will probably come to me as I
leave the
room.</div><a name="09030572000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000415"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> So the eligibility threshold set at level 2 will be
problematic in that
regard?</div><a name="09030572000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> Yes.</div>
<a name="09030572000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000416"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Should the Bill not have paid more attention to
pre-apprenticeship training of the kind that you are referring to,
which would be sufficiently flexible and adaptable to suit different
kinds of
needs?</div><a name="09030572000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> Yes. I would agree with that.
&#147;Flexibility&#148; is a far better word to use than
&#147;fragility&#148;, which I used.</div>
<a name="09030572000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000417"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Yes. The question for 4Children&#151;which is
alliterative, but there we are&#151;is this. Given the Audit
Commission&#146;s findings about local authorities&#146; competence

<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>in terms of children&#146;s services, what are your concerns about
their taking more responsibility for schools and early years and,
simultaneously, for apprenticeships, further education colleges and
information, advice and guidance
services?</div><a name="09030572000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> I suppose that the starting point is to
say that I think that a common framework, which makes leadership and
responsibility clear, is a good one. I think that, yes, there are
concerns about abilities to deliver. A lot of those concerns are about
inefficient systems that are already in place and a lot of them are
about lack of co-ordination, and a lack of professional co-ordination
within that. If you are going to go to a brave new world that embodies
and embraces all these different services, there is absolutely no room
for manoeuvre in making all those systems work. You have to get a
simple system that is clear about accountability, delivery and
co-operation throughout, which goes back to my former point. That point
was that if you are going to go for children&#146;s trusts, you have
the scale of what you have to follow through. To make all of this work
is an immense task. This is not just tinkering; it is really an immense
change. It is a change for the better, I think, but one that requires
quite a dramatic response to make it work.</div>

63</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000418"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We heard from our witnesses this morning a
distinct lack of enthusiasm for a complaints service. I would just be
interested in hearing from all three of you as to whether or not you
think we needed a complaints service that is independent of schools and
Government.</div><a name="09030572000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> Is this for the parents&#146; complaints
about
schools?</div><a name="09030572000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030572000419"></a>Jim
Knight:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="09030572000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> I am disappointed that your witnesses this
morning were against this, because we are fully supportive of an
independent complaints authority, basically the local government
ombudsman, and of making it a point of entry for parents and as
accessible as possible. Again, we have some issues about clarity and
tightening up. I also have a concern about the time frame, which is 12
months from the incident. If you are going through a process of the
complaint going to the school, the governor and then to the complaints
authority, or LGO, I think that there would be many occasions when it
will not hit that 12-month
mark.</div><a name="09030572000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that you would have to recognise the expense of the enterprise.
Obviously you want to get information to parents in the most accessible
way, and to children, but you also might want to consider the need for
an advocate function. If you are introducing mediation and
reconciliation facilities too, they all cost.</div>
<a name="09030572000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">So it is an
aspiration that we certainly favour and it would be very useful in
easing parents&#146; concerns in many ways, particularly with a
graduated approach and the use of mediation. However, I just have some
anxiety as to whether you can implement it, because of its
cost.</div><a name="09030572000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have just one other thought on this subject. There is something about
the collection of the data and I would have thought that one of the
useful points of collection or analysis would be to establish what
complaints consist of, and not just establishing whether or not the
system is cost-effective.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div><a name="09030572000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000420"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Do you have an instinct about what sort of
complaints are most
likely?</div><a name="09030572000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> I do not, so it would be wrong of me to
say. That is not an area that we have worked in. It might be a future
piece of
work.</div><a name="09030572000218"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> My response would be that no complaints
process is a good thing. I can imagine that some would say that it
would not be, but they might be working within the system where it
might make things more difficult. It is part of a wider opening up of
schools and the education system to parents who often, as their
children go through school find themselves increasingly estranged from
the system. When you collect small children from a nursery you are told
what greens they had during the day, when they slept, what they laughed
at and every thing. That goes completely over the school time. When
children get to secondary school by year 10 or 11 there is little
communication for many. That is a shame. Children do not benefit as a
result.</div>
<a name="09030572000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is part
of wider system of communication with parents, be it e-mails, parent
meetings with teachers and the like. It is also important because it is
an overt and visible message that the education system needs to be
outward facing. It is there to serve children and parents. I know that
that is what most teachers, hand on heart, would say they are there
for. But sometimes the system takes over and it feels very difficult
for parents to get a way in. Turning it very overtly out in that way
gives a strong message that it has to be outward
facing.</div><a name="09030572000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000421"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Briefly, do you agree
Clare?</div><a name="09030572000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> I completely support that. I just raise the
point of making sure that there is clarity for children in local
authority care, who may have the complex relationship of a corporate
parent and could potentially have a complaint investigated by the body
about which they are complaining. There needs to be a way getting that
sorted.</div><a name="09030572000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000422"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I have one final supplementary for you all, which
is probably two questions in one. Do you think the local government
ombudsman is the right vehicle as the basis of a complaints service? Do
you think pupils should be able to complain as well as
parents?</div><a name="09030572000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> Yes. I have read other responses to the
consultation as well and there seems to be a general endorsement of the
LGO as an appropriate body. It is sufficiently independent. It is
certainly preferable, we thought, to the local authority doing it.
Clearly this is a step forward from expecting people to go to the
Secretary of State. It is a very good move. As with other aspects of
the Bill, there needs to be a bit more clarity about the systems that
you require a complainant to go through before getting there. That is
not specified. It is in other documentation, but it is not in the Bill.
Something would be useful
there.</div><a name="09030572000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000423"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> And
pupils?</div><a name="09030572000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> Yes, I think you have to have something
for pupils, but you need an awful lot of support for them and an
acceptance that you take out what is
frivolous.</div><a name="09030572000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> It has to be pupils, but you have to
manage what gets to what stage. You have to acknowledge that an awful
lot could be dealt with within a school 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>system. Again this is an overt way of putting that sort of emphasis into
the culture of the school. It has to be pupils within the wider system
as
well.</div><a name="09030572000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> I agree with the local government ombudsmen.
It is not sufficiently different or special. If we are doing what Anne
is describing, which is to make this as normal and accountable as
everything else, it makes complete sense. Why would you make a special
case? But we need the
sensitivity.</div><a name="09030572000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000424"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Two final quick questions: the first is for Clare
and Anne. Given that both your organisations run children&#146;s
centres, are you clear how the new inspection will work? The 4Children
briefing said that you would support it but that you were not happy
about duplication. How much involvement have you had and how much do
you know about the new inspection service?</div>
<a name="09030572000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> First, the basic principle is that it is
good. It needs to be high quality and that needs to be embraced. The
children&#146;s centre is a new entity so it does not fit neatly
within the inspection regimes that are in place, but there are
inspection regimes in place that are quite cumbersome and quite
detailed, particularly in early years and child care. I am not clear
how it would work. That is an area for clarity. We would not want to
see it duplicating others and just becoming a third or a fourth
inspection. Nor would we want to get to the stage where it replaced all
of those and diluted what was in, for instance, early years and child
care, where there is a very distinct and detailed inspection. We would
not want to see that replaced by a cover-all that does not put in the
same safeguards on quality. So, there is a lot there to work through.
Discussions are underway, but they are not very far advanced or
widespread to my knowledge. We need to ensure the highest quality
across the piece. That needs to be the
aim.</div><a name="09030572000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> I completely agree, and I suggest that it is
quite possible that Ofsted does not understand this properly. We have
not been terribly involved&#151;4Children has as far as I am
aware&#151;and so it would be good if Ofsted came to talk to us to
develop its understanding of exactly what a good children&#146;s
centre looks like and how it safeguards
that.</div><a name="09030572000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000425"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I have a quickie for Clem. One of the elephants in
the room today is health. None of us has really talked about health and
the problems that there are sometimes on the ground in involving health
in children&#146;s trust boards and children&#146;s centres. I
think that you have done some general work in that area. Could you, or
any of the other witnesses, help us to understand how we could get
health working more effectively as part of delivering for children and
families?</div><a name="09030572000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clem
Henricson:</b></i> On the ground, we have been strong
advocates for developing the health visitor service. That has
potential&#151;ensuring that it is represented in children&#146;s
centres rather than just health centres. Regarding the
children&#146;s trusts, we have certainly highlighted the
difficulties that have been experienced because they appear alienated
and are not being involved in the same way. We would advocate inclusion
of the mental health service on the children&#146;s trust board
because of the particular issues that arise for young people and mental
health services. I am afraid that placing an obligation on the health
service to be an active partner and to co-operate will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>probably help. Looking at some higher representation might give it a bit
of emphasis. You are taking from the local authority what would be the
commensurate level in the health service. The other reservation that I
have about the children&#146;s trusts is that there should be more
locally elected representation. It is fairly limited. Something to look
at might be how far you can get high up in the accountability structure
of the health
service.</div><a name="09030572000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000426"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Does anybody else have anything to add on health?
You both effectively work with health, do you
not?</div><a name="09030572000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anne
Longfield:</b></i> We do. A lot of the relationships that are
in place are there because of long developments and partnerships on the
ground&#151;operational rather than strategic partnerships. It is a
case of rocketing children and young people up the strategic health
agenda and ensuring that that is plumbed into the system at the
appropriate high level, that health promotion, public health and
children are also plumbed in, that the budgets for health follow, and
that the status and requirements of children and young people are
mirrored in the health strategy. Until that strategic emphasis and the
ability and requirement for budgets to follow are there, that remains
something that has to be reinvented 100 times on the ground. That would
be my step
forward.</div><a name="09030572000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Clare
Tickell:</b></i> We are teetering on the brink of a very deep
recession and the most important thing to remember is that early
intervention will be absolutely critical and key. It talks to health in
a way that some of the conversations thus far have not. I agree with
Anne that there is something about getting the language sufficiently
understood by both partners so that they can each see the relevance of
the other. That is about being clear about the outcomes that go behind
what we are seeking to do here and ensuring that people are signed up
to them. It then begins to fall into
place.</div><a name="09030572000236"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000430"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Clauses 79 to 91 will set up the Skills Funding
Agency and the National Apprenticeship Service. There have been
complaints from previous witnesses that the system is overly
bureaucratic. It was described on Tuesday as a &#147;bureaucratic
muddle&#148;. Today we have heard concerns from other union
representatives about the complexity and bureaucracy associated with
the Bill. What is your view on that? I do not mind who chips
in&#151;all or some of
you.</div><a name="09030572000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Strutton:</b></i> I am afraid that you have caught us on an
area that is not our expertise and which we have not prepared for. I do
not have an answer on that point. If you want a view, I am sure that we
could go away and consider it, but we do not know about that
area.</div><a name="09030572000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000431"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> All right. Let us move on. You will know that the
Bill focuses largely on education for 16 to 19-year-olds. Something
that your members are concerned about in the economic downturn is
retraining routes back into employment. The National Institute of Adult
Continuing Education has described this as a missed opportunity to
re-engage adults and provide entry points for retraining. How important
are training opportunities and reskilling in the downturn and what
provisions would you like to see to facilitate
that?</div><a name="09030572000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Christina
McAnea:</b></i> We are certainly very supportive of the
proposals on apprenticeships and provision for 16 to 19-year-olds. We
are happy that local government is being given a greater role in
co-ordinating the process. What we would like to see is tied up with
other provisions in the Bill, such as the right to train. We would like
a clearer right for people in employment to access training. Many
members of the unions represented here are those in local government
with the fewest formal qualifications. When you look at what happens
across employers&#151;it is the same in local government and in
schools&#151;only 1 per cent. of the money spent goes to those staff
who do not have a degree level qualification or equivalent. Almost all
the money is spent on staff who already have some formal qualification.
We would want a clearer right to train and a greater focus on how to
upskill people who are coming in or are not in the workforce at the
moment, with a level 2 or above
qualification.</div><a name="09030572000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> May I just come in on the schools
perspective? I apologise if I am not au fait with all the clauses in
the Bill. I came back from six weeks&#146; holiday at the weekend and
I have been trying to get my head round those clauses I particularly
want to focus on.</div>
<a name="09030572000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the
school perspective, we have welcomed the introduction of the new
vocational diploma as a means of encouraging participation in learning,
particularly learning focused on the next stage of employment or
training.</div>
<a name="09030572000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
whether there is anything on this point in the Bill&#151;it might be
inappropriate to mention and it is anecdotal&#151;but we often find
in school that not enough credence is given to those vocational
qualifications in terms of presenting data about
schools.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000432"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> That is an interesting additional point. I take
your point about training investment largely being focused on those who
are trained. There is a lot of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>empirical evidence to support that. Indeed, they are not only trained
but trained to high levels. It is often middle management and above who
get a good share of the resources.</div>
<a name="09030572000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
an immense number of new responsibilities for local authorities, such
as providing information, advice and guidance; networking with heads of
local authorities; new involvements with schools, further education
colleges, apprenticeships, younger children and early years. Are local
authorities well equipped to deal with those new responsibilities and
what implications do they have for the competencies of your members?
Are extra resources and skills needed? How skilled up, tooled up, is
local government to deal with
that?</div><a name="09030572000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Strutton:</b></i> From the wider local government
perspective, Mr. Allenson and I are joint secretaries of the
national joint council for local government. We have just come from a
Cabinet Office meeting between the trade unions and public sector
departments where the ability of public services&#151;local
government in particular&#151;to help the economy through the
recession was talked about in some depth. The capacity to cope with
that now as well as all the needs you are outlining is quite frankly
not there. Our members report back to us constantly. You will probably
have seen a report in the past couple of weeks from the Local
Government Association outlining what it saw as the problems it would
be facing. From a union member&#146;s point of view and the reports
that we get, bear in mind that we in local government have had on the
books since 2004 a national training agreement whereby every local
government employee should have had a personal development and training
plan. Virtually no local authorities have carried that out. The point
we are starting from with these initiatives is a long way back. Funding
in local government generally is extremely tight, as you know, so the
capacity to ramp up from an already low platform leaves us quite
concerned.</div><a name="09030572000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Allenson:</b></i> To add to that, it is well recognised that
local government has achieved significant efficiency savings over the
past few years. Indeed, that has trimmed away a considerable amount of
what might be called fat, and to be honest, it is now really difficult
to find the resource necessary to take on additional responsibilities
in the way you indicate. The difficulty is that sometimes it is one
initiative too far, in terms of being able to cover the new
responsibilities that might come their
way.</div><a name="09030572000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000433"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The Bill had its genesis before we reached the
current economic state, which is dynamic. What additional things have
we done in the Bill to deal with an appropriate response to the
economic circumstances of your members? We talked a little about
upskilling, reskilling and the re-engagement of people through work
force retraining, yet there is no entitlement to an adult
apprenticeship. Indeed, adult apprenticeship funding is rather less
generous than that provided for young people&#146;s apprenticeships.
What other things might the Bill do on your agendas to better fit us to
deal with the effects of the economic
downturn?</div><a name="09030572000256"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Christina
McAnea:</b></i> May I mention a particular point that is of
interest to my union? There are concerns about the early years
provision and the role of local authorities as the commissioning
agents, and the issue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>of commissioning runs through many of the Bill&#146;s proposals and is
a key point relating to what the strategic role of local authorities
will be. We are a bit concerned that the public sector provision of
some services, particularly children&#146;s and early years services,
produces better results and standards than is currently possible in the
private and voluntary sector, and there is hard evidence to support
that in Ofsted&#146;s own information. One of the things we are
concerned about is the impact some of the proposed changes will have on
the funding of early years provision, for example, because it will all
depend on the funding
formula.</div><a name="09030572000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Public
sector provision is usually more expensive than that provided by the
private and voluntary sector because the staff tend to be better
trained and slightly better paid. If the funding formula is to be cost
driven during an economic recession in which you will be saying,
&#147;We want you to go out there and get the cheapest possible
provision you can find.&#148;, our concern is that that will have a
downward push on standards because you will not be able to attract
people who are suitably trained and qualified for some of those
key roles.</div>
<a name="09030572000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
concerned that the thrust will be for local authorities to become
merely commissioning agents for most of the services, whether
apprenticeships or early years, and they will be seen as such. Even if
that is the case, surely there is an argument for saying that local
authorities, in their role as commissioners, ought to be building in
much tighter requirements for the companies and organisations that will
be willing to do that work. They should be saying, &#147;This is how
you will train your staff, and these are the minimum standards they
will have to meet.&#148;</div>
<a name="09030572000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further work
is needed on how that commissioning role will be used. Brian has
mentioned that we have just come from a meeting with public sector
departments, and one of the issues we discussed was how to use the
commissioning role to ensure that providers in the private and
voluntary sector are actually delivering on some of those key
objectives.</div><a name="09030572000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> May I add something to that from the school
perspective? Often individual schools in a locality can respond to
local issues very quickly because of their contacts. What sometimes
holds them up is unnecessary bureaucracy and a lack of funding. One
think I will put in front of you to carry forward is the proposal that,
if some of those things need to be expedited quickly, maybe some
thought should be given to how funding can be devolved to individual
schools or groups of
schools.</div><a name="09030572000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000434"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> It is obviously really nice to talk to you, and I
apologise for the limits on my knowledge of the matter. I will ask
questions on teaching assistants, but as a way of having a much wider
range, and I would be interested to hear about anything else that ties
in with those other jobs. I have long been concerned that teaching
assistants can be paid termly and that holiday pay is not covered, so I
would like to hear your comments on that situation. Do you think that a
new negotiating body will actually be able to tackle something like
that?</div><a name="09030572000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Strutton:</b></i> One of the key reasons that we have worked
so long to set up such a body is the so-called term-time pay formula,
which we have always regarded as an abuse of school support staff in
their employment. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>Under the formula, support staff have to be aligned with all other local
authority staff, so their pay is determined in relation to another
full-time equivalent employee, and, for the local authority,
&#147;full-time equivalent&#148; means working all year round.
Under that classification, school support staff are part time because
they only work term-time weeks, which means that their salary is
reduced pro rata, and, of course, as nearly all school
support staff are part time, it is further reduced pro
rata.</div><a name="09030572000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every
local authority does it differently, and many schools within
authorities do it differently again. We stopped counting when we got to
50 different ways of calculating school support staff pay, which is one
of the nonsenses that we have been trying to correct by setting up a
national body. We tried to correct it through the existing local
government negotiating machinery, but were unable to do so. One of the
raison d&#146;êtres for trying to separate school support
staff from the rest of local authority staff was so that their
particular terms and conditions could be addressed. That is one of the
key points for
us.</div><a name="09030572000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000435"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I have another point about teaching assistants.
There are obviously examples where teaching assistants are perhaps
given responsibilities for which they may not be qualified. I see being
asked to do something for which you have not been trained as a
protection aspect; looking after a whole class, for example. What sort
of protection against that can we look forward
to?</div><a name="09030572000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Christina
McAnea:</b></i> This is a key issue for us. We are hoping
that it will achieve national role profiles, which are not quite like
job descriptions, but will delineate between different levels of
responsibility and will have some sort of recommended pay spine
attached. One of our big problems at present centres on part of the
remodelling agreement in 2003 or 2004&#151;I forget when we signed
it. The agreement guaranteed teachers planning, preparation and
assessment time, so we have introduced things such as higher level
assistants and cover supervisors. The big problem is that there has
been such a large amount of flexibility that things are being run very
differently in different
schools.</div><a name="09030572000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should say that we have a paper to give you&#151;we are a bit
late&#151;but one of the things that we have raised as a trade union
is our concern about the reform agenda&#146;s sustainability in
schools. We have to get it right for support staff because, in our
view, they are critical not only to the delivery of the things that our
members do, but also to maintaining the things that teachers do and the
kind of reforms that they have seen. By and large, where teachers have
been given additional time, it is our members who have been
asking to take on
responsibilities.</div><a name="09030572000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have worked hard with the Training and Development Agency for Schools
to try to develop good training packages, so we now have, for example,
a higher level teaching assistant standard. One of our problems is that
loads of schools have just plucked bits of it and said, &#147;We are
going to employ you as a teaching assistant level 2, but for four hours
a week we are going to put you in charge of a whole class, for which
you might get an extra &#163;5 an hour.&#148; In some schools, they
are not even using higher level teaching assistants for that; they are
using teaching assistants who, in the head teacher&#146;s judgment,
are capable of doing it. That happens  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>predominantly in the primary rather than secondary sector, and is a huge
problem for us. We think that it will mean that the
sustainability of what has happened in schools&#151;the fact that
teachers have access to 10 per cent. PPA time&#151;will not go on for
ever.</div>
<a name="09030572000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
protections that we will get, we hope that, by having national role
profiles lent to a grading structure, all the employer organisations
will sign up as well through time, because we are doing this in
partnership with them. A much stronger message will go out to schools
to say that this is the way that you will employ and, crucially, deploy
your support staff. The reason why it is important that we get this
body set up is because that it would give us a mechanism to deliver
some sort of statutory enforcement to an extent, even if it is only of
core conditions of employment. That is what we need. To deliver
national consistency, we need some sort of national statutory body, a
bit like the teachers&#146; pay and conditions document, so that head
teachers can lift the book off the shelf, open it and say,
&#147;Alright, if I want someone to do this job, this is the job
description and this is what I pay them&#148;.</div>
<a name="09030572000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> I cannot wholeheartedly support everything
that Christina has said; she would be falling off her chair if I could.
I would like to assure you, Annette, that the work that teaching
assistants do in schools is very much appreciated. Their numbers are
increasing, because of the very good work that they do.</div>
<a name="09030572000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
for the inconsistency, if you want to use that word, of their
deployment between schools is because schools are individual
institutions. They have their own individual response to their
circumstances. They have their own priorities, strategies and strategic
direction. The way that they deploy their staff, particularly their
support staff, underlines and underpins their priorities and strategic
direction. That is the reason for some of the inconsistency in the jobs
that people do and the names that those jobs are given.</div>
<a name="09030572000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we look at
the question that Christina raised directly, of the HLTA status, if you
like, we have a difficulty here with the concept that somebody is paid
according to their status or qualification, no matter what sort of job
they are doing and whether or not the job requires those skills. I will
just give you one example. It is not uncommon now for teachers, as they
get towards the end of their career, to downsize and to come back to do
part-time work, perhaps coming back into school and taking a support
staff role of some sort. Following the logic through, they should be
paid at the rate that they are paid as a teacher, rather than the rate
that should be paid for the job that they are doing as a teaching
assistant.</div>
<a name="09030572000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there is a
sort of conundrum there, really. I am just putting the opposite case,
if you like. What we agree on is that there needs to be some framework
for schools to use when it comes to the employment terms and conditions
of their support staff.</div>
<a name="09030572000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000436"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I certainly take this initial opportunity to pay
tribute to the really good work that support staff are doing in freeing
teachers to teach and in developing new professionalism and new skills
in the school work force.</div>
<a name="09030572000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within the
current arrangements through the NJC, you pointed out some of the
weaknesses and the issues  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>about consistency. Currently, how is national consistency reconciled
with local flexibility and how should it be reconciled, with a new
body?</div>
<a name="09030572000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> I suppose that currently it is reconciled
because the support staff in community and voluntary aided schools are
subject to the NJC. The flexibility comes in with the local flexibility
that is offered to foundation and VA schools by virtue of the governing
body being the
employer.</div><a name="09030572000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000437"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> And how should it be
reconciled?</div><a name="09030572000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> We would like to see the possibility for
employer-level flexibility as one of the outcomes of the discussions
that we are having and the framework that we are now trying to set
up.</div>
<a name="09030572000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Strutton:</b></i> We would argue that currently national
consistency and local flexibility are not reconciled and that that is
precisely the reason why, for the past four years, we have been, with
FASNA&#146;s assistance and local government employers, jointly
working through the proposal to establish a nationally consistent
framework that can be applied flexibly at local level. It is because
the current system is broke that we need to fix it. What should be done
is exactly what we are trying to do, which is establish a national body
that can give effect to nationally consistent pay and conditions
arrangements that can be applied in all schools. Our job is to ensure
that the application of that still leaves room for flexibility at local
level, which I hope would satisfy Joan&#146;s point on the
matter.</div><a name="09030572000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a fine line to tread and a difficult balance to strike between how
proscriptive to be nationally and what has happened with school support
staff, which is that they have grown in terms of responsibilities and
numbers because they can be deployed flexibly. It is not in our
interest to get in the way of flexible deployment, but, once deployed,
we want to see them treated fairly and consistently across the country.
That is the happy medium that we want to
strike.</div>
<a name="09030572000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
80</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000438"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> David, would you like to comment?</div>
<a name="09030572000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Algie:</b></i> I agree, I think that it is important that we
have a national framework for school support staff. I understand that
it is difficult to achieve national consistency and local flexibility,
but we should pursue it. The negotiating body, if constructed in the
right way, can do that.</div>
<a name="09030572000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000439"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Clearly, looking at the two papers, we are getting
on reasonably well and there is a lot of similarity, but there might be
some negotiating left to do. Recognition was raised in the final
paragraph of the memorandum from the three trade unions. Would it be
acceptable to the unions for the specifics of recognition to be dealt
with in secondary legislation, assuming that it was quickly implemented
alongside the necessary clauses in the Bill?</div>
<a name="09030572000283"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Strutton:</b></i> Yes. Other colleagues will disagree, but we
are all of one mind about this: it would be a satisfactory route. We
would have preferred recognition to be enshrined in primary
legislation, but we understand the reasons why it is not possible. We
would be content for our recognition to be tied up in secondary
legislation, but we have been at this point for several weeks now.
We  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>saw this issue coming many months ago. When the Bill was published, our
immediate reaction was how is trade union recognition going to be dealt
with. We are still at the point where we know the route for resolving
the issue&#151;secondary legislation&#151;but we are not at the
point of doing it. Our dilemma is that the Bill is going through
Parliament and will arrive with statutory force later this year, if it
is all plain sailing, so where does that leave our recognition? It
would be unprofessional of us simply to rely on assurances and trust,
however high our trust is in you, Jim, and your
team.</div><a name="09030572000284"></a>

Strutton:</b></i> What has been explained to us as the
process that lies behind clause 215 is that the Secretary of State
cannot give ratified orders on anything that he has not referred to the
body in a formal letter. Unions and employers have found it hard to
reconcile that with our understanding of how negotiations
work.</div><a name="09030572000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
you can see, we are all long-in-the-tooth negotiators, ladies excepted,
and we know the way in which negotiating bodies have to operate. Things
happen very quickly. The ability to strike a deal while parties are
ready is crucial. The idea that having reached the point of agreement,
we have to seek permission from the Government machine to strike the
deal seems to us to be a barrier to the proper operation of a
negotiating body. Given that the negotiating body has the Department
sitting in as observers and that it has an independent chair who is a
conduit to Ministers, we fail to understand why in addition we must
seek permission to reach agreements. The independent chair and the
Department are in the room to ensure that we are told if we are doing
anything inappropriate. Therefore the requirement to seek permission in
clause 215(3) should simply be
deleted.</div><a name="09030572000295"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Allenson:</b></i> May I add to that the concern about having
to refer to the Secretary of State before something is referred to the
School Support Staff Negotiating Body? As democratic organisations, we
have to consult members. One way in which we do that to start with is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>to bring a claim together in a normal negotiating situation. As Brian
has indicated, we try to get our understanding clear from the start on
how we can do that. Unless we have a mandate from our members, we are
not able to operate in the normal way. That is important to us. The
question of recognition is also an emotive subject for us. Both are
things that our lay representatives will have to be consulted about in
a detailed way shortly. We will be looking out to see if the right
things happen at the right
times.</div><a name="09030572000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Seabeck:</b> You talk about the mismatch between support
staff, teaching assistants and local authority staff and about how that
has changed. Having been a member of support staff when my children
were small, I understand what you are saying. There are also issues
about equal pay. There seem to be no direct comparators for teaching
assistants and support staff to enable pay levels to be properly
assessed. You may correct me if I am wrong. Do you see this negotiating
body as a mechanism that will ensure that there are equal pay rights?
That will have cost implications for
employers.</div><a name="09030572000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Christina
McAnea:</b></i> We certainly see it as a way of delivering
equal pay for the future. This continues to be a live issue. We would
like to have some sort of job evaluation scheme, or a method to analyse
what jobs are worth, with which we and employers feel comfortable. It
should be written and developed specifically for schools, or at least
take schools into consideration. There has not always been success in
using the local government structures to deliver and analyse jobs in
schools because they can be quite different. The context is different.
The working hours and the working year are different. It has been quite
difficult to do that.</div>
<a name="09030572000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
comparators. At the moment, if you are in a community school there is
nothing to stop people taking an equal pay claim across to someone who
works in the local authority, particularly if you have been evaluated
under the same job evaluation scheme. There is an issue about whether
that will continue to be the case. We will probably need to get some
updated legal advice, given that the situation in equal pay changes
weekly, if not daily, about what happens once the body is up and
running and staff in schools are then paid from a different source and
there is a different set of negotiations. What would be the impact on
their ability to take equal pay claims
then?</div><a name="09030572000299"></a>

Strutton:</b></i> Just to make one thing clear. Currently,
school support staff do have comparators. Between our three unions we
are running about 70,000 equal pay claims in local government. A lot of
those are school support staff. All school support staff have the
opportunity to raise those issues with us. Half of local authorities
have implemented equal pay structures now and the rest have got plans
to do so. As Christina rightly said, part of what we are doing is
designed to resolve those types of issues. It will do so by building a
bespoke system for school support
staff.</div><a name="09030572000301"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> Currently, for foundation and VA schools,
where the governing body is the employer, the equal pay issue is just
across the individual school. You cannot have comparators from outside
a foundation or a VA school.</div>

85</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000446"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Thank you for clarifying that. The reason I am
asking is that we have a potential equalities Bill coming through. We
are getting slightly different advice on this issue from people
lobbying on that. We talked about national and local differences and
the need for local flexibility. What are the local issues that would in
your view require the scheme to be varied? Can you identify examples of
things that would be so local that they would require the scheme to
change?</div><a name="09030572000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian

86</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000447"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Mrs. Binder said that she thought
there needed to be flexibility in order to adapt for local differences.
I just wondered whether anyone could identify what they might be. Can
anyone give us an
example?</div><a name="09030572000305"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian

some.</div><a name="09030572000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> There can be a range. Are we talking about
pay? Are we talking about terms and conditions?
</div><a name="09030572000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
87</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000448"></a>Alison

meant.</div><a name="09030572000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> I was fairly broad because within the support
staff working group we have used the word &#147;flexibility&#148;
without going into any particular definition of what our individual
understanding of that is. If we are looking at what might be up to a
school or a local authority to determine, there may be elements of
something like sick pay where there would be a common basis&#151;am I
talking totally off the top of my head here Brian? He is going to drop
me in it later.I do not have a professional background in this. In
terms of deciding things at local level, it is more to do with
responding.</div>

88</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000449"></a>Alison

the
school?</div><a name="09030572000310"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> I mean the local employer. For me, local
means employer, whether it is the school or the local authority. That
for me is the &#147;local&#148; in the &#147;local level&#148;.
The question about the flexibility that you might need has just gone
out of my head. There might be issues such as how much you pay your
cleaners. The going rate, depending on the area, might be x. However,
the framework that we are setting out might suggest that you pay your
cleaners within a range that x does not fall into. The school would
need flexibility to be able to say, &#147;In order to attract and
keep cleaners, we have got to match that
level.&#148;</div><a name="09030572000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Brian
Strutton:</b></i> Christina will come back at you on that
one,
Joan.</div><a name="09030572000312"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Christina
McAnea:</b></i> We feel that flexibility can be built into
it. We might say to schools that we do not envisage a situation where
they will be told, &#147;This is exactly what your structure will
be.&#148; Schools will be able to determine what their staffing
structure is, what level of staff they want and what jobs they want the
staff to do. That can all be determined at school level. All that we
are saying is that once you have done that, here are national
frameworks that will help you to decide: these are the levels of
responsibility; this is the level of work I want them to do; this is
what the pay range should be and it will be a range of pay. Issues such
as the ability to recruit and retain staff in an area where you have to
pay more can all be built into it. We have done that in other sectors.
In the higher education sector we have a specific framework agreement
that has recruitment and retention built into it. All of that is
entirely possible and we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>believe that it still leaves sufficient flexibility for schools to be
able to have whatever staffing structure they want and whatever level
of staff they want.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000450"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I would like to briefly pick up on that last point.
This is a question for Joan Binder. Leaving aside the issue of pay, is
there anything in these provisions about the School Support Staff
Negotiating Body that prevents you from doing what you want to do in a
foundation school? Are there issues there that make it inflexible in
terms of the job itself, rather than the
pay?</div><a name="09030572000314"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> It is very difficult to give a definite
answer at this stage, because we are still in the early stages of
trying to describe what is going to be in the eventual framework.
Provided that we are still talking about flexibility and, using
Christina and Brian&#146;s analogy, that we are still envisaging that
flexibility being built into the framework, then I am hopeful that it
will be possible for schools to be able to do what they are doing now
in terms of employment and deploying their support
staff.</div><a name="09030572000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
90</b><b class="B"><a name="09030572000451"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> How might it not work? Can you give an example of
how it could be inflexible in terms of the job description or
employment?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div><a name="09030572000316"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Binder:</b></i> It could be inflexible if the job description
for, say, a site manager was fixed, and if schools did not have a site
manager who did exactly that, then they would have to find one who
could do that, if you see what I mean. I do not think that any of us
want that. We all want something whereby a school&#151;because the
term &#147;site manager&#148; can cover a whole range of jobs in
different schools&#151;would be able to say, &#147;Oh yes, my site
manager does this bit, this bit and this bit. Therefore, that is his
job description and contract and therefore that equates to this pay
range.&#148; A bigger school might say, &#147;My site manager does
all of those and a few extra bits from here. This is his contract and
his pay range is therefore something else.&#148; That is a
description of what we are trying to aim at. If we can produce that
then I am hopeful that, provided there is employer-level flexibility,
schools can
manage.</div><a name="09030572000317"></a>
