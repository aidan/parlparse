the Committee, Mr. O&#146;Hara, I warmly welcome you and your

co-Chairmen, Sir John andMr. Benton. You are all experienced

and knowledgeable, and I am sure that you will keep us in order. We

look forward to your expertise and are confident that our deliberations

will be both thorough and relevant. I extend a warm welcome to the hon.

Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) who will lead for the

Opposition in Committee and to the members of her team, the hon.

Members for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) and for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), and

those who support

them.</div><a name="06050978000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome Mr.

Cranmer, the Clerk to the Committee. I am pleased that we shall benefit

again from his significant experience of Finance Bills. I also welcome

the <i class="I">Hansard </i>staff, as I do the hon. Member for Falmouth and

Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) and her Liberal Democrat colleagues. I am

pleased to see the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie). He has

been assiduous on the Floor of the House. No doubt he will welcome his

happy and long stint in Committee, but perhaps he can tell me about

that at the end of our

proceedings.</div><a name="06050978000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be

supported in Committee by the Financial Secretary and the newly

appointed Economic Secretary, who is truly looking forward to being

here every Tuesday and Thursday&#151;morning and afternoon. That will

come as news to him. Given that my hon. Friends will follow our

proceedings in great detail, I hope that they will not be disappointed.

The good news is that we have only one Finance Bill this year, not

two&#151;or three Bills, as we had last year. I look forward to our

debates in the coming weeks. I hope that we can conduct ourselves in an

appropriate manner, being pressing in debate, but always remaining

civil. We shall need to behave in such a way to get through the

proceedings and for the sake of our sanity.</div>

and to your co-Chairmen. My team and I also look forward to working

with you, as we do with the right hon. Lady and her team in the

constructive and co-operative manner that she has just mentioned.

Obviously, we shall make it clear when we disagree with the Government

on certain points, but we hope in many instances to table amendments

that go more towards ascertaining the meaning of the Bill and teasing

out uncertainties, rather than necessarily pushing for a Division and a

change in the published

Bill.</div><a name="06050978000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also echo the

Paymaster General&#146;s welcome to the hon. Members for Falmouth and

Camborne and for Dundee, East. I particularly welcome Back Benchers. It

is not always considered to be a great privilege to discuss the Finance

Bill in Committee, but although it may prove to be a fairly long and

gruelling experience, we are well aware of the importance of the task

ahead of us. Indeed, as my hon. Friend Member for Rayleigh said a few

weeks ago, in the past there has almost been an outbreak of Stockholm

syndrome in the Committee as matters become a little eccentric after

several weeks discussing the details of United Kingdom financial

legislation. With those words, I welcome the sittings

Member for Falmouth and Camborne has written to you, apologising for

not being able to be here this morning due to a prior speaking

engagement that she could not get out

of.</div><a name="06050978000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is many years

since I had the great pleasure of sitting on the Finance Bill Committee

and, from my memories, I was not certain that I wanted to renew that

experience immediately. However, I look forward to working with

the Government some of the important issues that will affect hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000379"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Before we proceed, I have several announcements

to make. The Ways and Means and money resolutions agreed by the House

and on which the Bill is founded are available in the Room. There has,

apparently, been a software bug, which means that the contents pages of

the Bill as printed are slightly inaccurate. If hon. Members have an

inaccurate version, they may obtain new contents pages, printed

separately on green paper, which are available in the

Room.</div><a name="06050978000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In view of the

resolutions of the House relating to the declaration of interests,

right hon. and hon. Members are required to declare relevant interests

when they table amendments as well as when they speak to them. Copies

of the relevant rules are available from the

Clerk.</div><a name="06050978000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, as usual

with the Finance Bill, because of the quantity of paperwork, boxes are

available to store papers between sittings. Hon. Members who make use 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div>of that facility should note that the filing cabinet containing the

boxes will be locked when the Committee is not

sitting.</div><a name="06050978000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Vote

Office would be very grateful if we could try not to mislay copies of

the Budget documents, for the obvious reason that supplies are short

and, if we keep losing them, it may be embarrassed in finding

replacements.</div><a name="06050978000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

should, as usual, like to draw attention to the fact that adequate

notice must be given of amendments. Neither my co-Chairmen nor I will,

as a rule, call any standard amendments, including any starred

amendments that may be reached during an afternoon

sitting.</div><a name="06050978000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000381"></a>The

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> I

welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara. It is a pleasure to serve

under your chairmanship again. In my experience you Chair proceedings

with a firm and fair hand and I know that you will continue to do so. I

am grateful to you for the guidance that you have given us on the

grouping of new clauses to be discussed as part of the clause stand

part debate.</div><a name="06050978000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

mention my views on the new clauses later, but first let me deal with

clause 1, which increases the rate of duty on cigarettes, cigars,

hand-rolling tobacco and other smoking and chewing tobacco products. It

does so in line with inflation, therefore increasing the typical price

of cigarettes by 9p, including VAT, and did so with effect from 6 pm on

Budget day, 22 March

2006.</div><a name="06050978000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee is

aware that smoking kills more than 100,000 people in this country each

year. It is the greatest cause of preventable illness and premature

death in this country. So the duty increase, in line with inflation,

will help to maintain the real price of tobacco, the contribution to

Government revenues and the price support&#151;a level of pricing

that encourages people to smoke less or to quit, and discourages

children or young people from taking up the habit in the first

place.</div><a name="06050978000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Duty rates form

an important part of our strategy to drive down the level of smoking in

this country and of our target to reduce the prevalence or level of

smoking to 21 per cent. by 2010. Those measures run alongside important

provisions that we are making through the NHS to support those who want

to quit and also the public places smoking ban due to come into effect

in the summer of next year. So the duty increase continues a

well-established policy&#151;a twin track of maintaining the high

real price of cigarettes while clamping down hard on the unregulated

supply of cheap smuggled tobacco. That will help to reduce smoking, and

lower the financial, social, personal and health costs associated with

it.</div><a name="06050978000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the new

clauses, I welcome the interest of the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr.

Goodman) in evidence-based tax policy decisions. I say to him and his

colleagues on the Opposition Front Bench, we publish more information

relevant to their new clauses than they might realise. In fact, we

might publish more than they care to read. In relation to new clause 1

on tobacco, I gathered up on my way here a selection&#151;not an

exhaustive list&#151;of the documents that we have published in the

last 18 months.</div>

<a name="06050978000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;The Demand for Tobacco

Products in the UK&#148;, published in December 2004, is a detailed

model for the elasticities of tobacco demand. The pre-Budget report

2004 included an update on our strategic approach to measuring and

tackling indirect tax losses, including from tobacco, and in late 2004

we published an analysis of, and plans to deal with, counterfeit

cigarettes. I have brought also a copy of a quarterly 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div>publication that includes a tobacco fact sheet&#151;hon. Members might

or might not be aware of it&#151;with data on tobacco clearances and

duty, and on the state of the market. As I said, it is a quarterly

publication and the hon. Gentleman might care to pick up the next one,

which is out later this

month.</div><a name="06050978000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In December

2005, as part of last year&#146;s pre-Budget report, we published an

analysis of indirect tax losses which took into account the impact of

duty. This year we have published a detailed fresh analysis of how we

will reinforce our strategies for tackling tobacco fraud and smuggling.

Furthermore, of course, there are the Budget notices&#151;once again

I have brought only one copy with me&#151;published alongside the

Budget, which are legally binding, and which we attempted to write in

plain English, setting out the changes announced in each Budget, how

they impact, and on

whom.</div><a name="06050978000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We make a

considerable effort to assess the impact of tax regimes on specific

industries and the wider economy. We meet regularly with and take into

account the views of organisations with special interests. We

frequently reassess the general design or specific aspects of the

operation of areas of the tax system, and when we do so we run a

public, open consultation

process.</div>

<a name="06050978000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In each year&#146;s

pre-Budget report and Budget, we give updates on tax and wider policy,

and each year we publish a pre-Budget report for the excise

regimes&#151;an analysis of the tax gap, the losses and the impact of

the rates. Ours was the first finance Ministry to make such a

systematic analysis of the operation of the tax system and the first to

put in place comprehensive strategies for reducing the tax gap, and I

believe that we are still the only Government to do so. In those

circumstances, when we come to decide on whether the proposed new

clauses should become part of the Bill, I hope that hon. Members of all

parties will bear in mind the quantity and the quality of what we

already produce.</div>

Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): It is a pleasure to see you

in the Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara. Unlike the Financial Secretary, I have

not had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship before.

Although I am sure that, in the course of these proceedings, the

Financial Secretary and I will not agree on everything, he was right to

pay tribute to your chairmanship, and I look forward to your guiding us

in our transition through today&#146;s clauses in a dignified,

orderly and efficient manner.</div>

<a name="06050978000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause that we are

considering invites us to approve the tax rise proposed in the

Chancellor&#146;s Budget. As the hon. Gentleman said, new clause 1

would have the effect of compelling the Chancellor to publish a review

in relation to the effectiveness of tobacco duties. You, Mr.

O&#146;Hara, will be pleased to know that I do not intend to discuss

the proposed review in detail, and the hon. Gentleman will be pleased

to hear that too. I want to refer to what he said about the quantity

and quality of the information already published by the Treasury; he

was right to draw attention to that. The proposed new clause seeks to

draw an assessment from him of how all those 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div>documents come together in terms of the effectiveness of the

Government&#146;s strategy with regard to the duty.</div>

<a name="06050978000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to explore the

effectiveness of that strategy in some detail. Any tax needs to be

effective; it must achieve its aims. The Financial Secretary made it

clear that the aim is to discourage smoking. That is an aim that we

share. However, he did not mention the other aim of the clause, which

is to raise revenue for the

Exchequer&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> He did. I

apologise to him. We are covered so far as aims go.</div>

<a name="06050978000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial Secretary will be

mindful of that great law in relation to taxation and many other

matters, the law of unintended consequences, as well as of the effect

that raising a tax beyond a certain point might have on expected

consequences, namely that it might not discourage the behaviour that it

seeks to discourage. If raised beyond a certain point, it might raise

less revenue than it would if it were not increased or if it were

decreased. Raising it beyond a certain point could cause such

unexpected consequences as evasion, in this case tobacco smuggling,

which we shall discuss in more detail when we debate clause

2.</div><a name="06050978000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,

according to the Tobacco Manufacturers Association&#151;which would

like duties to be frozen, not unusually&#151;smuggling increased

between 2002 and 2004, the last few years for which the organisation

has figures, resulting in a rise in revenue loss

from&#163;2.6 billion to &#163;2.9 billion. The Minister

will doubtless point this out when he replies, so I shall point it out

for him: it is true that the cross-border element has fallen from

&#163;1.4 billion to &#163;1.3 billion. However, when both figures

are added together, the result is a rise from&#163;4

billion to &#163;4.2 billion. The Tobacco Manufacturers Association

suggests that those developments threaten the Government&#146;s

smuggling targets. I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to

that point

too.</div><a name="06050978000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to a

Gallaher monthly pack swap survey, the consumption of counterfeits has

risen slightly, from 2.4 per cent. to 2.8 per cent. of total

consumption. It is worth standing back from the figures for a moment

and looking at them in context. According to the TMA, cigarette prices

in the UK are already the highest in Europe, and the UK&#146;s excise

duty burden is the highest in the EU. The rising number of freight

movements and visits within the EU, good things in themselves,

naturally increases opportunities for smuggling. There has also been a

significant rise in UK consumption of hand-rolling

tobacco.</div><a name="06050978000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050978000383"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): My hon. Friend makes a

good point about the influence of duty increases on smuggling, but I

should be most interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to the

point made earlier about the analysis of elasticity. What is the

Government&#146;s analysis of the effect on reducing smoking of each

1p increase in duty? It would be extremely interesting to hear

that.</div>

<a name="06050978000049"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000384"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> My hon. Friend has conveyed his request to the

Financial Secretary through me, so I shall not repeat it. We look

forward to hearing the

answer.</div><a name="06050978000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

return to hand-rolling tobacco consumption. In 1995, &#163;5.1

billion-worth of hand-rolling tobacco was 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 9</div>consumed. Last year, &#163;10.8 billion-worth was consumed. The amount

of non-UK-produced hand-rolling tobacco in particular has increased

every year since 1995.</div>

<a name="06050978000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister works on

enforcement with the Tobacco Alliance, which represents some 17,000

independent UK retailers. I know that he sees the alliance regularly,

and I am sure that he will join me in paying tribute to its work. The

Tobacco Alliance is seriously concerned about the effect of smuggling

on small shopkeepers&#146; livelihoods and on public health, given

smugglers&#146; greater propensity to sell tobacco, particularly

counterfeit tobacco, to children.</div>

<a name="06050978000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last August, 83 per cent. of

retailers surveyed by the alliance reported that smuggling had

decreased their sales, 27 per cent. had cut staff&#151;those are the

two most serious figures&#151;and 21 per cent. said that they were

considering closing. Some 71 per cent. were aware of tobacco smuggling

in their area, 35 per cent. were aware of counterfeit tobacco smuggling

and 20 per cent. knew of smugglers who supplied underage smokers. A

total of 90 per cent. thought that the Government were not doing enough

to help retailers affected by smuggling&#151;I suppose that when

surveyed people always tend to think that the Government are not doing

enough, but there it is&#151;while 74 per cent. thought, perhaps

unsurprisingly, that the Government should reduce or freeze

taxes.</div><a name="06050978000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday, I

received a letter from Ken Patel, a Leicester retailer and the chair of

Retailers Against Smuggling, the campaigning arm of the Tobacco

Alliance. The Financial Secretary will know him. What he wrote is

important:</div>

<a name="06050978000054"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Tobacco sales account

for a large proportion of our footfall and when a customer comes in to

buy their cigarettes, the chances are they will pick up something else,

like a pint of milk or a newspaper at the same time. We shopkeepers are

therefore losing out twice. We simply cannot compete with the smugglers

who can undercut our prices by

half.</div><a name="06050978000055"></a><div class="hs_brev">Let me put to

you a hypothetical situation: say I was the European head of a

smuggling organisation who had to report in to my boss, the worldwide

head of a smuggling organisation who wants profits and wants them fast.

Where am I going to focus on to get the most profits as quickly as

possible? Clearly the solution would be to focus on the country where I

can undercut shop prices but still make the most profit&#151;the

place with the highest tobacco levels in the EU&#151;the United

Kingdom.</div><a name="06050978000056"></a><div class="hs_brev">On top of

that, the best thing about the

situation&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06050978000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">he is

writing from the vantage of the imagined head of a smuggling

organisation&#151;</div><a name="06050978000058"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is

that the Government in Britain is going to help me out, by increasing

tax every year and encouraging more people who smoke to buy their

cigarettes from my street-sellers.</div>

<a name="06050978000059"></a><div class="hs_brev">Let&#146;s take another

hypothetical situation: that I smoke 20 cigarettes a day. I enjoy it

and it is part of my life. I am not going to stop just because my pack

has gone up over the &#163;5 threshold. It could go up over the

&#163;6 threshold and it would not make me stop smoking. It

wouldn&#146;t matter that much because I know that if the cost of a

pack of legitimate goes over a price barrier I might have

subconsciously set, then I can go and get some smuggled from the street

corner. It&#146;s going to be quite a while before the cost of a pack

of smuggled reaches that subconscious level I have set for a legitimate

pack.&#148;</div><a name="06050978000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will

not read the rest of Mr Patel&#146;s remarks nor will I explore, in

the manner of the Hutton inquiry, subconscious motives. However, I

wanted to draw the letter to the attention of the Committee because it 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>represents the views of 17,000 retailers and Mr Patel makes some

important points.</div> <a name="06050978000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

is worth standing back from those figures for a few moments to consider

which organisations are making profits from tobacco smuggling.

Ministers do not know and cannot be expected to know all the

organisations involved, but they do know, as the rest of us do, the

names of some of the organisations. When we refer to smuggling gangs,

it can be assumed that they are ordinary criminal gangs. However, they

do include the Provisional IRA and loyalist paramilitary groups, which

is plainly a serious matter.</div>

<a name="06050978000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two months ago, Radio

4&#146;s &#147;File on 4&#148; programme reported that the IRA is

linked up with other criminal gangs and is behind the smuggling of

millions of pounds of contraband across the North sea. It is perhaps

significant that cigarettes were among the items seized when premises

of the IRA&#146;s reputed chief of staff, Thomas &#147;Slab&#148;

Murphy, were sealed off in March, after an operation by customs

officers, detectives and soldiers from both sides of the

border.</div><a name="06050978000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050978000385"></a><b class="B">Rob

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000394"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b><b class="B"> </b>If I deal with that point in detail, I am

concerned that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob

Marris) will accuse me of delving into clause 2. However, the hon.

Gentleman is right; the Financial Secretary has reported progress in

that field, and I am delighted, as I said earlier, that customs

officers from both sides of the border were involved in the recent raid

on the farm of Mr. Thomas &#147;Slab&#148; Murphy.</div>

<a name="06050978000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stepping away from the issue of

smuggling and the perils of becoming entangled in clause 2, we, like

the Government, believe that it is right in principle to use the tax

system to discourage smoking. It is also reasonable, in principle, to

use taxes on tobacco to raise revenue. We also note that the

consumption of tobacco continues to decline, albeit slowly, and that

the Treasury has brought down revenue losses from

smuggling.</div>

<a name="06050978000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050978000395"></a><b class="B">Stephen

Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): Given that the Financial

Secretary indicated that the rise is in line with inflation, I am not

clear what point the hon. Gentleman is making. If there is some

elasticity and the rise is the result of inflation, what other increase

would he make? Would it be less than

inflation?</div>

<a name="06050978000075"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000396"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> I do not know what rise, freeze or reduction my

hon. Friend the Member for Tatton(Mr. Osborne) will propose

when he introduces his first Budget in 2009, but I hope that the hon.

Gentleman will recognise that there is a relationship between the level

at which a duty is set and smuggling. If the Government were not

concerned about smuggling or about the level of the increase, we would

hear the first noises in Committee from the Economic Secretary to the

Treasury, whom I congratulate on his promotion. I am glad that his hon.

Friends are as enthusiastic about the issue as I am; doubtless he is,

too.</div>

<a name="06050978000076"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000397"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> Is not one of my hon. Friend&#146;s key points

the fact that our tobacco price is among the highest in the European

Union? That high price is driving the smuggling industry and putting

many shopkeepers out of business.</div>

<a name="06050978000077"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000398"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> My hon. Friend is right. We are considering the

relationship between the high price, smuggling and counterfeit goods.

That is the best answer that I can give to the hon. Member for Wirral,

West (Stephen Hesford).</div>

<a name="06050978000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the Government Back

Benchers became so enthusiastic, I was moving on to make a point in the

Government&#146;s favour. Although losses from smuggling rose last

year, they fell to &#163;4 billion in 2002-03&#151;from &#163;4.2

billion in the previous year and &#163;4.3 billion in the year before

that. It is at least possible to believe that HMRC will begin to reduce

the figure in future years. For that reason, while we want to hear what

the Financial Secretary says, we have no plans to oppose the tax rises

in line with inflation that are proposed in clause 1. However, we would

like him to address the questions about the rate of duty, and to tell

us whether he accepts that there is a point beyond which, if the

tobacco duty were raised, revenues would fall and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div>smuggling would increase. Given the high prices and duty levels to which

my hon. Friend referred, we would like the Financial Secretary to give

us an indication as to the Treasury&#146;s thinking about how close

we are to that

point.</div><a name="06050978000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050978000399"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I, too, would like to express

my enthusiasm about serving on this Committee under your chairmanship,

Mr. O&#146;Hara, and that of Sir John Butterfill.</div>

<a name="06050978000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I declare that I have a

prejudicial interest that is not shown in the Register of

Members&#146; Interests. I am a fervent and passionate anti-smoker.

If that colours my remarks on the clause, I am sure that Committee

members will at least understand. I am curious about the increases in

the rates of duty, because they are somewhat at odds with the

Government&#146;s stated policy. I welcome the proposed increase in

line with inflation, but I am concerned. Recently, we in the House have

advanced proposals banning smoking in public places on grounds of

public health, and the Financial Secretary has argued thatÂ duty

rates are being increased to discourage smoking on the same grounds.

Why, then, are the Government limiting themselves this year to an

increase in line with inflation

alone?</div><a name="06050978000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have done a

bit of research into the increases in tobacco duty under this

Government. I understand that between January 1998 and March 2006

tobacco duty has been increased from 131.9p per 20 cigarettes to

210.2p, which is a rise of 59.4 per cent. in nominal terms and an

increase of 14.9 per cent. in real terms using March 2006 prices.

However, we are presented with no increase in duty in real terms,

despite the Government&#146;s stated

intent.</div><a name="06050978000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">In trying to

understand what may be lying behind this modest increase, I have

considered the incidence of smoking under this Government. In the 2004

general household survey, published in December 2005&#151;the one

most recently available from the Office for National

Statistics&#151;table 8.6 refers to the prevalence of cigarette

smoking in Great Britain between 1978 and 2004 in persons aged 16 and

over. The incidence of smoking across the population as a whole has

declined from 27 per cent. in 1998 to only 25 per cent. in 2004, which

is a modest decline given the Government&#146;s ambitions.</div>

<a name="06050978000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The table helpfully goes back

to 1978, the period immediately before the last Conservative

Government, so I should like to set the issue in context. I remind the

Committee that at that point the proportion of adults smoking was 40

per cent., but that declined to 27 per cent. in 1998. That was during a

period of the Conservative Government who were clearly more successful

in bringing down smoking for a number of reasons. I am not claiming

that tobacco duty is the sole reason why the incidence of smoking

declined. None the less, the previous Government had a more successful

record. I invite the Financial Secretary to comment on the elasticity

of demand for cigarettes related to duty and why the Government are

being so modest with this

measure.</div><a name="06050978000084"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000400"></a>Mr.

Breed:</b> The hon. Member for Ludlow(Mr. Dunne) has

said much of what I was going to say about the strategy behind the

rates of duty.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div><a name="06050978000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Duty can be lowered, frozen or

raised. Raising it in line with inflation would perhaps be the minimum

amount that a Chancellor could do to preserve the amount of revenue

received. However, it is the Government&#146;s desire and

wish&#151;and the wish throughout the House&#151;for this duty to

contribute to a general reduction in smoking and, let us hope, to

discourage young people, in particular, from

starting.</div><a name="06050978000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the

hon. Gentleman, I ought to declare an interest, because I have never

smoked anything. I am not certain whether that makes me anti-smoking.

Nevertheless, I think that we all want to reduce smoking, because of

the health

effects.</div><a name="06050978000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing in

mind that the Government have, as the hon. Gentleman said, introduced

with a huge amount of support in the House and the country the measure

for no smoking in public places as a drive to reduce smoking generally,

perhaps it was a surprise that the duty on tobacco products in the

Budget was raised only in line with inflation. Paragraph 8 of the

explanatory notes

states:</div><a name="06050978000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

estimated revenue yield from these changes is nil against an indexed

base.&#148;</div> <a name="06050978000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume that

that is because it has been raised only in line with inflation.

However, given the Government&#146;s proposals for driving down

levels of smoking, which have been largely supported, one might have

assumed that in the next year levels of smoking would reduce and that

therefore fewer cigarettes would be purchased. That, in turn, would

reduce the tax revenue. That might well be considered a

success.</div><a name="06050978000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government could have considered combining different legislation. For

instance, the Scottish Parliament has banned packs of 10 in an attempt

to make certain that young people, who are one of the principal

purchasers of packs of 10, are unable to buy them and therefore have to

spend more money on packs of 20. The hope is that that will reduce the

numbers of young people smoking. There is alsothe idea of

increasing to 18 the age of purchase. So the Government could have

reinforced their proposals with other

measures.</div><a name="06050978000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been

said, price is a main driver. As it goes up, fewer people will want or

be able to purchase cigarettes. That could spur reduced consumption.

Perhaps the Chancellor might have been a little more ambitious by

increasing duty further, but we support the overall contention of

maintaining the real

value.</div><a name="06050978000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been

pointed out already, the real problem is that as we drive up the price,

we almost encourage continued smuggling. I am sure that we will discuss

that in much greater detail during consideration of the next clause,

but a year or two ago, I and other hon. Members visited a business in

Belgium that dealt exclusively in what I suspected were smuggled

tobacco products. The man who ran the business told me that all he

needed for his business to thrive was for the Government over here to

keep driving up the price of

cigarettes.</div><a name="06050978000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until we

can get agreement on the way in which tobacco is taxed, particularly in

other parts of the European Union, that problem will continue. The

Government should not be deflected or bow down, but should try to stop

the smuggling. Certainly, we do not 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 14</div>want to give smugglers any encouragement, even if we are going to

increase the

price.</div><a name="06050978000093"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000401"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> To take the hon. Gentleman back a couple of

sentences, is he suggesting tax

harmonisation?</div><a name="06050978000094"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000402"></a>Mr.

Breed:</b> I am not suggesting that at the moment, but it

ought to be considered over time. There is smuggling from all sides in

Europe and certainly there is a great deal that could be done in

France, Belgium and elsewhere to prevent some of the smuggling into

Britain. At the moment, there seems to be a rather laid-back effort. Of

course, if other countries in Europe shared our views on the health

aspects of smoking, they might be encouraged to increase their prices

too. However, if we are not careful, I suspect that harmonisation would

end up with us substantially reducing our duty, which I could not

possibly accept. It is somewhat fanciful to think that they might

harmonise up to our level immediately but, over the next few years,

their broad strategy ought to be to recognise the associated health

problems. A French person&#146;s lungs are as likely as those of an

English person to be affected by the consumption of tobacco.</div>

<a name="06050978000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I expected a modest increase in

duty beyond inflation. However, we can look at that again next year and

assess the effect on smoking levels and tax yields of the duty rise and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000403"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I shall try to be brief and focus on the

effectiveness of duty and its impact on the elasticity of demand and

pricing.</div><a name="06050978000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard

already that we have the highest duties in the EU. As always, the hon.

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West makes a very interesting point on

tax harmonisation. However, a synthetic tax harmonisation is

effectively occurring because of the impact of smuggling, which was

mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe. Although in reality

taxes are not coming down, the tax take may ultimately come down as

prices increase. The tax take is becoming a synthetic tax

harmonisation, and we need to be concerned about

that.</div><a name="06050978000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point

has to do with the analysis of elasticity of demand and pricing, which

the Financial Secretary probably has in hand in one of the documents

that he was waving about. Action on Smoking and Health has quite

correctly pointed out that tobacco price rises are key in discouraging

individuals from smoking, but the problem with price rises, as my hon.

Friend said, is that they encourage more and more smuggling. I should

like to focus, however, on that elasticity of

demand.</div>

<a name="06050978000099"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000404"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is also

possible, if not likely, that there is a floor beyond which consumption

cannot go? In other words, no matter how high taxes are raised, it is

impossible to reduce consumption below a certain level, although no one

can be sure what that level is. No matter how high 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 15</div>Governments attempt to raise the tax, they cannot remove that floor. It

also encourages smuggling, as he

said.</div><a name="06050978000100"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000405"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> As always, my hon. Friend makes an excellent

point. As a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology, I

know that there is an addictive element to smoking cigarettes. I

believe that increasing prices will encourage those with extremely

addictive personalities&#151;or, I should say, those who are affected

more strongly than others by cigarettes&#151;to go to the black

market to buy their cigarettes at a price below the market price

effectively set by the Government. That will encourage a larger and

larger black market to satisfy the needs of a core minority of people

who need their tobacco fix. I am interested in what the Financial

Secretary will have to say on the Government&#146;s analysis. For

every 1p increase in tobacco duties, what reduction do we see in

consumption, at least down to the rock bottom mentioned by my hon.

Friend? I am curious to hear a little more about that

analysis.</div><a name="06050978000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Imperial

Tobacco has said, smuggling into the UK is the direct result of the

differential in excise duties. We want to clamp down on that smuggling

or prevent it from happening. Small shopkeepers in my constituency are

no different from the shopkeepers of Leicester mentioned by my hon.

Friend, or indeed from any of the 17,000 retailers in all the

constituencies represented in this Committee. We must be sensitive to

their interests.</div>

<a name="06050978000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the health of the

nation is paramount. As a non-smoker, like the previous two speakers, I

want to discourage smoking as much as possible. However, we need to

deal with the tension of duty increases and their effect on the black

market and smuggling. I shall be interested to hear from the Financial

Secretary what analysis the Government have done on the link between

the reduction in smoking and the increase in the tax take. What numbers

can he give us to show that the tax take is increasing, even with the

inflation-linked increase in

duty?</div><a name="06050978000103"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000406"></a>John

Healey:</b> Let me respond to the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr.

Goodman). I know Mr. Patel. I met him before the Budget and wished him

well. He has recently taken over as chair of the Tobacco Alliance, and

I discussed with him the Government&#146;s interest in working with

him and his network of small retailers to see how we can improve the

public information that warns people about the dangers of counterfeit

cigarettes and smuggled tobacco. Having published the Budget, we will

do that work jointly with his organisation. As the hon. Gentleman said,

small shopkeepers such as Mr. Patel are concerned, because cigarettes

and tobacco bring into their shops people who then buy other

things&#151;the footfall, as Mr. Patel puts it. That trade is

affected by the availability of illegal, smuggled tobacco. One of our

principal reasons for giving such priority to the anti-smuggling

strategy is that legitimate, honest businesses are undermined by the

bootleggers and smugglers who make available cut-price cigarettes and

tobacco.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div><a name="06050978000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Small retailers also face a

number of other trends, not least the increasing range of retail

products available at garages, and the patterns of shopping that,

increasingly, take people to supermarkets and out-of-town centres,

rather than to their local high streets and corner

shops.</div>

<a name="06050978000105"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000407"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. However, I just want

to be sure that he acceptsMr. Patel&#146;s key point, which

is that there is a relationship between the rate of duty and

smuggling.</div>

<a name="06050978000106"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000408"></a>John

Healey:</b> I shall come to that point. Thehon.

Members for Ludlow and for Braintree(Mr. Newmark) both tried

to probe the relationship between price&#151;underpinned in part, but

not entirely, by duty&#151;patterns of smuggling and patterns of

consumption. That is clearly complex, but I shall deal with it when I

refer to the detailed modelling that the Government economic service

has done.</div> <a name="06050978000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition

to the Tobacco Alliance, the hon. Member for Wycombe mentioned the

Tobacco Manufacturers Association. We work closely with that

organisation. Our analysis is that the illicit market trend is

consistent, but the precise figures sometimes differ. The counterfeit

figures&#151;I am not sure whether they were the

TMA&#146;s&#151;that the hon. Gentleman cited certainly differ, and

we believe that the anti-fraud measures that we have put in place are

making a great impact.</div>

<a name="06050978000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

important to consider&#151;as the hon. Gentleman encouraged us to

do&#151;the modest measure of retaining the real value of tobacco

duty in clause 1 in the wider context of the anti-tobacco smuggling

strategy, which we launched in 2000-01. Between then and 2003-04, we

succeeded first in halting the rapid rise, then in stabilising it and

then in beginning to reduce the illicit market. By 2003-04, the illicit

market was still too big, but it was down to 16 per cent. Since the

launch of the anti-tobacco smuggling strategy in March 2000, the number

of cigarettes smuggled into this country each year has been reduced by

more than 5 billion, and we have cut the illicit share of cigarettes by

a quarter and protected almost &#163;6 billion in revenue to the

public purse. Without that action, and the investment that we have been

prepared to put in, the illicit market would be not 16 per cent. but 36

per cent. We still have to do more to clamp down, because smuggling

gangs change their tactics and their methods very rapidly. Part of what

we have to do, and which we set out in the publication &#147;New

responses to new challenges: Reinforcing the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling

Strategy&#148;, published alongside the Budget, is to deal with the

increasing levels of counterfeit cigarettes and the persistently high

levels of smuggled hand-rolling

tobacco.</div><a name="06050978000109"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000409"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> What analysis does the hon. Gentleman have that

lies behind those projections, which show that the number would have

been 36 per cent. as opposed to the 16 per cent.? What is the detailed

analysis behind that differential?</div>

<a name="06050978000110"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000410"></a>John

Healey:</b> The hon. Gentleman brings me neatly to one of the

documents that we published about18 months ago. I will send

him a personal copy.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div><a name="06050978000111"></a>

Primarolo:</b>

Signed.</div><a name="06050978000112"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000412"></a>John

Healey:</b> I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman wants me to

do that. The publication is the most rigorous attempt to model and

assess the often complex combination of inter-relationships in which

the Committee is interested. It contains much of the information for

which he and the hon. Members for Ludlow and for Wycombe have been

asking. If the hon. Gentleman has time, I suggest that he study

it.</div><a name="06050978000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The model&#146;s

main findings show that, with tobacco, we are close to the revenue

maximisation point with cigarette duty. That means that any large real

increase in duty rates would increase smuggling and start to reduce,

not increase, revenues. Duty cuts wouldnot produce

proportionate reductions in tobacco smuggling. Only a large cut in duty

would be likely to have any significant impact on the behaviour of

consumers and suppliers. The Government economic service tobacco

model&#151;this is the answer to one or two of the points that the

hon. Gentleman has made&#151;shows that a 1 per cent. real increase

raises, in revenue terms, only about &#163;5 million

pounds.</div>

<a name="06050978000114"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000413"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I am most interested in what the hon. Gentleman is

saying. If possible, may I receive a copy of the document? Will he look

back at the historic impact of the real increases in the past and

explain how effective they were in raising revenue versus the increased

smuggling?</div><a name="06050978000115"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000414"></a>John

Healey:</b> I shall be delighted to ensure that the hon.

Gentleman receives a copy. If any other Committee members would like a

copy, it is available through the Vote Office.</div>

<a name="06050978000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to our calculations,

a 4 per cent. increase in duty would increase smuggling by about 1 per

cent. It would have a negligible impact on consumption. The assessment

suggests that it would hit consumption by 0.2 per cent. only. It would

increase revenue by only about &#163;10 million pounds and that is

the point at which we would reach the revenue maximisation point on

cigarette duty.</div>

<a name="06050978000117"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000415"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I very much appreciate the analysis that the

Financial Secretary has explained. However, there is a slight

contradiction, or perhaps, if he could clear it up for me, it is not a

contradiction after all. He said that a 1 per cent. increase in duties

would increase tax take by &#163;5 million pounds. However, he also

said that there is a point of diminishing returns; that one cannot keep

increasing duties ad infinitum. I am curious about the analysis in that

document. What is the actual tipping point? Are we there now or do we

need to increase duties by another 2 to 3 per cent.? Clarification

would be helpful on where that tipping point is and the point at which

we meet those diminishing

returns?</div><a name="06050978000118"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000416"></a>John

Healey:</b> I do not want to repeat myself. Perhaps the hon.

Gentleman did not catch my words when I said that we are very close to

the revenue maximisation point on cigarette duty at present? Were we to

increase the duty on cigarettes by 4 per cent., we would raise 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div>only an extra &#163;10 million or so. We believe that that is the

level at which we would hit the revenue maximisation point.</div>

<a name="06050978000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his intervention and his

contribution, the hon. Gentleman argued that our smuggling problem is

principally a product of the fact that our tobacco duty rate is high

compared with that of our European Union counterparts. I do not really

wish to refer him to other documents, but if I did he would see that

the vast majority of illegal cigarettes are smuggled into the UK in

freight from outside the European Union. No duty is paid on those

cigarettes anywhere, let alone in the European Union, so to concentrate

on the difference in duty between Britain and Belgium, Spain or France

is to miss the point. It is misleading as a focus for analysis. I am

not sure whether the hon. Gentleman advocates cutting the duty in the

UK to a rate that is comparable with those that prevail in the rest of

the world, but his Front Benchers might be interested in that

proposition financially&#151;because it would cost billions of

pounds&#151;and in terms of health, because it would lead to an

increase in

smoking.</div>

<a name="06050978000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

am</div><a name="06050978000120"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000417"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> On a point of clarification, I would never make

any suggestion that would contradict my Front Bench, or the aspirations

of my fellow Opposition Members.</div>

<a name="06050978000121"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000418"></a>John

Healey:</b> I think that we have heard the first public job

application from the hon. Gentleman. I wish him well in supporting all

the positions that his Front Bench takes during the course of these

proceedings. If he does not disagree with the hon. Member for Wycombe,

he certainly does with the hon. Member for Ludlow. While he was arguing

that rates should be lower, the hon. Member for Ludlow said that the

price of cigarettes and the duty on them should be higher. There is

clearly an interesting discussion taking place behind the hon. Member

for Wycombe. All hon. Members will be interested in the fact that the

UK has long maintained high levels of duty so as to keep prices

relatively high in order to try to affect consumption. Other countries

in Europe, such as France, Germany and Ireland, are

beginning&#151;both for public health reasons and for revenue

reasons&#151;to follow our lead.</div>

<a name="06050978000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">As part of his

contention that we should increase tobacco duty in real terms, the hon.

Member for Ludlow is rightly concerned, as all hon. Members will be, to

bring about further reductions in smoking in this country. It has been

the policy of successive previous Administrations and this one to use

duty rates to maintain high cigarette and tobacco prices. That has

undoubtedly been a significant factor in the reduction in the number of

smokers in the population, which has dropped from 35 per cent. in the

early 1980s to some 25 per cent. now.</div>

<a name="06050978000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the proportion

of the population who smoke reduces, further gains are harder to

achieve. While duty rates were never low&#151;they were never the

single club in the policy bag&#151;a number of other measures are

needed. That is why I mentioned in my opening remarks that, through the

NHS, we are making a large investment in programmes to help people who

want to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div>quit smoking. Hon. Members will be aware that 70 per cent. of smokers

say that they would like to quit. The cessation programmes that we have

put in place through the NHS are important in that respect. Given our

experience in Ireland and Scotland, we believe that the ban in smoking

in public places is likely to have a further impact on the overall

level of smoking in this country.</div>

<a name="06050978000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the support of the

hon. Memberfor South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) for the

Government&#146;s policy of a comprehensive smoking ban in public

places. I am not sure that his hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham

(Dr. Cable), as the Liberal Democrats&#146; shadow Chancellor, will

be quite so keen, but he will certainly be interested in his approach

to tax harmonisation.</div>

<a name="06050978000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me end by saying that any

members of the Committee who believe that there is merit in any of the

four new clauses should have a word with me and I shall undertake to

let them have copies of all the documents that we have published

recently that cover the relevant territory. Hon. Members may take that

as a promise or a threat, but I hope that it will help them to come to

the right decision when we finally vote on the new clauses, not just on

whether clause 1 should stand part of the

Bill.</div>

<a name="06050978000126"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000419"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> As I explained earlier, the new clauses were

primarily an attempt to elicit from the Financial Secretary an

up-to-date summary of the effectiveness of tobacco duty. He has

thoroughly outlined the Government&#146;s thinking, particularly on

the revenue maximisation point. It was useful to hear him explaining

the Treasury&#146;s position that there is a point beyond which, if

the duty were raised, it would almost certainly not drive consumption

down, but it would drive smuggling and counterfeiting up. He was also

right to say that duties are only one club in the bag, albeit an

important club, and to give us details.</div>

<a name="06050978000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been given two

pointers. One is the point that was raised by the TMA that the

Government might miss their smuggling target if present trends

continue. The other relates to the Financial Secretary&#146;s kind

offer to shower us with documents. While, as I said earlier, the

Government&#146;s anti-smuggling strategy succeeded in reducing the

revenue loss for two successive years from 2001, it rose again last

year. I should be glad&#151;goodness knows why I am exposing myself

to more documents in this way&#151;if the Financial Secretary would

point me towards the sections of the document that explain clearly and

straightforwardly why that occurred. We do not intend to oppose the

proposed rise in duties and will not press the new clauses to a

vote.</div>

<a name="06050978000128"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000420"></a>The

anticipate the clause stand part debate that will take place later. On

the other hand, I have to say something about their context. The clause

is important for this part of the Bill. In relation to the evasion of

tobacco products duty, which we discussed in part a few moments ago, it

sets out a series ofduties on manufacturers and penalties if

they fail to comply with those duties, an appeals system and various

supplementary provisions. The proposals are controversial. The

Kingdom&#148;.</div><a name="06050978000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge

that &#147;likely&#148; has been used in legislation, but it is the

view at least of the Chartered Institute of Taxation that the word is a

bit vague. We must remember that the assessment of likelihood will be

made in due course by the commissioners, so it is important to be clear

about the meaning of

&#147;likely&#148;.</div><a name="06050978000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

I am not misrepresenting the position of the Chartered Institute of

Taxation, it suggested that there are two interpretations of

&#147;likely&#148;: one is a balance of probabilities, while the

other is the alternative legal idea of beyond reasonable doubt. It is

obviously important to be clear which meaning the Government have in

mind. I take it that the Bill refers to likelihood on a balance of

probability. If that were the Government&#146;s view, it might be as

well to write it into the

Bill.</div><a name="06050978000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chartered

Institute of Taxation said that the term &#147;likely&#148; is not

absolute and could range from being likely on a balance of

probabilities to beyond reasonable doubt. I will take its advice on the

matter. When I read that, it occurred to me that something could be

likely on a balance of probabilities and yet it had to be certain

beyond reasonable

doubt.</div><a name="06050978000152"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000428"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I advise the hon. Gentleman in contradiction to

the Chartered Institute of Taxation that &#147;likely&#148; means

on a balance of probabilities. It is a standard legislative word; it

does not mean &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148;. That is a

criminal

definition.</div><a name="06050978000155"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000429"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> I thought that the hon. Gentleman might say that.

As I said a moment ago, I was struck by that when I read the Chartered

Institute of Taxation&#146;s document. However, if the

Government&#146;s meaning of &#147;likely&#148; is &#147;on a

balance of probabilities&#148;, the Paymaster General should explain

why she might or might not want to make that clear under the

Bill.</div><a name="06050978000156"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000430"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> The Paymaster General does not need to take such

action. The meaning is clear under the Bill and the word would be

interpreted by a judge as meaning &#147;on a balance of

probabilities&#148;. It is not a matter of ambiguity; there is no

ambiguity. The word 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div>would be interpreted by a judge as the Chartered Institute of Taxation

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000431"></a>Mr.

Paymaster General will confirm that. There could be other

is good enough, but I shall do my best. Does my hon. Friend agree that,

if a tobacco manufacturer were to get the judgments wrong, he would

face a potential penalty of up to&#163;5 million? Is it not

explored thoroughly amendment No. 10 on the importance of defining

&#147;likely&#148;. AmendmentNo. 11 seeks also to insert

No. 12 refers to subsection (2)(b) which describes the &#147;written

policy&#148; that a manufacturer will be obliged to keep for the

purposes of describing what they are doing to ensure that they are not

unwittingly participating in fraud. The manufacturer will have to keep

that policy to satisfy the commissioners. M hon. Friends and

I are seeking to insert after &#147;subsection (1)&#148; the

words</div><a name="06050978000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless that

keeping such a policy will impose a burden upon manufacturers. That

burden might be justified&#151;we shall have that discussion a little

later&#151;but it is reasonable in principle to establish a means by

which that burden might be lightened a little. A memorandum of

understanding would be a possible means not unknown to the

Treasury.</div>

<a name="06050978000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In March, the

Treasury and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs published a joint

document entitled &#147;New Responses to New Challenges: Reinforcing

the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling Strategy&#148;. It acknowledged that

the memorandum of understanding procedure, in which HMRC co-operates

with UK tobacco producers rather than compelling them to act, has been

a success. No doubt, the Financial Secretary wishes to draw our

attention to that document. It

states:</div><a name="06050978000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;MoUs

between HMRC and the UK tobacco manufacturers have been an important

element of the strategy, and have played a crucial role in restricting

the availability of genuine cigarettes to smugglers. Since its peak in

2000/01, the incidence of UK manufactured cigarettes being smuggled

into the UK has fallen markedly, from about 75 per cent of large

seizures to 28 per cent in 2003/04.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div><a name="06050978000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government were thereby acknowledging

that those memorandums of understanding are an important element in

their strategy.</div> <a name="06050978000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

true that in that document the Government ruled out using memorandums

of understanding in the way that I have suggested. However, we feel

that that decision has not been fully justified, although the Financial

Secretary might attempt to do that in his reply. The main point of the

amendment is to seek to establish whether a means can be found of

lightening the considerable burden that will be placed on manufacturers

if clause 2 comes into effect. Amendment No. 13 refers to the same

policy and seeks to insert the same wording as amendment No.

12.</div> <a name="06050978000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee

will be delighted to hear that we now turn to page three, where, on

line 2, a requirement is placed on manufacturers. It

states:</div><a name="06050978000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Commissioners may by notice in writing require a manufacturer of

cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco to provide, within a specified

period of time, specified

information&#148;</div><a name="06050978000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">contained in

the three following subsections, which I shall not read out. The point

is that the Bill

period of time&#148;,</div><a name="06050978000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">but

there is no indication about how long that period will be. In effect,

if manufacturers get a letter from the commissioners demanding that

they fulfil their undertakings under the clause, they may, as far as I

can see, be required to reply immediately; that might be the

&#147;specified period of time&#148; referred

to.</div><a name="06050978000169"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000434"></a>Stephen

Hesford:</b> When the hon. Gentleman was dealing with clause

1, it was not entirely clear whether he was sanguine about the concept

of smuggling. Clause 2(5) gives effect to subsection (4), under which

the commissioners are attempting to cut down smuggling. I see the hon.

Gentleman nodding. The commissioners may want to act sooner rather than

later, with little notice or some flexibility, because that would give

more weight and effect to the function that they would ordinarily carry

out under subsection (4). Inserting the word &#147;reasonable&#148;

might hamper the commissioners. Does he accept that? In those

circumstances, would he ask leave to withdraw his

amendment?</div><a name="06050978000170"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000435"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> Without repeating the debate on the previous

clause, it is evident that my hon. Friends and I take smuggling

seriously. Debating the level at which the duty is set in no way

suggests that we are frivolous about it. However, I am grateful to the

hon. Gentleman for bringing me to the next point that I wanted to make,

which is about the word

&#147;reasonable&#148;.</div><a name="06050978000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

think that the hon. Gentleman said that if &#147;reasonable&#148;

were inserted, it might hamper the entirely laudable anti-fraud drive

of the Treasury and the commissioners. If that is so, the Financial

Secretary will doubtless give us adequate reason when he replies.

However, just for argument&#146;s sake, I cannot immediately see why

inserting the words &#147;and reasonable&#148;, which would merely

require the commissioners to be reasonable, would be a blow against the

laudable, praiseworthy anti-smuggling efforts of the Treasury and the

commissioners. I think 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div>that, with the assistance of the hon. Member for Wirral, West, I have

covered that

point.</div><a name="06050978000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050978000436"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): If there is

a particular need for information to be provided quickly, it would be

reasonable for there to be a demand for it to provided quickly; if the

demand was not reasonable, it could take longer. It depends on the

circumstances, and I do not think that one should assess all the

factors and circumstances. If there is a reasonable need for

information to be provided promptly to enforce the measure, I see

nothing in my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment that would prevent

that.</div><a name="06050978000173"></a>

the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) is right and as

helpful as ever in making his point about reasonableness. The idea of

reasonableness is not exactly foreign to Government

Bills&#151;whichever political party forms the Government&#151;or

foreign or extraneous to this Bill, which is full of clauses that use

the word &#147;reasonable&#148; or the concept of reasonableness. I

am attempting&#151;I am sure that the Financial Secretary is

attempting it too, and doubtless he will take up the point when he

responds&#151;to strike the right balance between the burden being

placed on manufacturers, which raises important issues that we propose

to discuss in the debate on clause stand part, and the

Government&#146;s anti-fraud drive. We must get that balance

right.</div><a name="06050978000175"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000438"></a>Rob

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000440"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I suggest again that the amendmentis

redundant. We are talking about tobacco manufacturers, who usually have

a lot of money. If they think that the Government have not acted

reasonably, they can apply for judicial review under Wednesbury

principles, and they will

win.</div><a name="06050978000178"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000441"></a>Mr.

manufacturers&#146; only recourse, considering all the time, trouble

and difficulty that they would face in applying for judicial review. I

am waiting to hear what the Financial Secretary has to say, but I

suggest that the Government might want to find a means to ensure that

the manufacturers would not have to go to that trouble in the first

place.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000444"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I am not sure whether it will be a sharp legal

point, but it is a legal point none the less. The Wednesbury judicial

test of unreasonableness is a very 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div>high bar that is difficult and expensive to meet. The word

&#147;reasonable&#148; in this situation will set a more realistic

bar than the Wednesbury idea of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000448"></a>Mr.

Breed:</b> We must all agree that smuggling has been,

continues to be and is likely to be a problem. However, an island

nation like ours ought to be better placed than most in trying to

prevent it from happening. The smuggling of cigarettes and alcoholic

drink has become almost socially acceptable. It is unfortunate that

many people do not see it as a great sin or breaking the law in any

way.</div> <a name="06050978000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, we

have a situation in which, according to the notes, one in six

cigarettes and half of all hand-rolling tobacco are smuggled. That in

itself must cause us considerable concern. As, I think the Financial

Secretary pointed out, much of that is large-scale smuggling in

containers by organised criminal gangs who quite frankly are making

huge profits&#151;many millions of pounds. But those products are

purchased by people. As we have seen recently, people are quite willing

to buy materials in pubs that they do not question, but which might

have been stolen. I suspect that there are considerable distribution

networks that underlie those huge gangs. I do not know how they could

distribute literally 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 27</div>millions of cigarettes without clear distribution networks in this

country in order to dispose of the smuggled

material.</div><a name="06050978000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

return to my visit to Belgium to which I alluded earlier. I went there

with a few other hon. Members to look at a particular operation set up

purely to ensure that smuggled tobacco came into this country. We

visited a warehouse just inside Belgium that was stacked to the

gunwales with cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco. Apparently it was

restocked twice a week&#151;a massive warehouse emptied out and

refilled twice a

week.</div><a name="06050978000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proprietor

seemed to use a cash system. I did not see anyone paying with cheques,

credit cards or anything like that. He had a huge tea chest for a till

which was full of &#163;10, &#163;20 and &#163;50 notes and more

in euros and other currencies. Next to it were standing two large

gentlemen as a sort of insurance policy against someone taking the tea

chest away.</div><a name="06050978000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were

invited to have a conversation with the owner, who, I imagined from his

accent, was from London. He was quite open about what he was doing. I

said, &#147;Well, doesn&#146;t anyone come to check?&#148; He

said, &#147;We get checked probably every week. We are raided every

week by the authorities. They come to check on what we are

doing.&#148; I asked if there were ever any problems and he said,

&#147;No, we adhere to all the regulations that we are required to

meet, so we carry

on.&#148;</div><a name="06050978000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">With four

or five hon. Gentlemen in their suits parading around that place, a

considerable number of cars came, slowed down, looked at us and then

disappeared around the corner. So we were not invited to stay for long

because it looked like we were having a bad effect on the

owner&#146;s trade. I asked him roughly how much cash went through

his business in a year. He said, &#147;I can be quite clear about

that. Last year we tipped just over &#163;100 million.&#148; I

asked what sort of profit margin that was and he said, &#147;Easy.

Between2 and 2.5 per cent.&#148; I said, &#147;So you

make about&#163;2.5 million in profit.&#148; He said,

&#147;That&#146;s about right.&#148; Moreover, I would not have

thought that his overheads would have amounted to a huge

amount.</div> <a name="06050978000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The owner

made no bones about the fact that some people even had sports bags that

carried precisely the amount of rolling tobacco that they considered

could get through customs, which were then put in with others. They

appeared to be returning tourists when they were actually day trippers.

Sometimes such people would go over two or three times a week to do

nothing other than pick up that sort of material and bring it back. I

do not suppose that that has changed much. That might be considered

small-scale, but while we were there at least 100 customers must have

come along and picked up goods for cash. I cannot imagine that that was

all for their own

consumption.</div><a name="06050978000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we

have day trippers going not only on booze cruises, but on tobacco

forays. Part of the problem is defining personal consumption. To me and

other Committee members, it would be nil, but to others it could be 50,

60 or 100 a day. Many of my constituents, and perhaps others, have

fallen foul of customs&#151;even people who might have been quite

innocent in their decision to get some cigarettes for their friends and



<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 28</div>themselves. We know of cases when even cars have been confiscated

because customs have decided that people have gone over the limit.

There was certainly not great clarity then about what could be imported

and how it could be used. I hope that there is much better clarity now.

Clearly, if the products are to be sold in this country, that is

illegal. Most people understand that, but few people would decide not

to purchase cigarettes, and rolling tobacco in particular, from people

whom they knew had bought them without paying the duty.</div>

<a name="06050978000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">As many members of the

Committee have said, such action undermines our confectioners,

tobacconists and newsagents who are under siege anyway. They are under

siege because of supermarkets having taken their business; they are

under siege because of newspaper wholesalers being difficult to them

and they are under siege because of so much smuggled tobacco. That was

pointed out by my local CTN who in one week sold only about 20 or so

packs of rolling tobacco, but enough cigarette papers to roll about

5,000 or 6,000 cigarettes. He was for ever more having to order and

sell cigarette papers, but did not sell too much of the rolling tobacco

that was supposed to be put in

them.</div><a name="06050978000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is obvious

that there are huge amounts of smuggled material. It is right that the

Government should get the position under control. Perhaps the Minister

or others may know about it, but I have not seen reports in my local

papers of organised networks of distribution in this country that have

been busted. No great effort has been made to close down some of the

internal networks, but I hope that there will be in future. The

manufacturers have an obligation to support such efforts. They make

huge profits from tobacco products. We are moving away from memorandums

of understanding to a more statutory obligation. We are trying to put

more pressure on manufacturers. If that is so, a certain amount of

clarity in respect of what the manufacturers need to do is required by

tourists and day trippers to avoid

penalties.</div><a name="06050978000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the

Minister say whether the provisions cover small-scale smuggling? Will

those who bring in small-scale amounts of cigarettes and rolling

tobacco be caught more heavily under the Bill? Will it be made clear to

them what the penalties will be? Will we make certain that constituents

will not realise suddenly that they are infringing the law to the

extent that they will be subject to huge penalties? Clause 2 refers

continually to

cigarettes.</div><a name="06050978000210"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000449"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I am listening carefully to the hon.

Gentleman. He is slipping between speaking to the amendment and

speaking to clause stand part. I have been generous with him so far,

but I must say to him and others who wish to speak that we are not

debating clause stand part, but these fine

amendments.</div><a name="06050978000211"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000450"></a>Mr.

Breed:</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I am sorry

for speaking in a wider

context.</div><a name="06050978000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments refer to specific parts of the clause, which refers only to

cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco. However, clause 1 refers also to

cigars. I do not know whether there is a huge smuggling operation in

cigars, but is the clause confined purely to those two

products?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000451"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I hope to speak during the clause stand part

debate, but I want to speak to amendmentsNos. 12, 13, 17 and

18, which refer to the memorandum of understanding mentioned by my hon.

Friend the Member for Wycombe. He quoted from a document produced by

the Treasury and HMRC, &#147;New responses to new challenges:

Reinforcing the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling Strategy&#148;, which

identified the important role played by co-operation between the

industry and the Government. There seems to be no doubt that

restricting the availability of genuine cigarettes to smugglers is

crucial, too; that is an important part of Government policy, and that

is to be welcomed.</div>

<a name="06050978000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of my concerns about clause

2 is that there is no recognition of the role of co-operation with the

industry and no reference to the memorandums of

understanding&#151;other than those in my hon. Friend&#146;s

amendments, of course. The purpose of amendments Nos. 12, 13, 17 and 18

is to put the memorandums on almost a statutory basis, or at least to

create a role for them, so that there is a recognised role in

legislation for co-operation between the Government and the industry.

That is important because greater co-operation with the industry may

continue to be essential in reducing smuggling.</div>

<a name="06050978000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all wish to reduce the

amount of smuggling, for obvious reasons, but industry co-operation has

been essential to the success in doing so in recent years. I fear that

as we move towards a statutory basis, industry involvement may

diminish; there may be less incentive and less desire for the industry

to assist the Government. I am concerned about that, and that is why I

should be interested to hear the Financial Secretary&#146;s views on

where memorandums of understanding will lie following the

implementation of the Finance Bill. Is there still a desire on the part

of the Government to work with industry, and how could that be

recognised in the Bill? Could the burdens on industry be not reduced,

but made more suitable for them, so that there is a line of

communication between Government and industry, and so that there are

effective measures for tackling

smuggling?</div><a name="06050978000216"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000452"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> support the amendments tabled by my Front-Bench

colleagues. In particular, I wish to speak on the amendments referred

to by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr.

Gauke), which have to do with the memorandum of

understanding.</div>

<a name="06050978000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to the document

referred to, we have had some success in reducing the proportion of

smuggled cigarettes manufactured in this country to 28 per cent. in

2003-04. That is obviously good news, but it means that 72 per cent. of

smuggled cigarettes being sold in this country are manufactured

overseas. My concern about the Government proposals thus far is how the

measures will affect overseas manufacturers in practical terms. I shall

be most interested to learn from the Minister how the Government expect

to encourage manufacturers to comply with the regulations if we do not

encourage them to co-operate with HMRC and the authorities in this

country through means such as memorandums of understanding.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div><a name="06050978000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording in proposed new

section 7A, referring to the likelihood of manufacturers&#146;

customers smuggling into this country, is extremely vague and gives

manufacturers a great deal of opportunity to argue that all their

customers are bona fide. How on earth can HMRC, when prosecuting those

manufacturers, prove that there was not bona fide intent? That would be

extremely difficult, and that is why a memorandum of understanding can

work through the arrangements between the manufacturer and the Revenue

to provide proper enforcement. The other matter that arises, given that

the clauses are directed at overseas manufacturers, is jurisdiction and

territoriality. I am not an expert on that. Unlike others who have

spoken, I am not a solicitor, and would have difficulty in interpreting

this legislation alongside the legislation that might apply in

jurisdictions under which non UK-based manufacturers are incorporated.

Does the Minister appreciate the fact that memorandums of understanding

with foreign-based companies might be the best way to overcome

territorial and jurisdiction

issues?</div><a name="06050978000219"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000453"></a>John

Healey:</b> It is difficult to debate the amendments without

dealing with the broader context of the clause. Although the hon.

Member for Wycombe did that very effectively, his hon. Friends ranged

rather more widely. Some of the points that they raised were better

suited to clause stand part.</div>

<a name="06050978000220"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000454"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister has highlighted something

that I have seen from the Chair&#151;the difficulty of staying within

the amendments while keeping clear of clause stand part. If the

Committee will be happy, I shall move from the Chair that we combine

the debate on the amendments with a clause stand part debate, in which

hon. Members who have spoken may speak again. That should overcome the

difficulty that a number of us have

identified.</div>

<a name="06050978000221"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000455"></a>John

Healey:</b> I am grateful for that guidance,Mr.

O&#146;Hara. In that case, I shall have a bash at both. Let me start

with the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, who made a number of

general comments, and gave us a vivid description of the retail

warehouse that he visited in Belgium. I am curious to know&#151;he

might not wish to answer&#151;whether he rang the customs

confidential phone line when he came back. If he did not have the

number, I shall happily supply it to him.</div>

<a name="06050978000222"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000456"></a>Mr.

Breed:</b> I did better than that. We raised it in an

Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall, in which all of those who went

spoke.</div><a name="06050978000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050978000457"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Francois:</b> Was that designed to keep it

confidential?</div><a name="06050978000224"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000458"></a>John

Healey:</b> The hon. Gentleman made a serious point, namely

that those operations are highly organised and can be very profitable.

Both the memorandums of understanding and the clause that we are

debating are designed to ensure that we can clamp down further on

sources of tobacco that might enter illegal or illicit supply chains.

His comments, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div>while vivid and relating to events two or three years ago, were

pertinent to our discussion today.</div>

<a name="06050978000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Members for South-West Hertfordshire and for Ludlow wanted proper

recognition of the role of memorandums of understanding, and of the

co-operation that there has been with tobacco manufacturers in recent

years. I shall come to that in detail. The hon. Member for South-West

Hertfordshire mentioned the document that we published at the time of

the Budget, &#147;Reinforcing the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling

Strategy&#148;. That clearly points out how important close

co-operation and voluntary memorandums of understanding can be in

helping us to clamp down on sources of tobacco and cigarettes that have

found their way into illegal and illicit supply chains in this

country.</div>

<a name="06050978000226"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000459"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> Will the Minister accept that not including the

memorandums of understanding specifically in these clauses and this new

regime tends to indicate to manufacturers, if to nobody else, that the

Government&#146;s view is that the memorandums of understanding

regime has not done the job properly? If he accepts that memorandums of

understanding are important, is it not vital that they be specified in

this clause?</div>

<a name="06050978000227"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000460"></a>John

Healey:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall

explain the position. If he feels that I have not dealt with it, he can

respond. I do not think that he appreciates the fact that clause 2

mirrors the memorandum of understanding. Those of our UK manufacturers

that have a memorandum of understanding in place will find it much

easier to comply with the clause than those that do not. We want

manufacturers that do not have one to be covered by the same regime,

and clause 2 will ensure that they

are.</div><a name="06050978000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Memorandums of

understanding go beyond the provisions and purpose of clause 2. They

cover issues that help us to work with the tobacco manufacturers to

deal with counterfeit cigarettes, and they set out levels of

co-operation that support other anti-smuggling strategies. Memorandums

of understanding are important. They are the basis on which clause 2 is

built. The clause mirrors the memorandums of understanding in many ways

but does not replace them, because they play an important and much

wider part in our anti-smuggling

activities.</div><a name="06050978000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

deal with the comments of the hon. Member for Wycombe, amendment by

amendment. The problems appear to have been raised more by tax advisers

than by tobacco companies and the industry itself. He described the

amendments as probing amendments. I hope that I can reassure him and

other Committee members on the

points.</div><a name="06050978000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 10 and 11 seek to introduce a defence for tobacco manufacturers,

based on the balance of probability, against the accusation of

facilitating smuggling. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,

South-West was right: the amendments are not necessary, as the

conventional legal interpretation of &#147;likely&#148; is based on

the balance 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div>of probability. The clarification proposed in amendments Nos. 10 and 11

is simply not

necessary.</div><a name="06050978000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 12 and 13 seek to exempt tobacco manufacturers that have entered

into memorandums of understanding with HMRC from the requirements to

maintain and provide a written policy setting out their approach to

controlling and monitoring their supply chains. Likewise, amendments

Nos. 17 and 18 aim to remove the content of the supply chain policy and

the manufacturer&#146;s compliance with it from the list of factors

taken into consideration when determining the amount of any

penalty.</div><a name="06050978000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have

said, the draft legislation is designed to mirror those memorandums of

understanding. UK manufacturers with MOUs supply us with their

documents already. Although a manufacturer might have agreed particular

terms in an MOU, which might be helpful evidence of its willingness to

comply, such agreements are voluntary. They do not provide any means of

enforcement if a manufacturer does not adhere fully to the terms

agreed.</div><a name="06050978000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">An additional

point worth making is that the clause as drafted will create equality

of responsibility among tobacco manufacturers. In other words, it will

ensure that those manufacturers that have entered into and complied

fully with a memorandum of understanding are not disadvantaged.

Providing exemptions on the strength of a memorandum of understanding

would send the wrong signal to manufacturers, providing a potential

incentive to enter into a voluntary agreement for the purposes of

avoiding the clause&#146;s obligations.</div>

<a name="06050978000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 14 refers to any

notice given by HMRC to the manufacturer to provide within a reasonable

period specified information about supplies of its brands to particular

customers and markets. Such notifications will be made by HMRC where

there is a particularly high risk of smuggling, and as a result

manufacturers will be expected to exercise greater control over their

supply chain policy.</div>

<a name="06050978000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a general principle of

public law that HMRC must act reasonably. The addition of the word

&#147;reasonable&#148; is therefore unnecessary, as it is implicit

not just in the provision but in the clause as a

whole.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000461"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I have been perusing the explanatory notes.

Paragraph 33 of the section that relates toclause 2

states:</div><a name="06050978000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HMRC

attach a large margin of error to estimates of profits tobacco

manufacturers gain from this

trade,&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06050978000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume

that that refers to the illicit trade that we are

discussing&#151;</div><a name="06050978000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but

they estimate profits to be in the region of &#163;33 million or

&#163;55 million, depending on different methodologies

used.&#148;</div><a name="06050978000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be

helpful if the Minister clarified that that refers to the illegal or

illicit trade that manufacturers enter&#151;unbeknown to them, I

assume. I am curious about why there is an almost 60 per cent., more

than &#163;20 million, difference between the sums.</div>

<a name="06050978000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The paragraph goes on to

state:</div><a name="06050978000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The UK

tobacco manufacturers accept that they have a certain responsibility

for ensuring that cigarettes and HRT, sold to markets outside the UK,

are not supplied or re-supplied to persons likely to smuggle them into

the UK. To this end a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div>number of the UK tobacco manufacturers have agreed a Memorandum of

Understanding...with the Commissioners of

HMRC.&#148;</div><a name="06050978000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that

memorandum of understanding have any teeth that the Minister is aware

of, or is that statement just generic? Will we have a debate in a

year&#146;s time and find out that &#163;33 million to &#163;55

million in illegal profits is still being

made?</div><a name="06050978000241"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000462"></a>John

Healey:</b> The purpose of clause 2 is to giveteeth

to the very provisions and approach of the memorandum of understanding.

If the hon. Gentleman and other Conservatives were successful in

blocking the progress of the clause, we might indeed return to this

issue, next year or the year after, with little impact having been made

on the profit margins that he cited from the explanatory

notes.</div><a name="06050978000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Calculating

anything connected with the operation of and margins in an illicit

supply chain is inherently difficult. Such calculations involve the

profits that can accrue to legitimate manufacturers producing and

supplying genuine products that may, at a point down the supply chain,

be diverted, avoid duty and be resold. That is not the profits that

those manufacturers make on that activity, but the profits made on the

products at source that may eventually find their way, according to our

ability to calculate and estimate, into the illicit market. That is why

there is inevitably a margin of error with such calculations. That is

the nature ofhow the product is sourced and supplied, and the

memorandum of understanding, reinforced byclause 2, is

designed to try to choke off such illicit

profits.</div>

<a name="06050978000243"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000463"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> The margin of error strikes me as rather large;

we are talking about not 5 per cent. or10 per cent. but a

more than 60 per cent. margin of error. That has perplexed me. Has the

Minister done any analysis on how we could narrow that margin of

error?</div><a name="06050978000244"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000464"></a>John

Healey:</b> We are able to improve our analysis; sometimes,

doing that reduces the margin of error to the extent that we have good

quality and improving information about the activities in the illicit

field and the operation of the supply chain right back to the

source&#151;the legitimate manufacturers. Given that we are building

up that work and that HMRC is sharing information with tobacco

manufacturers about seizures, we are building up a better picture of

the pattern of supply chains. With that picture, we can more

effectively try to choke off such illicit activities, and ultimately we

will be able to get a better measure of them.</div>

<a name="06050978000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot give the hon.

Gentleman any promises on reducing the margin of error, but I hope that

I have explained the nature of the problem that we are trying to assess

and calculate and why it is right to indicate that there will

inevitably be a margin of

error.</div><a name="06050978000246"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000465"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I understood that, as the Minister correctly

pointed out, the whole point of the memorandum of understanding was to

give more teeth. I hope that the Minister can give me confidence that,

if I am lucky enough to be on the Finance Bill 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div>Standing Committee one year from now and I refer to the explanatory note

on clause 2, the margin of error will not be 60 per cent. and the

numbers will be far smaller than those in this year&#146;s

explanatory

notes.</div><a name="06050978000247"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000466"></a>John

Healey:</b> I hope that I, too, will be on the Standing

Committee next year and still in the position that I hold

now.</div><a name="06050978000248"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000467"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> Will my hon. Friend take the opportunity to

explain to the hon. Member for Braintree that it is not a question of

margin of error? As the explanatory notes say, different methodologies

produce different results. That does not mean a margin of error. The

hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand

that.</div><a name="06050978000249"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000468"></a>John

Healey:</b> My hon. Friend is right. It is essentially a

measure of margin of

uncertainty.</div><a name="06050978000250"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000469"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> Let me clarify the point. Two or three questions

ago I asked the Financial Secretary to clarify what the methodologies

are.</div><a name="06050978000251"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">The

Chairman:</b> Order. It is not clear to me whether the Financial

Secretary is taking that

intervention.</div><a name="06050978000252"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000470"></a>John

Healey:</b> I give way to the hon.

Gentleman.</div><a name="06050978000253"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000471"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I apologise, Mr. O&#146;Hara, and I thank the

Financial Secretary for giving way. If the hon. Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West had listened to my question two or three

questions ago he would know that I asked what assumptions lie behind

those methodologies that created such a large difference and how we can

narrow

them.</div><a name="06050978000254"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000472"></a>John

Healey:</b> I shall take this opportunity to return to the

point that I was dealing with and the sensible questions asked by the

hon. Member for Wycombe about the reasonableness of HMRC&#146;s

approach. That is important because the question of judicial review was

raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, who

asked whether failure to provide information becomes a factor in

issuing any penalty. The reasonableness of the request may be brought

before a VAT and duties tribunal, which may then judge the matter. That

may be a more available form of challenge and legal redress than

judicial review.</div><a name="06050978000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

clause to which amendment No. 15 relates deals with the issuing of an

initial notice to a tobacco manufacturer when HMRC believes that that

manufacturer has failed to comply with its duty. The amendment would

require HMRC to establish the facts of the case with the manufacturer

before issuing any notice. Again, the amendment is unnecessary because

such a requirement is implicit in the various factors that HMRC must

consider before issuing a notice, the majority of which would benefit

fromsome serious dialogue between HMRC and the manufacturer.

The provision reflects the framework of sharing information and the

ongoing dialogue based on the memorandums of understanding within which

the clause has been created, and permits any manufacturer to place the

facts of the matter before 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div>HMRC at any time prior to the issuing of a notice. It would not be in

HMRC&#146;s interests to issue a notice without trying to establish

the facts first.</div>

<a name="06050978000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 16 would require

HMRC to state fully the grounds for any penalty notice rather than just

to state them. Again, it is clearly in HMRC&#146;s interest to state

the factors taken into consideration when issuing any penalty and any

failure to do so is likely to be looked on unfavourably in any

subsequent tribunal

proceedings.</div><a name="06050978000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 19 and 20 deal with the provision for a departmental review of a

penalty notice. That is an important stage in the safeguards for

manufacturers and the way in which HMRC manages the process. The clause

states that unless the manufacturer has been informed to the contrary

within 45 days the penalty will stand. That decision may subsequently

be contested at the VAT and duties tribunal. That is standard practice

with excise duties and I am not sure that it would make much sense to

try to make an exception in the clause. To do so would merely add

uncertainty for those organisations and manufacturers involved in

dealing with duty on tobacco products.</div>

<a name="06050978000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 21 would require

consultation with commissioners, manufacturers and other interested

parties prior to any amendments made by Treasury order. I shall say a

couple of things that I hope will reassure the hon. Member for Wycombe,

because we are discussing a proper concern about the process through

which the Government go to legislate either by primary or secondary

legislation, or by subsidiary guidance. As I think he knows, there are

well established forums for HMRC and the Government to consult, and

discuss with, manufacturers and other interested parties. They would be

used before any amendments were made to the clause.</div>

<a name="06050978000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman might not be

aware, although I have circulated copies to the Committee, that tobacco

products amendment regulations have been circulated in draft, and

manufacturers have received them. They are already the subject of

discussions with those parties and they cover aspects such as the

detailed operation of the scheme, the seizure thresholds and

information to be provided on seized products. I hope that he will take

that as an indication of our approach to the development of policy and

of any legislation that may flow from the primary clause.</div>

<a name="06050978000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the scheme is

implemented fully, we willprepare and issue guidance. Before and as we

do so, we shall consult manufacturers about it. That process is also

under way. I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman sufficient

explanation or assurance on the specific points that he was probing

with hisamendments to encourage him not to press them to a

Division. If he does so, I shall ask my hon. Friends to resist

them.</div> <a name="06050978000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

imposes a general duty on tobacco manufacturers to avoid, as far as

possible, facilitating the smuggling into the UK of cigarettes or

hand-rolling tobacco that they may have manufactured and distributed.

The measure forms a central part of the reinforced strategy to tackle

tobacco smuggling that was published on Budget day. By discussing the

amendments, we have dealt with the operation of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div>clause 2 in many respects. I stress that the legislation includes

important safeguards to avoid the manufacturer being penalised unjustly

for the actions of others or being penalised without having a chance to

take steps to control better their supply chains. Such matters lie

behind the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments.</div>

<a name="06050978000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have already talked about how

the legislation and the memorandums of understanding encourage and

foster a greater degree of dialogue between the tobacco manufacturers

and HMRC. I would be delighted if HMRC never has to raise a penalty

notice under the provisions of clause 2 and would regard the clause as

being equally successful as I would if we had to do so. If HMRC were to

raise a penalty notice, it would have to take into account a long list

of factors, which would help to provide important checks and balances.

As I have said, tobacco manufacturers will have a right to a

departmental review of any decision to impose a penalty and the right

of appeal to a VAT and duties tribunal if they are not satisfied with

the results of the review.</div>

<a name="06050978000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay tribute to the level of

co-operation that now exists with our leading manufacturers, through

the memorandums of understanding with HMRC.Tim Lord, the

chief executive of the Tobacco Manufacturers Association,

said:</div><a name="06050978000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This new

MOU demonstrates the high level of co-operation that exists between

HMRC and the tobacco companies in the UK. We hope that it will

contribute to a further reduction in the level of smuggling and so curb

the consequent damage to legitimate

business&#148;.</div><a name="06050978000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

reaction at Gallaher Group plc to the Budget strategy and the

provisions in the Finance Bill typified that level of co-operation and

the extent of the acceptance that we now need to reinforce the

memorandums of understanding with legislation.Jeff Jeffery

from Gallaher

commented:</div><a name="06050978000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

continue to support the Government&#146;s initiatives to stop tobacco

smuggling. The Government&#146;s actions to reinforce its strategy

for tackling tobacco smuggling will, we hope, result in further

reductions in the illicit trade in tobacco and

cigarettes.&#148;</div><a name="06050978000338"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

pm</div> <a name="06050978000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

discussed the provision fully with those affected and will continue to

do so as we develop the detail of the implementation process. I hope

that the hon. Member for Wycombe will regard as satisfactory my

specific comments on his amendments and not seek to press them, and

that when we come to the clause stand part debate, he and his hon.

Friends will actually support

it.</div><a name="06050978000266"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000473"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Perhaps it would be easier if I clarified the

procedure that we are now following. The amendments have been proposed

and in the course of the debate it became clear that it was difficult

to isolate remarks on the amendments from the substance of the clause,

so I incorporated the clause stand part debate into that on the

amendments. The clause stand part debate may continue and references

may be made to the amendments, although I hope that they will not be

repetitious. At the end of the debate we shall dispose of the

amendments and I shall put the question that the clause stand part

without further debate.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div><a name="06050978000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050978000474"></a><b class="B">Sir

George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): It is a

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,Mr. O&#146;Hara,

and to return to the Standing Committee on the Finance Bill after a gap

of some 10 years.</div> <a name="06050978000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

welcome any measure that deals with smuggling and indeed any that deals

with smoking. I happen to be opposed to both. I listened carefully to

the Minister, but did not hear any estimate of the impact of clause 2

on the substantial evasion of revenue listed in the background

notes&#151;the figure of some &#163;2.9 billion. That should be of

interest to any Treasury Minister. I would like to know what the impact

on that figure would be if the measures in clause 2 were

implemented.</div><a name="06050978000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

looked through the Red Book to see if it contains such an estimate.

Under the heading &#147;Budget Policy Decisions&#148; is a section

entitled &#147;Protecting Tax Revenues&#148;, which is what clause

2 does, but there is no estimate in that column of the impact of

extending the use of the memorandum of understanding. Likewise, I

looked at the text of the Red Book to see what will happen to tobacco

revenues, but the only reference to a revenue forecast that I could

find was on page 265, which

states:</div><a name="06050978000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

tobacco forecast includes an estimate of the impact of the smoking ban

on consumption in enclosed

workplaces&#148;</div><a name="06050978000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">which will

reduce receipts. However, it does not say if clause 2 would increase

receipts.</div> <a name="06050978000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be

helpful if the Minister could tell us by how much the &#163;2.9

billion loss would be reduced if clause 2 were to stand part of the

Bill. Listening to his remarks I can see that on the one hand revenue

might increase because if access to illicit tobacco is eliminated and

people have to buy through the tobacconist, there will be more revenue

for the Treasury, but on the other hand, if overall demand is reduced

and the manufacturers produce fewer cigarettes, there will of course be

less revenue.</div> <a name="06050978000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">All I

seek is an estimate of by how much the Treasury will benefit if the

measures in clause 2, which seem entirely sensible, are adopted. By how

much will the Treasury be better off? I am sure that the Treasury would

not put such a clause before the Committee unless it had made some

estimate of the benefit that would accrue to the public

Exchequer.</div><a name="06050978000273"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000475"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> May I take this opportunity to say how pleased I,

too, am to serve under your chairmanship, Mr.

O&#146;Hara?</div><a name="06050978000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

support the intention that the Government have demonstrated in clause 2

of cutting back on the smuggling of tobacco and increasing the revenue

that the Exchequer can then retain, but I am concerned about the burden

of obligations that will be placed on tobacco manufacturers. Will the

Minister make it clear that those burdens have been thought through

properly and that the language in the clause will assist tobacco

manufacturers in knowing exactly what they have to do to

comply?</div><a name="06050978000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be

difficult for tobacco manufacturers or anyone else to moderate their

behaviour to avoid someone else behaving in a criminal way, but

that

<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 38</div>is what clause 2 expects of them. Under proposed section 7A of the

Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979,</div>

<a name="06050978000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A manufacturer of

cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco shall so far as is reasonably

practicable avoid...supplying cigarettes to persons who are likely

to smuggle them into the United Kingdom&#148;</div>

<a name="06050978000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div><a name="06050978000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;supplying

cigarettes...where the nature of the circumstances of the supply

makes it likely

that&#148;</div><a name="06050978000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">smuggling will take

place.</div> <a name="06050978000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

broadly clarified the fact that the likelihood will be based on a

balance of probabilities, whether or not it is stated in the Bill, but

there remains the difficulty of what it is that a tobacco manufacturer

can reasonably be expected to anticipate in the behaviour of the person

to whom he is supplying the tobacco. That is a substantial difficulty.

In the situation described by the hon. Member for South-East

Cornwall&#151;a large gentleman and a tea chest full of

money&#151;it is pretty clear that something illicit is about to

happen. However, such situations are not faced by every tobacco

manufacturer when supplying its product.</div>

<a name="06050978000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should be some clarity

about the circumstances in which tobacco manufacturers should look to

understand their obligations. Some assistance is given under subsection

(2) of proposed section 7A.</div>

<a name="06050978000281"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000476"></a>Stephen

Hesford:</b> The hon. Gentleman misleads himself. Subsection

(2) of proposed section 7A sets out some of the things that the tobacco

manufacturers will have to consider. As has been said, this is not a

new thing. It is an ongoing process; we are including something in the

Bill that is already in train. If a manufacturer knows that the market

of a tobacco supplier who is buying huge quantities of tobacco is a

tiny home market, it will be obvious that the tobacco is being sold

elsewhere. I am not sure what point the hon. Gentleman is

making.</div>

<a name="06050978000282"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000477"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> I suspect that the hon. Gentleman may have been a

little too hasty in his intervention as I was about to deal with

subsection (2). Indeed, I had started to do so.</div>

<a name="06050978000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concede that there is some

assistance for the tobacco manufacturer, but nowhere enough. Subsection

(2) states:</div><a name="06050978000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In

particular, a manufacturer...in supplying cigarettes or

hand-rolling tobacco to persons carrying on business...shall

consider whether the size or nature of the supply suggests that the

products may be required for smuggling into the United

Kingdom&#148;.</div><a name="06050978000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a

helpful indication of the sorts of things that tobacco manufacturers

might look for. Indeed, I go further. I concede that subsection (4) of

proposed section 7A

states:</div><a name="06050978000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Commissioners may notify a manufacturer in writing that they think the

risk of smuggling into the United Kingdom is particularly great in

relation to&#148;</div><a name="06050978000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">particular

people, particular products or particular places.</div>

<a name="06050978000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause provides assistance.

My concern is that it could have been phrased the other way around. Why

should not the Government set out the sort of things that they want

manufacturers to consider, giving a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 39</div>definitive list rather than simply imposing a general obligation on

tobacco manufacturers to avoid getting into trouble with those who

might be about to smuggle the goods that they had supplied? They could

list specific things that tobacco manufacturers should avoid

doing&#151;specific ways to avoid entangling themselves&#151;and if

tobacco manufacturers failed in that, penalties should of course

follow.</div> <a name="06050978000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">That broad

obligation given in subsection (2) is not specific enough about what

precisely a tobacco manufacturer should avoid doing. As has already

been observed, the penalties for a tobacco manufacturer failing to

comply with the obligations set out in the clause can be considerable.

I ask the Minister to assist us by being a little more specific about

why the Government chose the language of this clause and did not

tighten it up.</div>

<a name="06050978000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tobacco manufacturers are being

asked to decide whether they believe it likely that products that they

supply are likely to go on to be smuggled by others. That is a very

subjective judgment. The Government require them to construct policy

statements that say, &#147;We considered the following things before

we supplied our product to the potential smuggler.&#148; Again, there

does not seem to be any aspect of the clause that indicates how to

measure whether that policy document is reasonable. What is to prevent

the manufacturer from saying, &#147;I have considered whether the

person to whom I am supplying is likely to smuggle, and I believe that

he is not likely to do so. That is my decision; I have written my

policy document in those terms and therefore I have done what I need to

do.&#148; There does not seem to be enough specificity in the clause

to make tobacco manufacturers clear about what they have to

do.</div> <a name="06050978000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the

clause provides for an appeal to the VAT and duties tribunal. It is not

clear&#151;or at least as clear as I should like it to be&#151;what

the grounds for such appeals would be. Again, I ask the Minister to

assist us by indicating in what ways appeals can be made, and the

grounds for them.</div>

<a name="06050978000290"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000478"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> It is also not clear from the clause whether the

person who will hear the appeal is to be somebody other than the person

who made the original judgment.</div>

<a name="06050978000291"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000479"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> My hon. Friend is entirely right. The clause

provides for a review of the original penalty notice to be made by the

commissioners, but it does 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div>not indicate that that review should be made by somebody other than the

author of the original penalty notice, which would be desirable in the

interests of justice. Again, the Minister may wish to assist

us.</div>

<a name="06050978000292"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000480"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I welcome you to the Chair,Mr.

O&#146;Hara, and thank the hon. Member for Wycombe for probing the

wording of the Bill. In my experience, on occasion the wording of Bills

is not as good as it should be. That is particularly important in the

case of the Finance Bill, because it does not go to the other place,

where it might be tidied up further. I know that my hon. Friend the

Financial Secretary will think that I am being pedantic, but to

demonstrate that we need to be careful about wording, I refer him to

line 24 on page 2. That sets out the facts that are to be looked at by

manufacturers as guidelines and, inter alia,

says:</div><a name="06050978000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall consider

whether the size or nature of the supply

suggests&#148;.</div><a name="06050978000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I invite my

hon. Friend to introduce an amendment on Report to change the word size

to quantity or amount, which is more elegant and more

accurate.</div>

<a name="06050978000294"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050978000481"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I was disappointed that, in responding to the

debate on the amendments, the Minister did not take the opportunity to

pick up my points about territoriality. It is increasingly clear from

this debate that the clause is directed primarily at UK-based

manufacturers; the Financial Secretary quoted from their

representatives at the beginning of the stand part debate. However, as

has also been made clear by me and others, the bulk of the smuggling

into this country is of cigarettes that have been manufactured outside

this country. I urge the Financial Secretary to address how the clauses

will work in practice against foreign-based firms. In that connection,

has any form of regulatory impact assessment been undertaken on the

impact of this sledgehammer approach on the UK firms that already

co-operate thoroughly with the Government in seeking to reduce

smuggling? It might be that, because this is my first Finance Bill, I

am not aware of the necessity or otherwise for RIAs, which are usually

made for non-financial Bills. It would be helpful if that could be

clarified.</div> <a name="06050978000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Wirral, West illustrated very precisely the nature of the

problem.</div> <a name="06050978000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
