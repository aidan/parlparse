No. 31, in page 5, line 1, after `(5A)', insert `or (5AA)'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I shall not repeat the arguments that I advanced at our previous sitting on Thursday 25 January as they are recorded in Hansard. Opposition Members are anxious to stick to the Bill's timetable, so, God willing, we shall complete our proceedings today.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): My hon. Friend may have inadvertently made a small error. We are under no commitment to end our proceedings in Committee today, although we may well do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I was not making a commitment to finish our proceedings today, just saying that I hoped that we would be able to do so.
<P>
The amendments give powers to the Assembly and, more particularly, to the Secretary of State, to extend the Children's Commissioner's remit beyond those matters that are devolved to the National Assembly for Wales to non-devolved areas that may be described as cross-border issues. At our previous sitting, I referred to several issues, including some non-devolved issues that were specifically Welsh, such as S4C, whose privatisation the Conservative party is not favour of, which we compared with the Welsh Language Board, both of which may have areas that cross over with each other, yet the Children's Commissioner will have a remit over only one of those areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Livsey </B>(Brecon and Radnorshire): One matter causes me concern. Amendments Nos. 12 and 30 would authorise the Secretary of State laying before Parliament orders to amend schedules 2A and 2B by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>adding any person to that Schedule . . . omitting any person from that Schedule . . . altering the description of any person mentioned in that Schedule.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The amendments would give the Secretary of State much power and could be seen as an attempt by the Conservative party to ensure that if, in future, the electorate returns a Government of a different colour, the Secretary of State for Wales would possess greater powers than the National Assembly with regard to the welfare of children. That is another example of the Conservative party attempting to restrict the powers of the Assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Win Griffiths (Bridgend):</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to ask a question on the issue. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond. Does the Secretary of State still have the power to make such orders? Under the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the devolution settlement, such powers would, by and large, have been passed to the National Assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livsey:</B> I have similar suspicions about the issue. We must keep a clear focus on the fact that the Children's Commissioner for Wales is accountable almost exclusively to the National Assembly. We have previously debated widening the commissioner's remit to include non-devolved issues. When the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) sums up the debate, will he clarify some of the problems involved?
<P>
The commissioner has basic powers to monitor, review and report on all matters that may affect the human rights of children in Wales. That does not conflict with the devolution settlement. The commissioner could be given powers, similar to those of the Assembly under section 33 of the Government of Wales Act, to consider and make appropriate representation about matters affecting children in Wales. I am concerned that the amendments may water down the powers of the Assembly by transferring to the Secretary of State powers that could be adequately carried out by the Assembly.
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan </B>(Cardiff, North): Like the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey), I am concerned that the amendments appear to extend the devolution settlement by putting non-devolved matters into a list, but giving powers to the Secretary of State over devolved matters. Have the official Opposition thought about the implications of such amendments? Some of them are very prescriptive. For example, if the amendments were made, the National Assembly for Wales would not be able to change the name of the Care Council for Wales without the permission of the Secretary of State. The amendments have difficult implications, which the Opposition do not seem to have not thought through completely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Before we chase the issue, which was also raised by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, this, to use the words of the current Government, is joined-up government. We are trying to extend the powers of the Children's Commissioner so that his remit extends to cross-border and non-devolved matters. Clearly, the commissioner could not derive those powers from the National Assembly, because it has no remit over such matters. The Secretary of State, however, does. To join everything up, the amendment would bring the Secretary of State into the decision-making process in adding and subtracting people from the schedule. It is simply a case of joined-up government.
<P>
<B>Ms Morgan:</B> I understand the points that the hon. Gentleman is making, but, as a consequence of the amendments, should the National Assembly for Wales wish to change the name of one of the bodies listed in the schedules, the Secretary of State would have to grant permission. That is not in the spirit of the devolution settlement.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales </B>(Mr. David Hanson): Hon. Members will not be surprised to hear that I side more with the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and my hon. Friends the Members for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) and for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan) on the amendments than with the official Opposition, so it is back to normal.
<P>
I understand that the intended effect of the amendments is, as the hon. Member for North Dorset said, to widen the range of bodies that could be included in the commissioner's jurisdiction. That would be done through the framework that the hon. Gentleman mentioned of vesting order-making powers in the Secretary of State, rather than in the Assembly. The points made by my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire are valid.
<P>
The Committee has debated at length the principle of the commissioner's jurisdiction, which falls within devolved spheres and, therefore, relates to bodies with functions in the Assembly's devolved areas of responsibility, so the order-making power proposed in the amendments to add bodies in future should be underpinned by such a principle. The amendments are not consistent with the principle of allowing the Assembly maximum discretion in secondary legislation.
<P>
Clauses 3 and 4 give the Assembly discretion to amend the list of bodies proposed in schedules 2A and 2B, but they do so in particular defined circumstances, which are essentially those that I have often mentioned in Committee. The Assembly must have a locus in the devolved or shared responsibility for those bodies. The Bill requires the Secretary of State's consent only if the relevant body is not 50 per cent. funded by the Assembly. That is an important principle, but under the Bill the Secretary of State cannot add bodies unilaterally. That chimes with the comments of my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire.
<P>
That condition echoes the condition specified in the Government of Wales Act under which the Assembly may add bodies to the Welsh Administration ombudsman's remit. The most obvious examples of such bodies will be those whose functions span both devolved and non-devolved fields of responsibility. The Secretary of State may give his consent if the funding condition is not fulfilled, but the body would still have to have functions in devolved areas of responsibility.
<P>
I accept the spirit of the amendments, which would require the Secretary of State's consent in all circumstances. As my hon. Friends said, the amendments would also allow the Secretary of State to make orders amending the schedules. Given that the Bill relates solely to Wales and bodies with functions in devolved spheres of responsibility, I accept that it would be an unacceptable interference in the Assembly's responsibility to give an order-making power to the Secretary of State over aspects that are rightly the Assembly's responsibility.
<P>
If the Assembly's spheres of responsibility are to be extended in future, the range of bodies that the Assembly could add to the commissioner's jurisdiction, with or without the Secretary of State, would be extended accordingly, reflecting the wider range of bodies coming within the devolved field. Any extension of the Assembly's functions is a matter for primary legislation, considered by the House; further transfer of functions orders; further legislation; or motions and procedures that are subject to affirmative resolution and therefore open to consideration by hon. Members.
<P>
It is important to give the Assembly flexibility to examine its spheres of responsibility and not to allow the Assembly unilaterally to stray into non-devolved spheres or allow the Secretary of State unilaterally, without reference to the House, to add functions to the Assembly. Given the comments of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and my hon. Friends, those arguments&#151;

<P>

<B>Mr. Win Griffiths:</B> Is my hon. Friend saying that, constitutionally, it would be in order for the Secretary of State to have the order-making powers provided for in the Bill, although, technically, the Government of Wales Act handed those powers over to the Assembly. What is the constitutional propriety of that? Is anything permitted in relation to an Act of Parliament, simply because we do not have a written constitution?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> If the Bill were to give the Secretary of State the powers mentioned by my hon. Friend, he could make the necessary orders. However, we must ask whether the House and the Assembly would consider that desirable; given the devolution settlement, I do not think that they would. The Assembly and the House can examine areas within their spheres of influence. If we adopted the amendments, we would give the Secretary of State greater influence over the daily running of the Assembly than is allowed under the devolution settlement.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for North Dorset will reflect on that and on the remarks made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> We are dealing with primary legislation, and it is within the House's power to legislate as it thinks fit throughout the United Kingdom. The Government of Wales Act 1998 should not act as a constraint on our powers. The areas devolved to the Assembly are not the only ones in which there is child abuse or a challenge to children's rights. Several bodies in Wales that have not been devolved to the Assembly under the Government of Wales Act 1998 should come within the remit of the Children's Commissioner.
<P>
I sensed, from some remarks, that the Act was perceived as a constitution in defiance of which we could not legislate. It is not; it is an Act of Parliament that gives devolved powers in secondary legislation and administrative matters to the Assembly. This House is the one that legislates, and it is appropriate that it should do in the interests of joined-up government. Under the Bill, the Assembly has discretion, but in relation only to devolved bodies. The Minister suggested that the Secretary of State would be involved in the list of bodies that might come under the commissioner's remit if there were certain levels of joint funding. The amendments would tidy up that process, giving order-making powers to the Secretary of State, not simply as an individual but with the consent of the House. Therefore, there would be a democratic constraint on him.
<P>
From the Minister's comments and from the tone of the interventions, I suspect that we will not win the argument at this point. However, we may readdress the matter on Report or in another place. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 3, line 10, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by members of the public'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 15, in page 3, line 12, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or of steps taken following,'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>No. 34, in clause 4, page 5, line 24, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or of steps taken following'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Walter:</B> There is a point of principle here that the Committee should discuss. Amendment No. 14 deals with clause 3(5), which is a catch-all subsection. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `An order under subsection (2) must not add to Schedule 2A a person whose sole main activity is&#151;
<P>
(a) the investigation of complaints by members of the public about the actions of any other person;'
<P>
</UL></FONT>That means that if someone else is already involved in the game, the Commissioner cannot have a role to play. I am not sure that we would intend that constraint to fall on the Commissioner. It is entirely appropriate that in certain areas of activity, when other bodies are investigating complaints, the Commissioner may like to say, ``But the manner in which you are investigating those complaints is against the best interests of the children involved,'' and may wish to comment on the complaints procedure.
<P>
Complaints by members of the public could cover a range of activities. The one that springs to mind is police activity. We have already said that we feel that the Commissioner should have a remit when children are in police custody, and when the police are investigating crimes that are alleged to have been committed by children. We do not suggest that the Commissioner should investigate those crimes, but that he should have a say in the way in which children are treated in police custody.
<P>
In order to achieve that, it is appropriate to delete the reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the investigation of complaints by members of the public'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>as amendment No. 14 would. Investigation of complaints by members of the public covers principally complaints against the police, but it could cover complaints against local government involving the ombudsman, where children are either the subject of the complaint, the complainants or witnesses to an investigation. To put that constraint on the Children's Commissioner could rule out his becoming involved. The Committee should think seriously about that. I am not entirely happy that the phrasing of our amendment will achieve the desired objective&#151;the subsection may need a fundamental rewrite to put the point across&#151;the reason for tabling the amdts, however, is to open up the discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Win Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned complaints relating to the police and to local government. In the latter case, an independently established ombudsman investigates complaints by members of the public. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Children's Commissioner should be able to investigate the ombudsman in case the latter does not do his job properly? If he is saying that about an independently established body such as the local government ombudsman, why not raise the same question about the Children's Commissioner himself? Yet that is gainsaid by the amdts. I understand about the police complaints authority, but not about independently established ombudsmen such as the one for local government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> If the local government ombudsman were looking at a specific complaint of maladministration in a local authority social services department in relation to children's services, it would not be desirable, in the interests of joined-up government, for the Children's Commissioner to be silent on the matter while the ombudsman carried out his investigation. I want to find an accommodation within the Bill whereby the Children's Commissioner would be considered by the ombudsman to be the more appropriate body to consider that kind of complaint, rather than the ombudsman himself.
<P>
The amendments are probing and are intended to tease out where the line lies in relation to complaints about children's services, children in care or children in custody, when another complaints procedure exists. To rule the Children's Commissioner out of court in relation to such an investigation of complaints by members of the public is not necessarily the appropriate way forward. I shall be interested to learn how the Minister regards the interplay between the Children's Commissioner and other bodies with a view to making sure that complaints involving children, children's services, children in care or children in custody are satisfactorily investigated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livsey:</B> The Minister needs to clarify this aspect of the Bill. I understand from what the hon. Member for North Dorset said that the amendment is probing, but it begs some questions. Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An order under subsection (2) must not add to Schedule 2A a person whose sole or main activity is&#151;
<P>
(a) the investigation of complaints by members of the public about the actions of any person''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Under the amendment, the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by members of the public''
<P>
</UL></FONT>will be removed.
<P>
That would have many ramifications if, for example, a member of the public complained to the NSPCC about what was going on in a children's home, or if Children in Wales received a complaint. I would not want a member of the public not to have the right to make such representations, and have them examined, perhaps in relation to a complaint by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which might then go to the Children's Commissioner.
<P>
Many of the amendments under consideration are of the same ilk and have the same function. Will the Minister tell the Committee how this part of the Bill should be interpreted? Amendment No. 34 would remove the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``, or of steps taken following''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Presumably, the steps taken following an investigation have been thoroughly examined, and I would have thought that one of the commissioner's functions should be to look at the effect of those steps, which should improve the way in which children are treated in a certain place, or in general. A number of issues need to be spelled out, and I hope that they will be.
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan:</B> The amendments are difficult to understand, but the hon. Member for North Dorset has said that they are not to be taken literally but are designed to explore the issues behind them. Those issues are important. They concern the relationship of the commissioner with other independent bodies that investigate complaints, and I shall be interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say about that.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The provisions that the amendments would alter were inserted by the Government with a clear purpose, which I hope to be able to explain to the Committee. Essentially, it is to prevent the commissioner from reviewing the activities of other bodies set up to deal with complaints by members of the public or to monitor investigations by such bodies. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend brought much of his ministerial experience to bear in his intervention, which highlighted the Government's concerns. There is a similar provision in schedule 9 to the Government of Wales Act relating to the Welsh administration ombudsman. The key to the Government's position is the idea that there should not be confusion between the roles of broadly similar bodies.
<P>
The amendments have several different effects. Amendment No. 14 would restrict the order-making power further by preventing bodies from being subject to review by the commissioner if their principal activity were investigation of any complaint about the actions of anyone in particular. At present the restriction relates to bodies who investigate complaints by members of the public. The amendment appears to be intended to widen the restriction to encompass a body, if such a body existed, whose role was to investigate complaints other than those of the public. I hope that Opposition Members do not want to restrict the potential in the Bill to add bodies to the commissioner's jurisdiction where it is sensible to do so.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 15 and 34 would have the opposite effect. They would narrow the existing restrictions so as not to exclude bodies whose main activity might be to follow up an investigation. However, that activity is closely associated with the remaining words of the provision, which speaks of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``supervision or review of . . . an investigation''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>It would be more sensible to retain the provision as drafted.
<P>
I hear what hon. Members have said about the amendments. In essence, our aim is to ensure that there is not confusion between the roles of similar bodies. The Welsh local government ombudsman and the Children's Commissioner, have different roles in dealing with the public. It is important to have clarity about those roles and not to involve one body in examining the concerns of another body.

<P>

<B>Mr. Win Griffiths:</B> In seeking my hon. Friend's advice and guidance, I am partly interpreting what I believe the Opposition are seeking to do, in one amendment at least. It would not be appropriate to specify the local government ombudsman in a schedule to this Bill, but if he were investigating a social services case involving child abuse, when the investigation was over and the recommendations made, would it be appropriate for the Children's Commissioner to say, ``Yes, I am pleased that this has been done. It was a good job on behalf of children.''? Or might he even say, ``Yes, this is really good&#151;and it could be improved by local government doing this, that or the other,'' simply by way of informal advice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> That would depend on the context and the issues that arose, but I cannot see any difficulty. It is important to differentiate between the roles and responsibilities of the local government ombudsman and those of the Children's Commissioner, and the amendment could cause confusion in those roles, leading to difficulties in the interpretation of the Bill compared with that of other Acts of Parliament.
<P>
I recognise that many questions that hon. Members have raised may not have been adequately answered in detail, but the Government want to emphasise that the amendments might lead to confusion&#151;and that confusion is exactly what the clarity of Bill is designed to avoid. I therefore ask the hon. Member for North Dorset to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am a little worried that our concern seems to be about administrative convenience and neatness rather than the investigation of complaints about children's services. It is central to the Bill that children are the people about whom we are concerned. We are not necessarily concerned about the niceties of whether the local government ombudsman has his empire imposed upon by the Children's Commissioner. That is something that we as politicians must sort out in drafting legislation, and ensure that it has the best possible effect on the children we seek to protect.
<P>
As I have said, the amendments seek to tease out from the Minister his response to our concern that in order to preserve the remit of, for example, the local government ombudsman or any other ombudsman or investigatory body, we are limiting the powers of the Children's Commissioner. I am not sure that that is in the best interests of children. I am not sure that our probing amendments would be sufficient to achieve that end, but we were seeking the Minister's response. We may need to revisit the subject as we proceed, and their Lordships may want to look at it in the other place.
<P>
In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

I have therefore selected the proposed amendments to part I of the schedule for discussion during this clause stand part debate. I shall be content for hon. Members to discuss part I of the schedule more widely if it will make for a more effective debate. If hon. Members wish to put any of the amendments to the schedule to the vote, they should make that known to me or to my fellow Chairman. We shall call the amendments formally when we reach that part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Evans </B>(Ribble Valley): I am grateful, Mr. Jones, for your guidance, as I am sure is the Committee. The Bill is a relatively short, and when I first looked at schedule 2A and went through the bodies mentioned in it, I wondered what connection some of them had with the Children's Commissioner for Wales. I scratched my head when I saw in the list a national park authority for a national park in Wales and the Arts Council of Wales, and wondered how the powers of the commissioner might impinge upon those various bodies, what recommendations he might make, what research or inquiries&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> It is wonderful to see the hon. Gentleman. I am delighted to give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Once again, he has not thought the matter through. For example, the Arts Council of Wales has a children's theatre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> I fully accept that when one thinks more deeply about the list it starts to make more sense. For example, why include the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales? I am not saying that children would not have an interest in those areas, but that does not readily spring to mind when we read the list of the various bodies in proposed new schedule 2A. Similarly, the Welsh Development Agency, the Welsh Language Board and the Welsh National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting are listed. Some suggest themselves more readily than others. What ties those bodies together is that the National Assembly for Wales has authority over them.
<P>
I do not wish to dwell on the issue because, as hon. Members will see, our amendments Nos. 36 to 41 and 50 to 67 list many other bodies, and I could quite easily stand here until 7 o'clock this evening saying something about each of them&#151;[Interruption.] Excitement has built up in the Committee at that prospect.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman might be willing to stay here until 7 o'clock, but I am not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> I am sure that when you have read the reports of previous Committees that have dealt with various different bodies, Mr. Jones, you will have seen that detail was included about some of them. I do not intend to repeat any previous contributions that I might have made.
<P>
There seems to be general agreement that we want to ensure that the Children's Commissioner for Wales will not be straitjacketed in any way. The Minister has told us that the commissioner's budget is limited to approximately &#163;800,000. We are told that he should concentrate on the core issues, and should not become involved in highly charged party political issues. At the same time, he will able to comment on issues outside the core areas, but in an informal way. I hope that that summation of the Children's Commissioner's role is accurate.
<P>
Our amendments would ensure that the Children's Commissioner in no way felt inhibited. We have listed a number of different bodies that suggest themselves as much as the bodies contained in proposed new schedule 2A. They do not fall within the direct powers of the National Assembly, so they are regarded as being outside the core areas. The bodies mentioned in our amendments, such as the Army Cadet Corps, the Combined Cadet Corps and so forth, are directly involved in services to children.
<P>
As for others, such as the Benefits Agency, we would not expect the Children's Commissioner to comment directly on the amount of money being given in benefits for children, but if there were any problems with the payment of benefits already announced by Government, or with the guidance to parents as to the benefits available, I would expect the commissioner to comment. He may not feel able to do that under the Bill as drafted, because the function is not a core function.
<P>
When the Government make announcements on social security matters, they can be complicated, especially if means-testing is involved, and claimants are required to fill out several pages of forms to claim the benefits. We all know that under successive Governments, some benefits have been underclaimed. Without going into the issue of fraud and overclaiming, we can agree that it would help people if forms were simplified, or if more information were made available to claimants. If the Benefits Agency were identified in the Bill, the Children's Commissioner would be able to examine the system of benefits involving children, and if he felt that the benefits could be better explained, he could get involved.
<P>
The Employment Service suggests itself readily, because children will be employed. I declare an interest in that I believe that we have paper boys and girls in our shop in Swansea&#151;we certainly did when I was a youngster. They would not fall directly within the purview of the Employment Service, but, in the light of various experiences, the commissioner may want to make recommendations. The Food Standards Agency clearly suggests itself.
<P>
The amendments also refer to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Independent Television Commission and Sianel Pedwar Cymru, which is safe in our hands. Children watch television, obviously, so the content of programmes is important. Everyone considers himself an expert and comments on that subject. It will not be a core area for the commissioner, but he may want to comment on aspects of programming or the amount of time spent by children in front of the television.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The commissioner may also want to issue guidance and make recommendations about new technology, and the content and availability of the internet in particular. We must make the Bill relevant to the 21st century. There is a digital divide, in that some people have constant access to the internet, while others have none. Children who cannot enjoy the benefits of the internet will be disadvantaged.
<P>
In addition to those bodies, we should not forget the Radio Authority&#151;radio is vital. I will not add anything to what I said about the Child Support Agency, as I have already given a lengthy disposition on the subject.
<P>
The Government should state why they feel that the Children's Commissioner's power would be sufficient without amending the Bill. I do not claim that our amendments are fully comprehensive, as other bodies might be added. The National Assembly for Wales would not be able to add bodies beyond the area for which it has responsibility without the permission of the Secretary of State for Wales. That is why we devised a list of bodies on which children's issues might impinge. We hope that the commissioner will not be constrained in that respect.

<P>

<B>Mr. Win Griffiths:</B> I hope that I do not cause any consternation to my hon. Friend the Minister in saying that I sympathise with the thrust of the amendments. I am pleased that the Opposition's concerns about the fate of children have led them to make a total reverse, or U-turn, in their attitude towards devolution. If the amendments were accepted, the role of the Assembly would be hugely expanded through the Children's Commissioner. They would also drive a cart and horses through the Government of Wales Act&#151;although, during the passage of that Act, the Opposition spent all their time trying to minimise the role of the Assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman's comments are causing consternation on the Government Benches, but they certainly are on the Opposition Benches. I have no intention of doing what he suggests. Children come first in our minds as we debate the Bill, so we want to give the commissioner power to overlook those areas that involve children. The Assembly can make whatever statements it likes on subjects that impinge on it. I hope that the annual report, which, it is recommended, should be laid before the Assembly, is laid also before the House, as I am sure that hon. Members will want to comment on services provided for children in Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman almost took up the point that I wanted to make. Given what has been said in Committee and on Second Reading, and in the light of the Government of Wales Act and the power of other Departments, it would not be appropriate to accept the amendments. Nevertheless, my hon. Friend the Minister has made it clear that the commissioner should not be constrained in commenting on anything that affects children in Wales. In an earlier debate, we also made it clear that the appropriate way to give added strength to what the commissioner says would be to channel his remarks and observations through the National Assembly. The Government of Wales Act could deal with that at an official level, through the Secretary of State for Wales into the Cabinet. If changes in primary legislation were needed, that would be the appropriate way to make them. The mechanisms are in place without having to include all those bodies in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> The debate mirrors earlier debates in Committee. Although it is important, I suspect that the amendment was tabled to initiate further debate on the subject of an exhaustive list. The Minister rejected wording, similar to that of section 33 of the Government of Wales Act, which would have been appropriate and would have included in the Bill an overarching power for the Commissioner to investigate all matters affecting children in Wales. The wording in that Act is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`may consider, and make appropriate representations about, any matter affecting Wales'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>All we need are the words ``any matter affecting children in Wales''. The Government have rejected that and I suspect that, argue as we will, there will be no change in the Bill. That is unfortunate. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Bridgend says, ``Do not be so pessimistic''. He may know more than I do, and I hope that he is right.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should address the Chair. Sedentary remarks are not recorded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Member for Bridgend knows more than I do. I hope&#151;no doubt as you do, Mr. Jones&#151;that the hon. Gentleman's qualified optimism will be rewarded later in Committee. I hope that I am in order in making those remarks.
<P>
This is the crux of the matter. All hon. Members want the commissioner to be able to deliver the necessary services on behalf of the children of Wales. The wording of section 33 would cover the issue perfectly. Plainly, there will be no movement on the amendment, because of what was said in earlier debates, but will the Minister think again about an extension in the Bill? In our debates on Tuesday last week, Labour Members&#151;especially the hon. Member for Cardiff, North&#151;said that, because of his status, the commissioner would be able to ask for information from various Departments. I come again to my honest belief that, unless it is written into the Bill, Departments will not feel under any pressure to send anything to the commissioner, least of all anything of moment or of relevance to the matter in hand.
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan:</B> My recollection of what I said in those debates is that any comment of the commissioner would be of sufficient status for it to be noticed. My reference was generally to comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but what comment will the commissioner be able to make without knowing what he is commenting on? The commissioner will be viewed as an animal of the National Assembly, so it is only devolved matters that he will be entitled to consider in any depth. The commissioner may comment on various non-devolved matters until the cows come home, but without some reference to the extension of his remit, the Bill will be just words, and nothing else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livsey:</B> I shall reinforce the argument of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), who made some pertinent points. We are discussing clause stand part as well as the amendments, which would bring almost exclusively non-devolved organisations into the remit of the Bill. They remind me of an ancient west country rhyme; they should be called the ``Old Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all'' amendments. The only things missing are references to Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer and so on.
<P>
None the less, I have some sympathy with the amendments. The organisations to which they refer are missing from the Bill. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred to amendment No. 42, which is not now before us. It was a catch-all amendment and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commissioner may make appropriate representations . . . about any matter affecting the rights or welfare of children ordinarily resident in Wales.''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The amendments make up a shopping list of various non-devolved organisations. I draw the Committee's attention to the position of the Army, junior leaders and regiments. Matters relating to them were dealt with in Wales. Indeed, matters of discipline and other unfortunate incidents were dealt with in my constituency. The Ministry of Defence has now referred such matters to Lichfield in Staffordshire, where all young soldiers, whether from Wales or elsewhere, are trained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman may or may not know that the South Wales Borderers were first established by a corps of troops from Lichfield.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livsey:</B> I shall not go too far down the road to Lichfield. The 24th Regiment was originally founded further east, but settled in Brecon, in my constituency, which is where the hon. Gentleman comes from.
<P>
What might happen to young Welsh people could happen outside Wales. Four or five years ago, there was a scandal concerning the treatment of young Welsh soldiers in Lichfield. Surely such matters would be of interest to a Children's Commissioner for Wales. If I had pushed amendment No. 42 a little further, it would have taken care of the amendments under discussion. I hope to return to the matter later in our proceedings. The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) are honourable, but they make up a shopping list of organisations. Given what the hon. Member for Bridgend said from a sedentary position, perhaps the Government may come up with an appropriate amendment, and a solution can be found to the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> We must recognise the powers that clause 3 gives the Children's Commissioner. That is the key extension of the commissioner's role. It takes the commissioner's functions way beyond those envisaged by the Care Standards Act 2000, which concerned complaints, advocacy and whistleblowing procedures&#151;important though those activities are. The clause gives scope for the commissioner, in the words of the National Assembly's report, to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``raise the profile of children's issues and take an overview of the impact of policies and procedures''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must recognise, before we discuss the amendments tabled, that the clause is extremely important in giving extra powers to the commissioner. It introduces a new power for the commissioner to review the exercise or proposed exercise of functions by the National Assembly and other bodies in Wales. The bodies listed in the schedules extend beyond those that provide direct services to children, several of which have been mentioned by Opposition Members. The clause will enable the commissioner to review the impact on children and young people of a wide range of public bodies operating in areas such as economic development, town and country planning, transport, sport and recreation, as well as more obvious areas such as education, training and health care.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The bodies listed are those with significant executive functions in Wales, within the Assembly's areas of responsibility. Before I address the amendments, I want the Committee to recognise that clause 3 and the schedule will give the new Children's Commissioner a wide, roving brief to raise the profile of children's issues across a vast sweep of the public sector in Wales. We must not forget the impact of the clause and the extra powers that it will give to the Children's Commissioner.
<P>
I have said previously, and I hope that I have made my views clear to the Committee, that the Government are sympathetic to the need to give the commissioner a wide role. The degree to which we are prepared to do that is reflected in the long list of bodies in schedules 2A and 2B. However, for the sake of clarity, I shall say again that one fundamental principle underlies the selection of those bodies, the presumption of clause 3 and our approach to the roles and responsibilities of the Children's Commissioner for Wales. That underlying principle is that the commissioner is the creation of the National Assembly, with Government support, and of the legislation that we have enabled the Assembly to enact. It is therefore right and proper that the commissioner's functions should coincide with the Assembly's areas of responsibility. I recognise what the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said in that regard, but that is the point that we have reached. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend pointed out, I have said that there are areas in which the commissioner can examine issues, as they arise, beyond that statutory role. However, it is right and proper that the commissioner's core functions should be specified in the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I listened carefully to what the Minister said about the bodies listed in the schedule being those operating in areas in which the Assembly has responsibility. One of the amendments would add the Food Standards Agency to that list. I understand that, under the Food Standards Act 1999, the agency is responsible to the National Assembly, as it is to this House and the Scottish Parliament. Would not the food that our children eat and their dietary requirements be an appropriate matter for the commissioner? Should not the Food Standards Agency therefore be added to the list?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be aware that there is a Food Standards Agency in England, and the chairman of the agency, Sir John Krebs, also has a UK responsibility. It is a joint England and Wales body, and the Assembly may, if it so wishes, add it to the list, by order, in due course. No great problems therefore exist in relation to that issue, as it falls within an area in which the Assembly has responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I want to take the Minister back to what he said, before the intervention by the hon. Member for North Dorset, about the commissioner commenting more widely on matters affecting children in Wales. Does he not agree that the last thing a commissioner will do is to stray from the strict statutory definition of his office, at least in the first few years, as he would be finding his way with the 24 bodies concerned, and the other bodies listed in schedule 2B? The commissioner will therefore be hampered in the performance of his duties in the initial few months. The Minister said more than once that he would be able to comment on things outside the strict definition of devolved matters. However, I have heard no example being given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I refer the hon. Gentleman to column 72 of the Official Report of Thursday's sitting, when I responded to the points that he made on Tuesday about the substantive difference between what is in the Bill and some of the core issues.
<P>
The substantive difference is that the commissioner should comment on core activities&#151;those that are the responsibility of the National Assembly. I must have answered the hon. Gentleman's point to the satisfaction of the Committee, because the amendment was withdrawn. The commissioner can comment on issues more broadly, but there are core functions in relation to which the commissioner must have a role and responsibility. Those functions fall within the responsibilities of the National Assembly as determined by the schedule and reinforced by clause 3, which gives additional powers to the Commissioner.
<P>
It is important to keep clear in our minds the distinction between the role of the commissioner and the role of routine child protection arrangements. I have tried to explain to the Committee that the commissioner has a role in ensuring that provisions for protecting children from abuse operate effectively. However, the office is not intended in any way to be a routine part of the regulatory regime. I emphasise that the commissioner cannot replace statutory agencies. He has a wider role in the promotion of children's interests, but is not intended to replace or duplicate those statutory agencies.
<P>
In relation to bodies listed in the amendments that have direct contact with children, such as the Prison Service and the Combined Cadet Force, controls exist that are designed to prevent abuse and harm to children within their care or responsibility, and those include the vetting of individuals. I shall take the example given by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire of the army corps based in his constituency. Having consulted the Ministry of Defence, I assure him that systems are in place to protect children and young people in the Army cadet force, the Air Training Corps and the Combined Cadet Force from abuse. For example, in the Combined Cadet Force, the head of service is responsible and ultimately accountable to the Ministry of Defence to ensure that all adult volunteers are vetted as suitable for working with children. Mechanisms are in place to examine the child protection needs within that type of service.
<P>
Similar provisions apply to many of the other bodies listed in the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley. Two of the bodies listed&#151;the Charity Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality&#151;are independent watchdogs in their own right. As was said in the previous debate, it would therefore not be appropriate for the Children's Commissioner's jurisdiction to extend to other commissioner-type bodies, even if they fell within devolved areas of responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livsey:</B> The Minister mentioned bodies operating in Wales. As we all know, people involved in such activities must be vetted. Currently, quite a large charge must be paid for that service by bodies such as the scouts. I understand that the problem has been overcome in Scotland, and that people do not have to pay for the vetting service. Has he any news on the subject in relation to Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I shall examine the matter. . The Government are deeply committed to the voluntary sector, and we recognise the important work that is done. We fully understand the anxieties that have been expressed about the difficult issue of charging a fee. The bureau is working closely with users, and we are examining the issues being raised.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will agree that despite the anxieties that have been expressed, the paramount issue is that we need to provide effective and efficient safeguard systems for the welfare of children. I hope that fees will be kept to the minimum necessary to recoup costs, and that they will be reviewed in the light of the bureau's operations in due course&#151;but we are slightly straying off the point, because such matters are currently being examined. I should like to return to the main part of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Rowe </B>(Faversham and Mid-Kent): Not only is vetting an expensive exercise for voluntary organisations, among others, but it is absolutely indispensable that the information available be of the highest possible quality. If volunteers are going to have their reputations destroyed because the records are hopeless, it will do huge and lasting damage. I understand that at the moment such records are shaky.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> We would all agree that accurate records should be available, which reflect the quality of those who work with young people. I am sure that my colleagues in the Home Office will be working towards that end.
<P>
My key point, which relates to the issues raised by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, is that mechanisms are in place, and the bureau will help those mechanisms to ensure that people who work with children and young people in the bodies listed in the amendments have the security to ensure that abuse is prevented as far as possible.
<P>
To return to the key issue, the&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Both the clause and the amendments that were tabled to it are about trying to define the role of the Children's Commissioner. I believe that the clause acts strongly to define and strengthen that role, and I have explained the differences between the amendments and the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> I can understand why the Minister wants to move off the point about fees, but we shall drag him back to it, because it is important, especially in cross-border areas. He said that he and his colleagues were examining the issue, but it is a cross-border issue, and it must be examined in Scotland, Wales and England&#151;and in Northern Ireland, too, if it applies there. I am sure that we would all like there to be no fee. Everyone agrees that the requirement for such searches is intended to protect youngsters, but in all voluntary bodies involved with youngsters, enormous pressure is placed on youngsters and parents to pay fees weekly or monthly. The charges may eat into those subscriptions, which is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Because of the focus of our debate, I shall not discuss the criminal records bureau. I worked in the voluntary sector for many years before entering the House, and the Government fully understand the anxieties that have been expressed in the voluntary sector about the difficult issue of charging a fee. Fees will be kept to the minimum necessary to recoup costs, and in due course the Government will review fees in the light of the bureau's operation.
<P>
To return to the point made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, mechanisms are already in place to examine the bodies listed in the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley, so I ask him not to press those amendments.
<P>
Clause 3 is important. It adds powers, gives strength and develops the role of the Children's Commissioner, but it does so in the context of the National Assembly's roles and responsibilities. The amendments would extend the devolution process. On reflection, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley will probably recognise that we should supply the commissioner with core functions and allow him to comment on matters outside those functions. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment to a Division; if he did so, we would have to oppose it.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> The list of bodies has been referred to as a shopping list&#151;and that is what it is. It is not the most convenient or tidiest way of introducing a wider remit into the Bill, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said. I agree with him, too, that in the first few years, the commissioner will have to concentrate on the core issues, because he will be feeling his way. It will take him a long time to bed in, so I am delighted that the post is up and running, and that he is working to make his role known to the various bodies throughout Wales.
<P>
It was never the intention of our amendments that the commissioner should replace or duplicate the powers of statutory bodies, but that he should monitor, investigate and comment upon them. We intended the commissioner to make recommendations, and the National Assembly for Wales to consider and debate his comments. If any changes were needed in primary legislation, they would go through the post-devolution procedure. Those routes are complicated and not everyone fully understands them, but I hope that comments made during the procedure would be fully heard here at Westminster. The Secretary of State for Wales should consider the commissioner's recommendations carefully, and speak at the Cabinet table. It should be part of the Secretary of State's role to listen to the Assembly and the commissioner, and if he believes that legislative time is necessary in which to protect our youngsters further, to say so.
<P>
I am sure that we will revisit those matters, because there is a consensus in the Committee that the commissioner should not be hamstrung. Each of our attempts to put something into the Bill that would give the commissioner confidence in dealing with areas outside the devolved matters has been hit back by the Minister. However, there may be other opportunities. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendments.

<P>
We do not need to labour the point of the amendment too strongly, because my hon. Friend the Minister's comments&#151;especially those made in the previous debate&#151;should reassure us that everything is being done to ensure that any statutory role for the commissioner is provided for in full. We should also be reassured that the commissioner would have a strong voice as regards other bodies that are not part of the statutory set-up for the Assembly but belong to other Government Departments.
<P>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister consider the amendment? We appreciate the broad interpretation of the commissioner's role, which allows him to do almost anything in relation to his functions, by giving advice and information, and so on. However, the commissioner's role is extended by giving the broadest possible interpretation to the Care Standards Act, and the explanatory notes state that the Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``encompasses all children in Wales and different sectors and services.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The amendment would put some flesh on a substantial skeleton, by giving the commissioner the power to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``promote understanding and awareness of the importance of the human rights of children.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>In doing that, he would be able to

<P>
(a) research;

<P>
</UL></FONT>That would give the commissioner a little bit extra power in his role as independent champion for children.
<P>
It is important to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``promote understanding and awareness of the importance of the human rights of children'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>because children have been seen as second class citizens, who do not have the same rights as adults, which has resulted in many problems in the treatment of children. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond positively, either by giving an undertaking that the commissioner can do those things, or by taking the amendment away and framing it in some other way that would be more within the spirit of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rowe:</B> I hope that among the commissioner's rights and responsibilities will be the obligation to publish his report in terms that are easily accessible to young people. A lot of young people have attended the steering group of United Kingdom Youth Parliament to establish the first Session, which will be at the end of February. That group has urged upon Ministers that White Papers and other policy documents that affect young people should be summarised or put on the web in a form that is easily accessible. I endorse that because, if they can make those documents understandable to young people, they may make them understandable to me. It would be a huge step forward if, as part of his obligations, he were charged to produce a summary report of his activities in a form that young people would find accessible.
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan:</B> The activities that are spelled out in the amendment are an important part of the commissioner's role, and it is good to highlight them.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley said that it was not obvious how the Welsh Development Agency and the Arts Council for Wales affected children. The commissioner would have an important role in educational activities and research to promote the fact that all activities have a children's dimension and affect their rights. That needs to be spelled out: it is an important part of his role. I feel strongly about the planning process that has been mentioned. When planners sit down to plan, how often do they take into account how their plans will affect children? In planning terms, how are city centres and towns in Wales geared to children? An important part of the commissioner's role is to promote the way in which children are affected by activities that do not fall within the boundaries of health and social services, such as the activities of the national parks authorities and the Sports Council for Wales. That is an important part of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I fully support the amendment. Research into children's human rights is important. Children in should be educated and encouraged to look outwards. The current excesses in the violation of children's rights worldwide is frightening&#151;torture, child abuse, sale of children, prostitution, child soldiers, children made refugees because of armed conflict, and the many thousands&#151;millions even&#151;of children dying of disease and hunger, poverty, lack of education and homelessness. All those matters are catered for in the UN charter, but are still going on, and in some places increasing. In the new millennium, we should reflect on that. In spite of the UN convention, child labour, prostitution, hunger, disease, inadequate schooling, drugs, homelessness and the curse of AIDS are increasing. We see refugee camps and children disabled by war; we need to put our house in order. The Bill is not a panacea for all ills, but a commissioner in Wales may at least contribute towards educating children in Wales about the problems of children in other countries. Hopefully, we can look towards a better prospect for children generally in terms of the environment, disease and illiteracy. We owe it to the future of humankind to show that children know exactly what is going on in the big, wide world. The amendment helps to define further the role of the commissioner to assist children in Wales and beyond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livsey:</B> My name appears on the amendment and, clearly, I support it 100 per cent. An understanding and awareness of the importance of children's human rights is vital, and we should push that further. The children's rights commissioner for the Flemish community in Belgium has specific powers in relation to the Flemish Parliament and Flemish legislation. He has a general duty to defend the rights and interests of the child.
<P>
We must remember that, as a result of the Good Friday agreement, there is a Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission that includes the rights of children. If that exists in one part of the United Kingdom there is no reason why it should not exist in another part. It is important to initiate research and educational activities in that respect so that we all understand commitment to children. Creating independent human rights institutions is a mark of a Government's commitment to creating a human rights culture and being accountable for human rights obligations. Setting limits on monitoring and reporting powers defeats the object and calls in question the commitment. The amendment will thus go some way to strengthening the Bill in an important respect.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, the never-ending series of scandals involving gross violations of children's rights dictates that there must be no compromise whatever in creating a children's champion who can be fearless and unfettered in defending children's rights and welfare. Amendment No. 43 pushes that agenda considerably in the right direction and there is a strong case for the Government to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Again, we have had useful contributions from hon. Members. In an effort to be helpful to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, the fact that we have not yet accepted amendments does not mean that our debate has not been useful. I hope that it has clarified the intentions of hon. Members, the Government, and the Assembly with regard to the role and responsibilities of the Children's Commissioner. I hope that I can reassure both my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, who moved the amendment, and other hon. Members who have spoken.
<P>
I understand that the commissioner can already provide advice and information to any person in connection with his functions by virtue of section 76(3) of the Care Standards Act. There is every reason why such advice and information should extend to the human rights of children. I can put it no more strongly than to say that such rights are central to the commissioner's role and to our role in protecting the rights of children.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Clause 2 sets out the principal aims of the commissioner. I emphasise them because they are key to today's debate. Section 72A of the Care Standards Act states: ``The principal aim of the Commissioner in exercising his functions is to safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of children to whom this Part applies.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That principal aim is a strong signal to the commissioner, and to children and community groups, that the commissioner should play a strong role in underpinning the rights of children and be central to those rights.
<P>
The way in which advice and information is delivered will be a matter for the commissioner, but I am confident that that principal aim will not leave any doubts at all that the rights of children&#151;as mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Bridgend and Cardiff, North and the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, for Faversham and Mid-Kent and for Brecon and Radnorshire&#151;are central to and at the forefront of everything the commissioner does.
<P>
The hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent made a valuable suggestion about the nature of reports and we will deal with matters relating to reports later. In due course, it will be for the Assembly to specify in regulations the requirements for reports, but I am sure that it will welcome his suggestion, and I shall certainly pass that on for its consideration.
<P>
The amendment also refers to the undertaking and commissioning of research and educational activities. The commissioner's general powers under paragraph 5 of schedule 2 to the Care Standards Act 2000 allow him to do anything that seems necessary or expedient for the purpose of, or in connection with, the exercise of his functions. They are important powers. There is also a provision under section 76 of the Act whereby the Assembly can make regulations to confer further functions on the commissioner, provided that they are in connection with his core functions.
<P>
It will be a matter for the Assembly to consider whether to make such regulations and whether to define them, given that the commissioner has the overarching power that allows him to deal with matters in connection with his functions that seem to him to be necessary and expedient. I hope that members of the Committee will be reassured that the combination of provisions under the Care Standards Act and those in clause 2 of the Bill will provide a framework within which their aspirations are fulfilled.
<P>
I wish to place on record that there is no doubt in my mind that the Government believe that, under clause 2, the commissioner can consider the issues that have been raised in Committee. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred to child soldiers, prostitution and slavery. If such issues pertain in any way to those that relate to the commissioner's core responsibilities in Wales, he will consider them. Some matters that have been raised are international issues, so there will be less scope for the commissioner to make representations about them. But let there be no doubt that the word ``rights'' in the Bill will be sufficient for the commissioner to exercise his powers accordingly. I hope that my response has satisfied my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend and that he will withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his positive contribution and for making a strong commitment to the aim of amendment No. 43. I was taken particularly by his saying that the National Assembly for Wales will in any event be able by order to include specific matters in any job description of the Children's Commissioner. Bearing that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 6, line 3, after `Children's', insert `and Youth'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: New clause 2&#151;Children's and Youth Commissioner for Wales&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `In section 72 of the Care Standards Act 2000 for the words ``Children's Commissioner for Wales'' there shall be substituted ``Children's and Youth Commissioner for Wales''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 49, in Title, page 1, after `Children's', insert `and Youth'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The amendment is interesting. It challenges the title of Children's Commissioner. Proposed new subsection (1A) of section 78 of the Care Standards Act 2000 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Regulations may provide that, for the purposes of this Part of this Act, ``child'' includes a person aged 18 or over who falls within subsection (1B).
<P>
</UL></FONT>That brings into question whether we are dealing with a Children's Commissioner or with somebody who deals with young people as well. From the definitions on page 1 it is clear that there is a wider remit.
<P>
The Care Standards Act 2000 and its interpretations suggest that the provision applies to a child. We have previously debated ``ordinarily resident in Wales.'' New subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This Part applies to a child . . . to or in respect of whom services are provided in Wales by, or on behalf of or under arrangements with, a person mentioned in Schedule 2B; or . . . to or in respect of whom regulated children's services . . . are provided''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Under the Bill, a Children's Commissioner will be responsible for services for children and young people. Our contention is that we should amend the Bill by agreeing to new clause 2 to change the title of the commissioner to the Children's and Youth Commissioner for Wales.
<P>
That may seem pedantic, but we want young people to have confidence in the commissioner, and for the commissioner to feel that his remit extends, if not to all the bodies mentioned in earlier amendments, to institutions of further and higher education. I remind the Committee of paragraphs 5,6,7 and 8 of proposed new schedule 2A to the Care Standards Act 2000. Those bodies deal not with children under any usual definition, but with young people who come within the remit of public bodies involved in education. The proposed new schedule includes the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales, which is examining 16, 17 and 18-year-olds' pay. The Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales, the Sports Council for Wales, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency as well as the Welsh National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting deal not only with children, but with youths. That wider definition should be reflected in the title of the Bill and the title of the Children's Commissioner. I lay before the Committee the proposition that we should add the words ``and Youth'' to make the title of the office that we are creating under the Bill the Children's and Youth Commissioner for Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livsey:</B> I support the amendment. Young people are sensitive about how they are described, but it is not politically incorrect to describe them as youths. If one looks, for example, at transgressions, such as young people not being paid properly in workplaces where statutory legislation has to be enforced. That can occur with the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales, with which I have dealt in the past. It must be a good thing to describe those young people as ``youth''. The same applies to what was said earlier about the services. Aspects of the services in Wales can be described as ``youth'' services; they too have rights. Amendment No. 47 is a grown-up amendment; we support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I too am unhappy with the term ``Children's Commissioner'' and agree with what has been said. It is important to consider changing the name; that would not extend the remit, nor would it impose further duties or obligations on the office of commissioner.
<P>
Hon. Members who have referred to their teenage sons or daughters as ``children'' know that that is a cardinal and unforgivable sin. I am reminded of the redoubtable actress Kathleen Turner, who was over here a few months ago acting in ``The Graduate''. I did see it, but I will not go into that now. [HON. MEMBERS: ``All of it?''] Yes&#151;but no doubt I would be straying if I were to go further down that road. Suffice it to say that she is a redoubtable actress&#151;and a tough character, they say. She was interviewed on a chat show and someone asked the innocuous question, ``Miss Turner, does anyone ever call you Kath?'' The answer was, ``Only the once.'' Similarly, calling teenage young people children is not sensible.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is entirely appropriate to look at the commissioner's title. To change it would not extend the remit; that already extends to further and higher education. People at university, at the age of 20 or 21, are by no means children.
<P>
We need to ensure that children and young people are comfortable with the commissioner and his role. People over 16 or 17 would feel unsure and unhappy about going to his department if he were known as the Children's Commissioner for Wales. This is not a back-door way of extending his remit, but a highly desirable and appropriate change of name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> As the parent of one teenager, and of two other children who are on the cusp of becoming teenagers, I concur with what the hon. Gentleman has said. There are occasional flashes of childlike qualities, and occasional flashes of growing adulthood. I recognise that when dealing with teenagers, we must all tread carefully&#151;I will say no more&#151;especially if we are absent parents on occasion, as I am , because of the demands of the House.
<P>
In general terms I sympathise with the points that have been made by hon. Members, because it is important that the Children's Commissioner be relevant to all groups that fall within his jurisdiction, and be seen by them as their champion. That goes for children of pre-school, primary or secondary school age, and for some of the children defined by the Bill who are at the older end of the commissioner's jurisdiction. He must be the champion for all children. When he takes up the post, the commissioner will need to develop a communications strategy and an understanding of the nature of the role, to ensure that that is so.
<P>
However&#151;I trust that hon. Members will accept this in the spirit in which I say it&#151;if we change the name at this stage, given the discussions that we have had to date, there may be difficulties. By statute, under the Care Standards Act, Wales already has its first Children's Commissioner designate. Peter Clarke has been appointed and is in post. All the recruitment work, the selection work, the adverts and the attendant publicity use the title ``Children's Commissioner''. That is how the office has been referred to by the National Assembly, by Parliament, by the groups involved in promoting the Bill, by hon. Members, by Assembly Members&#151;by every individual involved to date, in fact. ``Children's Commissioner'', or its equivalent, is also the title that is commonly used for all the parallel positions in the rest of Europe and elsewhere. There is therefore a global resonance to the phrase ``Children's Commissioner''.
<P>
Because of that resonance, and given the nature of the political and social discussions that we have had about the nature of the post last year and this year, in the Assembly, in the House of Commons, in Committee and in the outside world, I doubt whether the commissioner's post would be referred to as anything other than the Children's Commissioner, even if we were to change the name. That is not to say that I do not recognise the points that have been made.
<P>
Another important issue has even greater resonance. The title Children's Commissioner also links in with references in other legislation passed by this House dealing with people under the age of 18, such as the Children Act 1989. The title Children's Commissioner is therefore consistent with the general understanding of what is meant by statute in parliamentary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> But equally, it is inconsistent with all statutes dealing with higher and further education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The commissioner will cover universities and higher education only in so far as they deal with those who are under the age of 18. We have to recognise that there is a definitive split-off point at the age of 18 for the commissioner's roles and responsibilities under the legislation. I emphasise again that the title is consistent with the general understanding of the age group covered by the term ``children'' in statute.
<P>
As I said in opening my remarks&#151;this echoes what the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said&#151;I recognise that some teenagers may object to being referred to as children, but most members of the Committee will recognise that we need to have an unambiguous title that is as short as possible. Referring back to the appointments procedure for the Children's Commissioner for Wales, neither the Assembly nor the Wales Office has had any representations about the name of ``Children's Commissioner'' from any young people during consideration of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rowe:</B> I have considerable sympathy with what the Minister is saying. The business of names is difficult to resolve. However, I wonder whether the Government have ever considered looking again at the thorny problem that has been around in our society for as long as legislation has&#151;that the law alternates between the responsibilities of children, young people and adults in the most inconsequential way. We all know, for example, that people can get married at 16 but they cannot buy a drink. At some point, when Ministers have nothing else to do, they might like to consider, among other things, the opening paragraphs of the Kilbrandon report, which established children's hearings in Scotland. They would see what a wonderful portrait it paints of the anomalies at the time, and realise that, although they have changed, the anomalies remain every bit as incomprehensible now as they were then.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his suggestion, and I am sure that in due course the Government will examine some of those concerns. I am afraid that I cannot do more than soak up the suggestion this morning and reflect upon it, because there are myriad departmental responsibilities in the areas that he has mentioned. There are certainly issues that could be explored, and before he retires, there may still be opportunities for private Member's legislation on those subjects.
<P>
I return to what I was saying about having had no representations. That is important in the context of the appointment procedure for the Children's Commissioner because, as hon. Members will know, the National Assembly involved young people and children in that procedure. Many 16 and 17-year-olds were involved, and none of them commented on the fact that the word ``children'' appeared in the title. Young people themselves seem to recognise the appropriateness of using the title Children's Commissioner.
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend about using a short title that is easily recognisable and usable, and which has been accepted by young people in Wales. Does he not agree that the important point is how the commissioner operates in relation to the different age groups that come under the banner of ``children''? Will he make certain that all his communications and his efforts to reach disadvantaged children are made in a way, and in language, that recognises the whole range of ages under that banner?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I do agree. It is important for the Children's Commissioner to reach out to all children and young people within his sphere of influence.
<P>
I return to the fact that we have several issues before us: current legislation and the definition of children, the anticipation that the Children's Commissioner post has generated and the understanding of it over the past 12 months, and also the general recognition of the title Children's Commissioner on a worldwide basis. All that leads me to say that that title reflects the needs, wishes and aspirations of children generally. I sympathise with the points that have been made and, in echoing what my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North has said, I hope that the Children's Commissioner, once fully in post and with the new powers that we have given him in the Bill, will devise a strategy to ensure that all people within his jurisdiction in Wales feel that they can approach him, that he reaches out to them, and that the activities that he undertakes reflect all their needs.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for North Dorset understands where the Government stand on the issue and that, on reflection, he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I hear what the Minister says, and I am grateful for the support of other hon. Members. I suspect, however, that this may be an academic discussion because, as we saw with the Government of Wales Act 1998, giving titles to posts in the Welsh Assembly does not seem to mean that those who hold them are in any way limited to using those titles. They seem to be able to make up their own titles as they go along. The First Secretary has become the First Minister, and the other Secretaries also call themselves Ministers.
<P>
To turn to the more serious point&#151;that is not to say that renaming posts in the Welsh Assembly is not serious&#151;although my own children are well beyond being teenagers, I still refer to them as children, despite the fact that they are in their 20s. None the less, I am sure that they would have been exceedingly upset if public bodies had referred to them as children, even when they were 16, 17 or 18 years old and entering higher education. As my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent said, some anomalies are involved in that people may marry at 16 but cannot drink until they are 18, and there are various other things that they cannot do until they are 21. None the less, not necessarily during the passage of the Bill but as the Children's Commissioner starts work, we shall revisit the question of whether it would be more appropriate to call him the Children's and Youth Commissioner for Wales. In the light of what has been said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
(a) provide details of the Commissioner's work in the course of the year;
<P>
(b) provide a breakdown of the Commissioner's total expenditure for the year; and
<P>
(c) make any recommendations about the scope of the Commissioner's remit as the Commissioner may deem necessary.''.'.&#151;[Mr. Evans.]

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
New clause 1 is fairly straightforward. It would make three alterations. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commissioner shall lay a report before Parliament annually.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Much has been said about the Assembly's ability to ask the Children's Commissioner to report on various issues, and no doubt an annual report will be laid before the National Assembly for Wales. As the Committee has discussed, the commissioner may want to comment on non-devolved aspects even though they are not core issues for him, and no doubt he will do so in a report to the National Assembly. Forty Members of Parliament represent Welsh constituencies, and they all have an interest in matters affecting Wales and children, as is clear not only from this debate but from other debates on the Floor of the House. It is only right that if the commissioner wants to comment on non-devolved aspects, a report should be laid before this House.
<P>
Paragraph (c) of proposed new section 77A of the Care Standards Act refers to making
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any recommendations about the scope of the Commissioner's remit as the Commissioner may deem necessary.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>After 12 months of operating under the Bill, the Children's Commissioner may say that he feels constrained in certain areas, and he may want to make recommendations about his own powers. As primary legislation may be necessary to alter those powers, it is only right to encourage him to examine them and find out whether there is anything else that he might want to say about them.
<P>
The commissioner may comment on secondary legislation introduced in the National Assembly for Wales, and he may, as we have discussed ad nauseam, want to comment on primary legislation. He should be able to comment on any primary legislation that affects children in Wales. He may easily comment informally, but his report to Parliament would enable him to do so in a more detailed fashion. As primary legislation is introduced here, surely we should be able to examine his comments. Paragraphs (a) and (c) would enable us to do that, and paragraph (b) would provide a breakdown of the commissioner's total expenditure for the year, which would enable us to consider more carefully how money is spent.
<P>
Several members of the Committee have advanced the case for the commissioner's having extra powers. The hon. Member for Bridgend spoke about his role in education about the human rights of children, and in facilitating research on that subject, which would cost money. I assume that under his current powers, he will be able to advance research on all devolved aspects. That would cost a certain percentage of his money, and it is only right for us to have a full breakdown so that we can examine the pressures on his budget.
<P>
It would help the Treasury and the National Assembly for Wales to examine whether the Children's Commissioner would be more effective if more resources were pumped into specific areas. That would also give hon. Members an opportunity to see whether there was a lack of monitoring in some areas because of lack of money. That could certainly come out under paragraph (b). New clause 1 is straightforward and I hope that the Government will look favourably upon it. It is not radical, but it enables hon. Members to take an active interest in what the Children's Commissioner is doing, especially with regard to primary legislation, which resides at Westminster.
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan:</B> The new clause should be resisted. It is linked with previous amendments tabled by Conservative Members, and would undermine the devolution settlement. The report is the property of the National Assembly, and if the Assembly wished to take it further by channelling it to the House, that would be acceptable. The new clause undermines the principles according to which the National Assembly has created the post and set aside money from its budget to implement and operate it. If we start to interfere with the budget, that will cause difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Win Griffiths:</B> My hon. Friend has raised an important point about the annual report and the position of Members of Parliament. Is it not true that, with the systems already established, right hon. and hon. Members of this House have pretty direct access to documents published by the National Assembly, and can obtain them in much the same way as parliamentary reports?
<P>
<B>Ms Morgan:</B> Yes, we do get easy access to all reports produced by the National Assembly. Writing into the Bill that the commissioner's report should be submitted to this Parliament would undermine the way in which the system works. The Children's Commissioner should have wide-ranging powers, but his ability to comment and make representations on any powers that he has&#151;or wishes that he had&#151;should be channelled via a report to the National Assembly. The amendment should be resisted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> This is an example of rather muddled thinking. The commissioner has been set up by the National Assembly for Wales and is answerable to that Assembly. His over-arching remit is devolved matters, so how on earth can this House second-guess whether he or she did the right thing, when it has no responsibility for devolved matters? That is the first muddle.

<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman has said&#151;I sought to intervene on the hon. Lady, but she sat down before I could do so. The purpose of new clause 1, which proposes that the commissioner should lay his report before Parliament, is to establish a formal link between him and Parliament. If our Select Committee on Health, for example, wished to investigate children's services in the United Kingdom, would it not be appropriate for that Committee to investigate children's services in Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> It would be entirely appropriate, but is the hon. Gentleman saying that the only way to persuade the commissioner to appear as a witness before a Select Committee is to ask him to report directly to this House? That cannot be right, because there are hundreds of thousands of witnesses every year who are not strictly bound to report to this place.
<P>
The second bit of muddled thinking is the idea that the commissioner should provide this place with a breakdown of his total expenditure. That must be a matter for the Assembly, which should be in charge of the commissioner's office. The commissioner will report directly to the Assembly and, if there is a need for greater expenditure, the Assembly will presumably have to put the case to this House&#151;or alternatively, part of its block will have to provide for it.
<P>
Thirdly, there is muddled thinking behind paragraph (c) of the new clause, which mentions making recommendations about the scope of the commissioner's role. This House cannot have it both ways. The Assembly pressed for the post of commissioner to be set up, while this House, traditionally, showed a great deal of reticence and a lack of enthusiasm for creating that office. Now it seems that this House wants to say, ``Well, the office has been created, but make sure that the commissioner reports to us, not to those people down in Cardiff.'' That is not on; it is muddled thinking or worse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Nobody is saying that the commissioner should not report to the Assembly; that would be ludicrous. We are saying that the 40 Welsh Members in this House should have the opportunity to consider his report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Very well. What happens if Assembly Members approve the report and the Members of this House do not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> It is part of the devolution procedure&#151;as we are told time and time again&#151;that the two may not agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> That could be avoided by not reporting to this place at all. Again, that is muddled thinking. I am glad that that those two hon. Gentlemen intervened, because they are showing themselves up. I shall go on, because this debate is embarrassing those on the Conservative Front Bench.
<P>
Paragraph (c) is muddled because the machinery already exists for the legislation to be brought to this House. That is how the legislation that we are now discussing came to this House in the first place; it came from the Assembly, together with pressure from the Secretary of State for Wales. There is no need for the commissioner to plead with this House for an extension, as the machinery is already there. On three counts out of three, the new clause is not a good one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livsey:</B> I agree with the hon. Members for Cardiff, North and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. The new clause relates to accountability and functions, which were sorted out during debate on the Government of Wales Bill&#151;now the Government of Wales Act 1998. To accept the new clause would be to go backwards.
<P>
I understand that Opposition Members want information. I, too, want freedom of information, and am sure that the report will be available to everyone, as will a breakdown of the Assembly's expenditure. Those matters have been devolved to the Assembly; they have been settled, and we cannot go back into history and unscramble that. There is already a means of processing that information, and we all understand it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> It is good to see that everyone is ganging up against the Conservatives; that is always a good sign in Committee.
<P>
Paragraph 8 of schedule 2 to the Care Standards Act 2000 already provides for regulations relating to reports from the commissioner. The Assembly may shortly require the commissioner to make an annual report to the Assembly; if it made such a request, that would reflect the recommendations of its own report on the roles of the commissioner.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and for Cardiff, North, and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, that placing in the Bill a further detailed requirement for annual reports to Parliament would conflict with the Government's approach of giving maximum discretion to the Assembly, which is entirely consistent with the devolution settlement. As the hon. Member for Ribble Valley said in debate on his amendment, asking for breakdowns of the commissioner's total expenditure and making recommendations could be perceived as another attempt to reinvade Wales on the part of the Government.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Given the consistency of the devolution settlement, it would not be consistent for a report to be laid formally before Parliament, for the reasons that hon. Members have mentioned. By virtue of section 45 of the Government of Wales Act 1998, reports or statements relating
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``exclusively to matters with respect to which functions are exercised by the Assembly''
<P>
</UL></FONT>are laid before and published by the Assembly. The commissioner's financial package and report are the responsibility of the Assembly.
<P>
In the spirit of co-operation, however, which I have tried to ensure during our proceedings, I should be happy to bring to the Assembly's attention the suggestion that hon. Members might want to be included when matters are presented by the commissioner, and that reports could be made available to Parliament. It is usually the practice of other Assembly-sponsored bodies to make reports available through the Library. The Assembly might also want to consider the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley that the 40 Welsh Members might want to receive reports. Indeed, the Assembly might even send them to Conservative Members as well, none of whom represent Welsh constituencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livsey:</B> The Minister has made an important point in saying that such reports should be available. If he and fellow Members go to the Library, they will find that an enormous number of reports are available from the Scottish Parliament, but very few from the Welsh Assembly. The Assembly is run on an electronic basis, so information may be available by that means, but will he ask his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to distribute more information in a readable form to the Library? That would be of great value to us all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the Assembly puts many of its reports on the web and uses its website to promote its activities. I take the point that hard copies are welcome for research purposes and for those who do not have access to the web. However, the general practice for devolved public bodies is to make their reports available to Parliament in the Library. I am sure that that could apply to the commissioner's report, too, and I will put that request to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan), the First Minister.
<P>
I welcome the comments made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, but I want to clarify one point. The reports of the commissioner to the Assembly do not have to be approved by the Assembly. The commissioner is financially accountable, but he is independent of the Assembly; if his reports had to be approved by the Assembly or anyone else, his independence would be undermined. That argument applies, too, to the new clause. The House might have to approve the report, which would go against the commissioner's independence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley has experienced the combined efforts of the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and for Brecon and Radnorshire, and my hon. Friends. Given that, I hope that he will withdraw his new clause, recognising the superior forces in opposition to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Evans:</B> I stand before the Committee quaking in my boots at the combined forces of the coalition that my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset and I knew existed, but had not seen working before in Committee. The Minister said that it was good to see everyone attacking the Tories again and that reminded me of the glorious 18 years of the Conservative Government. It was wonderful to have such an experience in Committee, if only for a short time. However, we are only a few weeks off a general election. It was almost a cause for an X-file investigation, given the conciliatory words of the Minister, when he referred to the 40 Welsh Members of Parliament. After the general election, however, a number of Conservatives will represent Welsh constituencies, so they will receive a copy of the report, but it would be useful if it had as wide a circulation as possible.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent said that the report should be prepared in such a way that people can understand it. That is an important point. Whether it be in hard copy or on the web, the report should be prepared so that people understand the commissioner's thinking about those areas that he has monitored and the recommendations that he makes. I know that the Children's Commissioner will be reading a copy of our deliberations and I hope that he will pay due regard to the manner in which the report is brought forward.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire about the availability of some of the reports from the Welsh Assembly. It seems as though we have to go out of our way to obtain certain reports. Given that the primary legislative powers will remain here, it is important that Members of Parliament with Welsh interests and children's interests are encouraged to read the report, and one way to facilitate that might not only be to put it in the Library, but to ensure that it is sent to all Members of Parliament, as is the case with several other reports.
<P>
With the wonderful warm consensual words of the Minister still ringing in my ears, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Win Griffiths:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss new clause 4&#151;Right of access to institutions&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) In section 74(3) of the Care Standards Act 2000 (examination of cases) before paragraph (a) insert&#151;
<P>
``(a1) requiring persons to allow the Commissioner access to institutions which include children to whom this Part applies;''.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The new clauses are the result of concerns that have been raised by the Children in Wales Commissioner Campaign Group. Children in Wales has representative organisations affiliated to it in Wales, which include Save the Children, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Cymru, Barnardos Cymru, the Children's Society in Wales and representatives of professional bodies such as the Royal College of Paediatrics and the Institute of Child Health, the Wales branch. Children in Wales is a significant umbrella organisation, which combines voluntary bodies that work with children in Wales and professional organisations that care for children in Wales. As such, the two new clauses are important.
<P>
New clause 3 would remove the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or has been determined by''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from section 77(1) of the Care Standards Act 2000. It is important because the restriction on the commissioner threatens&#151;I believe, and the Children in Wales Commissioner Campaign Group believes&#151;to undermine seriously his role as a children's champion and whistleblower. The Children in Wales Commissioner Campaign Group does not want the commissioner to second guess court decisions or comment on matters that are sub judice. The group and I recognise that that would be entirely inappropriate. However, there will be circumstances in which the commissioner would need to speak out. My hon. Friend the Minister may be able to reassure me that there will be appropriate circumstances in which the commissioner might be able to refer to such matters.
<P>
Under the Bill, and according to my hon. Friend the Minister's responses so far, there is a degree of ambiguity and confusion as to the commissioner's powers to inquire into and comment on concluded criminal and other cases, including specific matters of concern raised by trial judgments and judgments arising. The restrictions under the Care Standards Act ban the commissioner from inquiring into or reporting on any matter in so far as it has been determined by a court or tribunal. I am aware of the Government's broad interpretation of the commissioner's role, as indicated by the Minister, and of their support for informal comment.
<P>
Although we appreciate that it is not a likely prospect for a decade or two, we must admit that the party in government can and does change. I am therefore taking a long-term view&#151;such a change may even be half a century ahead, in which I case I will not be around&#151;but it is right, given that this Bill can become an Act of Parliament, that we consider that distant prospect. Even when there are Governments of the same party but different Ministers, interpretations of the law can vary. It is right to take that into account, notwithstanding the supportive attitude of my hon. Friend. He has made it clear that the commissioner may comment informally on such cases, but I wonder whether that is sufficient. I know that the Children in Wales Commissioner Campaign Group believes that it is insufficient. It feels that the Children's Commissioner for Wales must be able to make informed judgments on which to base his comments. That will mean acquiring knowledge and understanding, which other bodies or persons may challenge as amounting to&#151;in the context of the Bill&#151;inquiring and reporting.
<P>
On the question of whether the commissioner is inquiring and reporting in making informal comments about cases and tribunals, even informal comments, because of the status of the Children's Commissioner's office, would have greater import and significance than those of most other individuals. That may give rise to legal challenges that such comments are, in effect, a violation of the clause. I hope that the Committee will recognise that that may put a restriction on the ability of the commissioner to initiate inquiries.
<P>
