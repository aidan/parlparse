<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): Unfortunately, I missed part of our debate on the important subject of the complaints procedure, but I have carefully read the Official Report. I am aware that the Economic Secretary has contributed to the debate, but before we hear from her again, I should like to summarise some of our objections to the Bill as drafted and to set out the reason for our amendments.
<P>
We have frequently observed that the Financial Services Authority represents a concentration of power over people's livelihoods, which may well be justified, but which needs to be offset by the ability of traders and practitioners to obtain redress when things go wrong. In any human institution, mistakes are made, and can often be made at a low level in the organisation--not under the direct or continuing control of senior managers. Such mistakes can then be compounded by obstinacy, so that traders, some of whom may be small and precariously balanced, may feel substantially disadvantaged. In a competitive market--which we are all endeavouring to create--traders of all sizes are vulnerable to the vagaries of the market. They accept that, but they cannot accept that they should also be at risk from the negligence, recklessness or oversight of the FSA, especially when they know that if it were they who made such mistakes, they would be penalised. They want the same discipline and the same rules to apply to the FSA. There should be a readily available mechanism for such mistakes to be corrected and for financial compensation to be paid in appropriate circumstances.
<P>
I should say a word or two about the importance of independence. The philosophy underlying the Bill is that no one should be regulator in his own interest. The market is not to be self-regulating; an independent body--the FSA--is being authorised by statute to regulate it. The FSA should therefore also be subject to an independent complaints authority or investigator. The Bill is deficient in that regard. Although it is true to say that when complaints are well-founded, they will end up in the hands of the investigator, it would help greatly if the investigator were more clearly seen to be independent, so that complaints would be diverted to his office automatically and he, rather than the FSA, would do the filtering. We, as Members of Parliament, all know that complaints may not be well-founded--they may be frivolous, vexatious or whatever--and we do a great deal of filtering before forwarding complaints to a Government Department, or, in some cases, the ombudsman. However, in this case, it would be better if the investigator were to perform that filtering to decide in the first instance whether a complaint merited investigation. The investigator should also be obliged to inform the complainant in due course whether action was to be taken.
<P>
I ask the Economic Secretary to reconsider whether improvements can be made to the Bill. Our amendments may be defective in a number of technical respects, but we are certain of the thrust behind them, which is that we need to bolster the perceived and actual independence of the investigator.
<P>
The FSA will operate against a background of a great deal of statutory immunity, as we shall discuss later in our proceedings. It is important to bear that in mind in the context of the amendments, because that statutory immunity could, in some cases, prevent traders and practitioners from seeking redress through the courts. That is a powerful reason for setting up an investigator who can award financial compensation.
<P>
In the Economic Secretary's response to amendment No. 9, she gave three reasons for rejecting the case for financial compensation. I am not especially convinced by any of them. Taken together, they certainly do not make the case for the status quo. First, the Economic Secretary said of possible powers to award compensation:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"That is not a feature of existing legislation and we do not see a good case for changing that".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the Government are introducing many other provisions not in existing legislation. Indeed, the whole Bill is an exercise in change. We are here this morning precisely because the status quo and the existing provisions are inadequate. Therefore, an appeal to what is in existing legislation hardly constitutes an argument.
<P>
Secondly, the Economic Secretary said of the role of the investigator as a mechanism for investigating alleged FSA shortcomings that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It should not be a route to additional redress for aggrieved firms and consumers."--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 8 July 1999; c. 83.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, it would not be a question of additional redress, because there is no redress at all at present. We want to incorporate a provision for redress, which would not duplicate existing conditions. It is true that there will be an opportunity to appeal against enforcement decisions by going to a tribunal, and in those circumstances a complaints procedure might be seen as an additional form of redress.
<P>
However, we have been advised that cases will not always be referrable to a tribunal. Decisions about enforcement could be heard by a tribunal, but other matters to do with procedure and the way in which decisions are made, which might not be referrable, would still require a means of redress. I therefore reject the Economic Secretary's assertion that we are proposing an additional mechanism.
<P>
Thirdly, the Economic Secretary referred to compensation schemes and to the ombudsman, pointing out that they will make awards to consumers. However, we are dealing not with the question of consumers, but with companies and regulated individuals. It would not be appropriate, or possible, for them to be awarded compensation or redress under those schemes or through the ombudsman. I therefore reject the third of her reasons because it is inadequate.
<P>
I return to the point that cases of negligence, incompetence or oversight could be perpetrated by the FSA, which would have serious financial consequences for regulated firms. In such cases, there is a need for financial awards.
<P>
 Of course, they should not be made automatically, but, when an investigator comes across a case of serious oversight, negligence or incompetence, he should be able to make a financial award against the FSA. Whether that award should be paid out of FSA funds or through the Treasury is a matter that we might debate elsewhere.
<P>
It is important to prevent the asymmetry whereby firms can be fined for behaviour which, if performed by the FSA, it could not be sued for or for which an investigator could not award compensation. That is wrong in principle. Our amendment would change that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I want to add a few words to the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory).
<P>
Our discussions on Thursday afternoon resulted in everyone in the Room agreeing to the view that an independent investigator is a good thing. However, if the independent investigator is to act as a safety valve on any abuse committed by the FSA--that is the role that we see for him--why do we not just cut out the middleman? Instead of complaints being referred to the authority, why do they not go directly to the independent investigator, who is seen by us all as the custodian of independence? He should take up the cases of aggrieved firms or investors.
<P>
The Bill states that complaints can still be referred to the independent investigator if the FSA decides not to take on a complaint. Therefore, we are driving at the same point. Why not do away with the authority's roles for complaints and use the independent investigator as the ultimate safety valve? That is what our amendments would do.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells made clear, the amendments do not deal with cases of gross market abuse for which the tribunal has a role. They deal with relatively minor matters, such as negligence, the authority leaving names off lists and giving wrong advice to firms that might lead to them incurring unnecessary expenditure or losing business. For such cases, the complaints procedure should involve an independent investigator as the arbiter of whether a complaint is justifiable. As my right hon. Friend said, compensation should be the counterbalance to the immunity from statutory prosecution that appears in the Bill.
<P>
I have a few questions for the Economic Secretary. She used the phrase "alleged FSA shortcomings" that the authority would refer to the independent investigator. What penalties will be involved? Without any form of compensation, all we are looking at is a metaphorical slap on the wrist about which the FSA might not be terribly concerned. Will she outline what penalties the independent investigator will be able to bring to bear if he does not have the power to award compensation? Does she believe that he will have meaningful power?
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary tell us whether an independent investigator currently exists? Has he or she been appointed and what role has he or she played until now? Or will the appointment be made only when the Bill becomes law?
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary give me examples of other agencies, quangos or authorities which respond themselves to complaints made against them? That will happen in the FSA if it is set up in the form outlined in the Bill.
<P>
I am delighted and grateful for the Economic Secretary's positive response to amendment No. 5. She has had five days in which to wrangle over its proposal to insert a six-letter word into schedule 1. Our ultimate achievement in relation to previous Finance Bills in which we have been involved has been to have a date changed from 1999 to 1998. The prospect of having a six-letter word inserted into the Bill is a reward on an altogether higher plane. Who knows, one day, we may even have a sentence added to a Bill.
 <P>
Will the Minister confirm that "prompt" is to be added to the Bill? She has agreed that it is a common-sense amendment, but accepting it would give us an enormous boost.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B>  This debate has been extremely interesting and important.
<P>
I shall begin by recapping and reminding Committee members of what the Government have already done to strengthen the investigation of complaints against the FSA and to put the complaints procedure on a statutory basis. Under insurance company arrangements, complaints may only be made against the regulator through Members of Parliament under the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967. Arrangements in schedule 1 represent a pretty significant step forward, as they strengthen the complaints system and ensure that authorised people who feel that the FSA has not treated them well have access to a proper complaints procedure.
<P>
We have responded to the concerns of the Joint Committee. For instance, it wanted to ensure that the investigator had a permanent position and a continuing role. We have done that. The Joint Committee was also anxious that the investigator should have adequate resources. We have done that, as paragraph 7(3) states that the investigator must be appointed on terms which, so far as possible,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are reasonably designed to secure ... that he will be free at all times to act independently of the Authority".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, adequate funding will be a key component in ensuring the independence that the investigator needs to do the job properly.
<P>
Last week, I told Committee members that I would be prepared to consider further whether the Treasury's power to approve the appointment of the investigator should be exercisable instead by the Lord Chancellor's Department, should Opposition Members wish to press the matter. Last week, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) said that who should appoint the investigator or approve his appointment is a fine matter. Like the hon. Gentleman, I hope that Opposition Members will accept that an argument can be made for both sides and that they will not press the matter to a vote. However, I shall certainly reflect on the issue.
<P>
Before turning to the other amendments, it may be helpful for Committee members if I draw a comparison with the existing position, which has just been mentioned by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). The Financial Services Act 1986, which--if I may say so--was passed by the previous Government, merely requires the FSA to ensure that there are effective arrangements for investigating complaints against recognised bodies underneath it, including self-regulatory organisations. In other words, under that Act, there are no requirements for the FSA to maintain arrangements for investigating complaints against itself. There are no provisions relating to the investigator's security in office, his powers to investigate complaints that the FSA has declined to investigate, consultation on the investigation arrangements, or the publication of reports concerning completed investigations.
<P>
The Banking Act 1987 has no provisions relating to complaints against the Bank of England. So we have progressed a long way from the existing arrangements under the current legislation. I hope that, despite their concerns, Opposition Members agree that we have significantly improved the position that exists under the current measure.
<P>
The arrangements in the schedule create a system of investigation for the FSA that is analogous to the ombudsman arrangements that apply to Government Departments and other public bodies--the issue raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). Members of the ombudsman scheme are expected to have satisfactory arrangements for dealing with complaints, which are to be examined externally only if the complaint is not satisfactorily resolved.
<P>
In complaints to the ombusdman regarding maladministration by Government Departments, cases can be referred only by Members of Parliament, which means in practice that the Government Department has already examined the complaint and failed to deal with it to the complainant's satisfaction. The same applies in cases to the local government ombudsman. As a constituency Member of Parliament, I know that my local authority has a procedure for dealing with complaints by dissatisfied constituents who, if they are still not happy with the outcome, will come to me and the matter will go to the local government ombudsman.
<P>
That is right and proper, as it is for the FSA to deal with its own complaints in the first instance. It would be wrong, however, if complainants were left at the mercy of the FSA and if it could dismiss their complaints, fail to investigate them adequately or refuse to investigate them at all. That will not be the case under the Bill. Schedule 1 already provides that the FSA must refer complaints to the independent investigator who will have the power to conduct a full investigation. That is made clear in paragraphs 8(2) and 8(4).
<P>
Under paragraph 8(3), the Bill requires the FSA to tell the investigator if it decides not to investigate the complaint. If the FSA decides that a complaint is manifestly ill-founded, it must nevertheless tell the investigator that it proposes to do nothing more, and the investigator can still proceed with an investigation. That is an important independent safeguard for the complainant. There is no possibility for the FSA to stop the investigator from dealing with a complaint against it if the investigator wants to proceed and the complaint falls within the terms of the scheme.
<P>
We have responded fully to the Joint Committee's suggestion that the investigator should be able to investigate cases directly, as well as those referred by the FSA itself. Furthermore, we have done that in a way that is similar to the ombudsman's arrangements, thus giving the FSA the initial responsibility as well as the opportunity to account for itself. I hope that that deals with the status of the investigator and his powers vis-a-vis the FSA. The second main point is covered by amendment No. 9, relating to the ability of the independent investigator to award financial compensation. I stress again how committed we are to ensuring that consumers and firms have a real voice in the new regulatory regime. Where appropriate, that voice is backed up by rights--to be consulted, to be listened to and, if something goes wrong, to complain.
<P>
We must also ensure that the regulatory framework allows the FSA to get on with its business effectively and efficiently without being hindered by uncertainty and the constant potential for complaints. Otherwise, the system becomes unworkable and everyone--consumers and practitioners as well as the FSA--could lose out as a result. Just as we are determined that the industry is not made uncompetitive by being tied up in red tape, so we have to ensure that the regulator is not tied up in red tape or hindered by a constant prospect of claims for damages and compensation.
<P>
At this stage I do not wish to anticipate, even in response to the right hon. Member for Wells and the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, the forthcoming debate on statutory immunity. During that debate, we shall explain our belief--with which the Joint Committee agreed--that an appropriate degree of statutory immunity is essential.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that the complaints system must be a counterpart to statutory immunity. That is right, but it must not be a contradiction to statutory immunity. Whether in relation to compensation for complaints or damages for negligence, the FSA needs to be protected from actions that could otherwise undermine its ability to regulate in an open and effective way. People may well be upset by being regulated and prefer to get on with their business wholly unhindered, but we cannot set up a system that encourages them to take constant pot-shots at the FSA. The FSA would constantly be looking over its shoulder, and would be subject to the threat of claims that could undermine its administration and operation.
<P>
As I have said, the complaints mechanism is designed to ensure the open and transparent investigation of any alleged shortcomings in the FSA's administration. It is not designed to provide additional recompense for firms and consumers. The tribunal will make provision for regulated persons, and the ombudsman and the compensation scheme will make provision for consumers.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I apologise to the Economic Secretary--I had to slip out for a moment during her speech, and I may have missed something.
<P>
Will it be possible for an independent financial adviser, for example, to receive financial compensation through a tribunal? The Economic Secretary made a fair point about the real dangers of undermining immunity. However, barristers and solicitors--I declare an interest as a barrister--have to put up with people who seek compensation through compensation or disciplinary schemes. Such cases involve individuals, but here we are dealing with the might of the state. Provided that the figures were carefully controlled and there were suitable gatekeepers, would such a prospect be too frightening to consider?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for making that point, and I shall deal shortly with circumstances similar to those that he described during last week's debate. However, and without excessively anticipating our debate, I want to stress that statutory immunity will not apply where allegations are made that the FSA has acted in bad faith or breached the Human Rights Act 1998. Depending on the facts, such cases might result in successful action for damages. Nevertheless, I recognise that, in some circumstances, the tribunal, the ombudsman or the compensation scheme may not be the most appropriate way forward for authorised persons and consumers. In such cases, the appropriate recourse would be to complain to the independent investigator, which is why we have set up the system.
<P>
I understand why hon. Members believe that, in principle, there is no reason why the FSA should be precluded from making ex gratia payments when it feels that to do so is right. I am sure that we all hope that complaints will be few and far between. If they are, the question of payments may never arise. However, we do not always live in an ideal world, and there is the risk that the regulator may inadvertently get something wrong. In circumstances where, in fairness, the FSA felt it appropriate to make an ex gratia payment, I hope that it would consider doing so. I believe that the FSA is keen to have the ability to make ex gratia payments from its own resources in appropriate circumstances.
<P>
Committee members will be aware that the FSA will consult on the proposed complaints arrangements later this summer. The forthcoming consultation document might cover the question of ex gratia payments and the associated discretion, and, in particular, the circumstances in which it might be necessary to make an ex gratia payment. I am sure that Labour Members want those matters to be considered.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is the Economic Secretary aware of any ex gratia payments that have been made to date?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As I said, there is currently not an independent complaints procedure against the FSA--it applies only to the self-regulating bodies. In relation to those bodies, I am not aware of any ex gratia payments that have been made, but I shall double check on that matter for the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I should stress that, by definition, the decision to make an ex gratia payment will be a matter for the FSA board. The circumstances in which it might want to consider making an ex gratia payment might be similar to those that were described last week by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), and they might involve the case of a small adviser whose name had erroneously fallen off the register and who had suffered a real loss as a result.
<P>
We should not establish a system in which the FSA was obliged to make payments. That might attract inappropriate and ill-founded complaints; it would be likely to distract the regulator and the investigator and to tie them up with red tape, and it might bring about all of the dangers that we sought to avoid by establishing statutory immunity. The Joint Committee supported us in that regard. The associated risk would undermine the system of effective but light-touch regulation that we all support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): The Economic Secretary said a moment ago that there was always a risk that the regulator would get something wrong and that we must make provision for that possibility. We are concerned about that and about the need for an incentive structure to discourage the regulator from getting something wrong. If the Government concede that ex gratia payments may be appropriate in principle, I do not understand why they are not prepared to use that mechanism in a structure that could act as a counterweight to the FSAI s urge to investigate. There may be a gross imbalance between the FSA's powers--it has to protect its back by investigating every concern--and the fact that there are few pressures to prevent it from proceeding with investigations that could knock small people out of business.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> First, I stress that there is a significant difference between allowing ex gratia payments in situations that we all hope will be extremely rare--someone might suffer through no fault of their own, perhaps as a result of carelessness or an unfortunate accident in the FSA--and establishing a statutory compensation system that would in effect allow actions to be brought against the FSA, although statutory immunity would otherwise prevent that. In that case, the compensation scheme might destroy the role of statutory immunity, which I believe most, if not all, Committee members understand and accept the need for.
<P>
Secondly, our proposed arrangements for accountability mean that the FSA has real incentives to run itself fairly and effectively. In relation to the complaints system, we have an independent investigator with the necessary resources who can investigate even those complaints that the FSA believes are ill-founded or which it has investigated and found wanting. The investigator will publish the report of his investigation; that should not be lightly dismissed because it is precisely the power that the Parliamentary and local government ombudsmen have in respect of Government Departments and other public bodies. There will be a discretionary power to make ex gratia payments but should the FSA board consistently fail to ensure that complaints are investigated, fail to respond properly to the independent investigator's reports or persistently make mistakes that give rise to complaints which are upheld by the independent investigator, the board's accountability to the Treasury and Treasury Ministers, and thus to Parliament, will come into play.
<P>
The FSA will not operate in secret; the existence of the independent investigator will assist in ensuring that an effective searchlight is put upon the operation of the FSA, which will have to respond. If the board shows a persistent reluctance to sort out deficiencies in its own procedures, we will take the necessary action.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Economic Secretary, reasonably, recognises that there may be circumstances in which it would be fair to make payment and she is saying that the FSA wants the power to do so ex gratia. I empathise with the Minister's reluctance to give away too much, too soon because of the fear of damaging the immunity system, but I ask the Minister, her officials and the FSA to reflect further on the matter. It could be organised in a way that would not tie the FSA in red tape. It would benefit not only independent financial advisers in the circumstances that I have described, but the system as a whole to have a transparent, clear-cut way of gaining proportionate compensation that does not force people into human rights cases, which, after all, can lead to compensation.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I said at a previous sitting that I would readily accept the spirit of the Opposition amendment on the issue of "prompt", and I shall deal with that before I respond to the right hon. and learned Gentleman.
<P>
I regret to say that the Parliamentary draftsman is immensely busy and overworked and I have not yet had his advice on whether the word "prompt" will do the trick or whether something else is required. However, I assure the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that we will introduce an amendment on the subject; I am sure that he will be satisfied with it, but if he can suggest a sentence that is as good as ours we will consider it with equal sympathy.
<P>
I am aware of the difficulty involved in the regulator having to regulate the one-person operation--the small independent financial adviser who may lose his or her business and his or her house if the business collapses--right through to the most enormous, billion-dollar global multinational financial services firm. In the light of the FSA's consultation on the complaints system, including its further deliberations on the issue of ex gratia payments, I am happy to give the Committee an undertaking that I will reflect further an whether anything more could or should be done to allay hon. Members' concerns. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the Economic Secretary giving way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I have finished speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In that case, this will be a speech rather than a intervention.
<P>
Amendment No. 9 does not oblige the investigator to make compensation awards; it merely empowers him to do so. If I understood the Minister correctly, she is proposing the same arrangement by back-door, unspecified methods. What she described could only work on the basis of the FSA acting on the advice of the investigator. In other words, if someone comes before the investigator and his business has clearly been quite unfairly damaged by a careless mistake, the investigator will tell the FSA that the case is just and will recommend that it makes an ex gratia award to compensate for what has happened to the business.
<P>
Is it so much better to have that back-door, unclear, untransparent approach to the issue than our proposal, which is extremely clear cut but does not breach the whole issue of statutory immunity? It does not propose setting up an automatic compensation scheme; it merely makes the investigator's position public and transparent as opposed to opaque and behind closed doors, which appears to be the only way in which the Minister's suggestions could be put into action.
<P>
This harks back to previous amendments. One objective of regulation is to require transparency in the private and financial services sector; indeed, transparency is one of the biggest protectors which of the public at large. It is therefore strange that whenever it comes to something a little difficult for the FSA, instead of going for transparency, we have to have sleight-of-hand, back-door methods of achieving what is clearly just and fair. I do not see how implementing our proposal via the back door can be a better way of achieving it than our front-door method.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary sought to reassure the Committee that the investigator would be independent and that that was provided for in the Bill. Our amendment builds on those assurances and makes them more explicit. It is not a radical departure from what the Government propose, but it provides an additional safeguard and an important public assertion of the independence of that office.
<P>
The more the Government try to explain their case about compensation, the more we are convinced that the present proposals are flawed. The Economic Secretary said that a compensation scheme would threaten to tie up the FSA in additional bureaucracy and red tape which it is anxious to avoid. We agree about the need to avoid needless form-filling and paper shuffling, but investigations will be carried out anyway by the investigator. The paper will flow, the files will be open and the investigations will be made.
<P>
We seek to ensure that at the end of that process, in certain cases the investigator will be empowered to award compensation. That itself does not add any red tape or bureaucracy. As the Bill stands, however culpable, the FSA is found to be in an individual case, and however much a trader or small firm has suffered, the investigator is unable to award compensation. That is wrong.
<P>
The Economic Secretary rightly linked the whole subject to that of statutory immunity, which we look forward to debating. She pointed out that as things stand, the FSA has no immunity against certain actions, such as when it is failing to act in good faith. Surely it is better that all matters are tackled and corrected without the need to go to law. That is bureaucratic and expensive: a complaints scheme is a better alternative.
<P>
Other matters may fall short of bad faith, but could be damaging. For example, if the FSA were negligent or failed to correct a mistake, a trader might suffer severe damage. The agency would be immune at law, but if an individual firm behaved in such a way, it would be fined. We are asking for equality of treatment.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Economic Secretary advanced the concept of a new system of ex gratia payments. That is helpful to a limited extent, but it would be entirely at the discretion of the FSA. The Minister went on to say that she did not want to make it compulsory because an obligation on the FSA to make payments might attract ill-founded complaints. It would be for the investigator to reject ill-founded or frivolous complaints. That filter would provide a safeguard against ill-founded complaints bombarding the FSA. However, if the complaints were well-founded and had caused damage, the investigator should be empowered to make a financial award against the FSA. Otherwise, we may find ourselves in a dangerous and informal situation in which the FSA, if it is found to be guilty of something that falls short of acting in bad faith but, nevertheless, has caused financial damage, may be told by the investigator in a hole-in-corner way, "The game's up. This is serious and if I were you I would make an ex gratia payment." The FSA might graciously respond, but that would not be justice, transparency or fairness. We want the investigator to be empowered in the way that I suggested.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that she might be able to concede something in due course and that she would reflect further on the matter. That is helpful and we shall ask her to deliver on that in due course, but we shall press the matter to a vote to make clear our concerns about the matter and our request to the Government. That is the spirit in which we shall divide the Committee.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall quickly go through the gist of the Opposition amendments, which relate to what should appear in the FSA's annual report. Amendment No. 13 would require a reference to general duties to appear in the annual report. Amendment No. 14 deals with the transparency of compliance costs and the incremental costs of the regulations that will be made under the Bill. Amendment No. 15 deals with the cumulative costs of the compliance costs and, as proposed by the Joint Committee, amendment No. 16 would require that the investigator's work should be a feature of the annual report. Amendment No. 30 seeks to ensure that penalties and fines are mentioned in the report.
<P>
The annual report is an important document. The FSA published the report for 1998-99 just last week and it is a fairly weighty document. However, it is with the quality rather than the quantity that I am most concerned. The report will be the benchmark by which the FSA will be judged annually and by which the authority will bare itself to the financial community so that it can be judged on whether it has performed its duties properly. It will have to account for the words that appear in black and white--and even in colour--in the report. Therefore, it is important that the Committee ties down minimum requirements for the contents of the report.
<P>
This year's report contains many charts and figures and much information. I congratulate the FSA on producing such a report in a turbulent, transitional time. However, Conservative Members need to be assured that at least as much, if not more, information will be readily available in future reports. The report and accounts are the best way of providing that.
<P>
This year's annual report was accompanied by a press release in which the FSA lists subjects, figures and accounts that it proposes to include in future annual reports. For example, the press release mentions statutory objectives and the extent to which regulatory objectives are met. There will be a section on major policy decisions taken in the previous year and others on the FSA's exercise of its rule making powers, on the consultations that have taken place over the year, on cost-benefit analysis policy and practice, on major regulatory issues and other detailed information. I am glad to see that there will be information on complaints too. The FSA has rightly recognised the vital need for a great deal of information to be contained in its annual accounts.
<P>
Many aspects of our amendments have already been agreed to in principle by the FSA. It is only right and proper that the Bill ensures that there is no backsliding in future--if, for example, the FSA regards it as inconvenient to be forthcoming with information that should be provided to the investing community. In those circumstances, the FSA must be forced to produce it. It is unacceptable to produce information one year but not the following year. If there is a gap, comparisons will be difficult.
<P>
There are some weaknesses in the FSA's press release proposals. As I mentioned, the fifth proposed main content of the report deals with cost-benefit analysis. The FSA proposes to provide an account of cost-benefit analysis policy and practice, but providing an account of cost-benefit analysis policy is a different kettle of fish from providing cost-benefit analysis, which would show information on the cost-benefits of the various rules and regulations introduced in the previous year.
<P>
That is where we take issue with the proposals because we want actual amounts to be specified in figures. It should be made plain for everyone to see exactly how the calculations were made in order to make an objective judgment about the benefits of the FSA's cost-benefit analysis. That is important because it would show the financial services industry whether the FSA is providing value for money. We want to ensure that the FSA has teeth, but also that it uses those teeth effectively and efficiently without tying up the industry in red tape with a concomitant lack of security for the consumer.
<P>
Proper cost-benefit analysis is also important because it shows overseas competitors that the United Kingdom is a good place to come and do business. At the same time, as we debated last week, it would put pressure on the FSA to keep costs down, even if a competition and competitiveness requirement is not built into the objectives, as proposed by Opposition Members last week.
<P>
The press release proposes in paragraph 13 that the FSA should provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an assessment of the regulatory burdens and compliance costs of UK markets compared with overseas jurisdictions and changes over the year in question."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome that, and we debated it long and hard in the Joint Committee, which wanted full transparency of information on cost-benefit analysis in a world, as well as a UK, context. We all know that there is a sparsity of information about whether financial service communities in individual markets in different countries provide good value.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) many times mentioned the goodly Dr. Willis from Australia. His report of 1995 was cited as a great audit of the cost-effectiveness of regulation throughout the world. That report was published four years ago and was based on information that was a few years old then. It is long since time for an update. In conversations with us, Howard Davies agreed that it would be useful to conduct another detailed analysis, perhaps led by the FSA, into the cost-effectiveness of various markets around the world. It should also consider the extent to which the regulatory burden is a disincentive for outside bodies to enter our country to do business or for domestic bodies to stay in our markets rather than go abroad.
<P>
We all know that the biggest fear for many is the problem of regulatory arbitrage. In the City of London there are more than 500 foreign banks which, with little more upheaval than the flick of an electronic switch, can decide to do business in specific markets in New York, Geneva, Zurich, Frankfurt, Buenos Aires or wherever they want. We should be constantly aware of that problem of regulatory arbitrage and of what might happen if we pile up our financial services with too much red tape and too many costs.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am slightly at a loss as to why the Economic Secretary has not adopted the Joint Committee's suggestions, which are enshrined in our amendments.
<P>
When the Treasury Ministers were under scrutiny by the Joint Committee and others, they repeatedly laboured the point that cost-benefit analysis is an important principle when applied to the FSA's regulation of the financial services industry. It is no good bringing in a whole raft of new rules or making the rule book as big as possible, just for the sake of it, unless those rules are beneficial and have cost benefits, so that gains are not outweighed by the additional costs of regulation which, as we know, may ultimately fall on the consumer of financial products.
<P>
The regulatory impact assessment relating to the FSA contains some interesting details. I am almost surprised at the amount of information that will be available in the regulatory impact report, especially in relation to incremental costs. The report is an important document, and I hope that all members of the Committee have read it. Under the title, "Non-recurring costs", the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The FSA estimates its transitional costs, including establishing the single complaints-handling and compensation schemes--"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is rather mystifying, as the regulatory impact assessment envisages a compensation scheme, even though we have just ruled against such a scheme. Will the Economic Secretary tell us to which compensation schemes the report alludes?
<P>
The report estimates the FSA's transitional costs
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to be approximately £15 million".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is equivalent to slightly less than 10 per cent. of the current value of its mainstream regulatory activity costs.
<P>
"Non-recurring costs" contains a section on what extra costs are likely. It even gives an illustration, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"To illustrate the possible one-off transitional costs, it is plausible to assume that it would be equivalent to 5 per cent. of the existing annual compliance costs for firms and groups currently regulated by one body and by 10 per cent. for those regulated by more than one body."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 The report gives an example for a typical securities firm, which assumes an average incremental compliance cost of £110,000 per annum.
<P>
I welcome the report. However, the detail about possible extra charges falling on firms is almost dangerous because it shows that an enormous amount of information is available. So it is no good the Government saying, "Well, getting this cost-benefit analysis and figures and producing an annual report has involved an awful lot of costs."
<P>
That is simply not the case. If the FSA is doing what it says it will do in relation to preparing cost-benefit analyses for each of its rules and regulations, we are proposing little more than a drawing-together of readily available information. It is not difficult or costly to bring that information together in the annual report.
<P>
The regulatory impact assessment contains a section entitled "Benefits to businesses and consumers", which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Combining the existing regulators should produce economies of scale, making regulation more cost-effective and producing savings in compliance costs and regulatory fees. As a significant proportion of firms, incremental costs relate to their reporting to and maintaining relationships with regulators, it is expected that the percentage saving for firms regulated by several regulators will be greater than for other firms".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I very much hope that that is so, as that was one of the strengths on which the FSA was sold to us. We were told that nine self-regulating bodies would be brought together, so there would be economies of scale. That has not happened yet: there are 1,850 people, and the FSA wants to house more than 2,000 in its building.
<P>
However, the regulatory impact assessment promises that costs will come down. It states that there will be one-off costs, but that, ultimately, costs to the payers of fees, to the users of financial services and players in the financial services market will be reduced. The Opposition welcome that. We want the FSA to make sure that it carries that out so we want to see the proof in the annual report. That is what the amendments are all about. It is not just a matter of the cost advantage of working in the UK, there is the respectability gain that the FSA supposedly brings. The City of London, Edinburgh, or wherever it may be in the UK, will be not only cost-effective but clean places to do business. We need to balance those two considerations.
<P>
That takes in the meat of amendment No. 14. On the basis that all this information is available--we want it distilled down into usable form in the annual report--it is also reasonable, as amendment No. 15 proposes, to have those figures produced on a cumulative basis. Any normal annual report and accounts for a company will produce a five-year track record of its profits and earnings. It is particularly important for the cost-benefit analysis of regulation costs to have a cumulative cost analysis too. Many one-off start-up costs will hopefully drop out after the first year or so.
<P>
Many regulations that are in force at present or are coming into force will be effectively sunset regulations. In other words, they will last for only a limited period. Therefore the cost of those regulations that no longer apply to companies after two, three, four or five years will also drop out of the equation. As time goes on and the FSA gets even better at its jobs, there will be further economies of scale and we will see how the penalty and fine, offset against prescription fees, are working. The costs should come down.
<P>
We need to see not only the additional costs of regulation and compliance on an annual basis for the annual report, but how they compare with previous years. What we want to see on the graph after that is a gradually reducing line of regulation and costs if the FSA is doing its job properly and if the industry is reacting to that properly too.
<P>
The amendments are concerned with transparency of information. It is information that is readily available in some of the documents that I have just quoted. It must continue to be readily available through such documents if we are to be assured that the FSA is doing its job properly, as we hope it will, and if it is to assure the City and the financial services industry it regulates that the job is being carried out for the good of the industry and the consumer rather than for the sustainability and good of the FSA itself.
<P>
I turn now to amendments Nos. 16 and 30. If we can have all that information on the cost factor, to give credibility to the way the investigator has to work, we must see a full account of his work. That is even more the case since the Government are reluctant to accept our amendments which would have gold-plated his independent status and accord with the Joint Committee's proposals. The penalties and fining record over the year reported needs to be fully transparent.
<P>
That transparency is needed first, so that we can be assured that the FSA has not had a bout of megalomania and started fining everyone left, right and centre; secondly, so that it can be put in a several-year context and questions can be asked such as, "Why is it that one year the fines collected appear to be 50 per cent higher or lower than the year before? What change in policy or circumstances was there to justify that?" and thirdly, so that the industry can see how much was raised in penalties and fines and, in a transparent and up-front manner, can check whether it is really getting the kickback of the rebate and that the penalties and fines do not further line the coffers of Canary Wharf.
<P>
These are straightforward amendments which would improve the appearance of the annual report and make it more convincing. That is not a lot to ask; it would not require new information, but merely draw together existing information. The amendments would improve the Bill and I ask the Committee to accept them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has done full justice to our amendments on cost efficiency.
<P>
I want to make a brief point on amendments Nos. 13, 30 and 16. The FSA's annual report will address most of the issues and it has already announced its intention to broaden the range of matters that will be included.
<P>
However, we want to know why the matters on which it is required to report, as set out in schedule 1, are so narrow. It is the opposite of a transparent approach. In particular, clause 13 focuses on the rate of--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For the sake of clarity, I point out that when the hon. Gentleman talks about clause 13, he means amendment No. 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
Amendment No. 13 focuses on the regulatory objectives. We have debated at length the interplay between regulatory objectives and principles, and discussed whether some of the principles should be objectives. Clause 2 sets out the authority's general duties and it is nonsense that it is required to report on the regulatory objectives without reporting on the principles on which they hang. The Government were keen to stress that the FSA regarded its principles just as importantly as its objectives, so let us get them in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 30, which refers to the operation of the penalties scheme and the size of penalties, is crucial. It is desirable for the public and the industry to know what is going on in that respect and such information should not be suppressed. It should be in the Bill as an item on which the FSA is obliged to report. I believe that it will want to do so. <P>
Amendment No. 16, which would add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the work of the independent investigator",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
proposes a crucial element of liberty within the system. It would focus on occasions when the FSA acted negligently and potentially caused damage to businesses. In the interests of transparency, the FSA should be required to report on issues that arise under that heading.
<P>
Later in the Bill there is the issue of the FSA's consultations with the consumer and practitioner panels. Why is there not a requirement to report on what constructive dialogue has taken place? No doubt the answer will be that what is in the Bill is a minimum requirement, and the FSA has the freedom to branch out as it sees fit. It is unsatisfactory that the Government and the draftsmen did not make clear in the Bill the key issues that should be in the report as a matter of law. Such issues should be listed and we want to include the matters covered by the amendments. I do not see how the Government and the FSA can object, given that the FSA has said that it will cover such issues in future reports.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I should like to make a brief contribution on the annual report and on additional compliance costs.
<P>
It is helpful that the schedule sets out what annual reports should cover, but it does that in extremely general terms. Paragraph 10(i) merely refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) the discharge of its functions;
<P>
(b) the extent to which, in its opinion, the regulatory objectives have been met".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister emphasised that lightness of touch is an important part of regulation, and lightness of touch and cost compliance go hand in hand.
<P>
The amendments would ensure that the public and the industry know more fully from the annual report how effective the operation of the FSA has been. It might be possible to sharpen the amendments' drafting, but they focus on the need to keep the burden of any change proportionate to the benefit. I am sure that the Minister and the FSA would accept that in principle, and it is not asking much for the Bill to point out specifically the importance of the FSA achieving its aims on compliance costs. That would enable the industry and the public to know what the annual and cumulative costs of changes have turned out to be. It is also entirely sensible that something on the work of the independent regulator and on the operation of the penalty scheme should appear in the report.
<P>
There is nothing entirely novel about the scheme that the amendments propose. During my years in the House, we have continually and sensibly required plcs and other companies with limited liability to put extra information about their activities in annual reports. In particular, we have asked them to include information to which the public at large can be expected to be sensitive. We are asking for the annual report of the greatest regulatory body in our system to be focused on sensible matters that are undoubtedly important to the industry. We are not asking the Minister to give away a great deal. I would not expect any Minister to deny that it would be thoroughly sensible for an annual report to provide such information. However, it is not a habit of human nature to be enormously transparent about information if it does not provide exactly the answer that one had hoped to give.
<P>
It is easy for compliance costs to build up sharply. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made the fair point that if they grow too fast, the popularity of the City of London may be rapidly affected. It will be of comfort to those in the City to know that the authority must bear in mind such cumulative costs on an on-going basis, and must report on them in its annual report. I hope that we will receive a favourable wind from the Minister when she replies.
<P>
<B>Mr Tyrie:</B> The need for our amendments stems partly from the fact that when we debated the regulatory objectives, we concluded that competition should not be one of them. If competition and competitiveness had been included as a regulatory objective, the compliance costs on those regulated--especially the comparative international cost of regulation--would inevitably have been included in the annual report. The FSA could not report on whether it was complying with the objective of competition and competitiveness without drawing attention to international comparative compliance costs. It is a matter of great regret that we did not make the amendments that we discussed at our previous sitting. In a sense, with these amendments, we are trying to patch up a fundamental flaw that will be left in the Bill, unless the Minister and the Government are prepared to reconsider the paramount importance of competition and competitiveness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham ably introduced this group of amendments. I shall not go over the ground that he covered, except to reinforce his point about the mobility of the markets in question. We have made that point in other debates, but it cannot be too strongly emphasised that many transactions supervised by the FSA take place on a computer screen--we may almost say that they take place in cyberspace. The question of location is therefore already confused. We must ensure that the people operating the system and designing and selling the products are, so far as possible, located in this country, contributing to our tax revenues and employing our people. Because the market is ultra-competitive, it is sensitive and can be easily upset. Excessive costs, imposed for whatever reason, may drive the whole structure to other jurisdictions that are willing and able to receive it.
<P>
We are discussing costs that are borne not by fat cat shareholders or international investors but by ordinary savers. Independent financial advisers have repeatedly made the point to me--they must also have made it to the Treasury--that if we are to persuade savers, especially those on low incomes, to seek financial advice, we must not raise the price of such advice. Time spent filling in forms and complying with regulatory requirements is all unproductive time, and must be recovered from fees charged or the cost of products sold.
<P>
I hope that it is a common aim of the Committee to keep costs down. Costs are of two sorts: direct fees charged to firms by the FSA and indirect compliance costs, which can so easily mount up. We have noticed that it is unfortunately a European disease to unload costs from Government onto the productive sector of national economies. That has the tragic long-term consequence that investment increasingly takes place outside the European Union. Fortunately, in some respects we benefit from that, because we have caught the disease in a much milder form, but that needs to be watched. Competitiveness, especially international competitiveness, is not a state but an activity. It must be constantly worked at, and we must always be vigilant. That is why it is essential that the FSA, a rule making body, should measure, assess and report on the costs that it imposes, both on the regulated community and on the wider saving and investing public.
<P>
Firms already complain that their compliance officers are more numerous and that they have to do more work. Firms of all sizes have to seek legal advice that is becoming more expensive; they have to complete more forms and hold more interviews with their regulators; they also allege that they spend a great deal of time explaining their business to the regulator's staff. To some extent it is inevitable that firms will complain about unproductive costs. However, in many cases, it is a valid criticism that we have not erected a countervailing force against this regulatory burden. One way in which we might rectify that would be to require openness and transparency by putting an explicit requirement into law for the FSA to report on these matters.
<P>
I shall attempt to categorise the costs. There would be the normal continuing costs that a regulated firm might incur, and also the exceptional costs that they might face as a result of a big change, perhaps to a rule book. If the FSA were to bring out a new rule book covering new products, that would be a new burden.
<P>
The FSA could minimise costs by consulting properly and in plenty of time, or, perhaps, by giving pre-clearance to firms wondering whether to launch a new product or activity. There are many ways in which those compliance costs could be ameliorated. The FSA would be most likely to do that if it faced, at an annual general meeting, or in the publication of an annual report, a requirement to explain not only what individual costs were, but how they had built up cumulatively and, crucially, how they compared with those of competitor jurisdictions in other countries.
<P>
I hope that the Government are sympathetic to those points; they have certainly made encouraging noises in the past. In their response to the Joint Committee, they accepted that the FSA should report on those matters. They said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is understood that the FSA intends to cover both consumer awareness initiatives and comparative compliance costs amongst the matters covered in its annual reports"<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
They go on to say that if the FSA were to fall down on that intention, the Treasury would use its reserve powers. If all that is true, why was the provision not incorporated in the Bill? That would have sent a message to the market that the FSA and the Government were taking the matter seriously, because it would have been enshrined in an Act of Parliament, and could only have been changed by means of another Act of Parliament. If we are all moving in the same direction, let us crystallise that in the Bill.
<P>
I look forward to receiving the Minister's assurances about her intentions. However, we will require some very good arguments as to why the provision should not be on the face of the Bill, if we are not to press the amendment to a vote.

Given the warmth of the weather at the moment, perhaps we should conduct all our business out there in cyberspace, to save us the inconvenience of having to work in this humidity.
<P>
I am sure that all Committee members agree that the annual report is a vital part of the accountability structure for the new regulator. That was emphasised by the Joint Committee. Paragraph (10) of schedule 1 sets out the requirements on the FSA to produce an annual report. The FSA is required to report on the discharge of its functions, on the extent to which the regulatory objectives have been met and on such other matters as the Treasury may direct. That is important because, as the right hon. Member for Wells said, the Treasury has a reserve power in that context.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The FSA must also accompany its report with the report of the non-executive committee and with such other reports or information, including reports by third parties such as the auditor's report, as the Treasury may direct.
<P>
The statutory requirements for the FSA's reports are deliberately set at a high level of generality. We do not believe that including an extensive statutory list of items would be advantageous--rather, it might be a recipe for inflexibility. We have had an interesting argument this morning and last week, and there is a significant difference between the Government and the Opposition about the extent to which the matter should be dealt with in legislation and about what powers the Treasury should have.
<P>
The current provisions do not require the FSA to report on its consideration of the factors that are mentioned in clause 2(3), which are commonly referred to as "principles". We think that that should be remedied, which amendment No. 45 will do.
<P>
Amendment No. 13 would require the FSA to report on its general duties. The FSA is already required to report on the extent to which objectives have been met, and on the discharge of its functions. It therefore seems that the only additional requirement in amendment No. 13 involves a reference to the factors that are in clause 2(3). As I said, that will be dealt with by amendment No. 45.
<P>
 I understand the intention that lies behind amendment No. 13, and I hope that Opposition Members agree, at least to some extent, that the matter is best dealt with in amendment No. 45. 
<P>
Our discussion this morning focused on the detailed contents of the report, that are dealt with in amendments Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 30.
<P>
On 6 July, the FSA published a list of contents for the annual reports that will be published after the Bill's enactment. That list was agreed with the Treasury. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham--I believe that I have given the full name of his constituency--
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Well done.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman says, "Well done." He and I represent constituencies whose names include two places, and we believe that it is important to give a constituency's full name.
<P>
The list of contents will contain the information that is necessary to allow interested parties to hold the FSA to account for its activities during the year in question. In particular, the report will publish an assessment of the regulatory burdens and compliance costs of UK markets, compared with overseas jurisdictions, and changes during the year in question. I shall refer to that in more detail later. It will publish information on complaints against the FSA that have been passed to the independent complaints commissioner and on FSA responses to reports by the independent complaints commissioner. It will publish an account of its enforcement actions, including fines, costs and significant judgments by the tribunal.
<P>
We have sought to address all the concerns that the amendments raise. I agree that such information ought to be contained in the annual report, but, as I said, with regard to flexibility, I am not convinced that setting out detailed, statutory contents would be beneficial or desirable.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am most grateful to the Financial Secretary. Is she saying that, in respect of the matters covered in clause 2(3), Government amendment No. 45 covers all the points raised in our amendment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No I am not saying that.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Could she then explain what points are not covered?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Government amendment No. 45 covers the regulatory principles. As I understand the arguments and comments of the right hon. and learned Gentleman and other Opposition Committee members, they are trying to enshrine in the Bill matters with which the FSA has said it will deal, as its press release will make clear. We agree that those matters are important and we expect them to be included in the annual report, but we are not convinced that they need to be enshrined in statute. I want further to elaborate on that, because reference has been made to regulatory burdens, compliance costs and the comparison between UK and overseas markets, which, I agree, are important areas. Such comparisons are useful and we are all committed to the continuation and pre-eminence of the UK markets, but we do not believe that it is necessary or desirable to describe future flexibility in detail.
<P>
On the issue raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, the Bill will require the FSA to have regard to burdens as well as benefits.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I apologise for pressing the Financial Secretary on this matter, but she again referred to flexibility, which has been used as an argument against adding the extra words. However, I cannot see how requiring specific matters to be dealt with would reduce flexibility. The amendment would not prevent anything else from happening; it would simply point up areas that she described as extremely important in her previous speech. Can she explain why she is against it?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes, but I shall do so as I go along.
<P>
We are at the beginning of a process. The Opposition have come up with a list of items that they want enshrined in the Bill, and no member of the Committee would disagree with their importance. However, as the Bill progresses and the FSA continues its work, other areas may come to light that it should deal with in its annual report. As was said, the Treasury has a reserve power. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire made the comparison with public companies, which are required to include various matters in their annual reports. The difference is that in that case changes would have to made to the Companies Act 1985, which rules about what must be included in annual reports. That does not apply to the Bill because of the reserve powers of the Treasury.
<P>
I was talking about the requirement of the FSA to have regard to burdens as well as benefits. The Bill backs us up with a specific requirement to do a cost benefit analysis in consulting on the rules under clause 125. The FSA would be expected to explain in its annual report how it meets its obligations. Exactly how it does that is a matter for the board, but I am sure that it will want to take careful note of suggestions made by hon. Members. That illustrates the usefulness of our debate.
<P>
Reference was made to the cumulative burdens of compliance costs and regulatory measures. We agree with the FSA that it should provide an estimate of the regulatory burdens and compliance costs of the UK market in comparison with overseas jurisdictions, which should also take into account changes during the year in question. The FSA will certainly reflect on the most useful way of presenting that information.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked about compensation schemes in the regulatory impact assessment--particularly to a scheme for compensating investors who lose money when a firm goes into default. The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) referred to our previous debates on competitiveness and competition. I can tell him that the existing competitiveness principle has a pervasive impact on FSA activities. Let me reassure him that there is no question about the links between costs and competitiveness, which must also be considered in the report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Is it the Minister's understanding that paragraph 10 would require the FSA to report on competition and competitiveness, even though it is not covered by the phrase "regulatory objectives"? Would it still have to be contained in the annual report?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that, because Government amendment No. 45 deals with that problem: reporting on regulatory principles will be covered.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister is trying to be helpful, but I am not clear about what she believes will be achieved by Government amendment No. 45, which requires matters in section 2(3) to be covered by the annual report? She hesitated to answer me when I asked whether it would achieve what our amendments are intended to achieve. I did not receive a clear answer. I appreciate that she may wish to reflect on that, while officials behind her provide some guidance, but it would help the Committee if she could clarify it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I can assist the right hon. and learned Gentleman, who may have misunderstood the issue. Government amendment No. 45 would build into the Bill the requirement for the FSA to deal in its annual report with the regulatory principles. As drafted, the schedule requires the FSA to report on the objectives in its annual report. So we have made provision to include the regulatory principles, thus dealing with the matter raised by the hon. Member for Chichester.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other Opposition amendments would require the FSA to include in the Bill several matters that the FSA will report on anyway.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Clause 2(3)(e) requires that the authority have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the international character of financial services and markets and the desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom".
<P>
How will the annual report illuminate that topic, unless it provides the information that would be required in our amendments?
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the spirit in which the Opposition amendments were tabled. However, I am sure that the FSA will examine such matters in its report.
<P>
The FSA may report in many other ways on the subjects mentioned by Opposition Members and on many others. I am sure that it will do that as it develops.
<P>
Our debate illustrates the Government's approach. As my right hon. and hon. Friends said, we will have a light regulatory touch. That is why we are making provision for the minimum that needs to be done. However, as the FSA develops, it may deal with other matters in its annual report, as has been clearly evidenced by what it has already said and done. The Government will have the power to specify further matters to be included in the report, should that become necessary.
<P>
Government amendment No. 45 clarifies that all the FSA's functions and duties are covered. However, we differ from the Opposition--although not significantly --on which details should be spelt out. The Bill and our amendment make provision for all the FSA functions and duties to be covered. I therefore ask my hon. Friends to support the Government amendment and to oppose the Opposition amendments, should they be put to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Government amendment No. 45 contains the phrase:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"its consideration of the matters mentioned in section 2(3)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister clarify whether that puts the same burden of responsibility on the FSA to show that the principles had been met as paragraph 10(b) to schedule 1 does in relation to the regulatory objectives?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes. When we considered the issue and it became clear that there was an anomaly, we tabled Government amendment No. 45. We have not created a hierarchy. Regulatory principles are important and we expect the FSA to deal with them in its annual reports.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I wish to respond to this short debate. However, I am no more reassured at the end of it than I was at the beginning. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells summed it up when he said that we all seem to be moving in the same direction. We agree that the information that we want to see in the reports is valuable and it is accepted that the reports should be as transparent as possible. The Minister described the annual  report  as a vital part of the accountability structure of the new authority. That is right and that is why I congratulated the FSA on its recent report and the amount of information in it.
<P>
I also congratulated the FSA on its press release. I was surprised by how much detail that it proposed to go into and by how much detail appeared in the accompanying regulatory impact assessment that was published with the Bill. The provision of such detail is a good thing, so why cannot we all agree that such suggestions should be enshrined in the Bill? The FSA should be obliged to provide such information.
<P>
The Minister said that the amendments would not be advantageous, but a recipe for inflexibility in the future. I do not buy that argument. What would she like the FSA to flex out of--to coin a phrase--in future? Under what circumstances in two or three years' time, does she think it would be appropriate for the FSA to decide not to include a full round-up of cost-benefit analysis of the new regulations that it has introduced and for it not to make an international comparison of the additional costs? That would be undesirable for the financial community. It would not have access to the information that showed whether the FSA was carrying out its work cost effectively or whether it was bringing in regulations that were justified in terms of a cost-benefit analysis. That might put the financial community at a disadvantage when compared with its foreign competitors.
<P>
From the evidence of the press release that accompanied this year's annual report, the FSA is, on the face of it, very upfront and it is keen and willing to provide a great deal of information. It acknowledges that such information would be useful if it were included in the annual  report. The Minister has said time and again that the FSA is volunteering the information, but that proves that the FSA acknowledges that it is necessary and desirable information. Therefore, let us put a minimum benchmark in the Bill to detail the information that must be provided in the future. That would provide additional comfort to the financial community, which feels that it will be regulated by an enormously powerful organisation. Our job is to go out of our way to demonstrate the accountability and fairness of the authority. That point must be paramount in our deliberations.
<P>
The Joint Committee discussed the issue long and hard and we reached an agreement. Paragraph 54 of the Joint Committee report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We recommend that the FSA's Annual Report should address the regulatory burdens and compliance costs of UK markets compared with overseas jurisdictions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what the amendments would achieve in black-and-white and numerical terms. It is significant that the Labour members of the Joint Committee who are also members of this Committee have not piped up in defence of that paragraph in the joint  report. It was unanimously agreed and there was no great controversy about it. However, when it comes to a different scenario and Labour Members are under the cudgel of a Whip, if that is the right phrase, they immediately become mutes or decide to toe the line. That is unfortunate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): Silence should not be taken as assent to the Opposition's proposal, but as acceptance of the Government's argument. Flexibility demands that the requirements should not be written in stone. Although they are universally agreed now, there could be changes as time goes on. Putting them in secondary legislation subsequently allows scope for change if needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I hear the hon. Gentleman and I am glad that he has made a contribution. I just do not understand why, when after long and detailed consideration the Joint Committee decided that the sort of information that these amendments would require should be contained in the annual report, the hon. Gentleman should suddenly decide that we do not need that degree of detail and that flexibility, whatever that means, should be the order of the day.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): Let me correct the hon. Gentleman. The Joint Committee said that this should be in the annual report and all the news is that it will be. However, it did not say that it should be in the Bill, which is what the hon. Gentleman is arguing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Indeed, but there is no guarantee that the information will be in the annual report unless we stipulate that in the legislation. That is the whole point of the amendment. Just as in our last debate, we agree that it is a good thing and we want to make sure that it remains a good thing by placing obligations on the FSA to deliver it.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman </B>(Erewash): The hon. Gentleman says that there is no guarantee that it will be in the annual report, yet the Government's response to the report reads
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If the FSA decided not to include in its annual report the issues referred to by the Committee, the Government would not hesitate to use its reserve powers accordingly. We believe that the Committee's concerns have therefore been met."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Certainly it is an essential part of the report; we agreed that in Committee. We are arguing this morning about the ways and means that are central to the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The hon. Lady makes the point that I was just about to come on to. Everything is being quietly sidelined to this great reassurance that the Treasury has reserve powers. In future years another Minister may have a different interpretation. The flexibility for future years that the hon. Lady has often mentioned may lead the Treasury Minister to decide that it would not be appropriate to exercise those reserve powers to ensure that the FSA brought forward the sort of information that we and the Joint Committee agreed is desirable. It is entirely in the power of the Treasury Minister to decide that that is no longer the case. There is no guarantee. As with far too much legislation, we have to rely on the good sense, intention and virtue of the Treasury Minister at the time to exercise reserve powers about which we will have no control if this is not put in the Bill at the outset.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> When the hon. Gentleman says that there will be no guarantee that this information will be in the annual report in future, does he not accept that keeping the regulatory cost burden low is of paramount importance? That is recognised and stated frequently. Does he really think that this information that is essential to the health and wellbeing of the financial services would be withdrawn?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> There is no guarantee that that will not be the case next week, let alone next year or in a future Labour Administration. I do not agree that the overriding consideration of Members on both sides of the Committee is to keep the cost burden low. Although that is desirable, with it must go quality assurance. In many cases, one has to pay for quality. A foreign investor, a bank, for example, coming to London or Edinburgh to do business needs to be assured that the regulatory burdens are not excessive and that the cost of those burdens is as low as possible. Investors should know that there is an advantage in coming to London because the people who do business there tend to play by the rules. They believe in the old Stock Exchange maxim, "My word is my bond", whatever that may mean in the modern business context.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The arguments advanced by Labour Members boil down to a faint assurance that the Treasury will come rushing forth on its white charger when the FSA suddenly says, "We don't want to put that in this year." Only the minimum benchmarks, principles and objectives are required, which are open to different interpretations. To have to rely on the 7th Cavalry in the form of the Treasury using reserve powers is not good enough. Intentions and circumstances change, especially in view of the flexibility that the Minister mentioned so many times.
<P>
Our proposals would not be an overriding burden; there are no unreasonable requests. As I said earlier, our intention is to make the Bill more worthwhile, credible and acceptable to the many sceptics in the financial services industry who feel that they are suffering as a result of over-regulation. The best defence against 121 122 over-regulation is availability of information and transparency. The amendments would result in fully transparent and easily produced information on costs, on a long-term basis, perhaps over five years, not just a snapshot now. Artificial costs are being thrown up now because everything is coming together; there are new staff dealing with a new rule book. We need the Minister's assurance that the costs involved in the regulatory impact assessment will be one-off costs; they must not recur incrementally in future years and thus become part of the wallpaper.
<P>
I am more determined than I was at the start of the debate to promote the amendments, which are purely about accountability and providing information. Those two principles must be at the heart of the Bill. I cannot understand why Labour Members want to deny that sort of information to the financial community and put in its place a rather feeble assurance, not a guarantee, that the Treasury will come riding to the rescue if the FSA decides that it is not in its interests, or convenient, to produce the information in a future year.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I shall be brief. I apologise for allowing my phone to make an improper noise earlier.
<P>
I reinforce the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham because they will arise time and again in Committee. All members of the Committee should understand what we are talking about.
<P>
The Minister was helpful in accepting that the points we made were important. She confidently hopes that the matters that we raised will be dealt with in the annual report. She relies upon Treasury directions, FSA press releases and something called Treasury reserve powers to see that they will be dealt with, but there is nothing in the Bill to ensure that they will. The hon. Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman) stood up in good faith and agreed that she favoured the paramount importance--those are strong words--of keeping regulatory costs low. That is exactly the focus of the amendments. The hon. Lady was under the impression that the matter was adequately covered in the Bill. It is fair to say that the Bill gives enormous enabling powers to meet an overall common objective, but it is a serious problem with modern legislation that less and less of it has statutory force.
<P>
We are discussing the general question of compliance costs in an international context, which all members of the Committee, including the Ministers, agree is of great importance--some members of the Committee have said that it is of paramount importance--yet there is resistance to finding a way of requiring the annual report to deal openly and transparently with that in the Bill. We are falling back on promises and hopes. I can foresee the Minister's comments being quoted in a judicial review at great expense some years hence. I urge the Financial Secretary not instantly to give way in toto, but to reflect on whether we can put more of these important matters firmly in the Bill. Careful drafting will be required and it cannot be ideal to make individual amendments to the schedule at this point--the Minister rightly said that we are at an early stage of the legislative process--but if she would undertake to consider ways of putting in the Bill the fact that the law of the United Kingdom reflects the common intention of this Committee, we will have taken a step forward. At present we have not taken that step.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> On a point of order. On reflection, following the Financial Secretary's comments, I do not want to move amendment No. 13, but I want to press amendments Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 30.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has already moved amendment No. 13, so he will have to withdraw it. I did not hear what he said about the further amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> On reflection, Mr. Atkinson, I want to withdraw amendment No. 13, but to press amendments Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 30 to a vote.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The view of the Chair is that amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are closely related, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman will press only one of them to a vote, followed by amendments Nos. 16 and 30 if he so wishes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall take your advice, Mr. Atkinson, and press amendment No. 14 but allow amendment No. 15 to lapse.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Members should bear in mind that they may speak as often as they wish during a debate on a group of amendments, but the usual procedure in Committee is that an hon. Member moves an amendment, hon. Members speak to it, the Minister responds, and the hon. Member who moved it makes a short winding-up speech. If hon. Members wish to speak a second time, the record becomes difficult to follow by people outside and prolongs our proceedings, perhaps unnecessarily.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> We have tried to make clear in our deliberations our desire to ensure that there are adequate measures in the Bill to make the FSA properly accountable, including to consumers and practitioners. The annual report and annual meeting are important elements in the accountability package. I would not be chancing my arm too far to say that I am sure that that view is shared by all members of the Committee.
<P>
I am sure that we shall hear from the hon. Member for Chichester on amendment No. 18 and I am sure that it is well intentioned. I assume that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends seek to ensure that the meeting is well publicised by imposing on the FSA an obligation to contact all authorised persons. To satisfy the obligations imposed by paragraph 11 of the schedule the FSA will have to take reasonable steps to publicise details of the meeting well in advance. It would also require the FSA to do so in way which would be likely to bring the meeting to the attention of those who might be interested in attending.

The Schedule leaves it to the FSA to decide who the relevant people are and how notice might be given to them. In our view, that is a sensible approach. We are concerned that amendment No. 18 could be taken to mean that notice should be given only to authorised persons, which might cast doubt over what should be done for consumers, or whether they should be able to be represented at all. However, I am sure that was not the amendment's intention. Moreover, giving personal notifications to all authorised persons could prove quite expensive, compared with other options such as publicity via the internet or the press.
<P>
Cyberspace was mentioned this morning, and that facility is also available. Given our shared concerns about controlling regulatory costs, the FSA should be left to decide on the most cost-effective method of publicity.
<P>
The Government tabled amendments Nos. 58 and 59 in response to amendment No. 17, which was tabled by the Opposition but which has been withdrawn. The purpose of amendments Nos. 58 and 59 is the same as that of amendment No. 17--they will ensure that the FSA makes arrangements to hold its annual public meeting soon after the annual report is published, so that it can be discussed while the report's subject matter is still fresh. That is an excellent and eminently sensible suggestion. Imposing a three-month time limit from the report's publication is a valuable improvement to the arrangements. In view of the functions and powers that will be conferred on the FSA, accountability is important.
<P>
We have already discussed some of the accountability arrangements. Clearly, the annual report--which will have to comply with the requirements of schedule 1, which we have just discussed, and with the relevant requirements in the Companies Acts--will be an important part of that accountability package.
<P>
There are other relevant measures, such as the accountability of the FSA to Treasury Ministers. The consumer and practitioner panels, the requirements to consult and to issue cost--benefit analysis on rules all add further to the safeguards relating to the way in which the FSA will perform its duties.
<P>
The Government added the requirement to hold the annual public meeting after an earlier draft of the Bill was put out for consultation last July. I make no secret of the fact that the idea was put to us by people who responded to that consultation paper, including the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers.
<P>
I hope that that puts our proposals in context. We are considering a complex, detailed and technical matter, but it is important to get the legislation right. That is why we should have full discussions in the House and with the wider interested community. We have made it clear that we are keen to debate the Bill in a non-partisan manner and that we are open to constructive suggestions. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said earlier that the possibility of accepting a whole sentence may not be excluded from future consideration. However, on a serious note, we welcomed the original idea that was put forward, and we also welcome the further improvements that we are able to make as a result of the suggestions made by Opposition Members. In that spirit, I am happy to acknowledge the constructive suggestions that we have been able to take on board.
<P>
The annual meeting, open to both consumers and practitioners, is seen as a valuable addition to the other accountability measures. It will give people a chance to air their views and to seek direct responses from the board of the FSA. In effect, it will deliver something similar to a shareholders' annual meeting. It will give all stakeholders a chance to be engaged with the board, and enable them to express their views and to hear the views of other stakeholders. It will also provide a test for the validity of the statements made in the annual report.
<P>
It would be unrealistic to expect all members of the regulated community and its customers to attend. However, I hope that substantial numbers will seize the opportunity to attend from time to time, and to voice their opinions. It will give them a chance to say what the FSA is doing right, as well as what they think that it is doing wrong. It will give both sides, the industry and its customers--although one should perhaps not speak of sides--the chance to air their views. Both have a strong interest in the effectiveness and the costs of regulation and both will have a valuable role to play in shaping future policy.
<P>
We are grateful to Opposition Members for making the useful suggestion that the meeting should be held within three months of the publication of the annual report. That adds weight to the importance that the Government attach to these arrangements. I am pleased to inform the Committee that the chairman, Howard Davies, has also shown considerable enthusiasm for holding a meeting of this kind. I therefore propose the Government amendments for consideration by the Committee.

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> We have a little cameo of information there, showing that Howard Davies is keen on allowing annual meetings so that people can find out what he is doing. That is revealing, because the Bill will confer on him a more powerful position within a major institution than any post-war legislation has conferred on anyone else. I am pleased that he is in favour, as we are, of having an annual meeting.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 seeks to add four words to the Bill. Four words for the hon. Member for Chichester is a lot more than the one word that the Minister is prepared to give to my county colleague, the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Rivalry. I hope that I am not creating the politics of envy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend's one word is much more powerful than my four.
<P>
We have debated the importance of the annual report. It is important that everyone can see that the FSA is discharging its duties properly. Amendment No. 13 dealt with that issue. It is also important that everyone can see that the compliance costs on those regulated are placed in an international context, a matter dealt with in other amendments. The issue of international regulatory arbitrage is essential.
<P>
We now need to put the annual public meeting on the face of the Bill, partly as a response to consultation, and partly to ensure that every aspect of people's likely concerns will be available to public view. According to my understanding of the schedule, the Government intend to provide a good deal of information. The five amendments that we have discussed during the past hour would further increase the transparency of the FSA's activities. I am pleased that Government amendments Nos. 58 and 59 propose to add some detail. The Government appear to display a spirit of openness, but I worry that the Bill's clauses and paragraphs are directed towards reporting to the Treasury. Paragraph 10(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"At least once a year the Authority must make a report to the Treasury".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, what we really want is reporting to the wider public and the financial community as a whole. The FSA should be answerable not merely to the Treasury but to everyone who has an interest. Amendment No. 18 has been tabled with that in mind, and is designed to ensure the maximum possible awareness of the annual meeting on the part of interested parties.
<P>
As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire pointed out about an hour ago, it is in the nature of things that people who arrange annual meetings should want to minimise the amount of information that they provide. We have heard that Howard Davies is not currently adopting that train of thought, but it is an ever-present instinct among those who organise such meetings that the provision of information might cause only trouble. Having spent some time in the Treasury, I can assure the Financial Secretary that awkward matters can arise to which the Treasury--or another body such as the FSA--might not want the media to pay too much attention. For that reason, the amendments would tease out detail and require its inclusion in the FSA's annual report.
<P>
The best way to ensure the provision of maximum information is to maximise the number of people who know about the meeting. As Justice Brandeis said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Sunlight is the best disinfectant."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We need to use the annual report as a form of sunlight. Amendment No. 18 would ensure that a little extra sunlight was shed on the workings of the FSA by requiring that every authorised person--the phrase, "authorised person" refers to firms, not members of the public--is notified of the meeting.
<P>
There is a case for further addition. The Government may argue that the amendment is too restrictive, and that there should he an obligation to notify interested consumers and members of the public by advertising annual meetings in newspapers. Certainly, that should be considered, but in the meantime, I urge the Government to accept the amendment. It would provide the best possible protection against incompetence and over-regulation by bringing the fresh air of publicity to annual meetings. I cannot see why the Government should take exception to it, although the Financial Secretary raised a couple of minor objections a moment ago. She said that the FSA is required to take reasonable steps to notify people about the meeting. However, why should we rely on the FSA's taking reasonable steps, or on assurances that Howard Davies will interpret such steps in a suitable way? Is not it more logical and reasonable to include the requirement to notify all authorised persons in the Bill, thereby ensuring that such people have the opportunity to make their points?
