<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Linda Perham </B>(Ilford, North): On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. I should like to refer to the Committee's sitting on 22 February, during which the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) referred to me in my absence. That was a case of mistaken identity. It was not me but the hon. Member for Romford (Mrs. Gordon) speaking in the Chamber earlier that day who claimed that the Conservatives were a bunch of sad people. [Hon. Members: "True."] That became the quote of the day in The Daily Telegraph the following day. While I may not disagree with that view, I was not in the Chamber at that time.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also castigated me for being absent from the Committee that afternoon. I was away, with permission, on an armed forces parliamentary scheme visit, in which the hon. Gentleman has also taken part. I would like him to withdraw those remarks and to apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): Further to that point of order, I apologise to the hon. Lady for those remarks. She is quite right to say that that was the case of mistaken identity. I make no comment other than to apologise absolutely, and to withdraw those remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. During the Committee's fifth sitting, the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs set out some helpful figures regarding the numbers of staff to be employed by the new combined authority. After that sitting, the Minister sent a letter to all members of the Committee setting out the new figures that he should have announced to the Committee. I do not intend to make a big issue out of this, but it is important for the record to be correct, because people will otherwise rely on the figures that appear in Hansard. The Minister's letter of 24 February states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The figures on Ofgem staffing are, I fear, more complex than I led the Committee to believe.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it will be seen that Ofgem is currently projecting a substantial increase in staffing to carry out its enhanced duties under the Bill.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important point about the escalating costs that we fear will arise as a result of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to place on record the new figures. I understand the difficulties that he faced during the fifth sitting, having pieces of paper passed to him by civil servants when he had to stand in for the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe. I also appreciate his sending this letter to members of the Committee. However, it is important that the new figures should be placed on the record for the benefit of people outside the House.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will know, that is not a point of order for me. However, I am sure that the Minister has listened to what has been said, and will respond in due course.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I should like to speak to Government amendments Nos. 88, 89, 91 and 92 together. The Bill establishes new consumer councils for gas and electricity, for telecoms and for water. Those councils will have to be funded. Their activities will be directed towards furthering and safeguarding the interests of utility customers. The requirement for councils stems directly from the activities of the utility companies. It is, therefore, appropriate for the costs, including set-up costs, to be met from licence fees whenever legally possible.
<P>
There must be certainty that the councils can be funded from licence fee income. Under utilities Acts, a licence modification normally requires the agreement of each licensee, or the agreement of a significant proportion of them. If there is a failure to agree, and the regulator still wishes to proceed with the modification, the matter has to be referred to the Competition Commission for a view on whether the modification would be in the public interest. That would be a lengthy process and the outcome would be uncertain. More than 300 licences have been issued in the energy sector, and even more have been issued in the telecoms sector. To attempt to amend licences through normal procedures would prove unnecessarily complex. There is broad support for the principle of consumer councils--I understand that the Opposition support the principle--which need a firm and clear funding basis from the outset.
<P>
Clauses 7 and 88 need amending to ensure that the authorities may modify the licence conditions, so that the councils' expenses and costs arising from the establishment of the councils or new authorities may be recovered without the need for reference to the Competition Commission. The amendments are designed to achieve that certainty.
<P>
As amended, the clauses would be similar to clause 56, which will empower the Secretary of State to make licence modifications relating to the new electricity trading arrangements. It will provide a suitable mechanism where there is need for certainty about the outcome of the licence modification procedure, and where there is broad support--as there is for the principle of independent councils--for the policy that underpins licence modification. None the less, the amendments will require the authorities to consult licensees before any modifications are made to the payment conditions of licences.
<P>
The consultation provision is more complicated in amendment No. 92, which applies to the telecoms sector because of the need to accommodate class licences as well as individual licences. In respect of class licences, it is not always possible to contact holders directly, so the amendment provides an alternative procedure for dealing with this category of licensee, based on the publication of a notice.
<P>
The clauses will limit to two years the period within which the authorities are able to exercise power to amend payment conditions in licences. In other words, the period will not be open-ended.
<P>
The original clauses enabled the Secretary of State to direct the authority on exercising the power to insert new conditions in licences, and we recognise that that power was drawn too widely. Therefore, amendment No. 89 and its equivalent in respect of the telecoms sector--amendment No. 92--define the scope of those powers of direction more narrowly. They make it clear that the power can be used only to secure payment by 173 174 licence holders of sums relating to the council's expenses, and the Secretary of State's expenses in respect of establishing the council and the authority.
<P>
A power of direction is needed to safeguard the independent position of the consumer council. The Secretary of State must be able to intervene, if necessary, through direction to ensure that modifications to licences to recover approved costs are satisfactory from the council's and the Government's perspectives. Without a power of direction, councils would be entirely reliant on the authorities' discretion over implementing satisfactory payment conditions.
<P>
Once a licence condition is in place, the regulator may make changes to it with the agreement of the licensee. The regulator also has powers to issue new licences to new entrants. Although a clause may be satisfactory at the outset, that may change over time, or a new licence may not contain the relevant provision. Subsequent amendments could be detrimental to the councils, so, to safeguard their independence from the authorities, the Secretary of State's ability to give directions on payment conditions relating to councils' expenses must be on-going.
<P>
However, it is important to recognise that, after the initial time-limited, two-year period within which an authority is empowered to make licence modifications, the scope of the Secretary of State's powers of direction will diminish considerably. Within the first two years, an authority will have the power to make changes to licence conditions in response to the Secretary of State's direction. However, when that period expires, the Secretary of State's powers of direction on licence conditions will effectively be limited to a power of veto over changes to the payment conditions.
<P>
I urge the Committee to accept amendments Nos. 88, 89, 91 and 92.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments appear at first glance to temper the severity of clauses 7 and 88. That is especially true in the case of proposed sections 7(7) and 88(8), which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The powers of the Authority--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under subsections (4) and (5) and subsections (3) and (4) respectively--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may not be exercised after the end of the period of two years beginning with the commencement of this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That puts a time limit on the uplift of the costs involved in restructuring the regulatory regime, which is welcome. However, we are worried about whether the modifications to licences specified by the amendments can be made outside the regular procedures for licence modifications that the Minister explained: where consent of the licence holder has not been obtained, the matter is automatically referred to the Competition Commission. The Government seem to be bypassing the consent requirements against licence holders' wishes. Will the Minister clarify what the position will be after two years? Do the arrangements apply only to the two-year period, or is this a fundamental change to the method of changing conditions in licences with regard to licence fee payments? In respect of the telecommunications industry, can the appeal procedure in the recently issued Telecommunications (Appeals) Regulations 1999--SI 3180--still be used in appealing against a determination to change a licence condition under clause 88, as amended?
<P>
There is still some confusion as to the purpose of the amendments, in that they considerably widen the scope of clauses 7 and 88. Clause 88 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Conditions included in a licence by virtue of paragraph (b) of section 7(5) of the 1984 Act may, without prejudice to the generality of those paragraphs, require the payment of sums relating to--
<P>
(a) the expenses of the Council; and
<P>
(b) the expenses of the Secretary of State in relation to the establishment of the Council and the Authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phraseology of amendments Nos. 89 and 92 is much broader in terms of the expense involved in setting up the authority and the consumer council. They state that the authority may modify the licence where it considers it "necessary or expedient" to do so as a consequence of establishing the authority or abolishing previous bodies. Will the new powers of the regulator to modify licences apply generally to modifications to licence fee payments, or only specifically to the consequences of changes in the regulatory structure in moving from the old regime to the new authority?
<P>
Amendments Nos. 166 and 167 relate to the energy sector, while amendments 169 and 170 relate to the telecommunications sector. They would apply a limit to the increases in licence fees that can be imposed by clauses 7 and 88, which deal with charging and payments in respect of the regulatory authorities and the consumer councils. Throughout our deliberations, Conservative Members have argued for curbs and limits on the spending powers of the new authorities, and limits on increases in the levies that they can impose on utility companies. The principal reason for our concern is that the extra costs will be passed on to the consumer. That is also the Government's view. Page 19 of the regulatory impact assessment clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Companies will be able to recover costs from consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All costs borne by regulators, but recovered from licence fees and ultimately borne by consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is proof, if it were needed, that the costs involved in the powers in clauses 7 and 88 to modify licences to raise additional licence fees will ultimately be borne by the consumer.
<P>
In the debate during the fifth sitting, which the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs followed up in his letter, we expressed our worry that many of the regulatory authorities will be expansionist. The 400 staff employed by the Office of Electricity Regulation and the Office of Gas Supply will become 430 when they move to their three offices in London, Leicester and Glasgow. That is the increased number that the Minister had to confess he got wrong in our fifth sitting. What is worse about the numbers that have materialised in this letter is that 60 of those staff will be working in Leicester, 20 in Glasgow and only 350 in London, whereas Ofgem is to move into an office in London that will hold 450 staff. That implies that Ofgem considers it likely that its numbers will expand by a further 100 staff. Therefore, all our concerns about the expansion rates of these authorities and the Consumer Council are genuine, and are borne out by the figures and estimates of future staff numbers that we receive.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend wish to intervene?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend clearly thought that the figures were so shocking that I would want to intervene, but I trust the Minister and I suspect that, when he replies, he will say that he has sent messages to the ever-growing regulators saying that he will not stand for such increases. Therefore, I am waiting to hear the good news that I am sure the Minister will give us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, which I hope will result in the Minister saying that he is concerned, as we are, with the escalating costs of the regulatory authorities.
<P>
The Bill purports to protect the consumer. If the Government believe that, they will accept these two amendments to restrict increases to the rate of inflation. The industry is also concerned about increased cost, including, by way of example only, Vodafone Airtouch. In a letter that it has sent to all members of the Committee, it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The splitting of Oftel's function between the two entities--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the Telecommunications Authority and the Telecommunications Consumer Council--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>seems likely to give rise to increased costs, and Vodafone would urge that there should be no overall increase in the financial burden of regulations on operators and consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, I see nothing unreasonable in our amendments. If there is no expansionary tendency among the authorities, there should be no problem in limiting their expense increases to the rate of inflation.
<P>
Amendment No. 37 for the energy sector and amendment No. 38 for the telecommunications sector require any modification to licences under clauses 7 and 88 to be subject to the affirmative procedure. The powers in those clauses to raise licence fees are a form of taxation: they are compulsory for a licence holder, they are paid into the Consolidated Fund and any expenditure from them is voted for through parliamentary departmental votes in the normal way, like any other public expenditure. They contain every characteristic of taxation, except that the regulator can levy increases without recourse to Parliament. It is, therefore, taxation without representation.
<P>
The raison d'étre for Parliament arose because of conflicts between the Executive and the people over tax-levying. The Boston tea party crisis was over that issue. I spent a happy day last summer at the site of the Boston tea party, when we threw into the river mock bales of tea. They were hauled back out again to prevent the water being polluted. I took great pleasure in doing that, because I believe strongly that there should not be taxation without clear representation, and that it should be kept under control. That is the purpose of the amendments. In addition, they provide yet another safety valve that prevents the regulator from imposing unpopular and excessive licence fee increases on the utilities, because again, ultimately, the consumer pays.
<P>
The amendments refer only to the House of Commons because the resulting statutory instrument would be a financial matter. The Government will no doubt argue that that would saddle the regulator with an unnecessary administrative and procedural burden, but we believe that it is essential in a democracy.
<P>
Amendment No. 133 was tabled to obtain clarification of the consent of licence holders to changes in the conditions of the licences. Currently, a change can occur only if the licence holder consents or, if the licence holder refuses and the regulator wishes to persist with the change, it is referred to the Competition Commission. Nothing in the clause or the Government's amendments refers to consent being required. Will the Minister clarify the position and state whether the licence holders, after being consulted, have the power to refuse modifications when the two-year period has elapsed? If they refuse, can the regulator refer the matter to the Competition Commission? If licence holders are unable to refuse because their consent is not required, there is no point in consulting because it is merely a public relations exercise.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 refer only to the telecommunications sector. Amendment No. 39 would insert into clause 88 the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and the provisions of the Licensing Directive.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 88(1) would then state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Conditions included in a licence ... may, without prejudice to the generality of those paragraphs and the provisions of the Licensing Directive, require the payment of sums relating to--
<P>
(a) the expenses of the Council; and
<P>
(b) the expenses of ... the establishment of the Council and the Authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The regulator can change the conditions of a licence to require the payment of additional fees to cover the expenses of the Telecommunications Consumer Council and of setting up the Telecommunications Authority. The problem is that EU directive 97/13 on the common framework for general authorisation and individual licences in the field of telecommunications services does not allow that to happen. Article 11 of the directive states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Member states shall ensure that any fees imposed on undertakings as part of authorisation procedures seek only to cover the administrative cost incurred in the issue, management, control and enforcement of the applicable individual licence conditions.
<P>
The directive permits fees to be raised through the licence fee only in relation to the administration of the licence and not for the other objectives in the Bill. For example, the costs of regulation cannot be recovered from licence holders.
<P>
If the Minister refuses to accept amendments Nos. 39 and 40, which would insert references to the conditions in the EU directive, he will refuse reference to the directive's four guiding principles in relation to expenses: proportionality, legal certainty, objectivity and non-discrimination. Article 12 of the directive states:
<P>
Whereas any fees or charges imposed on the undertakings as part of authorisation procedures must be based on objective. non- discriminatory and transparent criteria.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to incorporate into the Bill the references set out in the directive. It is sensible to do that at this juncture because the requirements of the directive will become applicable.
<P>
It is clear that the on-going costs of the Telecommunications Consumer Council are not simply administrative costs in connection with management of the licence: they relate to the wider social aims of the Bill. How can the Government reconcile those two conflicting priorities? If the Government were challenged in the European Court of Justice, what line of defence would the Minister take? I hope that he will respond to that important point because the industry and the Opposition are worried that we may be introducing inbuilt conflicts with directives that are bound to follow.
<P>
We tabled amendments Nos. 285 and 286 in response to the concerns that were expressed by the telecommunications industry, in particular by the operators group. That group represents 24 communications companies, including Cable and Wireless, Energis, Kingston Communications (Hull) plc, One 2 One, Orange, Telewest Communications and Vodafone.
<P>
Amendment No. 285 would limit the cost of the regulations by limiting the amount that can be passed on to the telecommunications companies in higher fees. The limit would involve "such sums" as are "proportionate". Again, that echoes the wording that is used in article 11 of the EU directive 97/13. The amendment uses the same words as the directive's second paragraph. They state that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>fees of an individual licence shall be proportionate to the work involved and shall be published in an appropriate and sufficiently detailed manner so as to be readily accessible.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The operators group has already made representations to the Government in this regard but, alas, to no avail.
<P>
Amendment No. 286 would subject the Secretary of State's power to issue general directions on licence fees in clause 88(2) to the provisos in subsection (1). On first impressions, it appeared that the operators group had succeeded in its representations in this regard. Paragraph (9) of Government amendment No. 92 states.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may, for the purpose of securing the payment to the Authority of sums relating to any of the expenses mentioned in subsection (2)--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that refers to the provisos that I have discussed--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>give a direction to the Authority as to the inclusion of conditions in licences.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that the provisos relating to raising licence fees will be applied. However, the amendment contains a phrase in parenthesis that is problematic. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(in addition to any other sums that may be payable).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does that mean? If amendment No. 92 is agreed to, will the Secretary of State be able to issue directions to make changes to licence conditions in respect of payments for any purpose, not simply for setting up and running the new regulatory bodies? I have raised this important point on several occasions, and we need a categorical and firm response from the Minister to clarify the situation for the industry.
<P>
The operators group wrote to the Minister, the Secretary of State and all Committee members because it is extremely unhappy about the Bill. I expect that several Committee members--Labour Members in particular--will want to quote from this important letter. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the current Bill is inappropriate and that its underlying approach is flawed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a damning indictment from the telecommunications sector, which is a major segment of British industry. Those companies are supposed to compete with BT. The Bill is meant to help the consumer, and competition is the best way to do that. However, the companies that will introduce effective competition into the sector are unhappy about the situation. The letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is most odd that on one hand the Government declares the need to legislate for a single Communications regulator but on the other is actually legislating for communications to be treated as if it were a traditional utility.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset raised that matter in a previous sitting.
<P>
The letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The prospect of unlimited fines with no full appeal mechanism and communications companies being agents of social and environmental policy through vaguely or even undefined measures, will severely lessen the UK's attractiveness for investment and communications. The Utilities Bill will ... throw our industry into regulatory uncertainty with the guarantee of repeated further upheaval to come.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The industry is concerned about the extra fees to which the provisions will subject it. That is even more strongly expressed by the Federation of the Electronics Industry. Its director of information and communications technology stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I would like to register FEI's astonishment that telecommunications is included as a utility ... to include telecommunications and therefore<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>with these industries in a Utilities Bill seems, at best, peculiar and, at worst a huge drag on the development of UK plc. There are a plethora of competitors in numerous sectors--direct competitors to BT, cable companies, internet service providers, and wireless local loop providers are just some.

The common theme of this group of amendments is to limit the cost of regulation. The Government ceaselessly talk about better regulation and the regulatory impact unit. If the Government are to demonstrate that that is more than just empty rhetoric and an attempt to curry favour with industry, the Minister should accept at least some of the amendments. If he rejects all of them, it will become abundantly clear that, like so much else, the Government's rhetoric is phony, and contradicts the reality of the detail. I look forward to the Minister's response, which will be of interest not only to Committee members but the industry. The industry will have to pick up the bill, and, ultimately, the cost will be passed on to consumers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I shall speak first to the amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has discussed. I shall then deal with the amendments that I have tabled.
<P>
In a Committee, there are occasions when one feels that the speeches are doing some good, and making Ministers consider what is really happening. In a previous sitting, the Minister admitted that he was unaware of the total resources that would be devoted to the new regulators. He assured the Committee that he would write to us and give us all the information that he could obtain about resources currently expended and those that will be expended after the creation of the new bodies. The language in the Minister's letter betrays the fact that he has suddenly started to take his civil servants to task--he has taken them to one side and said, "Hang on a minute. I am telling the Committee and the House that this is proportionate and a sensible way of regulating. In fact, by bringing two bodies together, we are seeing an increase in the need for staff, not a reduction." It is good to see the projected numbers for the Telecommunications Authority decreasing. It will not require new premises, which is welcome. The Committee is starting to get to the nub of the issues, and the Minister should assure us that, from the outset, he will limit the projections for these bodies.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) have tabled amendments to limit and define exactly what the licence will pay for. The intention is to point out to the Minister that this country is a signatory to the European treaties, and there are certain directives designed to prevent Governments from introducing special measures to benefit or disbenefit particular companies. According to those important criteria, licence fees can be used only to recover administrative costs of licences and not as a hidden tax. Under the previous Government, the House made decisions in contravention of European directives, and, as a result, the Government were taken to court. That could also happen under this Government. Powerful and rich companies will be affected, not fly-by-night operations. Such companies employ many lawyers, and they will be examining carefully what is decided in this Committee. They will be checking what the Minister can or cannot do.
<P>
Vodafone, which since its merger is the largest company in the United Kingdom, has clearly stated, albeit belatedly, that it is complete nonsense for it to be regarded as a utility. In many ways, I wish that the Opposition had taken a stronger stand by saying that there is no need to go in that direction.
<P>
My colleagues may have spent the recent break indulging in leisure pursuits, but, being a sad Opposition Member, I spent it poring over the Bill. I discovered exactly what it will do, and there is a clear difference between it and the Telecommunications Act 1984. The 1984 Act covered telecoms services but the Bill will cover telecoms services and equipment. I thought that we had moved away from requiring that each telephone be approved by the Post Office before it is connected to the system, but the Government want to establish a regulator that will have all manner of controls and look into all the little devices that constitute telecoms.
<P>
I am worried that the Government have discovered that a great source of money is available to them. Bidding for licences for third-generation mobile phones is taking place today, and the Chancellor is rubbing his hands with glee at the prospect that at least £1.5 billion--sums as large as £3 billion or even £5 billion have been mentioned--will be amassed through selling licences for spectrum. When the relevant legislation was considered, we asked whether, under the directives, that would be regarded as legal. Clearly, the Chancellor has discovered that that money is available, and I shall discuss in a moment how he might spend the additional sums that the Bill will provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Has the hon. Gentleman forgotten that that provision was included in his own party's general election manifesto?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Indeed, I well remember that. I also remember that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who was a Minister with responsibility for licence bidding, resisted civil servants who wanted to take money from the pockets of those who will use third generation mobile phones. We should remember that everyone who uses such phones will be paying billions of pounds in yet another stealth tax imposed by the Government.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that his colleague, who assumed the relevant post in the Department of Trade and Industry after the general election--I cannot remember his name, which is just as well, as he might otherwise kick me--was beginning to adopt the view that a considerable sum is involved, and Chancellors are always keen to get hold of their money. The Government jumped on the chance to legislate when they came to office. They did not want to rush around regulating when they already had a Bill that would provide the Exchequer with billions of pounds. We are discovering that, lo and behold, there are social needs, as well as environmental needs, that can be written into this Bill. We are trying to limit the amount that can be charged in respect of licences.
<P>
Yet again today, we have heard through the usual leaks that the Chancellor will provide additional money to get unemployed people back to work. I shall explain myself immediately, Mrs. Roe, because you may be wondering what that has to do with the Bill. It is relevant because the new deal was funded by a "windfall levy"--a stealth tax--on the utilities. The Government specifically stated that they would collect that money over two years, that it was a one-off tax, and that after three years the new deal would have done away with long-term unemployment. It was a good deal, was it not? The Government would go in and take all that money off those terribly rich utilities--some of which are now making losses--and use it for socially worthwhile purposes.
<P>
However, we all know what has happened with the new deal. It has created a large revolving door. People are shoved in, and they come out six months later having been transformed from being long-term unemployed. They have to spend another six months on the unemployment register before they become long-term unemployed again. I see that you are becoming uncomfortable with this line of argument, Mrs. Roe, so I 181 182 shall return to whether money obtained through this licensing system can be devoted to such social purposes. It has already been done by the Government. They need to find more money because they have already collected the utilities tax, and Conservative Members believe that the utilities tax is returning in this new format. We must be careful about how the system will operate.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton gave a clear description of the amendments, and I support them. I now turn to amendments Nos. 343 and 344. While not wishing to challenge a decision made by the Chairman, I am a little surprised at the amendments to clauses 7 and 88 being grouped together in this way. I understand that they are mirrored clauses, and such a grouping is fine when the amendments deal with matters that are mirrored in both clauses. However, my amendments to clause 88 are telecommunications-specific and are not intended to be mirrored by any provisions in, or amendments to, clause 7. That is a technical point, and I am grateful that the amendments were selected. I shall now discuss them, although they relate specifically to clause 88 rather than the clause that we are now discussing.
<P>
Amendment No. 343 suggests that when licence fees are collected from United Kingdom-based companies, the authority should be allowed to treat people working offshore in exactly the same way as people who hold United Kingdom licences. That would create a level playing field between those based offshore working without a United Kingdom licence and those who work with a UK licence. The reason behind the proposal may seem obscure, but each of the amendments that I shall speak to is based on provisions already in place in the UK.
<P>
It was brought to my attention some years ago that the City of London Telecommunications company--COLT --which was owned by a New York company, had worked out an interesting device. Most companies can reclaim their value added tax, because they are registered VAT companies. COLT was selling masses of telecommunications services to the financial services industry in London. That industry is exempt from VAT. The companies do not charge VAT on their services, nor are they allowed to offset the VAT that they pay on their bills. VAT charged at 17.5 per cent. would form a high proportion of a telecommunications bill.
<P>
COLT found a device whereby it would invoice for both overseas and United Kingdom traffic from New York, where the sales tax is levied at 5 per cent. on telecommunications. It was, therefore, saving its customers 12.5 per cent. Moreover, its customers paid taxes not to the UK Treasury, but to the New York state treasury. The amendment draws attention to the fact that one can easily run a telecommunications company offshore, and charge offshore, which is not the case with water and electricity operations. The VAT issue was taken up with the American authorities through the European Community, and the loophole was eventually plugged.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Government decide to add 10, 20 or 30 per cent. to telephone bills for social purposes such as getting people back to work, companies will soon try to find ways of avoiding paying the levy by basing their operations overseas and invoicing from overseas.
<P>
Amendment No. 343 would not specifically require the authority to do anything, but would give it the power to consider factors that may be upsetting the level playing field. Through the amendment, I have tried to emphasise a matter that the Bill does not emphasise. Most of the Ministers who deal with electronic business and communications, and no less a person than our Prime Minister, have said that one of the Government's primary aims is to ensure that the United Kingdom is the best place in the world for people to conduct e-business. Under the Bill, the authority merely has the power to consider competition within the UK, and to try to ensure a good deal across the UK for domestic business. It is not empowered to take action to deal with matters such as the overseas traffic of telecommunications. However, a national regulator would be the ideal body to argue in the international forums for lower international tariffs. One of the factors that holds up e-business is that, under certain treaties, international traffic is very expensive, and was designed to be that way. Companies have no interest in driving those costs down; they would like to think that everybody has to pay the same high prices.
<P>
The amendment would allow the authority to have regard to ensuring that the cost of telecommunications makes the UK the best place in the world to conduct e-business. The authority would be able to consider overseas tariffs to ensure that the UK is competitive with the rest of the world; the Bill merely refers to competitiveness within the UK. That would be a proper additional activity for the authority, unlike the variety of activities that are being imposed on it for no good reason.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> This is a very large group of amendments. I shall try to do them justice, because they are important amendments that go to the heart of the Bill.
<P>
I shall deal first with the questions that were asked by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He asked whether the powers of the amendment are limited to changes in the existing regime. The procedure whereby the authority can make modifications without reference to the Competition Commission is limited to licence conditions in respect of the initial expenses that are incurred as a consequence of the establishment of the authority and the council.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether, after two years, the authority can make changes to payment conditions without reference to the Competition Commission. The answer is no. Changes after that period can be made only in accordance with the normal licence modification procedures in the existing legislation, which require either the consent of the individual licence holder or, in some circumstances, the consent of a significant majority of licence holders.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the new telecoms appeals procedure can be applied to modifications to licences to secure the Telecommunications Consumer Council's funding. The answer is yes. The regulator's decision to modify the licences falls within the scope of the new telecommunications appeals procedure, which was introduced last November.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman went on to deal with the Millbank headquarters of Ofgem and asked whether it would entail an increase of 100 staff. The answer is no. As I said in my letter, the figure of 350 headquarters staff is only an initial estimate and will be subject to rigorous review. As I also said in my letter, Ofgem intends to sublet any space in the Millbank building that it does not need. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that I cannot give him any idea about the stream of revenue that might flow from that. That will depend largely on managerial acumen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> As the Millbank office can accommodate 450 people and the Minister's letter refers to 350 staff transferring to it, can he obtain from Ofgem an assurance that it will sublet, straight away, the remaining quarter of the building that seems unnecessary for its purposes?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe will keep a close eye on the stream of revenue that I hinted at earlier and will try to secure the optimum income from any space in that building that can be sublet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> At column 165 of the Hansard report of our sitting on 22 February, I think through a note from his officials, the Minister told the Committee that £450,000 would be spent on refurbishment. Perhaps the shock of seeing the figure was such that he knocked a zero off, because over the half-term holiday that £450,000 has become, in the letter that he sent us, £4.3 million. Will he correct the record now? Is his letter correct or is the Hansard report correct? I know that the Hansard report accurately reflects what he said, because I was amazed that nearly £500,000 would be spent on refurbishment. Now that I hear that it is nearly £4.5 million--10 times as much--I am even more shocked.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I confirm the accuracy of the information that I put in my letter.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bogner Regis and Littlehampton said that subsection (8) of the amended clause refers to the Secretary of State giving directions to secure the payment of sums relating to the council's expenses and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(in addition to any other sums that may be payable).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He asked whether that broadened the Secretary of State's power of direction. The answer is no. The words in parentheses make it clear that other sums may be payable to the authority under licence conditions. The Secretary of State's power of direction under subsection (8) can be exercised only to secure the payment by licence holders of sums relating to the expenses of the council and the Secretary of State in relation to the establishment of the authority and the council.
<P>
Opposition Members have properly raised important issues in relation to the Vodafone letter, which was sent to all the members of the Committee. It was written on behalf of the operators' group, so it carries some weight. I repeat that the Government intend to review and reform the regulatory legislation relevant to the converging markets of telecommunications, broadcasting and information technology. Those issues were addressed in earlier Green Papers, and we are now developing our proposals for comprehensive regulatory reform. We intend to publish a White Paper this autumn. Opposition Members have argued that all the telecoms provisions in the Bill should be included in this wider review. We have received representations within the past week from a number of the larger operators and we are looking carefully at what they have said.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe made the point, when the hon. Member for South Dorset raised this question, that the telecoms issues covered by the Bill amount to a limited agenda that can be successfully considered on its own merits. However, we recognise the concerns that the industry has put to us, and we are considering them carefully. I said earlier that I do not wish to propose any changes to the treatment of telecommunications provisions in the Bill. I also ask the Committee to continue with its considerations of those provisions as part of the Bill. As soon as the Government have completed their considerations of the issues raised by the industry--such as those contained in the letter from Vodafone--I shall inform the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If the Government, having considered that letter, thought it appropriate to remove from the Bill all provisions relating to the telecoms industry, they would have the support of the Opposition, given that there is to be a review, and that it is important not to keep imposing changes on the industry over a period of years. That removal could be carried out in as swift and easy a manner as the Minister wished.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I rarely have the opportunity to say this, but I thank the hon. Gentleman for his co-operation. I am grateful to him for making that commitment. I also think that the Committee has a right to know whether the hon. Gentleman dressed up as a music hall American rebel in Boston before he threw what I assume were fake bales of tea into the river.
<P>
I shall address briefly some of the other issues raised by Opposition Members, who seek through amendments to place a cap on the sums that could be raised through a licence condition imposed under clauses 7 and 88. The cap proposed is that individual licence holders should not have to pay more than they would have paid before the Act came into force to meet the expenses of the relevant director general. The amendments provide for an uprating in line with inflation thereafter.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton recognises that clauses 7 and 88 are narrower in their effect than the amendments suggest. They are aimed at ensuring that the costs of the consumer councils and the Secretary of State's costs in establishing the councils and the new regulatory authorities can be recovered. They are not designed to recover the authorities' costs.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 166 to 170 are no doubt intended at heart to avoid a situation in which the costs of the consumer councils could escalate sharply, resulting in the financial burden being passed on to companies, in the form of higher licence fees, and ultimately to consumers. I sympathise with that underlying objective, but the amendments are unnecessary and, in some circumstances, undesirable.
<P>
I assure the Committee that the consumer councils will be subject to rigorous and effective financial disciplines. First, the councils will be required to consult on their forward work programmes and will have to publish indicative overall budgets. That will allow the industry and others to query the need for particular activities and to challenge the proposed budgets. In the course of consultation on the Green Paper, "A Fair Deal for Consumers--Modernising the framework for Utility Regulation", we were urged to introduce a more open and transparent budget-setting procedure. The provisions in the Bill to require the regulators and the councils to consult on a draft work programme and to publish an indicative budget are a major innovation. They go a significant way towards opening up the budgeting procedure and allowing companies and other third parties to make their views heard.
<P>
Secondly, each council will have to agree its budget with the sponsoring Department. Of course, in reaching final decisions on the work programme and the budget, the Department will have the benefit of reactions to the forward work programme.
<P>
Thirdly, like other non-departmental public bodies, councils will be subject to a fundamental financial management and policy review at least once every five years. We envisage that the review will build in benchmarking against comparable organisations such as other consumer councils.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, energy and telecoms councils' expenses will be incorporated in my Department's Vote, so overall costs will be controlled by Parliament. We intend to take a similarly robust approach to councils' start-up costs.
<P>
A rigid formula for setting a cap on licence fee increases cannot flex to take account of unforeseen developments that could justify an increase in resources required by the consumer council. I shall refer to a real example of a licence fee cap that created serious difficulties. The roll-out--I apologise for using that horrible expression, which is part of the macho management language that politicians like to use these days--of gas competition led to a significant increase in unresolved consumer complaints about serious matters such as aggressive doorstep selling techniques, and erroneous transfers of customers from one supplier to another. In 1997, the gas consumers council handled approximately 44,000 complaints, but in 1998, it handled 60,000 complaints, which constitutes an increase of 36 per cent. Resources had to be increased to accommodate the surge in complaints. The proposal for a licence fee cap tied to inflation would have created serious practical funding difficulties. We cannot say with certainty that similar hikes will never happen again, so flexibility must be retained.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister trusts those mechanisms, but according to column 120 of Hansard's account of our previous sitting, he castigated the previous Government for allowing the cost of MI5's headquarters to increase by a factor of three during the 10 years in which it was built. He will know that the cost of the ICI refurbishment has increased by a factor of 10 since he quoted the original figure to the Committee less than a week ago. If some guarantees were provided, Committee members would feel happier about allowing authorities to conduct their business.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That is very interesting, and I shall make a point of reading what I said. I can assure the hon. Gentleman and other Committee members that we will maintain rigorous and robust methods to ensure that such cost escalations do not occur.
<P>
The Government are committed to establishing adequately resourced independent councils. Given that it is difficult to anticipate the precise resource requirements in this area, it would be undesirable to put councils in a financial straitjacket, rendering them incapable of arguing for greater resources where market developments demand. Rather than advancing the interests of utility consumers, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is doubtless seeking to do, the amendment could undermine a core element of the Government's proposals to protect them.
<P>
The Government are well aware of, and fully accept, the need for rigorous financial discipline. That will be ensured through the measures that I have set out, rather than by including in the Bill a mechanistic and inflexible provision. I hope that the Opposition accept those assurances and will not press amendments Nos. 166 to 170 to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am particularly grateful for the Minister's response on provisions to modify licences, which will be welcomed outside this House. If I understand him correctly, provisions to bypass licence holders' consent when changes are made to licence fee provisions will apply only to the two-year period in which the set-up costs are recovered from the utilities.
<P>
I am also grateful for the Minister's response on the appeal procedure. He confirmed that the new procedure for the telecommunications industry, which was introduced last year, will apply to clause 88, notwithstanding that the drafting suggests that it will not.
<P>
I am not so grateful for the Minister's response on the cost of the authorities and the consumer council. There seems to be an element of complacency. He said more money should not be required than at present, but the evidence in his statements to the committee and a letter that he sent out suggests that the bodies will be escalatory. We are concerned about the number of employees on the consumer side. The Minister said that he was unable to give precise figures for the number of people moving from Offer to the consumer council, but the annexe to his letter referred to 100 to 140 who will be involved mainly on work that will be transferred to the consumer council. All the indications are that costs will escalate and my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset astutely spotted in the annexe that the refurbishment costs will be £4.3 million. The Minister assured us that the Government will keep all costs carefully under control, but there is no evidence to suggest that they will do so. The cost of government has increased in real terms by £1 billion since the Government came to power three years ago.
<P>
The Minister referred to the consultation on the forward work load of the authorities, but that forward work load will not be broken down project by project. We tabled amendments to obtain further details and estimates of the cost of the forward work load, but complacency again crept in and we were told that that would be an unnecessary burden on those bodies. The private sector does not find the burden intolerable because it costs almost every project before undertaking it, but for some reason the new bodies will not have to do that. They will merely come up with an overall estimate for the work programme for the year.
<P>
That complacency makes me even more determined to have the amendments in the Bill. The Minister referred to the cap, but that cannot take account of unforeseen circumstances such as the high-pressure selling when the gas supply industry was deregulated. Such hikes will occur, but the costs should be recovered in subsequent years so that there is a smooth level of funding for the councils over the years. Costs should be cut in future years to make up for peaks and the organisations should not be provided with an open door to pass increasing costs on to consumers.
<P>
I shall press amendment No. 167 to a vote because I believe strongly that the Government are too complacent in analysing and controlling costs. The Minister's assurances are meaningless because they will not incorporate into the strategy structure any devices to deliver the assurances that he keeps telling us he is able to deliver.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I was rather disappointed that the Minister did not respond fully to amendments Nos. 343 and 344. They are helpful to the Government's intentions of having an effective regulator and dealing with international issues, but my hon. Friend was right to say that the most important issue is to try to keep costs down.
<P>
After 13 years in this place, one develops an ability to read between the lines and my heart missed a beat when the Minister referred to using the Bill to change the regulations on telecommunications. The industry has made its representations clearly, and they coincide with Labour party policy, and policy that I and other hon. Members have suggested. If telecommunications regulation is to be considered, the focus should be on what the Labour party said it would do with the whole of communications and broadcasting. The Minister rightly said that we must continue considering this Bill, amending it and making it as sound as possible, and, even at this late stage, he might do a U-turn, for which I would be grateful. Some people think that I speak at length--
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): No, we enjoy it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I speak at length, but it is often on instructions. I hope that Ministers are listening, because I want to congratulate the Government and the Department of Trade and Industry team. I had a 20-minute speech to make on the Floor of the House on employment agency regulations, but, for certain reasons, I ended up speaking for about an hour and a half. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment listened carefully to that long speech, and announced, in the past week, a complete U-turn on employment agency regulations. The Minister does not need me to speak for an hour and half--I think that he is starting to understand the viper's nest that he has been given to play with, and he might start strangling a few vipers. On that basis, I shall not press my amendments to a vote. However, I shall be vigorous in support of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> The more that we consider the Bill, the more it seems wholly inappropriate that the Telecommunications Act 1984 should be amended so that, in effect, the authority is given the power to increase licence payments. I have already made my feelings known on the matter. The measure is being used as a form of hidden taxation for raising money for other purposes, which has already happened under this Government. The words "social and environmental" probably cover the whole of life as we know it, and are not highly defined in a potentially effective way.
<P>
The Government should carefully consider what they are doing before they move ahead. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has already said that if they were to have a fundamental rethink, we would be pleased to assist them in making the U-turn as smoothly as possible.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 88, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I should declare at the outset that I am taking part in the Industry and Parliament Trust scheme with the Electricity Association and that I chair one of the home energy conservation agencies in Milton Keynes. However, I have no shares or consultancy to declare, so I shall not be speaking every five minutes to promote my consultancy.
<P>
Clause 8 is the Bill's key clause, and many of the amendments that I have tabled stem from my belief that the Government have missed an opportunity in its wording. The Government's social and environmental guidance states that its purpose is to relate the regulator's duties
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>towards the wider social and environmental objectives of Government.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept that the Bill is only one way of achieving that, but the Bill is not being utilised as much as it should be.
<P>
I fully support the Government's environmental agenda and their commitment to it, which has been recognised by a variety of groups. For example, the Centre for Sustainable Energy has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We welcome the intention of the Government to give guidance to the Authority on social and environmental matters, particularly with respect to setting energy efficiency standards and introducing measures to give lower income consumers a better deal within competitive markets. We applaud the Government for stating its intention to set targets for renewables and CHP.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am concerned that the reference in the clause--and the equivalent reference in clause 12--to protecting the interests of consumers does not take into account consumers' long-term interests. There is a fundamental difference between consumers' short-term and long-term interests. The amendments would ensure that environmental and social considerations are included, while not making them subservient to the competitiveness aspect of the clause. I fear that that creates a loophole through which the Government's objectives could be frustrated.
<P>
The clause refers to consumers as if they were a homogenous mass, but there are different types of consumer: some have small businesses, some are disadvantaged, some live in rural areas and others in urban centres. There is a range, and all of them have different interests. Unless the environmental and social considerations are a primary purpose, the incompatibility of different types of consumers may not be recognised. Previous legislation did not benefit all consumers equally, as previous debates have acknowledged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the definition of consumer is too wide, because it includes not simply the individual in his home but providers of services who are purchasers of services from another utility? Does he therefore agree that it would be better to narrow the definition of consumer to deal with that problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I do not accept that we should narrow the definition. It is right to include those groups of consumers, but the Bill should take into account the differences between them. They should not be excluded, but should be recognised as having different priorities. The hon. Gentleman mentioned businesses. On the telecoms side, many companies will be competitors, as well as consumers, of BT.
<P>
The Bill refers to protecting consumers. Again, that is too narrow a definition. Amendment No. 20 would add the word "promote" so that the regulator could also be proactive: he would be able to consider the short term and historical data, and look to the future and take action to prevent a problem from occurring, instead of simply reacting to a problem. Consumers have wider interests than simply the short-term cost of electricity or gas, and issues such as energy efficiency must be taken into account.
<P>
I welcome the commitment that the Government have given in clause 9, but I am worried that guidance could be reviewed by a subsequent Government, who could drop environmental and social considerations because they are not set in stone. The Government may be missing a trick here, because a future Tory Government could downgrade the commitment.
<P>
The Minister may say that I am being over-pessimistic and that that would not happen, but when Clare Spottiswoode was the gas regulator, she refused to accept that environmental considerations were part of her domain and interpreted the Gas Act 1986 narrowly. I have tabled the amendments because I am worried that a future regulator could interpret the Bill in the same way. In spite of all the environmental and social guidance that the Government produce, a future regulator could use the loophole that it was not a primary duty and thereby avoid paying it the necessary regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am sorry to keep intervening, but how would the hon. Gentleman deal with a conflict between two primary duties? Two primary duties sounds like a contradiction in terms, but as he wants two, what would his solution be if the primary duty to protect the environment conflicted with the primary duty to protect the consumer--for example, if meeting the environmental objective resulted in a higher cost to the consumer?
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I accept that the regulator would need to balance those different considerations. My concern is that, without the amendment, the Bill would protect the consumer instead of promoting the consumer's interests, so a regulator could put the consumer's short-term interests first and ignore the environmental considerations.
<P>
A fair deal for the environment is in the long-term interest of consumers, but the short-term interest of consumers is not necessarily in the long-term interest of the environment. I hope that the Minister will address that fundamental concern in his response. If the Government are not prepared to accept my amendment, will they look into ways of ensuring, within the guidance, that the regulator cannot interpret the legislation narrowly as previous regulators have done?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I countersigned the amendments unbeknown to the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White)--I almost called him my hon. Friend, because he is a personal, if not a political, friend--for perverse reasons. The most perverse is that I half expected that he would be given leave of absence from the Committee this morning.
<P>
This is the first amendment tabled by a Labour Member, and the Government Whips have a strange way of deciding whether Government Members with important issues to discuss should be able to do so. I 193 194 notice that the Whip is deliberately keeping out of the way at the moment; he probably knew what I was going to say. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East may not realise--but I am sure the Government Whip does--that by putting my name on the amendment, it could not be pulled simply by ensuring that the hon. Gentleman was not present.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows me well enough to know that when I table an amendment, I intend to speak to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I was commending the courage and integrity that the hon. Gentleman has shown in doing so. One of my constituents wrote to me--unfortunately, I do not have the letter to hand--to ask whether I would support the amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman and by the Liberal Democrats on the subject of the environment. I have written back to him to say yes, and have put my name to those amendments.
<P>
The merits of the amendments attracted me because the hon. Gentleman had added to the aims of the provision so that they would not only "protect" the interests of consumers but "promote" them. He has made the very good point that if we create an authority and councils that exist simply to protect consumers' interests, they will wait for people to complain to them when something has gone wrong, whereas they could earn their keep by going out and promoting consumers' interests, which often coincide with the interests of the suppliers. Those two often go hand in hand.
<P>
I turn to the other amendments in the group. I do not know what has happened to the transport links to the parts of the country that our Liberal Democrat colleagues represent. However, I suspect that "In-Touch" leaflets will be delivered up and down the land--[Interruption.] I am sorry, I meant "Focus" leaflets. Each of those focus leaflets going through people's letter boxes will contain a claim by the Liberal Democrats that they are the true green party, and the only party championing the important issues in the amendments. Their absence is a strange way in which to promote those issues, having tabled the amendments. I do not think that my constituent who wrote to me was aware of the amendments because the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East had written to him, but I suspect that the Liberal Democrats have been writing round saying what they are doing in relation to the Bill.
<P>
I am not going to move the Liberal Democrats' amendments on their behalf. However, it should be noted that they have just not bothered to turn up. They should be here if they have tabled amendments and have gone round to all their supporters and said, "Look what we're doing on the Utilities Bill. We are the friends of the environment; we are the friends of the consumer." Yet they do not even bother to turn up. They are obviously too busy producing their next focus--

<P>

<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): Hocus-pocus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Hocus-pocus leaflets, as my hon. Friend says. I hope that, when we return to our constituencies, we shall point to the record in Hansard to show exactly has happened in Committee.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): I suspect that, as usual, the editions of "Focus" that the Liberal Democrats are busy drawing up will be rather blurry.
<P>
I followed carefully the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East with great interest and considerable sympathy. We have probably all received briefings in support of his case from organisations such as Friends of the Earth, the Socialist Environment and Resources Association and Climate Action Network UK. I want to draw one or two points to his and to my hon. Friend the Minister's attention, in the hope that the Minister will be able to say whether my understanding of the Bill is correct.
<P>
I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East has considered the combined effect of subsection (1). Does he accept that people do not want to buy gas and electricity as such, but want warmth and light, and that the predominant part of their fuel bills goes on buying fuel to keep themselves warm? Do the words "promoting effective competition" in line 11, when associated with "commercial activities" in line 12 and "supply of gas" in line 13 amount to promoting competition in marketing warmth and, through that, achieving a market in energy efficiency?
<P>
I am sure that my hon. Friends the Minister and the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East know, as I do, that fuel efficiency combined with selling warmth at the lowest possible cost is probably the best way to address the needs of the fuel poor. We know that between 4 million and 7 million households need to use more than 10 per cent. of their apparent income to keep themselves warm, and are estimated to be in fuel poverty. We shall shortly consider a private Member's Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) on warm homes, which will address those issues. The provisions in the Bill go a long way towards helping us to respond to the problems of those 4 million to 7 million people, who can hardly be considered a minority, as they represent a quarter to a third of households in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Does the hon. Lady accept that the best measure to deal with fuel poverty was the Act privatising British Gas? Fuel bills have come down considerably since privatisation. Her party opposed the measure at that time and has done so since.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> I accept, as I have done for a long time, that competition has had a significant impact on fuel, but many measures that the Government have introduced have had a greater impact. I think particularly of the reduction of VAT on fuel to the minimum permissible. When the hon. Gentleman's party was in government, it proposed to increase VAT to 17.5 per cent. The reduction in the gas levy, the introduction of the minimum income guarantee, our steps to improve people's incomes and, most particularly, the £100 winter fuel allowance have had a far greater impact. The hon. Gentleman will probably remember that in earlier debates I pointed out that, in the three years running up to gas competition, because of requirements from previous Conservative Governments, the price of gas to domestic consumers increased in real terms by 30 per cent.
<P>
When the Minister responds to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East, will he clarify whether the clause will achieve the purpose that my hon. Friend suggests in his amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Sawford </B>(Kettering): I should like to speak briefly in support of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. It is right to try to raise the profile of environmental issues and to place them higher on the Government's agenda. We have made international commitments on the reduction of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and other emissions, but there is a bigger issue at stake in our obligations to the planet, which is extremely fragile. Only this week we have again seen exceptional weather conditions creating havoc, human suffering and death. It will cost millions of pounds in aid and support to rebuild those communities. We are increasingly aware of the fragility of our environment and the effect that a change in temperature of just a few degrees and a little more erosion of the ozone layer can have on people throughout the world. We have an obligation to future generations: our children, grandchildren and beyond.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East referred to long-term considerations. The problem does not concern just short-term regulation and interest. In debating the Bill's general duties, it is right to give protection and promotion of the environment a higher priority and not to concentrate only on competitive markets and consumer protection. We should focus on longer-term issues and wider concerns and considerations.
<P>
The amendments provide the opportunity to reflect on that longer-term goal and the more distant objectives that are as important as the current concern for consumers, competition, free markets and so on. I congratulate my hon. Friend on providing us with the opportunity to raise those wider issues.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> Will my hon. Friend note that had my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East not done so, we would not have had an opportunity to debate these matters, because Liberal Democrat Members, who have tabled batteries of amendments, have not been in Committee to move them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Sawford:</B> My hon. Friend is trying to draw me into commenting on the absence of Liberal Democrat Members. Their commitment to the environment is disgraceful.
<P>
I do not want to speak for long, but I want to support my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East and to ask the Minister to consider writing into these crucial clauses a greater long-term commitment to environmental protection and environmental concerns. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to those points.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As this is the first group of amendments to be debated under this important clause, it may be appropriate for me to establish the context. I shall try to answer the points raised by members of the Committee.
<P>
We do not expect the clause to produce dramatic overnight results. There will be no sudden revisions of price caps or licence conditions; the regulatory environment is not about to be turned upside down. However, putting consumers at the heart of regulation will make a real difference. As the clause makes clear, the authority will continue to have a duty to ensure that companies can finance their licensed activities, and that all reasonable demand is met. That is part of the consumer interest in pursuing continued and secured access to the utility in question.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 20 and 24, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East, would change the objective of the authority from the protection of the interests of consumers to the promotion and protection of those interests. Under amendment No. 238, which was tabled by the absent hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker), the objective would simply be to promote those interests.
<P>
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East saw fit to allow us to discuss the issue. He made an extraordinary allegation--he said that he was more pessimistic than I am. If he had supported the Welsh rugby team for the past 20 years, he would be as pessimistic as me. I assure him that I abide by Gramsci's advice that one should always display pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the spirit. The Labour party has often got it the other way around, but I shall not discuss that now.
<P>
I appreciate the motivation behind the amendments, but it is important to consider what the "interests of consumers" really are. Clearly, they extend not only to the narrow consumer interest of high-quality service at low cost, but, as my hon. Friend said, to broader long-term interests in sustainable utility sectors. Who can doubt that consumers have an interest in utilities being able to operate in a viable market with a long-term outlook? How would consumers benefit if the return on shareholder investment were so low that utility companies could not attract the capital needed to maintain their infrastructure, which would ultimately lead to system failure? It is not in consumers' interests--whether those consumers happen to be other commercial organisations among our largest companies or domestic customers--that such companies are able to make excessive profits.
<P>
The trick is to strike the right balance. An objective to protect the interests of consumers gets that balance right. Changing the objective to "promote and protect", or simply to "promote", would risk signalling that the regulator should focus too strongly on narrow short-term interests. That would run counter to the wider interests of consumers.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy) raised the issue of fuel poverty. She has great experience in dealing with the subject. The Government are serious about tackling fuel poverty; it is a high priority. The Bill changes the focus of regulation to that of the protection of consumers, especially the disadvantaged. It also includes guidance on social objectives and a new framework for the Government to set energy efficiency targets. As a fallback, we have introduced a cross-subsidy provision that will come into 197 198 force if the industry falls to act effectively to combat fuel poverty. We hope that the regulated social action fund, which, as my hon. Friend knows, is due to be published shortly, will make use of the cross-subsidy unnecessary. I expect the industry to co-operate fully with the regulator and come up with new ideas on how to support and help the fuel poor, and to turn those ideas rapidly into actions.

<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> Will my hon. Friend congratulate the companies that are already taking steps in that direction? Two that have been brought to my attention are Transco, which is making a huge investment in an affordable warmth programme, and TXU Eastern Energy. Does he agree that the reserve powers would not have to be called on if other utility providers emulated those companies?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That is absolutely right. Other schemes, such as the one that PowerGen runs in conjunction with Age Concern, will also be of enormous help to a great many people. I hope that, in future, all companies will show such a sense of corporate responsibility.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Does the Minister accept that there has been an enormous increase in fuel poverty for car owners, young and old, because the Government's record of increasing duty goes against all that he has said on this issue?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Clearly, I am not here to talk about cars. I shall return to the issue of fuel poverty dealt with under the Bill.
<P>
The social aspects of the Bill and the work of the regulator should be seen as part of a wider programme across Government to tackle fuel poverty. A ministerial group has been set up to ensure that we have a coherent strategy and work programme.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Sawford) rightly pointed out that there has probably never been a more relevant week in which to raise the issues of global warming and the possibility of rising sea levels. We are witnessing horrendous scenes in Mozambique. I am no expert on the question of whether such events have happened before. However, it is 10 years, almost to the day, since the terrible floods more locally, but none the less seriously for those involved, in Tywyn in north Wales. On that occasion, the sea breached the sea wall with horrendous consequences.
<P>
The Government take such issues very seriously. The powers in the Bill will constitute a key instrument in the Government's strategy to stimulate the renewables market. Other key instruments include the climate change levy exemption for renewables, which will shift some of the additional cost from the electricity consumer to the general taxpayer, and enhanced support programmes for renewables worth about £43 million over the next three years, involving research, development, demonstration and dissemination. That will provide the technological help to overcome the barriers to greater deployment. We require a positive strategic approach to planning for renewables. Renewable energy is absolutely essential in helping to  deliver the Government's targets on climate change. It is central to achieving sustainable development while continuing to protect the countryside.
<P>
Although the remaining amendments in the group tackle the subject in different ways, they are all concerned with raising the profile of environmental and social issues in the authority's objectives. Amendments Nos. 18, 19, 21, 22, 23 and 25 would do so by making it part of the principal objective of the Secretary of State and the authority to protect the environment by making efforts to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. I do not wish to be misunderstood. These are all important issues, and, as I shall explain shortly, there is a considerable amount in the Bill directed at achieving positive action on all those fronts.
<P>
However, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments because, noble though their objectives, they are aimed at the wrong target. It is important to remember that the objective of the Secretary of State and of the authority is intended to govern the way in which they exercise their regulatory powers under the gas and electricity Acts, as amended by the Bill. Those powers are primarily concerned with economic regulation of what might collectively be called the supply industry. The authority will not have powers under the electricity and gas Acts directly to regulate the environment or deliver social objectives. In both cases, responsibility for taking direct action properly rests with the Government. Of course, the way in which the authority exercises powers of economic regulation can have important environmental and social effects, and we must ensure that it properly weighs those considerations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am listening carefully to the Minister, who seems to be making many of the points that I have made on social and environmental issues. In many instances, those issues are best dealt with by direct Government action, whether through the Department of Social Security, the Department for Education and Employment or the Department of Health. He is undermining the basis of the Bill, which is to provide economic regulation, enhance competition and bring down prices. The social objectives that the Bill will introduce for the first time are not appropriate to such legislation, and ought more properly to constitute other areas of Government action. The Minister seems to be making that very point.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have tried to make it clear that those considerations will be weighed properly by the authority. That is why clause 9 will require the authority to take account of social and environmental guidance--not directions--issued by the Government. The Bill contains important provisions on electricity from renewable sources and energy efficiency. As I said, those measures are properly a matter for the Government, rather an economic regulator, so they have been drafted to meet the commitment that the Government made in the Green Paper "A Fair Deal for Consumers--Modernising the Framework for Utility Regulation". Measures that impose significant costs should be decided by the Government and implemented through specific legal provision. For those reasons, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate. I thought that the hon. Member for South Dorset intended to keep on speaking until the hon. Members for Lewes and for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) turned up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for believing that I could speak for as long as that. I rather suspect that we will not see those hon. Members until Thursday.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> If that.
<P>
As usual, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton was more perceptive than me. I was arguing that we must ensure that a future regulator is on board in respect of fuel poverty, and the point that my hon. Friend made about those issues was absolutely right.
<P>
I think that it was the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser) who made a point about privatisation. The issue of ownership continues to cloud that of liberalisation. The Government have recognised that the major benefit of privatising the utilities is liberalisation of the markets, and we should not be bound by dogmatic views on ownership of a particular utility. In concentrating on the question of ownership, the hon. Gentleman is fighting a historic battle.
<P>
It is unfortunate that we have discussed this group of amendments this week. As I have said, I am concerned that a future regulator may try to subvert the intentions behind the Government's introduction of social and environmental guidance. I urge the Minister to look again at the matter. I accept that the regulator must concentrate on economic matters, but a balance must be struck between the regulator's activities and achievement of the Government's objectives. As the Ofgas experience shows, the issue was ignored and damage was caused.
<P>
In the offshore industry, there is competition at the point of the beach, which the Department of Trade and Industry regulates, yet the new authority will regulate on the beach. That clearly involves a conflict between the Government and the regulator. The Government should reconsider those issues, and I ask the Minister to do so. I praise the utility companies, such as Scottish Power, that are doing good work in an environmental and social context. It is in their interests to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want to comment on the hon. Gentleman's point about the gas industry. Does he think it rather odd that the Government are doing enormous damage to the environment through their stricter gas consents policy by refusing to allow the building of new gas-fired power stations, which produce 50 per cent. of the CO2 emissions of normal oil-fired or coal-fired power stations? Is the real target of the amendment Executive action in refusing to allow such power stations to be built--unless, of course, they are in Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a rather cheap point, which does not relate to what I was talking about. I do not accept the premise of his argument, and he will not tempt me further down that road.
<P>
I again ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and to recognise that the balance must be right if we are to achieve the objectives that the Government have rightly set. I fear that a loophole is being created by not striking the balance to the degree that I should like. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> All the amendments in this group were tabled by Conservative Members, with the exception of amendments Nos. 235 and 236, which were tabled by Liberal Democrat Members. I am concerned that the Liberal Benches are sometimes not occupied during the Committee's proceedings. My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) has just come from the Trade and Industry Committee, and therefore had a perfectly valid reason for his absence. However, for Liberal Members to table amendments and fail to turn up to speak to them represents a dereliction of duty and exposes their pretence of being a true Opposition party. True opposition is provided by detailed scrutiny: the painstaking work of going through Bills line by line. With the exception of the two members of the press who are present today, the Bill does not generally attract wide press coverage, because it is highly technical. However, this is what Parliament is about: close scrutiny, attention to detail and attendance in Committee, however tedious that may sometimes be. The electorate expect their elected representatives to spend more time doing such work, away from the public eye and the limelight, and less time on quiz shows and appearing in the media.
<P>
The starting point in debating this group of amendments to clause 8, for the gas sector, clause 12, for the electricity sector, and clause 89, for the telecommunications sector, is to look back at the original legislation that privatised those three industries: section 3 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, section 4 of the Gas Act 1986 and section 3 of the Electricity Act 1989. I shall refer initially to section 3(1) of the 1989 Act, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State and the Director<P>
</UL></FONT>--<P>

<P>
that is, the director of Offer--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall each have a duty to exercise the functions assigned or transferred to him this Part in the manner which he considers is best calculated--
<P>
(a) to secure that all reasonable demands for electricity are satisfied;
<P>
(b) to secure that licence holders are able to finance the carrying on of the activities which they are authorised by their licences to carry on; and
<P>
(c) subject to subsection (2) below, to promote competition in the generation and supply of electricity.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Three equal prime duties are placed on the Secretary of State and the regulator before the Bill comes into force. The key objective of all three duties is to ensure security of supply, financial viability and the promotion of competition. That is the essence of the current regulatory regime.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Under the Bill, the sole primary objective is to promote the consumer's interests. Security of supply and financial viability are demoted to secondary duties, and the promotion of competition comes into play only when it is directly appropriate to protecting the interests of the consumer. That is how the Bill is drafted.
<P>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, as the Committee will know, was the principal architect of the successful regulatory regime that has delivered huge falls in costs and in prices to consumers. He devised the retail prices index minus X formula, which was very novel when it was first introduced in this country. The United States, the only other major country that had such a regime in place, used, and still uses to a large extent, the rate of return method of regulating prices, which had the great disadvantage that it gave the public utility companies no incentive to reduce their costs.
<P>
In the United Kingdom, the brilliant methodology of RPI-X over four or five years meant that every pound saved beyond the X figure meant savings for the company, which could be passed on either in lower prices or to the shareholders. When the next review was done five years later with the new lower costs as the base, if the savings had not been passed on to the consumer, the regulator could simply ensure that that was done. It was a brilliant system that Stephen Littlechild devised, and we all benefit from it today.
<P>
Indeed, the RPI-X formula is now being exported around the world. The privatisation programme has been hugely successful. Indeed, one of our great export industries in the service sector is our expertise from the privatisations of the electricity, gas and telecommunications industries, which have been so successful.
<P>
I recommend the Minister to read a short pamphlet--it should not take long--by Professor Littlechild called "Privatisation, Competition and Regulation", which was published yesterday by the Institute of Economic Affairs. He expresses his concern about the Utilities Bill and says on page 34:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There must be a concern that the very success of regulation in bringing about change might be used to bring about further actions or changes in the industries that may serve short-term political ends, but not the longer-term interests of customers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the objective in clauses 8, 12 and 89 is to promote the interests of the consumer, the pressures on the regulator to introduce an immediate benefit to consumers that will not assist in the promotion of competition and therefore will not be in their longer-term interests will be great, notwithstanding the later definition of the consumer with reference to the longer term.
<P>
Professor Littlechild's particular concern about the Bill relates to the duty provisions in clauses 8, 12 and 89. It is important to quote him, because he sums the issue up well. In "Privatisation, Competition and Regulation", he goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Utility regulators at present have a primary duty (among others) to promote competition, and a secondary duty (again among others) to protect the interests of customers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The duty to protect the consumer still exists, even in the current regime, but it is part and parcel of the overall objective, which is to promote competition. He goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The government's Green Paper proposes to replace this by a single primary duty to protect the interests of consumers, wherever... appropriate through promoting effective competition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what the Bill says, too.
<P>
Professor Littlechild goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Most regulators felt that making the protection of customers a primary duty was not a problem but largely unnecessary, since they were already required to protect the interests of customers and sought to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what I have just said: it is already a duty in the Bill, albeit not a primary duty. Whenever the regulators are assessing what the price cap should be for a period and how they will regulate the industries, the consumer's interests are paramount. The purpose of regulation is to mimic a competitive market. Monopolies can often exploit the customer, so to prevent the utilities from doing that, they will always have regard to the interests of the consumer.
<P>
Professor Littlechild goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>But the proposed wording of the change here--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, in the duty clauses--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> may be positively unhelpful in so far as it puts an additional obstacle in the way of regulators promoting competition. The duty to promote competition will no longer be unqualified. This will have to be demonstrated to be the most appropriate way to protect customers.
<P>
There is the difficulty. Under the previous regime, the objective that the regulator always sought was the promotion of competition. Now, the regulator will have to overcome the extra hurdle that the primary duty in the Bill is to protect the consumer. The regulator will have to be able to demonstrate that that promotion of competition will directly protect the interests of the consumer, and that will not always be the case.
<P>
Professor Littlechild goes on to say:
<P>
 The Green Paper notes that, in defining the interests of consumers, new weight should be given to their longer and medium-term interests as well as their immediate or shorter-term interests.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the point that arises later in the Bill.
<P>
As Professor Hayek and others have pointed out, the long-run benefits of competition in terms of innovation and flexibility are never easy to prove in any particular case. There will be no shortage of companies willing to argue the opposite, perhaps even to the Competition Commission, and in judicial review.
<P>
As a result of the provision in clause 8 about protecting the interests of the consumer,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the problem arises that it is always difficult to provide evidence that will stand up in court. The Bill will ultimately be a statute that can be challenged in the courts by anybody aggrieved by regulators not adhering to the strict words in a statute. It is difficult to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that a pro-competition measure will lead to better service and lower prices for the consumer.
<P>
My view is clear, as is that of many academics: promoting competition will always benefit the consumer; but when it is a choice between direct action by the authority that clearly protects the consumer and action that is more indirect but protects the consumer in the longer term by promoting greater competition, it is difficult for the courts to judge which will be most in line with the duties imposed by the clause.
<P>
I have quoted Professor Littlechild's pamphlet at length, not only because of his long experience as a regulator and his pre-eminence in utility regulation, but because it succinctly sums up the issues of concern in the key clauses.
<P>
The promotion of competition and the creation and delivery of a competitive market are much the best way of protecting the interests of the consumer. The current regulatory model, which the Bill seeks to overturn, 205 206 delivered 30 per cent. lower electricity and gas prices and 50 per cent. lower telephone prices. In addition, more and new opportunities and choices have emerged for consumers. As the Minister said earlier, the PowerGen arrangement with Age Concern is one of many innovative ideas that are emerging from a competitive market. I believe strongly that many more similarly competitive products will begin to appear in the utilities sector, provided that full competition is allowed to flow. The concern is that the Bill will stop new competition and new entrants coming into the market and therefore stifle the development of those products. Later in the Bill we shall debate the penalty provisions, whose existence and draconian nature may limit the innovative tendencies of the private sector, which fears that any new product could incur a future penalty.
<P>
The operators group that competition is the key to ensuring value and choice for consumers and that it promotes efficiency, drives down prices and creates the right environment for investment, innovation and enterprise. It also said that only when competition is insufficiently effective or technically limited to particular forms of resale should continued sector economic regulation and additional structures for the protection of consumers be needed. That is the view of a large segment of the telecommunications industry.
<P>
Putting the duty to protect consumers above all else may, in the short term, conflict with measures to promote competition. Amendments Nos. 55, 56 and 57 would put into clauses 8, 12 and 89 respectively the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> wherever possible, and insofar as it is appropriate to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those primary objectives clauses currently state that the objective of the regulatory regime is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> to protect the interests of consumers . . . wherever appropriate<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 by promoting competition. The amendments would add "wherever possible, and . . . appropriate" to the key duty that the Bill imposes on the regulators and the Secretary of State.
<P>
The Government must be aware that that phrase has been removed from the Bill and that the amendments would put it back. It was used throughout the Govemment's consultation documents leading up to the Bill and even in their response to the consultation document. Proposal 3.1 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A new single primary duty should be inserted into the relevant utility statutes, requiring the utility regulators to exercise their functions in a manner best calculated to protect the interests of consumers, wherever possible and appropriate through promoting effective competition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Astonishingly, the phrase "wherever possible" has not appeared in the final draft of the Bill and we believe that that is an error. It makes an enormous difference to the interpretation of the clause.
<P>
 The word "appropriate" refers to whether a particular course of action is suitable or proper and, therefore, seems to be within the discretion of the relevant authority. The term imposes no obligation to act wherever it is possible to do so. The word "possible" means capable of existing or being achieved, and in the context of the amendment becomes an imperative imposing a requirement to secure competition wherever possible, except where such a course of action would be inappropriate. Will the Minister explain why the phrase, which remained intact throughout the Government's series of consultation documents, was suddenly removed from the Bill?
<P>
I turn to amendments Nos. 212, 213 and 214. The teeth and meat of the regulatory regime are the licence conditions. The regulator delivers his instructions to the utility companies when issuing new licences or amending existing licence conditions. The Bill was designed, deliberately or otherwise, to create continual pressure on the regulator to provide increasing licence changes and new conditions for the utilities to follow. The consumer councils will be partisan activists and will continually pursue what they perceive to be the interests of consumers. The Minister told the Committee that they will be partisan in pursuing the cause of consumers. The regulator is bound to take note and implement their demands and recommendations, however partisan, activist and extreme, because the regulator's primary objective is the protection of consumers. The consumer council, rather than the regulator, will be the statutory voice of the consumer. Under clauses 8, 12 and 89, the regulator will be bound in law to implement all the consumer councils' recommendations, regardless of the cost of such measures, or of their effect on encouraging new competition, on security of supply or on financial viability.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sure that there will be some very activist consumer councils. The Minister's letter has stated that they are to employ large numbers of people--for example, between 100 and 140 in the energy consumer councils' organisation. They will inevitably be drawn into the consumer lobby industry, and their recommendations will become the de facto interests of the consumer, regardless of whether they are so in reality. The regulator will then be forced to implement them.
<P>
The amendments seek to put some common sense back into those duties, and to redress the balance by requiring the regulatory authorities to do three things: to ensure that the regulatory burden imposed by licences is the minimum necessary to attain the authority's objectives; secondly, to keep such conditions under review; and, thirdly, to modify or revoke any conditions that impose a regulatory burden that is not necessary to attain the authority's objectives.
<P>
The authority must, therefore, have clear aims when it sets new licence conditions for the specific objective of a particular regulation. Without setting that specific objective, no matter whether the purpose of the regulation is social, environmental or consumerist, the regulator will be unable to assess whether aims have been met. When such an objective has been achieved, it will be time for those conditions or regulations to be revoked or repealed. Without the amendments, the Bill will simply provide for perpetual regulation, and the regulators will keep finding jobs for themselves, even in a fully competitive market.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 206, 207 and 208 require the Government to prepare reports annually for Parliament on, respectively, the gas, electricity and telecommunications markets. Those reports would assess the status of competition in the market and the events of the previous 12 months. They would also provide a review of any legislation that might impede or discourage competition and recommendations on repealing or amending regulations. The amendments provide for a mechanism for dismantling the regulatory regime once full competition had arrived, or once the objectives of the regulation had been met. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 55, 56 and 57. I thank the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for summarising Professor Littlechild's paper, and for listing his many achievements. His chief success was the formulation of the equation RPI  X. That saved us from the appalling fallout that would have resulted if we had adopted another system, such as the American systems of sliding scales or rates of return, which would have been a job-creation scheme for accountants, tax advisers and lawyers.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to pay tribute to Professor Littlechild, although he did not get it entirely right, because I recall that the country was left with its sensitive parts firmly in the grip of some very powerful generators for a long time, until that part of the market became subject to real competition. Nevertheless, he has done us all a favour in reminding us that Professor Littlechild is still thinking about such matters. He is a great source of information on them.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also quoted Professor Hayek, and I am surprised that he did not cite Professor Patrick Minford or any other member of the great body of thinkers lurking in our universities. Professor Minford is a great man and a friend of mine. [Laughter.]
<P>
The principal objective of the regulator is to protect the interests of consumers. However, he should do so whenever appropriate by promoting effective competition. That requirement is built into the principal objective and is, consequently, the regulator's primary duty. The intent is to establish a presumption in favour of competition as the means through which the interests of consumers should be protected. Whether promoting competition is the best way in which to protect consumers in any particular regulatory circumstance is, of course, a matter of judgment for the regulator. That decision will depend on a number of factors, including the practicalities of introducing or increasing competition, and the cost of establishing the competitive arrangements and benefits of competition--many of which may be long term or uncertain--compared with other forms of regulatory control.
<P>
Emphasising competition will ensure the maximum penetration consistent with practical, economic and other constraints that prevail in those sectors. However, as I am sure the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will acknowledge, there are some activities for which competition alone is unable to protect consumers' interests. There are natural monopolies, such as gas pipeline networks, which will always require an element of regulation, and, often, it will not make economic sense to duplicate those networks. In those and similar circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the regulator to protect the interests of consumers by promoting competition alone. Other means of regulatory protection would be required.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 55, 56 and 57 would replace the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>wherever possible, and insofar as it is appropriate to do so, by promoting effective competition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That wording would indeed provide that the regulator should protect consumers' interests by promoting competition wherever possible, except where it judges such promotion inappropriate. However, as it is drafted, the Bill will in any case have that effect, and there is no need for the amendments' convoluted wording. Therefore, I invite the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Given that we will probably have a wider discussion of this concept during the clause stand part debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. According to my selection list, the first amendment in this group is No. 109. Is it usual for Committee members to fail to turn up to debate amendments that they have tabled?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. It is up to 'individual Committee members to take their own decisions on such matters, and we are not prevented from debating other amendments that form part of the group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am most grateful to you, Mrs. Roe, for your indulgence. Although Liberal Democrats are not in attendance, official Opposition Members are available to take the debate forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> It is my understanding that the hon. Member for Lewes was once nominated environmental campaigner of the year. Should he not give back that title?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I do not want to insult someone who is not present to hear the insult--I usually prefer to stab people in the front, rather than the back. Perhaps the hon. Member for Lewes compared the impact of his amendments with that of using his car to travel to the House today and decided that, on balance, staying at home was the more environmentally friendly option. I do not know whether he will get another opportunity to discuss these matters.
<P>
As with many of the amendments that we have discussed, mine would effect the same change to three different clauses. Amendments Nos. 340 and 341 deal with clause 8; Nos. 311 and 312 deal with clause 12; and Nos. 306 and 307 deal with clause 89.

I give the Committee and the Government two options: the word "fairness" or the word "equality".
<P>
In some ways, my amendments are probing ones. What is the authority supposed to be doing for the four named groups of people? Is the intention to make the four groups better off than the average consumer, or is the Govemrnent's intention to say to the authority, "These are four groups of people who, because of their special circumstances, may be worse off than the ordinary consumer"? Is subsection (3) designed to make the position for those four groups better than the average consumer, or worse?
<P>
If one says, "Individuals who are of pensionable age should all be better off than the average consumer", that is a ridiculous. As we all know, there are already two classes of pensioner. Some have investments and a good pension from their workplace, and may have invested a large amount of money. Such pensioners are much better off than the average consumer.
<P>
When I was a parliamentary private secretary in the Department of Social Security, some work was done on exactly what was happening in relation to pensions. There are lies, damned lies and statistics, but, however much the Labour party accused the Government of being nasty to pensioners, they were the people whose incomes increased fastest in the last 10 years of the Conservative Government. That disguises the fact that a particular group of pensioners were doing extraordinarily well--their investments were doing well, and their pensions were paying out well--while another group were reliant on the old age pension and income support. Do the Government intend to tell the authority to introduce policies under which everyone who is not a  pensioner contributes towards pensioners' fuel bills, because there will be cross-subsidy between the two?
<P>
My amendments take account of the fact that, in certain circumstances, a pensioner, especially one who is poor, will have different needs from the ordinary consumer. There might be a regulation that referred to people who are cut off from electricity, gas or telecommunications. It might be essential for someone of pensionable age not to be cut off from water, electricity, gas or telecommunications. I am not attempting to make pensioners better off than other consumers. I am simply saying that other consumers can collect water if they have been cut off--
<P>
<B>Ms Perham:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument about pensioners having different incomes. Some pensioners have been prudent--I think that that is the word but the clause covers those with low incomes. Does that not answer the hon. Gentleman's point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but Members of Parliament have to be pedantic lawyers. The clause specifically refers to "individuals of pensionable age"--
<P>
