[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Oh.&#148;] Well,
companies have to be customer-focused rather than production-led. I was

got there in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7575</b><a name="10010538000197"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): The carbon capture and storage
competition was launched way back in 2007 and we were told that it
would be at least 2014 before a plant was up and running, even as a
pilot. Why is it taking so long to get the technology to a usable
stage?</div><a name="10010538000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> We haven&#146;t really started getting
the technology to a usable stage; we have been trying to get the
funding to a usable stage. I think that the main point is that you can
only start developing the technology seriously once you get the money
to do a feed. We are just about to do that. You then have to go through
the feed stage and actually build your plant, so the clock has not
really started ticking properly
yet.</div><a name="10010538000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
White:</b></i> My point of view as somebody who has come from
the financing end is that, by wanting people to do carbon capture and
storage, you want them to do something for which the market will not
reward them at the moment. It is therefore important to get the funding
mechanism sorted out first before people will lift a
spanner.</div><a name="10010538000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> It is a great pity that it has taken such a
long time to get to the point that we are at now. We could have got
here more quickly. The Energy Bill is extremely welcome from that point
of view. We need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>learn the lessons associated with the competition on the first project
and not make the same mistakes in regard to timing. Time is not on our
side.</div><a name="10010538000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><a name="10010538000198"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tobias Ellwood</b> (Bournemouth, East) (Con): If we had
introduced the same Bill five years ago, would we have been at a
disadvantage because we did not have the technology or the know-how, or
would we just have saved ourselves five
years?</div><a name="10010538000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> No, we would not have been disadvantaged by
technology. There have not been significant strides in technology in
that period, so we would have been further ahead than we are
now.</div>
<a name="10010538000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><a name="10010538000199"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Phil Willis</b> (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (LD): Who is
leading the race? I can remember meeting you five years ago when we
were doing a Select Committee report on carbon capture. At that point
we were ready with the technology, but we had no funding in place. Who
in the five years since then has started to get a lead on
us?</div><a name="10010538000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> There are a number of countries. The USA
certainly has extensive plans with support arrangements already put in
place for a number of projects. Canada has three projects which were
between the time that the funding was announced in total, and the
projects were selected through competition and allocated. It took less
than a year, so compare that with the time scale that we have just been
talking about and obviously we are slipping behind. The first
commercial size power project in the world may well be in China. The
second one may well be in Abu Dhabi. This Energy Bill is an opportunity
for the UK to regain the lost ground. We must seize this opportunity
and move on with
it.</div><a name="10010538000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000200"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> So you don&#146;t believe that it is a lack of
investment by the Government over the last five years in R and D that
has held us back; it is purely a lack of policy
direction.</div><a name="10010538000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> I very often say that the only thing that is
holding up the development of CCS is policy. Policy falls into two
areas: one is regulation and that has already been addressed by the
Energy Act 2008 and the other is the financial incentive to do it and
that is being addressed by this Bill. I am sure that Jon would have
more to say on R and
D.</div><a name="10010538000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> R and D really gets a stimulus once
people start to think about serious projects. You can think about them
in a vacuum, but there is nothing like having to do a real design to
stimulate real
development.</div><a name="10010538000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><a name="10010538000201"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): With about 240
years of energy requirement beneath our feet in coal seams, this carbon
capture and storage was a great opportunity for this country, yet
Professor Stuart Haszeldine has described the CCS competition as
&#147;dead on its feet&#148; with only ScottishPower potentially
being able to deliver by 2014. How feasible is the Government&#146;s
target of having a genuine demonstration model up and running? Should
we have done much more earlier to have a more competitive scenario than
we appear to
have?</div><a name="10010538000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> Part of the problem is that it is
competitive. The competition has been very limited in that, for
example, the various contestants cannot collaborate. They cannot talk
to each other. They cannot share 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>information. That certainly is a problem. If we had been able to go for
a single project that was run by a consortium of utilities, then we
would have moved faster. But equally you have to look at things in
perspective. CCS really only hit the ground at the Gleneagles
conference in 2005. In some respects things have moved slowly. But how
fast do things move in politics? Most people I guess in this room had
not seriously thought CCS was on the table until 2005. We have come on
quite a way&#151;keep things in perspective a little bit
there.</div>
<a name="10010538000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
White:</b></i> I think there is something else missing here
which is addressed in the Bill and that is a realisation that the
market by itself as it is currently designed will not deliver a
low-carbon economy with sufficient speed. If we are willing to say,
&#147;Okay we&#146;ve got to interfere in the market in some
way,&#148; we can get over that problem that Mrs. Thatcher
gave us where we believed that market forces were the best thing since
sliced bread. When we realise that markets can do some things, but they
are not very good at doing others we can start to move. But until we
get a financeable arrangement whereby people can be confident that they
will be rewarded if they make their plant and it works, carbon capture
and storage will be dead.</div>
<a name="10010538000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> Can I just add something? On the market,
it is interesting that the idea that you needed something beyond the
carbon price to support renewables got there a little bit earlier. You
have exactly the same issues with carbon capture and storage. It is
new, it costs more money. The carbon price does not support renewables,
although it goes to help support them, and it does not support CCS in
the same way. Because it said &#147;carbon&#148; and people thought
of capturing carbon dioxide, they equated the carbon price with support
for CCS. That took a while to work through the
system.</div><a name="10010538000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> What is being proposed by the Bill and the
associated policy documents, is probably one of the best proposals that
exist&#151;probably the best for financial support in the world.
Every other support mechanism in the world is a kind of
sticking-plaster support. It is usually capital support but on a
project-by-project
basis.</div><a name="10010538000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
mechanism of a levy on electricity and the return of the levy, probably
by a contract for differences, has the potential for a support
mechanism that can be rolled into the future and be self-adjusting,
because it is a contract for differences. As the price of CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>in the marketplace firms, the cost of the levy will adjust itself
accordingly. We have an excellent proposal, and the Government should
be congratulated on dreaming it up. It could be rolled out into the
future beyond four projects. We are really pleased to say that there
are four projects; there will be four projects in the UK and the sooner
we get on and build them, the
better.</div><a name="10010538000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
80</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000202"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> But if it is such an excellent proposal, why have
we got only two bidders for four projects? Why do we not have more
bidders?</div><a name="10010538000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> Because the proposal has not been there.
The proposal is being developed. Once people say, &#147;We have had
the Bill; we have had the secondary legislation,&#148; then people
will start
bidding.</div><a name="10010538000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010538000203"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> You think more people will come
forward.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div><a name="10010538000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> Oh yes. Do not forget that we had nine
bidders for one project in the first place. That is a demonstration
that industry is keen and ready to get moving in this
area.</div><a name="10010538000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000204"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> We had a series of representatives from companies
this morning, as you are probably aware. You made reference to E.ON and
ScottishPower, but the others said they have turned their backs on this
and have moved their interests elsewhere. It did not sound at all like
they were willing to see the Bill passed into an Act of Parliament and
then be knocking on the doors of the Department trying to sign
up.</div><a name="10010538000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> They have left the competition. Maybe
Jeff will say something, but my anecdotal experience is that if you
tell people that it is going to be the competition all over again, they
get a bit worried. If it is a market-based mechanism that extends to a
wider range of projects&#151;that does not have this
anti-collaboration clause in it&#151;it starts to make a lot more
sense.</div>
<a name="10010538000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
82</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000205"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Can I just come in? That is an important point
because there is a difference between our witnesses this morning and
what you are saying. It is important to stress that. One of the big
issues that we were given this morning was that pre-combustion was
ruled out of the competition, which therefore affected a number of
people who were particularly interested. I declare an interest in
pre-combustion, as I personally think capture post-combustion is
madness. Do you think that was the real reason that they pulled out or
were they just not prepared to make the investment in the
technology?</div><a name="10010538000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> Yes, half of the nine that were put forward
were pre-combustion projects. In the main, they still exist. There were
four, and at least three of them still exist. You can expect at least
three pre-combustion projects coming forward. They still exist on paper
as development
projects.</div><a name="10010538000042"></a>

Willis:</b> I am confused as to what we are talking about.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I&#146;m sorry, but this is
important. My understanding was that the competition basically ruled
out pre-combustion. What you are saying is that once the competition is
over and company A has won it, the other three projects&#151;the
Government want to have four altogether&#151;could all be
pre-combustion.</div>
<a name="10010538000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>The other important
difference is that the competition was for 300 or 400 MW&#151;this is
a little confusing&#151;whereas the Bill talks about demonstration
projects and additional CCS at the demonstration plants. That is an
important difference.</div>
<a name="10010538000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> You could envisage a situation where the two
projects which are currently finalists in the competition may be built,
one as the competition project and one as one of the other three, and
then the other two of the four could be the two out of the three or
more pre-combustion capture projects that are presently on the drawing
board.</div><a name="10010538000045"></a>

through the hoops of the competition, which are quite restrictive, or
would you rather wait for a market mechanism and let someone else be on
the bleeding edge, sorting out all the regulations and things like
that? Being a strong follower is often better than being a leader.

88</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000212"></a>John
Robertson:</b> Are you saying that the Government should be
put in a position of using selective powers to choose who they want for
the other three? That is the kind of thing we really don&#146;t want.
We want this to be open, and to take the
best.</div><a name="10010538000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> You may well not want it to be open. We
have already talked about wanting a range of technologies. There could
be reasons to have a range  of technologies. There could be
reasons to have a range of fuels, not just coal. I think you have to
keep it in mind that this is not pure market forces coming in. It is an
assistance to the market, and it is doing several things, so you might
restrict competition within certain
areas.</div><a name="10010538000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
you want to analyse where the competition has gone wrong, one of the
biggest areas where it went wrong was that it seems to have precluded
collaboration between the utilities, yet one of the most effective ways
of getting some of these plants built and of transferring information
would be to allow several UK utilities to take a share in a project and
to share the risk and the
learning.</div><a name="10010538000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> The Government would do well to take a
lesson from Alberta, where the competition selection process has taken
place so much more quickly than it has here in the UK. It is obviously
over-complicated.</div><a name="10010538000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> That may have been necessary because of
EU rules. That is
possible.</div><a name="10010538000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000213"></a>John
Robertson:</b> So if you were advising the Government
today&#151;and you can, because they are sitting with us&#151;how
would you get them to change the rules for the other three
projects?</div><a name="10010538000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> Well, certainly it should be a much more
streamlined process in respect of the projects. The essence of the
first project is that it has been treated as a public procurement
exercise rather than as an energy sector programme, like the renewables
obligation or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>something like that. It was treated in the same fashion as buying a
submarine, which obviously entails a completely different process. That
was probably the mistake. I am not really qualified to speak on the
subject, but that is my
view.</div><a name="10010538000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
White:</b></i> If I can add something there, I do not think
you should underestimate the amount of collaboration that it would be
important to allow. Also, do not underestimate the negative impact it
had by the as-perceived change of rules in the competition. Some
companies had set themselves up as a single company to do a project:
they raised money from their shareholders and had a certain burn rate
as they were working. Then all of a sudden the rules changed and they
were effectively out of business. So they are no
more.</div><a name="10010538000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
90</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000214"></a>John
Robertson:</b> The problem that I have with collaboration is
that it can also be seen as manipulation, in that it is unfair
competition if you have a collaborative
view.</div><a name="10010538000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> I think it is very important in the early
stages of the development of the CCS industry that there is the maximum
degree of collaboration. Most of those in the industry would agree with
that. Most of the industry players would be unhappy when they lose the
competition, but they would be happy to see that projects were being
developed, even if it was by someone else, to get the show on the road.
I am sure that the whole industry is behind the concept that the most
important thing is to get the show on the road as quickly as
possible.</div><a name="10010538000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> Maybe the problem there was that if you
only have one project you cannot have competition between
projects&#151;to keep everybody honest. Once you have multiple
projects, if the same consortium is not bidding for every one,
automatically you have
competition.</div><a name="10010538000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
91</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000215"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I am confused, as other Committee members are. We
heard this morning that there was much concern on the part of all the
companies that considered, or were successful at putting bids in, about
the selection process and so forth. The impression I am getting from
you is that you seem to imply that this is an effective mechanism for
funding CCS demonstration projects, but perhaps that the process of
going through a competition and selection&#151;we are now dealing
with the aftermath of that, with those people who deliberately avoided
the competition now able to jump on the bandwagon&#151;has not been a
success story at all. Would that be fair, without putting words into
your
mouth?</div><a name="10010538000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> It has been a learning exercise,
hasn&#146;t
it?</div><a name="10010538000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010538000216"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> Very delicately
put.</div><a name="10010538000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> No, it has. Look, basically the country
thought that it would get us where we wanted to get by having one
demonstration project and by learning. At that point we were being
advised that our target for 2050 was a 60 per cent. reduction. Since
then we have been advised that the target ought to be 80 per cent. That
changes things dramatically. This is not about CCS in a vacuum, but
about hitting emission targets. Now our target for 2050 has changed
significantly. It is not really a change from 60 to 80; it is 40 per
cent. emissions to 20 per cent.&#151;it is halving the emissions: it
is a big deal. And it has changed from 2030.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div><a name="10010538000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> But actually it is more than that, because
we are now talking about total decarbonisation of the power sector by
2030. That means not just CCS on all the coal-fired plants: it means
CCS on all the gas-fired plants by 2030 as well. If you start working
backwards from 2030, we have an awful lot to do to fill in that
gap.</div><a name="10010538000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
92</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000217"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> With that in mind, those who are reading or
watching this might not necessarily know their E.ONs from their
National Grids and will be wondering why, given that we have just had
this huge summit in Copenhagen&#151;there will another one in Bonn
and in Mexico next year&#151;there is not more collaboration across
the world to try to get CCS sorted. We seem to be reinventing the wheel
here.</div><a name="10010538000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
said at the beginning that the US, Canada, China&#151;I was surprised
to learn&#151;and Abu Dhabi are all pushing forward with this and are
five years ahead of us at the moment. Why is there not some form
of&#151;</div><a name="10010538000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> I do not think they are five years
ahead. I think you
assume&#151;</div><a name="10010538000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010538000218"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> That came about because of my
perhaps&#151;</div><a name="10010538000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> We are maybe five years behind where we
could be, but we would have then been very clearly ahead. There is
plenty of collaboration. I am working very closely with people in China
on CCS, but what we are talking about is not a scientific exercise.
This is an exercise in demonstrating and exploring a commitment to
full-sized plants. It is not about inventing things, but about
demonstrating and learning by doing. That is a very different
problem.</div>
<a name="10010538000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">What you have
to show for the likes of China is not that we know how to build a
plant&#151;they know in principle that we do know how to do
that&#151;but that we have done it, we have the conviction to do it
and we&#146;re prepared to pay the price for decarbonising fossil
fuel, for no other reason than climate change. That&#146;s really
what it&#146;s about. It&#146;s about large-scale commitment, not
some scientific
exercise.</div><a name="10010538000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> There is huge international collaboration
going on, on a technical as well as a policy level. As testimony to
that, we had the carbon sequestration leadership forum, the ministerial
meeting here in London chaired by Ed Miliband. We had Steven Chu from
the USA, along with a lot of other Ministers from around the world.
There was tremendous consensus about what needs to be done to get CCS
under way. We also have the Global Carbon Capture and Storage
Institute, which is at the moment looking at all the barriers to
investment in CCS throughout the
world.</div><a name="10010538000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is collaboration on trying to ensure that all the different
technologies are covered all around the world. There is collaboration
in Europe&#151;at a European level&#151;co-ordinated by the
Commission, although there are some faults in that area, which I
won&#146;t waste time in going into. But yes, there is an awful lot
of collaboration. Why should we be there? We should be there because
this is going to be a massive market in the future and we need to be
part of
it.</div><a name="10010538000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
93</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000219"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I do not doubt that at all. You actually make my
argument for me&#151;the fact that this will be a massive
market&#151;but it feels as though we are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>the tail-end Charlies here. We are actually coming behind these other
countries. You say there is collaboration. Why isn&#146;t there
evidence of that, with those companies perhaps working in a
collaborative process&#151;which I think is something that you wanted
to see anyway&#151;and participating in this competition, to see that
we get, rather than just four, the nine projects that you talked about
before?</div><a name="10010538000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> At an industry level, there certainly is
collaboration. All the members of the CCSA are collaborating at all
levels. We should bear it in mind that many of these organisations are
multinational. Obviously, the power companies are multinational; the
oil and gas companies are multinational. Shell, for example, is
developing a project in Canada and is also part of the Longannet team.
E.ON is developing projects in Germany and elsewhere. All these people
are collaborating in their own sector and working with one another,
especially in the research
sector.</div><a name="10010538000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010538000220"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We need to move on. Mike
Weir.</div><a name="10010538000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
94</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000221"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> We have talked about pre and post-combustion, but
Professor Gibbins, you said that the Bill needed to be extended to
cover natural gas and other fuels. Can you tell us why that is; and,
given the discussion that we have had, is research and development
already going on into CCS with natural gas in the
UK?</div><a name="10010538000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> The reason why the Bill needs to take in
natural gas is that it seems likely that because we now have these
quite stringent targets for 2030, we will have to fit a significant
amount of natural gas plant with carbon capture and storage in the
2020s. To be able to plan for that, you need to have demonstrated the
technology and to have the reference plants to look at and say,
&#147;This is how it&#146;s done,&#148; and to be absolutely
clear about what you&#146;re doing. That&#146;s why you would work
on
gas.</div><a name="10010538000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
regards the research and development, there&#146;s never enough
research and development. In fact, it&#146;s very, very hard to do it
without large-scale plants being built. That is to say you don&#146;t
get meaningful R and D without any practical examples of the problems
that are coming up, so that will come. We&#146;re in a position of
knowing how to get started in trialling CCS on natural
gas.</div><a name="10010538000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
95</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000222"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> But one of the reasons given for concentrating on
post-combustion on coal was to create an export industry basically in
CCS technology. Are we in danger of effectively having to import
natural gas technology to meet needs in the
2020s?</div><a name="10010538000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> The most important thing to export from
a post-combustion on coal demonstration is the idea. China is not going
to decarbonise its industry with technology imported from the UK. It
might well decarbonise its industry if it tries to emulate what we do
as an exemplar country. It is not the technology per se. Yes, there
will be some export, probably, but the main thing is to export the
concept.</div>
<a name="10010538000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was why
it was brought in. Although China is experimenting with pre-combustion
capture&#151;partly, I think, because it is emulating FutureGen in
the States and that was just a good project to do&#151;it has a great
amount of very new, quite advanced pulverised coal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>technology that will have to be retrofitted with some sort of capture.
It will not be closed down. That is the only way that we will
decarbonise China.</div>
<a name="10010538000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It makes
sense, but think about ideas rather than just necessarily physical
designs. Coming on to the Bill, it is about developing technology and
learning, but it is also about demonstrating commitment to spend the
money to generate gigawatts of power decarbonised by carbon capture and
storage.</div><a name="10010538000088"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><a name="10010538000223"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): Can I ask some
questions about the levy system and the assistance scheme following
from it? You have said, Mr. Chapman, that it is a very
workable and sound mechanism. How do you think it might best be
implemented in terms of fairness to the sector? Do you favour
simplicity in terms of market share, carbon intensity or other
mechanisms for levying money across the
sectors?</div><a name="10010538000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> We still have a lot of work to do on that. I
ought to say that it has the potential to be a very workable system,
provided that it is made simple and practical. I would expect that we
would spend quite a long time with DECC and Ofgem in the near
future&#151;I certainly have a meeting with both of them in the next
couple of weeks&#151;to begin putting some flesh on the bones about
how it will work.</div>
<a name="10010538000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000224"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> So what would you say at that point about
renewable supplies, for example? Should they be in or out of the
levy?</div><a name="10010538000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> I think that they should be in; it would be
a shame to eliminate any particular sector. In effect, renewables is a
levy on the whole of electricity consumption anyway, because the cost
of the renewables obligation gets passed through to all consumers. It
would not be fair on fossil fuels to apply the levy only to a
particular sector of electricity production. I do not think that that
would be equitable; it certainly would not be a level playing field.
Bear in mind that fossil fuel power generation is already penalised by
having to buy allowances under the EU ETS, so it already carries a cost
burden.</div><a name="10010538000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
98</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000225"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Most of the assistance scheme will be
determined by secondary legislation, but how do you think it can best
be organised to ensure that assistance goes to schemes in the best
way&#151;for example, for building oversized pipes for future
development?  Would that be in the assistance scheme, or would
it be beyond
it?</div><a name="10010538000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> We ought to consider something beyond the
assistance scheme. Bearing in mind that we are potentially talking not
just about power stations but about cement plants and steel works, we
should not be applying a levy on electricity consumers to support
infrastructure for other industries. That would not be right.</div>
<a name="10010538000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
hand, as things are at the moment, we would like to see the Bill passed
and get the show on the road as quickly as possible. We can discuss the
other things at some point a bit later. We might need another amendment
to an Energy Bill at some later date, but I do not think that we can
take that into account at the moment. I think the Government needs to
come out on the matter of infrastructure because that has not been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>properly thought through&#151;well, it may have been properly thought
through, but it certainly has not been properly pronounced
upon.</div><a name="10010538000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
White:</b></i> There is the rub. The problem is that if we
had the proposed system, we would end up having every pipe built just
to the right size, as opposed to economies of scale being taken account
of. Those could flow from having a series of hubs&#151;let us say
four in the UK&#151;and optimising the way they
work.</div><a name="10010538000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jon
and I have just been on a committee brought together by Lord Oxburgh on
how to do carbon capture and storage. I believe that you have all
received a copy of our proposal. We said that you need to go a bit
further and recognise that the market price of carbon will not deliver
carbon capture and storage in the long or short terms because it is a
very capital-intensive technology. We proposed taking the levy idea a
step further and having a monopoly buyer of carbon. It would be a
carbon capture organisation that worked in the same way as the
non-fossil fuel obligation used to work. It would pay for carbon, or
companies would pay it for taking the carbon away. It would be assured
of always having sufficient income to pay for the capital that it had
to buy through the levy on
customers.</div><a name="10010538000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless
you can reduce the risk of investing in very capital-intensive bits of
plant, you will be dealing with really high prices. By having the
ability to guarantee the income to service the debt that you incur by
building the large plant, you can get costs down for the customers. An
overall organisation could take the judgment that a nine-inch pipe
would do for one plant, but that if there is another plant nearby that
will come on later, a 14-inch pipe should be used. By being able to
anticipate where the demand will come from, such an organisation would
not fall into the problems that the National Grid has had of being
unable to anticipate where generation will come forward. It is able to
respond only to people wanting to build power stations. We now have the
situation where it cannot connect to all the power stations around the
country.</div><a name="10010538000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
99</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000226"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> That underwrites the idea, which I imagine you
would endorse, that the levy should essentially be a public good
outcome with knowledge and infrastructure sharing for the future on the
basis of the investment of the levy, and not a particular advantage to
one company or
another.</div><a name="10010538000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
White:</b></i> Exactly. But that is why it would pay private
sector people to do various things for it. It would effectively be a
kind of public good. The trouble is that we are all kidding ourselves
about the value or price of carbon and saying that the market is giving
a price for carbon. That is just not true. The market in our EU ETS
sets the price of carbon based on the abatement costs at the margin.
That is why we have quite low prices at the moment. The value of carbon
to future generations has nothing to do with the marginal costs of coal
and gas, which set the price now. We should not be scared of having to
intervene in some way. The market cannot deliver what I would call the
proper
value.</div><a name="10010538000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> There is a tendency to regard the levy as
something like a tax or public subsidy. We ought to think about this as
starting to generate an added-value kind of electricity. Just as we buy
organic potatoes, we will buy carbon-free electricity and pay a bit
more for it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="10010538000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
White:</b></i> Yes, but in paying a bit more for it and
having this quasi-monopoly, you lower the cost to the customer. That is
the important
point.</div><a name="10010538000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
100</b><a name="10010538000227"></a><b class="B">Natascha
Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): You were talking
earlier about gas and coal and about decarbonising the whole power
sector by 2030. How transferable in reality and in practice is the CCS
technology from coal-fired to gas-fired power
stations?</div><a name="10010538000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> There are some specific differences in
the technology in the sense that when you are dealing with gas, as it
stands, you have a much lower concentration of carbon dioxide in the
flue gases from which you are trying to capture the CO<span class="Sub">2</span>. So
you would want to design your plant in a different way. You might also
want to modify the gas turbines themselves by sending the combustion
products around again to get more CO<span class="Sub">2</span> added to them. That is
something that is specific to natural gas
plants.</div><a name="10010538000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
101</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000228"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> What I am interested in finding out is whether we
need completely different kinds of demonstration projects or whether
the demonstration projects that we are planning on&#151;whether it is
post or pre-combustion&#151;will be sufficient to give us the answers
that we need on
gas.</div><a name="10010538000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> Just stand back a little bit. For
example, if you are going to tell people in the 2020s, &#147;Hey
guys, we&#146;ve got to start fitting progressively more gas-fired
power plants with CCS,&#148; people will need to see a gas-fired
power plant that has had all the problems ironed out and that actually
works. They need to be able to kick the post-combustion capture unit or
do whatever they want with it and go and talk to the people and say,
&#147;Is this working reliably, guys? Does it start up every Monday
morning when you want it to?&#148; You cannot legislate to do that
because you know you may get all sorts of problems when you come to do
it.</div>
<a name="10010538000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
electricity industry has to be very conservative. It has to have
reference plants&#151;they really do mean something&#151;and a
reference plant has to be what you actually want to build. Yes, in
principle, things are transferable&#151;there is some
interplay&#151;but there are specific considerations for a natural
gas plant where you want to see a natural gas
plant.</div><a name="10010538000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010538000229"></a>Natascha

Jon Gibbins:</b></i> Correct. May I also say that I think
there has been some confusion between pre and post-combustion in terms
of whether they are on coal or gas? There seems to be some conclusion
that there is not a lot to choose between pre and post-combustion and
oxy-fuel on coal&#151;there seems to be pretty much a balance. As far
as we can tell at the moment, in terms of actually producing
electricity from natural gas, post-combustion seems to be ahead. The
International Energy Agency&#146;s greenhouse gas report shows that
quite clearly, so there is good reason to do that. The only reason to
go to pre-combustion on gas is that it was a very defensive use of
existing technology for hydrogen production. But it was not really a
power production technology that was
used.</div><a name="10010538000109"></a>

Jon Gibbins:</b></i> It depends on what you are up against.
There is an implication that if you are, for example, up against
offshore wind, you will be competitive with CCS. If people do not care
about having decarbonised electricity, yes, of course, it could not
possibly be competitive. But, compared with what we know about
alternative forms of decarbonised electricity, it does appear that it
will be
competitive.</div><a name="10010538000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000234"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> May I ask your view about whether you would like
carbon capture and storage for gas turbines to be included in the
Bill?</div><a name="10010538000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> Yes. There are two points here with
regard to different fuels. It would send a pretty useful message to the
electricity industry if natural gas was included in the Bill. It could
well be that after some deliberation about energy policy in the
2020s&#151;and the Committee on Climate Change is just having a look
at that at the moment&#151;we decide that we want a natural gas
demonstration. That could make a big difference, because it is very
hard to legislate, to tell people to fit CCS on natural gas, if you
have not got a reference plant. It really does not work.</div>
<a name="10010538000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a technical point that power plants burn a range of different fuels. I
believe that the wording of the Bill at the moment might be construed
as meaning that people who have burned a bit of oil to start their
plant up cannot claim for the CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>that was captured from the
oil&#151;and that is just trouble. So I think that it should allow
for any CO<span class="Sub">2</span> that is captured. On biomass, you want people to
work on biomass with CCS. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>should say that at the moment, with the existing capture-ready
legislation, we have got the&#151;I do not know whether it is an
anomaly or what it is, but we have people building biomass-only power
plants that are  5 MW under the 300 MW limit. That does not
seem to be in the spirit of encouraging carbon capture and storage. You
get negative emissions from biomass.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
106</b><a name="10010538000235"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): If the Bill goes through and
becomes an Act, I can imagine the conversations that will take place in
the boardrooms in Germany, Spain and elsewhere. People in them will
say, &#147;Right, the situation has changed&#151;there is a lot of
money there, what do we do now?&#148; They would be told, &#147;If
you build a 1.6 GW plant, you will get 400 MW of CCS on that. You will
get the levy that will support the funding on that.&#148; The people
in the boardrooms will ask, &#147;What will happen after
that&#151;will we then be required to retrofit on the other 1.2 GW of
capacity?&#148; The answer would be, &#147;Well,
possibly.&#148;</div>
<a name="10010538000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those in the
boardrooms would then ask whether they could get any funding. Actually,
the Bill does not say whether they would or not; it says that the
Secretary of State has the power to decide whether he will give some.
And so there is no guarantee that the companies will get support
further down the line for retrofitting the rest. From you have been
saying, Professor Gibbins, by 2030 one would expect all of our plants
to be retrofitted. How do you get round that issue and does there need
to be a greater clarity in the Bill for the support mechanism which
might be available in due course for
retrofitting?</div><a name="10010538000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> I do not think that there needs to be
greater clarity in the Bill as primary legislation. My understanding is
that the Secretary of State has powers to pay for additional CCS at
demonstration sites. I think it will come in under secondary
legislation and also in the contracts when you actually close the
financial support for your demonstration project. I am sure that any
prudent consortium investing in that would make sure that they had
their position covered to extend to full capture.</div>
<a name="10010538000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">It depends on
what the overall process is in the 2020s, because you cannot look at
these plants in isolation when they have to go to full capture; you
have to consider what is happening in the rest of the industry. For
example, if you tell coal plants that you have to go to a standard
beyond natural gas, then obviously that is one situation. If you say
that you have to decarbonise to a gas standard, then that is something
else. I do not think that you could look at them without the rest of
the
market.</div><a name="10010538000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> I would agree with that. I would just add
that we have got to hand it to the Government. They at least listened
to the point of view of industry when we said to them that if you leave
it open-ended like this you will not get anything built at all. That
still pertains&#151;if it is not in the secondary legislation and
then in the contract, as Jon said, then you will not get anything built
at all. It has got to be all or nothing
here.</div><a name="10010538000126"></a>

107</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000236"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> What about the intellectual property? If the
taxpayer, through a levy or some other form of subsidy, is putting a
lot of money in, should the Government expect to have their share of
the IP? Or would the companies walk away if they were not going to keep
their own IP?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div><a name="10010538000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> You are opening up a can of worms with
IP. That has a lot of established legislation. One of the interesting
things here comes back to whether these are R and D projects, or
demonstration and deployment projects. For example, offshore wind is
probably going to get more subsidy than a megawatt hour of decarbonised
electricity and CCS projects. I do not think I have heard any
discussion at all about whether offshore wind builders should share
their IP with everybody because they are getting paid for it. What we
are paying for here is decarbonised electricity. Incidentally, yes we
are getting very useful demonstrations and very useful learning, but I
think it really is more about paying for the product, in a sense, than
paying for the
technology.</div><a name="10010538000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
108</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000237"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> One of my concerns is that these are old
technologies, by your own admission, all of which have been used
extensively elsewhere, particularly in the United States for enhanced
oil recovery and things of that nature. Post-combustion is a relatively
tried technology and is relatively easy to do&#151;I say that in
relative terms. Putting them all together I accept is a big challenge.
Has anyone factored in, or should we factor in and make part of the
Bill, producing hydrogen as part of the pre-combustion process to
incentivise the hydrogen economy at the same time, so that Britain is
not only leading the world in CCS but also in producing the next
generation of hydrogen plants?</div>
<a name="10010538000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Jon Gibbins:</b></i> I would say that hydrogen technology is
better established than post-combustion technology on flue gases.
Hydrogen technology is very well established. The other thing that I
would say about hydrogen is that if you want to get to a lot of the
endpoints that you want using hydrogen&#151;electricity, decarbonised
transport and decarbonised heating&#151;studies that we have done
suggest that even if you have decarbonised hydrogen, you should convert
it to electricity. I am not sure that there is a significant advantage
in going via the hydrogen route when the end product is decarbonised
services.</div>
<a name="10010538000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jeff
Chapman:</b></i> There is a potential advantage in that it
may well be possible to decarbonise existing gas-fired power stations
remotely by supplying them with hydrogen as an alternative fuel to
natural gas. There might have to be a refit of equipment but it would
not be that expensive.</div>
<a name="10010538000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
White:</b></i> I would be very wary. That would be for a
public good, is that what you are saying? The companies would not
generate hydrogen just for the sake of its maybe having a use in
transport some time in the future, when there is the risk of electric
cars becoming the norm rather then fuel-cell-driven cars using
hydrogen, I would argue. So, is it a good use of a public good to get
them to do it? Possibly, but I would rather these guys just go and
build their power stations and get them to work and get the experience,
as we have been hearing, rather than complicating matters further. What
we want are kilowatt or megawatt hours operating as soon as possible
rather than trying to do two or three things at the same
time.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000241"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> A very simple question: are the Government right
to focus on CCS?</div>
<a name="10010538000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I certainly think it is right
that they take it into consideration, and the finance mechanism
proposed by the Energy Bill is likely to be necessary. We are concerned
that it is not currently matched with a proposal to mandate coal-fired
power stations to limit their emissions. The Government are currently
proposing that the levy will be paid for by the consumers but not
matched by some form of guarantee that ensures that the CCS
demonstrations take place within the correct parameters to ensure we
can tackle climate
change.</div><a name="10010538000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> I agree with much of that. I think that the
Government are right to focus on carbon capture and storage. We have
obviously had a policy framework for renewals in particular, but for
other technologies too, for some time. Over the past two
years&#151;certainly this year&#151;we have seen a transformation
in the Government&#146;s approach to coal from the position under the
previous Secretary of State, John Hutton, which effectively encouraged
energy companies to come forward with proposals for unabated coal-fired
power stations, to the current approach where no coal-fired power
station can be built without CCS. We also have the Bill&#146;s
proposals.</div><a name="10010538000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that is a tremendous step forward and that it is a gap in the
framework. I think we could decarbonise the UK&#146;s energy
generating system without carbon capture and storage, but, from a
global perspective, it is a critical technology and it is important
that we in the UK play our part in the cost discovery, which, as
previous witnesses have said, is going to be critical in identifying
what role and contribution the technology can make. However, I entirely
agree with Kirsty that we must have both the financing mechanism and
the regulatory framework. A number of amendments making that proposal
have been
tabled.</div><a name="10010538000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
111</b><a name="10010538000242"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): Moving on to the regulatory
framework, which you have commented on, we have a detailed memorandum
from WWF, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth about the need for
statutory limits on emissions from power plants. I take it that we are
talking about all forms of power plants. Can you expand on why you
think that is necessary and who it applies to if we are already going
down the CCS path?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div><a name="10010538000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> I will put it into context. The Climate
Change Committee has recommended that we need to decarbonise the power
sector, or very nearly decarbonise it, by 2030. Alongside that, it said
that there should be no unabated coal in the system by the mid-2020s at
the latest. Clearly, carbon capture and storage is one technology that
could help us get there, but it is currently in its demonstration phase
and has yet to be tested on a commercial scale. We therefore feel that
it is entirely reasonable to ask that, if you have a finance mechanism
for CCS, you should also match it with a regulation that mandates coal
and other fossil fuel plants to reduce their emissions in line with
what the CCC has recommended in case CCS does not prove to be workable
for whatever reason within the Government&#146;s time
scale.</div><a name="10010538000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> I agree with much of that, but slightly
differently in terms of some of the debate and some of the
Government&#146;s thinking about regulation as the safety net. The
regulation is primarily designed for the if-it-doesn&#146;t-work
scenario, which was mentioned earlier. I think that you must have a
finance mechanism, because companies will not come forward with
investment in CCS plants without a financing mechanism. What we have to
do is create a policy framework that not only gives investors
confidence, but that gives the public confidence in the climate impact
of the technology and that also gives investors absolute clarity about
what the Government want to see and what the trajectory must be for
emissions reduction from the power sector and the plants. The danger is
that at the moment we have something that makes it very clear how the
financing support will come forward, but, from the public&#146;s
point of view, it is not clear how potentially up to &#163;9.5
billion will deliver against the Government&#146;s climate change
objectives. Therefore, from our point of view, the overall framework
has to be designed so that it does bring forward CCS, but in a way that
gives investors and the public confidence about the emissions impact of
that
investment.</div><a name="10010538000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010538000243"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Our previous panel, which I think you witnessed,
were quite robust at the end about the expectations that CCS would work
and the fact that all the elements were there. As you said in your
memorandum, the Government have said that, if for any reason the
technology does not work or proves too expensive, they would then look
at contingency safeguard measures, which I assume would be in line with
the sorts of things that you are talking about in relation to statutory
limits on emissions. Why wouldn&#146;t that work? Why is it so
important to have that in place now? Would you actually put the limits
in the Bill, or would it just be a provision that regulation could be
introduced in certain
circumstances?</div><a name="10010538000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> I think it is very important that the financing
and regulation elements have parity of treatment. The financing
mechanism is going to be the subject of primary legislation, and then
the details of how that is going to work, precisely who will pay,
whether it will be levied by carbon, and so on&#151;issues I know the
energy companies had views on this morning&#151;will be defined in
secondary legislation. In our view&#151;I think I can speak for both
of us&#151;the regulatory mechanism should be the same. Certainty
that there will be a regulatory mechanism and certainty about the time
scale within which that will be introduced should both be in the
Bill&#151;in primary legislation&#151;but the details of precisely
what the level of that should be is something that we obviously need to
take time to get right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000244"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> So you wouldn&#146;t be talking about
introducing statutory limits now for existing power plants, but about
there being a framework in the Bill for doing that in secondary
legislation.</div><a name="10010538000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> In my view, the ideal scenario is that the Bill
would require the Government to bring forward that regulatory framework
and to do so within a specific time scale, within which we could get
this right. We could then ensure that we design an emissions
performance standard that gives investors clarity and something against
which they can make investment judgments&#151;as you said, boards in
other parts of Europe will be involved in that discussion&#151;but
also something that gives the public certainty about the financing
mechanism and about what the money they will be paying through their
energy bills is going to deliver in terms of the UK&#146;s climate
change
obligations.</div><a name="10010538000149"></a>

113</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000245"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010538000251"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010538000252"></a>Mr.

Clough:</b></i> You are right, I don&#146;t think that we
are happy with the Bill as it currently stands, which is why we would
want to see some form of amendment in terms of getting an emissions
performance standard taken forward. In terms of the numbers and the
specific dates, that would be a quite detailed discussion, which it
would be hard to get into a Bill of this nature at this point in time,
when there is an election coming up, etc. We NGOs do have a clear
position on what the level and timing should be, which I am happy to
talk about now, or I can give you our position paper at the end of this
session.</div><a name="10010538000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> We could all suggest a date, and we could all
suggest a level for the EPS, but I think there would be a significant
risk that we would get it wrong if we were to force that debate now,
and attempt to close it out within the time scale within which the
legislation would be discussed. From a Green Alliance perspective, we
are interested in not just choking off unabated coal but also in
securing CCS investment. The design of the EPS is something that we
have to get right. So, being clear on the face of the Bill that there
will be an EPS, but giving 12 months to ensure that we get the decision
right, is, for us, a sensible approach.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000253"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> We have been talking a lot about dates. We have had
quite a lot of evidence about the technology of CCS and how far it has
advanced&#151;some of it contradictory as far as I can see&#151;but
can you tell us how feasible the Government&#146;s target is of
having a CCS demonstration project up and running by
2014?</div><a name="10010538000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> I think that it is feasible. The Longannet
power plant in Scotland has stated that it is confident that it can
have a CCS plant up and running by 2014. The date is quite important,
because, as we have all heard, the competition has been running since
2007. In order for it to maintain some sort of credibility we need to
start doing stuff on the ground now to see if the technology can work.
The additional benefit of testing it on an existing plant means that
there is a net reduction in emissions immediately. You do not need to
build a brand new power station and fit CCS to 20 or 25 per cent. of
it, which would still result in 80 per cent. of emissions going into
the atmosphere. That is quite important. There is another plant in the
pipeline&#151;the Hatfield plant&#151;which has been awarded money
from Europe. That is potentially another option, too, which could be
one of the pre-combustion
plants.</div><a name="10010538000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> Nobody involved in this debate would have
invented the competition and designed it in the way in which it has
evolved over the past three years, because the Government have been
changing their mind through the evolution of the competition about what
they wanted to see. We can get the first plant up and running by 2014.
For the reasons that Kirsty gave, it is very important that the public
see a result, see something built, and we begin to get the cost
discovery. One of the things that we have been doing in the various
events that we have run, bringing together people from the private
sector and from the NGO to look at what shared territory or common
ground there is over how we can engineer a CCS industry in the UK, is
being clear that if we pursue purely a competition-based approach, it
will probably be 2020 before we get the second plant, and we need a
rather different approach 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>to procuring and identifying and securing construction of the second,
third and fourth plants that we can add to this first
one.</div><a name="10010538000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000254"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> When E.ON was here this morning, its view was that
2014 was a date but it could slip a few years. It was not the important
point; it was one of a range of factors. I take it that you do not
accept that, that something must be up and running by 2014 or it
endangers the use of CCS of meeting our climate change
targets.</div><a name="10010538000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> I think everybody in this room is aware of the
urgency of climate change. We have waited much too long to get serious
investment behind CCS. I went to an event held in the UK that brought
together stakeholders from all over the world to talk about carbon
capture and storage. I think that that forum has been running for six
years, and we do not have anywhere in the world a significant
large-scale CCS plant. So, 2014 is not soon enough in my view, but it
is probably as fast as is practicable.</div>
<a name="10010538000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><b class="B"><a name="10010538000255"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Do you think the levy system of underwriting
the development of the further three projects after the initial
competition is a wise way of proceeding? I mean the levy to industry in
order to fund the allocation of money for the CCS
projects.</div><a name="10010538000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> I am not sure I would have framed it in that
way. There needs to be a share of the risk between the private
developer and the state that represents the consumer who may be putting
&#163;9.5 billion into those private investors. We are not
underwriting without any constraints or without a share of the
risk&#151;I certainly hope that we are not&#151;the investment
activity of the private
sector.</div><a name="10010538000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> My concern would be that given the way the
Bill is currently drafted, I do not see the private sector taking on
much risk. The current proposal is that the Government will pay in full
for the four demonstration projects, and that that is now potentially
extended to cover the payment for retro fit as well with no guarantee
that they will be operating within the climate change remit that the
Government have set themselves,  or within the Climate Change
Committee 2030 recommendation. I am concerned about the way the Bill is
drafted if something like an EPS amendment is not
made.</div><a name="10010544000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000235"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The Bill creates a CCS levy across industry.
The proposal is that the levy be based on the market share of various
suppliers. Would there be alternatives, such as grant systems or
requiring an industry pool for such underwriting, or is the levy a
reasonable way of proceeding? If so, how might it best be apportioned?
Should it be apportioned on market share, or should it perhaps be
apportioned on the carbon intensity of those suppliers? Should there,
for example, be any wayleave for renewables suppliers within such a
levy system?</div>
<a name="10010544000002"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> There are two different issues, aren&#146;t
there? How do you share the contributions between the companies? Who
pays? Where do you levy it from? The Green Alliance does not take a
view on that question. The second question is where does that money go
and how is the risk shared between the state and the private 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>sector in relation to the demonstration plants? That is a very important
question. I agree with Kirsty that saying up front &#147;We will
cover the capital cost and build the pipes, and if it doesn&#146;t
work don&#146;t worry because we have written you a blank
cheque&#148; is not a very effective way to incentivise the private
sector. There is risk and reward for both sides. It needs to be
properly
shared.</div><a name="10010544000003"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000236"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Are you implying that industry ought to take a
greater degree of the risk in the development of CCS, or do you think,
certainly in terms of getting the four projects up and running, that a
levy system, followed by an allocation system, provided that the
results are public property and are shared out, is a reasonable way to
proceed?</div>
<a name="10010544000004"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> No, I&#146;ve got no objection to the levy
system in principle, although, as we&#146;ve been saying
consistently, there needs to be a regulatory framework alongside the
levy. When you determine what you&#146;ve got in that pot and what
you want to do with it, you need to make sure that you maximise the
benefits for UK plc, for the taxpayer and consumer and for the cost
discovery for CCS. That is about the state deciding where we want CCS
clusters and where we think there is most economic opportunity. We
therefore should be putting demonstration plants into those parts of
the country where there is likely to be industry investing and wanting
to store the carbon. We should be paying companies on the basis of the
carbon that they have saved, not on the basis that they are building
something that may store carbon. We need to share the risk and the
state should ensure that there is access to the intellectual property.
So there are issues there about
risk.</div><a name="10010544000005"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000237"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> So you would favour a fairly high degree of
regulation through secondary legislation in things such as the sharing
of knowledge and the building of pipes and the
infrastructure?</div><a name="10010544000006"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> On the building of pipes, one of the problems
with our debate over the past couple of years has been that the
argument has been focused on how much carbon is going to be abated and
how much unabated coal there is going to be. In reality, we need to
work out much more clearly, and only the state can do this, what plants
we want in the UK and how many pre-combustion plants and how many
post-combustion plants. Where do we want them to be? We should work
that out from an industrial perspective and from a carbon perspective
and then we should design a policy regime that delivers that, because
the market is not the best determinant of which parts of the country
are best suited to investment in CCS. The market is not going to
deliver you an infrastructure where the pipes are of the right size to
ensure that clusters of companies can come together. We cannot leave
this to the
market.</div><a name="10010544000007"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><a name="10010544000238"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b><b class="B">:</b> I can probably guess the answer to this,
but should the Bill provide for the contingency of CCS not being
technically and/or economically viable, and how would you do
that?</div><a name="10010544000008"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> Yes, to repeat what I said before, we think
this should be done by the establishment of clear limits on emissions.
You are setting the parameters within which your CCS demonstration
programme can operate. As Stephen has already said, you are keeping 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>your regulation and your finance on the same legislative footing. The
problem we have at the moment is that the Government have come at this
from the point of view that we need to commercialise CCS. That is not a
bad way to come at it, but we need to do that within the context of
decarbonising our power sector, in particular decarbonising emissions
from coal. That is what is missing at the moment. We would try to amend
that by including something like an emissions performance standard in
the
Bill.</div><a name="10010544000009"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000239"></a>John
Robertson:</b> How would that
work?</div><a name="10010544000010"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> An EPS of the type we are talking about would
place a specific limit on emissions from individual power
plants.</div><a name="10010544000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
125</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000240"></a>John
Robertson:</b> How would you know the limit at which it would
have to be set? How would you calculate
that?</div><a name="10010544000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> Speaking on behalf of WWF, we consider the
limit should be set on new plant at around 300g of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>per
kWh. That is the level of emissions that could be met by a new gas
plant with some form of heat recovery. We propose that this should be
scaled down to about 100-150 by the mid-2020s, in line with the
recommendations from the CCC, and at that point existing plants should
also be covered. That is where we are coming
from.</div><a name="10010544000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
126</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000241"></a>John
Robertson:</b><b class="B"> </b>Allowing for the fact that that could
add cost to the projects, how would you cover
that?</div><a name="10010544000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> Establishing those parameters allows you to
have the conversation with the power companies about sharing the risk
and about sharing the costs, which we mentioned earlier. We do not
think that consumers should be picking up the full cost of all of
this.</div><a name="10010544000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
127</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000242"></a>John
Robertson:</b> So, does this go back to the levy we were
talking about
earlier?</div><a name="10010544000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="10010544000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> The two things have got to be designed in
tandem. If you do not have the financing mechanism and the regulation,
then the regulation might choke off the investment, or the financing
mechanism might get them building something you wish they were not. You
have got new plant up and running that is not consistent with your
climate change targets. We need to see the finance and the regulation
designed
together.</div><a name="10010544000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000243"></a>John
Robertson:</b> Usually, when you go into a project, things get
better as you go along. Are you going to allow for the fact that the
initial start up might not hit your target? You do not want to close it
off and say that is the end of the project&#151;you want to keep it
going. Where is the flexibility in what you are
saying?</div><a name="10010544000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> The standard will evolve necessarily over time,
so that you can tighten the EPS, as Kirsty has already said. Coming
back to what we want for the UK, we want a mix of pre-combustion and
post-combustion. The first plant that could be got away clearly by 2014
is on an existing power station, the Longannet plant. That would only
reduce emissions because it is not new energy-generation. After that
you can quickly build pre-combustion, which will have very high
emissions reduction because of the nature of the technology. In a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>sense, this discussion about the limit and the EPS bites in particular
on the Forth&#146;s plant; it bites on large, super-critical
post-combustion technology. That is where the EPS is most pertinent,
and that is where it is important to get the policy framework
right.</div><a name="10010544000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
129</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000244"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> You commented on clusters and the involvement of
Government in those issues, yet the market is already talking about
clusters; we heard that this morning. We heard evidence the market sees
three as being initially viable, and it has a pretty realistic view of
this. Can I understand your balance? Where do you see the balance
between the market and regulation in this process, because I am not
sure I
understand?</div><a name="10010544000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> At the moment, as I understand it, the
companies cannot build a regional pipeline infrastructure, for Kent,
the Humber, the north-east or anywhere else. They are barred from doing
so, under the constraints under which they operate. Therefore, somebody
has to impose on the market framework, first, from an industrial
perspective, an identification of which parts of the country would most
benefit from CCS clusters and, secondly, a mandate to get that
infrastructure built, whether that is by giving a company a lead role
in a particular area or getting Ofgem or someone else to play that
role. Only the Government can set that investment in motion and create
the clusters. At the moment we have not moved as quickly on that as we
ought to have done. We effectively have a competition approach that is
basically asking, &#147;Who can build a cheap CCS plant?&#148;,
without any consideration of where in the country it would be smartest
to build such a thing. That is the shift we need to see when looking at
the second, third and fourth
plants.</div><a name="10010544000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000245"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Surely the word is &#147;partnership&#148; in
that respect, but I did not hear much about partnership in what was
said.</div><a name="10010544000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> What has been happening since the Government
said they wanted to see a cluster-based approach is that companies with
potential investment in particular areas have come forward to explain
that there are other companies in the area and what their cluster might
look like, and that is all right and proper. Clearly, there could be a
bidding process in which people say that the case for a cluster in one
area is this, and that the case for a cluster in another area is that,
and then the Government will have to come to a judgment. They should
make sure that the demonstration plants are in areas where we see
strategic advantage and where we want
clusters.</div><a name="10010544000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> I think we have to be a little careful with
clusters as well, because the cluster E.ON is proposing is based on it
building its new plant at Kingsnorth and on a new plant being built at
Tilbury, so there is an element of self-fulfilling prophecy. You build
the plants so they become a cluster, but there is not necessarily a
cluster there at the moment. A lot of the plant there will actually be
closing in 2015-16 due to the large combustion plant directive, so
there is an element of that going
on.</div><a name="10010544000025"></a>

we have just been talking about. There is nothing in the Bill about
that, as far as I can see, but perhaps you can point me to the bits
that do refer to it. We understand the demonstration, and that has
happened, I think, so there is no point going over that ground, but I
do not see anything in the Bill dealing with creating clusters or the
whole idea of creating a balance between Government and industry, or
between the taxpayer and industry, or indeed between individual
consumers and industry. Nor do I see anything in the Bill that gives
the Secretary of State the power to intervene on where he or she will
place projects in future. There is nothing in the Bill, as far as I can
see, that says we will have a balance between pre-combustion and
post-combustion, or indeed about oxy-fuel combustion capture, which
might be a third prospect. None of that is in the Bill, so where is
this? Have I missed something in the
analysis?</div><a name="10010544000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty

the Government representative, is whether they need primary legislation
for any of those things. Do clusters need primary legislation? Does
getting the right balance in the sharing of risk between Government and
industry need primary legislation? My answer to both questions would be
no. Our big concern about what is or is not in the Bill is that
regulation is not in the Bill, and in our view that critically weakens
the pubic confidence and the climate confidence in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
136</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000251"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Just for my clarification, because I am a simple
creature, do the green NGOs now support
CCS?</div><a name="10010544000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> I can only speak for WWF. We support it being
demonstrated and considered, but we would like to see that, as we have
said, within the context of it delivering for the climate from day
one&#151;so, set within strict emission
limits.</div><a name="10010544000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
137</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000252"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> So, Kirsty, do you think that the Bill should be
extended to include natural gas and other fuels as
well?</div><a name="10010544000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> Certainly, CCS will likely need to be applied
to natural gas in the 2020s if you want to meet the
2030&#151;</div><a name="10010544000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
138</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000253"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Should the Bill be amended as it goes
through?</div><a name="10010544000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> To be honest, we do not have a specific view
on whether natural gas should be covered in this levy. It seems to make
sense that the first CCS projects are on coal, as the most
carbon-intensive form of fossil
fuel.</div><a name="10010544000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
139</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000254"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Stephen, should we get that legislation in now or
should we leave that to secondary legislation and to Ministers&#146;
discretion&#151;all these nice Ministers&#151;in
future?</div><a name="10010544000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I think<b class="B"> </b>the decision to
extend the levy to gas would be rather expensive for consumers and
therefore would require primary legislation rather than secondary
legislation. But we have been focused, like WWF, on
coal.</div><a name="10010544000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000255"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> So we will continue burning gas. That will be all
right for
us.</div><a name="10010544000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>That isn&#146;t what I said and
that isn&#146;t our view. But our primary focus has been on
coal.</div><a name="10010544000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
140</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000256"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> What is your understanding of the
Government&#146;s position on those power stations not fitted with
CCS retrospectively after 2020? They will just
burn&#151;</div><a name="10010544000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>My understanding, although the
point is poorly defined, is that between 2020 and 2025 they will either
be fitted with CCS or they will no longer be allowed to
operate.</div><a name="10010544000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000257"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Is that your understanding too,
Kirsty?</div><a name="10010544000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> They are proposing waiting until 2018 to
decide this. If in the meantime we have built one, two or three more
big coal-fired power stations, the risk of a Government in 2018
demanding that they are closed is pretty unlikely&#151;it&#146;s
not going to happen. That is why we think we need something in place
now to prevent that from happening in the first place. You cannot put a
contingency measure in 10 years&#146; time: it is not a contingency
measure; it&#146;s an
afterthought.</div><a name="10010544000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> There is an analogy here with the Waxman-Markey
Bill in the US, where both the finance and the regulation have been
taken forward in tandem. One of the things we did at the Green Alliance
was to bring over a group of policy makers, both industry and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>NGO, to the UK to meet different political parties and to come here to
the House of Commons, as we did a few months ago, to share the US
experience of how they work together and why they feel that both
finance and regulation are essential parts of the
mix.</div><a name="10010544000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
141</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000258"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> Changing the subject to Ofgem, clauses 16 and 17
impose on the regulator a requirement to take account of carbon
emissions and security of supply. Do you think that will have an impact
on the way in which they
work?</div><a name="10010544000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> This is not an area that we have specifically
focused on. However, we welcome this clarification of their remit in
tackling climate change and ensuring security of supply. Our concern
would be that they now have a three-pronged remit: affordability,
climate change and security of supply. It is unclear how those three
will be traded off against each other, so we still think there is a
clear need for Government intervention&#151;not necessarily in
Ofgem&#151;to put in place clear policies and measures that guide
Ofgem&#146;s decision-making
process.</div><a name="10010544000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> Maybe I could put our view on that. It is not
unhelpful, but is this reform affecting Ofgem anything like as
significant as we need to see if we are going to get a low-carbon
energy objective system? Absolutely not. We saw an announcement in the
pre-Budget report by the Chancellor that there is going to be a review
of the structure of the energy market and there was discussion about
whether the incentives in that structure are right and whether the
system we currently have can deliver our low-carbon
objectives.</div><a name="10010544000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to look pretty radically at the structure of the market, at the
policy framework for the market and at the role of Ofgem, because the
history of its role and the way that the market has operated so far
suggests that it has prioritised security of supply and low-cost
objectives in the short time over climate imperatives. I am not
convinced that the reforms in the Bill will change that position
materially.</div>
<a name="10010544000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
142</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000259"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> So you do not envisage Ofgem suddenly deciding that
it wants to push customers to use more renewable energy, rather than
invest in more traditional types of
energy.</div><a name="10010544000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> As Kirsty said, Ofgem is the regulator and the
Government are the Government. If the Government want to see that, it
is for them to mandate that the companies do it, whether directly or
through Ofgem. In the end, the political direction and the decision
about the balance of investment that we want to see in different
technologies has to come from the Government, not from the regulator.
The regulator has to have the role and the incentives so that it
supports those
objectives.</div><a name="10010544000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
143</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000260"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> Yes, but how the regulator operates has a huge
impact on how renewables access the grid. You will be aware of the huge
problems over the years with grid access and transmission charges. Do
you see these new powers or obligations as something that will or
should impact on that area? Will you make representations along those
lines?</div><a name="10010544000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> Like Kirsty, this is not my area of expertise.
From reading it as a layman, it seems that it will help. Whether it
will be sufficient is another question and I cannot comment on
it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div><a name="10010544000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
144</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000261"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Can I be clear on where we are on the EPS? We have
had quite a discussion about it and I am keen to get more clarity.
Kirsty Clough has said that she would like to see it introduced at
300 grams per kWh for all new coal plants. Would that be the
Green Alliance&#146;s view of an appropriate
level?</div><a name="10010544000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> I think we would probably support that. I say
that carefully because we are supportive of the 12-month deadline for
setting an EPS because, as I said, this has got to give climate
confidence and investor confidence. We need the finance and the
regulation to be developed together. You need to understand how the
financing mechanism will work, how much it will raise and how the risks
will be shared. We must make sure we have a framework on both sides
that gets the plant built, but delivers our climate objectives. My
answer is a cautious
yes.</div><a name="10010544000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
145</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000262"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> To get to that level on coal, it would mean that
about three quarters of the capacity of a plant would need to have CCS
from the outset. Some could argue that that moves beyond the scope of
the demonstration project. That is almost commercialisation of the
project. How do you see an EPS at that level tying in with the
demonstration
work?</div><a name="10010544000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> Our proposal for 300 covers new plants so it
precludes existing plants. The demonstration at Longannet, for example,
would fit within that concept. For pre-combustion plant, the Government
have already said that pre-combustion CCS will be at 100 per cent. full
scale from day one. The whole generation capacity of a pre-combustion
IGCC plant would be CCS, so that would fit within that
context.</div>
<a name="10010544000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">For a new
post-combustion supercritical plant, you are right that it would
require about 60 per cent. of the emissions to be covered. I do not
think it is necessary, but if the Government wanted to build a
supercritical plant, they could consent to a smaller plant. It does not
have to be a 1.6 GW plant, as is currently proposed by E.ON at
Kingsnorth.</div><a name="10010544000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> The only thing I would add is that in terms of
what we want for the UK, there is a sequencing. By the time we come to
build a large supercritical plant, which is likely to be the fourth in
the four, we will probably know rather more about the cost and
viability of CCS than we know today. That kind of ambition is right,
but we will probably be sitting here in 2012 and 2015 when we are
operating the first one and we will know much more about this
technology. I hope we will have the confidence at that point so that we
can build a large plant that has a much higher proportion of abatement.
I see this as an evolution, and the demonstration programme should take
us on that
journey.</div><a name="10010544000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
146</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000263"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> But the amendment that you are supporting requires
that to be set within 12
months.</div><a name="10010544000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="10010544000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
147</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000264"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> You are saying that it could be two years before
we understand what is practicable. Are you comfortable about the speed
with which you are looking to move in this
direction?</div><a name="10010544000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> Investors need clarity. They need clarity over
whether there is a financing mechanism because they will not build
anything without it. They also need 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>clarity on what the emissions trajectory is. The Government should be
able to provide that and we should be able to make an informed judgment
on a shorter time
scale.</div><a name="10010544000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> It is also important that the EPS is set by
the science. The EPS is not about CCS technology per se, but about what
is required in terms of tackling climate change. To make that point
clear: if you determine your EPS by what you think CCS can deliver,
that is not likely to be necessary in the next few
years.</div><a name="10010544000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
148</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000265"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> But surely energy policy has to take account of
the climate change issues, affordability and security of supply. If one
puts in place a policy that drives away investment and we therefore
start getting power cuts and power outages because we are not getting a
new plant built, that will not provide a balanced energy
policy.</div><a name="10010544000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> That is why we always talk about regulation
and finance in conjunction; you certainly need finance to incentivise
CCS, but you need to operate that within your climate change
targets.</div><a name="10010544000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> I don&#146;t think that any of us want to
choose between those objectives, but the question is what approach gets
the best chance of achieving them all. The danger of the current
approach is that you do not have regulatory clarity. People are
encouraged to build plants, but there is no clarity on how they might
finance the retrofit. They then turn around and say,
&#147;You&#146;re going to have to let us run these things now,
because they&#146;re up and running and are rather expensive.&#148;
We therefore get forced to choose between security supply and climate
change, so our argument is that we should invest 12 months in devising
a framework that can do
both.</div><a name="10010544000074"></a>

Hendry:</b> Slightly separately, the Government have put in
place a road map on nuclear, so each month we know who is supposed to
be doing what and that the first nuclear plant is to open by 2017-18.
There is no road map for carbon capture. Do you think there should be a
requirement on the Government to put in place a road map so that we
know whose responsibility it is to do what? What has come out clearly
from our conversations with you this afternoon is that an awful lot
needs to be done but nobody actually knows whose job it is to do it. A
road map would provide much greater clarity. It is helping to drive the
investment in nuclear, so should we also have it for carbon
capture?</div><a name="10010544000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Hale:</b></i> I totally agree. I actually wrote jointly with
some of the energy companies to Ed Miliband making that analogy, and I
think that that, among many other things, contributed to the
announcement that there will now be an office of carbon capture and
storage in the same way as we have an office of nuclear deployment and
an office of renewables. Those offices are creating the road
maps.</div>
<a name="10010544000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
legacy of how carbon and capture storage coal policy has evolved in the
past few years that we have nothing like that kind of clarity. Again,
that is because we do not actually know yet what we are trying to build
and when. When we know what the mix of plants is, what the sequencing
is and where we want the clusters to be, we can have a road map to
deliver
it.</div><a name="10010544000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kirsty
Clough:</b></i> May I add something? I think there should be
a road map, which we are currently lacking, for the power sector. The
Government are yet to accept 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>the CCC recommendation for a close-to-decarbonised power sector by 2030.
If they were to adopt that, it would go quite some way to giving some
certainty to power companies about what they should be
investing
in.</div><a name="10010544000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000267"></a>The

150</b><a name="10010544000269"></a><b class="B">Anne
Main</b> (St. Albans) (Con): On social tariffs, does the
inclusion of the mandatory social tariff in the Bill indicate to you
that the voluntary agreement has
failed?</div><a name="10010544000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> No, I don&#146;t necessarily believe that
it does. I think the importance of the mandatory social tariff is that,
given the scale of support that is envisaged and that the Government
plan to introduce, it is really much more appropriate to be putting it
on a statutory and mandatory footing. It will move from something like
&#163;6 per energy customer that the voluntary arrangements currently
incur, to approaching &#163;11 per energy customer.</div>
<a name="10010544000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
scale, it is simply more appropriate that it is put on a statutory and
mandatory footing. That also provides a better opportunity to deal with
the issues that the Government envisage&#151;the issues around
targeting and eligibility, making judgments on who should be eligible
and putting in place the reconciliation mechanism that will ensure that
the cost is borne fairly across energy suppliers and, ultimately,
customers. The move to a mandatory approach is right, given the scale
of support that is
envisaged.</div><a name="10010544000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000270"></a>Anne
Main:</b> This morning I asked a similar question of our
panel. Do you think there is enough clarity in the Bill to ensure that
the targeting you have just referred to is correct? Could it be
expanded? Do you feel that the system will be sensitive enough without
being
over-complex?</div><a name="10010544000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> On targeting, subject to regulations
passing through Parliament, a very important trial of data sharing is
about to be undergone. That is going to be very important in helping to
provide the right mechanisms to ensure effective targeting. Targeting
is going to be very important to help get the support to those who most
need it. We have been great supporters of the Department for Work and
Pensions data sharing trial, as it is dubbed, and have encouraged it.
So we are very keen to see that happen. Hopefully, we will then see the
benefits from that trialling being applied, as the real detail of how
the social price support mechanism is going to work is subsequently
developed.</div><a name="10010544000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
152</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000271"></a>Anne
Main:</b> But are you happy that enough people have been
included in the targets? Are they accurate enough? Quite often it is
the elderly now. This 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>morning we talked about people with chronic and long-term illnesses. Are
you happy about the direction targeting is going or do you think it
could be
improved?</div><a name="10010544000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> In terms of eligibility&#151;and this is
why we see the value of putting this on a statutory
footing&#151;those judgments about who should be entitled to the
support and, by definition, who should not, are properly for the
Government. So we think it is much better that the Government now make
those decisions. What is important, given that this is a cost that will
be borne by all energy customers, is that people can be confident that
those measures are going to be received by and targeted at those who
are most in need. That is why things such as the data sharing trial
will be valuable to see how it works in
practice.</div><a name="10010544000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000272"></a>Anne
Main:</b> That all sounds as though it could be quite
expensive as well, if it expands the number of people who are now
included, as some would like to see. What steps does Ofgem take to
monitor the amounts spent by companies on
tariffs?</div><a name="10010544000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> If you are talking about social measures, I
should say that under the voluntary arrangements we produce an annual
report, as we have been asked to by the Government. The first, which
has just been produced, is on the first year of the voluntary
arrangements. We look at what the suppliers have been spending and at
the measures they have invested in. That is not a qualitative report;
it simply makes sure that the voluntary agreement that the Government
have secured with suppliers in relation to social measures is being
fulfilled. Certainly our first annual report suggested that suppliers
are collectively exceeding the first year&#146;s
targets.</div>
<a name="10010544000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000273"></a>Anne
Main:</b> So how are your responsibilities going to change now
with this new arrangement?</div>
<a name="10010544000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Under the new arrangement, we will move
through Ofgem E-Serve, the delivery arm of Ofgem, to administering the
levy. There is a power in the Bill to enable Ofgem also to have a role
in administering the reconciliation mechanism. What is very
important&#151;and we have been clear with the Government about this,
as with other environmental and other schemes that Ofgem administers on
the Government&#146;s behalf&#151;is that the rules and the
arrangements are set by Government and by Parliament, and that
Ofgem&#146;s role in those circumstances is to fulfil the official
administration of those. We would see our role going forward with the
social price support mechanism really very much mirroring the role that
we currently perform in administering the renewables obligation, the
CCL exemption and other schemes.</div>
<a name="10010544000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
155</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000274"></a>Anne

or is there more that you would like to see included?</div>
<a name="10010544000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I think that the Bill is an enabling power,
as you know. Obviously there is a lot of detail to be worked through,
which we are working through with the Department of Energy and Climate
Change to ensure that Ofgem is going to be in a position to fulfil its
administration function efficiently.</div>

that we want to see detail about the scheme that is clear about
eligibility and the functions that Ofgem should perform. It is really
the flesh on the bones of those arrangements, in exactly the same way
as we sought that detail in fulfilling the role that we have to
administer other Government environmental programmes.</div>

157</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000276"></a>Anne

<a name="10010544000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> There is no sign at present that that is
the case. Obviously, there is a way to go in getting the details of the
arrangements in place, and that will not happen in practice until after
the Bill has passed through and all the work is ongoing. There is no
evidence or sign that that will not be the case. Our message is very
clear to the Government: we expect as much clarity as possible from
them on how the arrangements will work, so that we can fulfil our
administrative function
clearly.</div><a name="10010544000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
158</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000277"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Can I just pick up on this? Like many, I am not a
great supporter of Ofgem. I think that in many ways it has been a
toothless tiger, particularly in dealing with the socially deprived. It
worries me that on clause 10 you are waiting for the Government to
design in detail the equalisation mechanism, because some companies
clearly will be hugely disadvantaged if they have a large number of
customers eligible for social tariffs unless there is a very effective
scheme. Are you saying that Ofgem will have no role whatever in
designing that scheme? Will you simply wait for the Government to hand
you down something?</div>
<a name="10010544000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> No, I am sorry if I created that
impression. I hope that I have made clear that we have been working
very closely with DECC to ensure that the role that Ofgem is going to
be invited to perform in administrating the social price support
mechanism is one that we are able to
play.</div><a name="10010544000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reconciliation mechanism is a very important one. In answer to a
Member&#146;s question, I made the point that ensuring that the costs
of the scheme are borne fairly across suppliers is going to be
fundamental to ensuring that there are not distorting effects that that
bear out on the market&#151;effects that mean, for example, that
suppliers will not have the right incentives to target support to those
customers. We care deeply about that and therefore we will be working
with DECC to ensure that that reconciliation mechanism achieves its end
and also allows Ofgem to do its job effectively, if Ofgem is to be
chosen for that particular function.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000278"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> One of the perverse problems is that for those
companies that are very successful in attracting the poorer customers
that we are talking about, whose energy uses make up a significant part
of their budget&#151;the fuel poor&#151;the costs of the
administration of the schemes may not be included. The companies would
have to bear a disproportionate cost. Do you see that as a problem or
is that something that can be waved away?</div>
<a name="10010544000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

that some companies are making in relation to the recovery of
administration costs under the DWP data-sharing
trial.</div>

160</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000279"></a>Mr.

not?</div><a name="10010544000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Not necessarily; that is one set of
arrangements but obviously there is going to be a new scheme set in
place, although the lessons, I am sure, will need to be learnt. In many
respects, what I am saying is that all of those details are ones that
will need to be worked through carefully with DECC to ensure that it is
equitable and not distorting&#151;not just for companies but,
critically, for their customers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
161</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000283"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Ofgem&#146;s view was prayed in aid this morning
by E.ON. When it comes to calculating the reconciliation between the
energy companies, the main choice in terms of equality is kilowatt-hour
or number of customer accounts. E.ON recommends kilowatt-hours and
prays in aid that Ofgem has the same opinion. I think that
Ofgem&#146;s opinion is on a different point from this one, so I
would be interested in your view on this particular scheme. Which is
the fairer way of making the reconciliation
calculation?</div><a name="10010544000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Sure. I am sorry; I had not appreciated
that that was your angle. We do have thoughts on that. It
doesn&#146;t just apply to the social price support mechanism. If you
look at the range of environmental programmes&#151;the programmes to
support CCS and other mechanisms, including this one&#151;I think
there is a question going forward about whether a more equitable way of
recovering those costs, ultimately from customers who bear the costs,
would be to base it on a kilowatt-hour basis as opposed to a
per-customer-number basis, because that would be more reflective of
actual
consumption.</div><a name="10010544000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have set that out in a policy paper and have discussed it with
industry, the fuel poor and consumer groups. The reason why we have
been debating this is that we know that lower-income households tend
to&#151;not exclusively, because of poor housing
conditions&#151;use less energy. Therefore, is it right that the
overall costs of these schemes could be more fairly distributed across
customers if they bore more relation to the actual consumption in
different households? That is a position I think E.ON picked up on this
morning, and we have set that out in a policy
paper.</div><a name="10010544000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
I was particularly pleased to see was that when the Government
published their own consultation on the CERT extension just before
Christmas, they raised that very issue in relation to the extension and
asked the question: &#147;Would it be fairer, particularly for
lower-income customers, if the costs of these schemes were based on
consumption rather than on simple flat per-customer number?&#148;
That is something we would argue, largely because we see there
are&#151;as you rightly point out&#151;significant impacts for
customers, particularly lower-income customers, in respect of some of
these schemes. Therefore it is right, with our principal objective of
protecting the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>interests of existing and future customers, that we think about ways in
which those costs could be more fairly
distributed.</div><a name="10010544000112"></a>

Willis:</b> Thank you. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
No, there is no &#147;but&#148; to it at all. I think what you,
Sarah, are saying is that there is no need for this level of detail to
go in the Bill, and I think that the Committee would agree with that.
Would it be helpful, however, if when we came to clause 10 in
particular, the Minister in his helpful fashion brought forward the
draft regulation that would go with the clause, so that he cleared up
the issues that he has so kindly brought forward this
afternoon?</div><a name="10010544000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000287"></a>Mr.

helpful.</div><a name="10010544000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Let me make my point. I have already said
to you that Ofgem thinks that there may be a more equitable way of
distributing the costs in relation not to just this scheme, but other
schemes as well. Let&#146;s face
it&#151;</div><a name="10010544000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000288"></a>Mr.

so&#151;</div><a name="10010544000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

is not specific to only this scheme; it is a general point that given
that the overall cost of consumers&#146; bills is, and will
increasingly be, attributed to two support mechanisms to meet proper
carbon targets and also social targets, it might be more
equitable.</div><a name="10010544000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
163</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000289"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000290"></a>Mr.

not?</div><a name="10010544000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000293"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is a question for the Minister, and we are
here to hear Ofgem&#146;s, not the Minister&#146;s, points. I
suggest we move
on.</div><a name="10010544000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
164</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000294"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I think the answer, Mr. Atkinson,
anyway is that there is a consultation out at the moment on whether the
current voluntary scheme should have its basis of reconciliation
changed in any event. Presumably, if a change is made in the current
scheme, that would follow the new
scheme.</div><a name="10010544000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sarah,
I want to ask you about clauses 16 and 17, which will obviously make a
considerable difference to your perceived and actual remit. What
difference do you think that will make, in terms of the way you will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>operate? There is potentially a real conflict between Ofgem&#146;s
previously regarded remit of keeping customer prices as low as possible
and ensuring competition, and the two new requirements placed on it in
clauses 16  and 17. Do you have a view on
that?</div><a name="10010544000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Yes, let me deal with both of those. First
of all, we very much welcome the proposed changes to Ofgem&#146;s
remit in the Energy Bill. In particular, if you look back over the last
year or 18 months to some of the practical decisions that Ofgem has
taken in the context of the existing set of duties, we have made some
significant decisions on increased investment on electricity
distribution and transmission networks&#151;another 40 per
cent. over the next five years to build our electricity distribution
networks. On the energy supply probe, we have taken some very clear and
specific actions to regulate and provide additional protection for
customers from unjustified price differences. That, incidentally, was a
change advanced by Ofgem that was not without controversy and did not
have unanimous support in the stakeholder community. Had we
been doing that in the context of the duties that are envisaged
in the Bill, the path toward that change might have been an
easier one.</div>
<a name="10010544000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are other things that Ofgem has been doing over the last year. In
particular, I would cite initiating two really fundamental reviews: the
approach taken to the regulation of monopoly networks, and the approach
taken to the way in which the existing market arrangements operate and
how well they are capable of meeting some of the significant challenges
we have. Overall, if you look at the context of things we have been
doing over the last 18 months under the current set of duties, we
reasonably welcome the changes coming forward. We see those changes as
really bringing more clarity and legitimacy to some of the developments
that Ofgem has been pushing and pursuing. They give us more flexibility
in addressing those issues, and also more clarity for the wider
stakeholder community. So we very much support the changes.</div>
<a name="10010544000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">On your
second point&#151;and I hope that the examples I have given you bear
that out&#151;Ofgem&#146;s focus has been increasingly towards
meeting our sustainability duties. That is not just about reducing
prices no matter what. It is not just about advancing competition. I
have given an example of where we have very specifically, in the retail
market, acted to regulate because our view is that while we want to
make changes to how the market works for retail customers, they are not
going to happen quickly enough to provide the protection that is needed
now. That is why we have taken the particular action to put in place
that licence condition to guard against unjustified price
discrimination.</div>
<a name="10010544000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
we have already been addressing some of the issues, but the changes to
the duties really do provide further legitimacy and further
flexibility.</div><a name="10010544000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
165</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000295"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Would you say, in answer to some people who
have observed Ofgem&#146;s arrangements concerning competition in the
past, that the culture change concerning those additional
responsibilities has already taken place in Ofgem? Or do you think that
the responsibilities set out in clause 16 and 17 would entail a
cultural change in the organisation in their own
right?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="10010544000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I think that we have already been moving
towards, in those very specific decisions that I have described to you
that we have taken, putting more investment into energy networks to
help meet our carbon targets and help meet our sustainability
objectives, and tackling some of the problems in the operation of the
market. All of those signify a movement, recognised in our existing
duties, toward meeting those objectives. However, the importance of the
changes is that it gives further support and allows further emphasis
toward those changes. Therefore, that is why we welcome
them.</div><a name="10010544000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
166</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000296"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Do you think that there is a congruence between
what the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report, which is
essentially a review of how the energy market as a whole might well
work in the context of decarbonisation of the energy economy, and the
new
duties?</div><a name="10010544000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Sorry, did you say &#147;conflict&#148;
or
&#147;confluence&#148;?</div><a name="10010544000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
167</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000297"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I am referring to the context of the
decarbonisation of the energy market and the extent to which the
existing energy market as a whole is fit for purpose, bearing in mind
those changes that are required. Now you have&#151;or you will have,
I hope, should the Bill become law&#151;those two new duties as a
part of Ofgem&#146;s remit. Does that extend to that fundamental
review of how the market might
work?</div><a name="10010544000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Let me just give a specific answer. One of
things that Ofgem has initiated in the last year to 18 months is
something that we call our Project Discovery. That is really a review
of the adequacy of the current market arrangements to meet very
significant challenges and changes that we face in the shift towards
reducing our carbon output and moving toward a more low-carbon economy.
The specific reason why we initiated that review in the context of our
existing duties is that we were concerned about the scale of the
challenge&#151;the particular issues facing us in terms of the
economic situation and the extent to which that might have a bearing on
investment&#151;and, looking out over the next decade or decade and a
half, the impact that would have on security of supply. We have
initiated that review under our existing set of arrangements. The
reason why we welcome potential changes to our duties is that they give
further legitimacy to the work that Ofgem is advancing and further
emphasis on the importance of that work, given that our overall duties
are to protect the interests of existing and future consumers. I think
the changes will complement the work that Ofgem has already initiated
through its Project Discovery.</div>
<a name="10010544000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
168</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000298"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> The other major change is the market power licence
condition in clauses 18 to 25. Can you tell us what powers Ofgem
currently have to deal with the problem that you seem to believe exists
here with energy companies balancing transmission-related constraints
and exploiting the price in some
way?</div><a name="10010544000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Ofgem has powers that are concurrent with
the Office of Fair Trading under the Competition Act, and so those are
the existing powers that we have. I will talk in a minute about how we
have tried to use those, and what the issues have been in doing so. It
is important to understand the context in which we are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>operating. We have asked the Government to look at introducing the
arrangements for the market power licence condition in this Bill. There
is the need for significant investment in transmission assets. We also
have significant increases in demand for new energy and generation
connections&#151;new renewable connections. Until that investment
fully comes on stream, we will be operating on a network that suffers
from severe constraints in some parts. Therefore, in those situations,
it may be possible for generators to take advantage of those, to unduly
exploit the situation. The impact of that falls on costs&#151;the
costs of having to take action to keep the system in
balance&#151;which are borne by customers. Our own analysis of that,
looked at in 2008-09, was that &#163;125 million of costs could be
attributed to the grid having to take such actions. So, those are the
particular circumstances that we are
facing.</div>
<a name="10010544000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Competition Act is available, and we have looked at trying to use it.
One of the things you have to do when prosecuting under the Competition
Act is to establish a position of dominance. You have to do that before
you can establish whether or not there has been an abuse of that
dominant position. Our efforts to use the Competition Act have been
challenged in the sense that it is quite difficult to establish
dominance in our electricity markets, which are temporal markets, and,
therefore, to establish abuse. We began a Competition Act
investigation, but our conclusion was that the chances of a successful
prosecution under that Act were quite difficult, and, therefore, it was
more sensible for us to use our resources
elsewhere.</div><a name="10010544000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that there is some concern about the MPLC. We have been working
with the Department of Energy and Climate Change on this, trying to
develop a very targeted and tailored approach that will deal with a
very specific set of issues. It will also have, wrapped around it, some
additional protections, which is why, for example, primary legislation
is important because one of those protections is to give generators,
which might be subject to an investigation or finding by Ofgem under
this new condition, the right to appeal to the Competition Appeal
Tribunal. We cannot confer that right through the ordinary licence
route; that can only be enabled by primary legislation. We think that
that is an important protection that should be there. The proposal is,
as you will no doubt be aware, that this is a time-limited power. So,
it is very focused and targeted on a particular set of circumstances or
situation as I described at the outset of my remarks. The other
protection is that we will provide guidance on how we propose to
enforce this condition if and when it is developed. Those measures
combined push towards what we believe is a proportionate measure to
tackle what could be a real issue for customers in this period when we
face increased investment, but a constrained network in the
interim.</div><a name="10010544000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
169</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000299"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> You mentioned the figure of &#163;125
million. For clarity, is that what you think has been lost through
companies abusing their position, or is that the constraint charges
that have been
paid?</div><a name="10010544000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> That is the cost of the actions that have
had to be taken by the National Grid to keep the system in balance.
Those costs pass directly to
customers.</div><a name="10010544000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
170</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000300"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> If I understand you correctly, these balances are
needed because of a failure or a lack of investment in certain areas in
the past. That is why the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>charge is required now. I am not quite following. I understand the need
to upgrade and I think that companies will follow that and understand
it as well. What seems to be suggested by some companies is that this
will turn out to be very costly for them in particular areas&#151;the
Cheviot gap being the obvious one in the Scotland-England
interconnector. I am not quite following why it is necessary to
introduce this for something that might happen. Do you have any
evidence that this has happened up to now with existing
systems?</div><a name="10010544000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I have given the figure of
&#163;125 million, which is the cost of having to take
that action. I have also given the example of where we have tried to
pursue a case under the Competition
Act.</div><a name="10010544000146"></a>

171</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000301"></a>Mr.

&#163;125 million was the cost to the National Grid of the
constraints. Is that
correct?</div><a name="10010544000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

balancing actions to manage the constrained
situation.</div><a name="10010544000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
172</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000302"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> But that is a natural part of the grid as it exists
at the moment. If I understand you correctly, that is part of the
balance in the existing grid. It is not necessarily an exploitive
action by the companies. The grid will have to do that balancing
anyway. It just seems a disproportionate act for something that may
happen and that is due to lack of investment in parts of the grid up
until now. It seems to be pushing it on to the companies and putting
evil intent on them, when there is no evidence of such evil actions
taking place. I do not want to be too dramatic about
it.</div><a name="10010544000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> If there is any further information I can
provide for you on this issue, I will do so. It is important to
remember that we had a series of concerns about behaviours by certain
generators in spring 2008 and commenced a Competition Act
investigation. As I explained, we did not feel that it would be a
proportionate use of our resources to carry on prosecuting under the
Competition Act, given the problems it presents, so we closed the
investigation. We continue to have concerns about the behaviour we
observed so the case is made for this
measure.</div><a name="10010544000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to think ahead. In a world that envisages a
connect-and-manage approach to transmission access, those opportunities
for constraints on the network are going to get even greater.
Therefore, there is the risk that undue exploitation can be exercised.
It is important that a regulator with the principal objective of
protecting the interests of consumers is armed with the appropriate
powers to investigate those examples and, if appropriate, take action.
We were talking about putting in place a licence obligation that would
allow us to investigate if certain circumstances emerged&#151;I
emphasise that we envisage specific circumstances. There would then be
a period of investigation and the finding of a breach or otherwise. It
is important for us to put ourselves in a position to protect
consumers. I emphasise that a number of other protections are
envisaged, not least a right of appeal, a time limit and, of course,
the commitment I have explained to set out our likely approach
to 
enforcement.</div><a name="10010544000151"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
173</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000303"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I do not think that we are going to agree on this.
Finally, if the problem is with the grid, is the correct solution not
to speed up the investment for the parts of the grid where the problem
is? Is it not part of the regulator&#146;s duties to push that
forward?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div><a name="10010544000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> It is very important that there is
investment in the grid. We are very clear that we do not want to see
investment being the issue that stands in the way of the development of
the grid, and therefore of the development of opportunities to connect
new generation and new renewables. Just to give you an
example&#151;to put some fat on the bones of that, if you
like&#151;that is why we have put out proposals for an
additional &#163;1 billion-worth of investment in the grid
and the transmission network. That is in addition to the allowances
that already sit in existing price controls. It is also a proposal for
additional investment outside of the price control period.</div>
<a name="10010544000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
that goes a long way towards meeting what the industry estimates will
need to be around &#163;4.7 billion of investment between now
and 2020 in order to get the national grid and the transmission network
into the position that we need, given the new renewables and other
generation connections coming on-stream. So it is absolutely proper
that the regulator makes sure that investment is there to respond to
that demand. That investment, of course, needs to be developed in an
efficient way, given that it is customers who are picking up the cost
of
that.</div><a name="10010544000154"></a>

174</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000304"></a>John
Robertson:</b><b class="B"> </b>You mentioned the market power licence
condition and the problems there were or are. The problems are
obviously on the side of the utilities. Do you have a problem with
it?</div><a name="10010544000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

you.</div><a name="10010544000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000305"></a>John
Robertson:</b> On the MPLC, the utilities don&#146;t like
it. They see it as being counterproductive in terms of investment. How
do you see
it?</div><a name="10010544000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> We very much support it. We put the case to
Government for a MPLC, because we think it is an important tool to have
in our toolkit to help protect the customer&#146;s
interests.</div>
<a name="10010544000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
175</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000306"></a>John
Robertson:</b> So do you see your position as being to protect
the customer or to help with investment, or are you somewhere in
between?</div><a name="10010544000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> The customer&#146;s interests are served
by upping our investment. But, it is important that that is not
investment at any costs. It has to be efficient investment because it
is customers who pick up the bill. Both of those issues are really
central to our role of protecting the customer&#146;s
interests.</div><a name="10010544000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
176</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000307"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I do not want to put words in your mouth, but
would you consider that the utilities are basically crying wolf in what
they are saying, and they just do not want any kind of legislative
powers given to the MPLC that can curtail their activities of misuse?
Would that be a fair
statement?</div><a name="10010544000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I am not going to let you put words in my
mouth. Let me be clear: the companies have raised concerns about the
MPLC proposal. We are strong supporters of it; we are advocates of it;
we suggested to the Government that we need those extra powers. Having
said that, as I explained, there are issues. That is why, through
working with the DECC, we have put together what we think are a set of
additional protections around this power. That was done in recognition
of those issues, but it does not mean removing our need for the power
that this Bill hopefully will enable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div><a name="10010544000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
177</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000308"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am concerned about clause 26, which extends the
period during which Ofgem can impose penalties on companies from 12
months to five years. I am concerned that that suggests that Ofgem is
not really doing its job properly or that it will get around to doing
it in 12 months. How big a difference will this really make to your
work?</div><a name="10010544000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> This is important. Perhaps I can just step
back for a moment. As regulator charged with the duties that we have to
protect a customer&#146;s interests, what is important is that we
take the experience that we have of applying the regulatory regime as
it is at the moment and ask ourselves this question: is it doing the
job it should be doing? Do we have the powers we think we need; are
there ways in which we can better protect customers? The MPLC that we
have just been talking about and the one we are talking about now are
two very practical examples of where Ofgem has been doing its job and
has found that there are some gaps in our regulatory toolkit that we
need to
plug.</div><a name="10010544000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point about the 12-month issue is that at the moment, in practice, if
we pursue an investigation into a company, we have the power to be able
to impose a financial penalty. But, we can only take account of
12-months&#146; worth of history. If I can perhaps give you a
practical example to help illustrate this. We managed an investigation
last year into EDF Energy Networks business because we saw poor
customer service in the way in which it was fulfilling its obligations
to provide electricity connections. We concluded that investigation,
found against the company and imposed a penalty, which was &#163;2
million.</div>
<a name="10010544000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
period that we could take account of in determining that penalty was 12
months from the point at which the breach occurred, although our
investigation actually exposed breaches that went back beyond that. But
in setting the penalty itself, we could only take account of that
12-month period. The reason why that change is important is that in the
event that companies do breach their licence obligations we investigate
and need to take action. We are capable of taking into account in the
penalty that is set the full context of the abuse or the problem,
because it sends the right signal and message to the industry about the
importance of compliance overall.</div>
<a name="10010544000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
178</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000309"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> So you want to find &#163;10 million, instead of
&#163;2
million?</div><a name="10010544000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> No, I am not going to draw that conclusion
in that case. I am telling you about our practical experience of
operating under the regime as it is at the moment in that case. That is
why we think it is incumbent on us, when we see these problems, to say,
&#147;We have a problem here, so let&#146;s see if we can fix it by
expanding and extending our powers in a proportionate
way.&#148;</div><a name="10010544000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
179</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000310"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> So I was wrong in thinking that Ofgem might have
been rather backward in seeing to its work
programme.</div><a name="10010544000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I would take that view, absolutely. What we
are talking about here is enforcement, and I think that enforcement is
terribly important. Making the market work effectively for consumers is
not just about putting the rules in place in the first place and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>making sure they are right. It is not just about monitoring those or
ensuring that customers can get the information they need to actively
engage in the market. It is also about having the right powers to be
able to enforce those rules, and this area is an example of where we
think we need a different set of powers or better powers to be able to
do
that.</div>
<a name="10010544000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
180</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000311"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Thank you very much. I shall move on to clause 27,
which will allow the Secretary of State to set up schemes to adjust
energy prices with particular suppliers for disadvantaged customers
whom he considers are being treated unfairly. From your experience, do
you think that those schemes are required, and will they really be
workable? Will there be too many loopholes and areas where business can
get out of the schemes put in
place?</div><a name="10010544000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I am sure that the Minister will have a
view on this as well. Those powers actually have been in statute since
the Utilities Act 2000, and this particular provision will plug a
specific gap that has emerged. Ofgem&#146;s energy supply probe did a
very thorough investigation on what was happening in the retail market,
and we found several customers who were being not very well served by
the operation of the market as it was. That is why we have made a
number of proposals for regulatory changes and new licence
conditions.</div>
<a name="10010544000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">One group of
customers who were particularly poorly served were those who were off
the gas grid and therefore received only electricity&#151;often while
taking their heating from oil-fired central heating of liquefied
petroleum gas. In those situations, they are not able to take advantage
of some of the better competitive offers available for dual fuel
customers. We found that energy suppliers were overcharging those
customers in order to subsidise others. That was a problem, and one
that we wanted to tackle. We have done that through the regulation to
which I referred that bans or prohibits unjustified prices.</div>
<a name="10010544000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the Government&#146;s changes to those particular
powers will plug that gap&#151;in other words, allow the current
arrangements to extend in addition to situations where gas customers
might be subsidising electricity customers, or electricity customers
subsidising gas customers. It is plugging a gap in a set of
protections, arrangements and schemes that are already available in
statute. In so far as they do that, they provide a back stop to the
arrangements that Ofgem itself has put in place, but which, in our
view, do not negate the importance of the work we have done and the
importance of putting in those protections.</div>
<a name="10010544000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
181</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000312"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> In truth, if Ofgem does not do its job as
effectively as it ought to, the back stop is that the Government are
there to do it for Ofgem. So the regulator is being regulated, which
sounds like over-regulation to me.</div>
<a name="10010544000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I am not sure that I share that view. The
regulations are there already, as that scheme has been in statute since
2000, so to the extent that plugging that gap provides additional
back-stop powers, then so be it. That does not take away from what we
see as important in relation to our own
work.</div><a name="10010544000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
182</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000313"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Brian Binley is right that the only reason why the
Minister has included clause 27, in his wisdom, is because Ofgem has
failed in its duty to protect vulnerable customers who have gas but not
electricity, or who have a particular tariff.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div><a name="10010544000177"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I am not going to answer a question about
the Minister; he can answer himself. I have just
explained&#151;</div><a name="10010544000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000314"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Is that because you have
failed?</div><a name="10010544000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> No. I have just explained to you that we
have done a thorough investigation of the market. We found and
highlighted the fact that there were  4 million customers who
were suffering, which is why we have put the regulations in place.
Incidentally, just to be clear, in anticipation of those
regulations&#151;</div><a name="10010544000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
183</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000315"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Sorry, but before you start again, what I do not
understand is that you have said on around five occasions that the
powers were already in place&#151;that is what you have said. Is it
not, therefore, a failure of Ofgem that the Minister has to introduce
this clause in this new Bill? Why does he have to do that if the powers
are already in
place?</div><a name="10010544000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> To be honest, I think that is a question
for him. What I am telling you is what Ofgem has done in response to
the problem faced by those other key
questions.</div><a name="10010544000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
184</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000316"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> May I ask one final question about disadvantaged
customers? The term &#147;disadvantaged&#148; depends on who you
call a disadvantaged customer. One of my concerns relates to some of
the smaller suppliers of energy within the market, particularly to
commercial customers, and the use of verbal contracts. In your view,
would it be possible under clause 27 to introduce amendments that
included those commercial customers and that outlawed things such as
verbal contracts? Would Ofgem welcome that or do you not have a
view?</div><a name="10010544000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> No, I very much have a view. In answer to
the technical question whether it is possible, the answer must be yes,
on the basis that legislation is Parliament&#146;s will. The problem
that you quite rightly highlight is something that concerns us and we
have looked to address it through the outcomes to our energy market
probe. Some of the other protections that we have put in place are
specific protections for small business customers, particularly those
who are facing what is known as contract roll-over, which is when you
are a busy small business with lots of things to deal with and your
energy supplier phones you to say, &#147;By the way, you&#146;re
coming to the end of your contract,&#148; and it is just rolled over.
The next thing you know, the customer finds himself on the same or
worse terms, which is why, in our energy probe, we have put specific
protections in place against that behaviour. I would be very happy to
write to the Committee, if it thought it useful, to set out what those
protections
are.</div><a name="10010544000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
185</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000317"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I have one more point on the new part of the
back-stop power. Your way of solving a problem, generally speaking, is
to introduce a new licence condition, as you have done following the
market probe. There are some peculiar rules, however, in relation to
the people who are being regulated in that they are able to object to
the new licence condition and not give their agreement to it, which
would hold up the implementation of your licence agreement. Could you
remind us of what that rule is and how long a delay it can lead
to?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div><a name="10010544000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Yes, absolutely. The rules are that there
are two ways in which we can change licences. One is to get the
agreement of the industry, which requires 80 per cent. of the industry
to support the change. That is done on the basis of customer numbers.
If we do not secure that, the other way we have to secure changes to
licence conditions is by making a reference to the Competition
Commission. Those are the arrangements as they exist at the
moment.</div><a name="10010544000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
highlighted to you, when we talked about the probe earlier, that the
unjustified price discrimination clause was not without opposition. We
very much saw it as important for customers&#146; interests, but
there were others who took a different view. Again, one of the reasons
why we see the changes to the duties as helpful is that they would have
perhaps made it clearer that it was legitimate for Ofgem to be able to
reach for regulation in that circumstance, and not just rely on
competition. That might have eased the process through which we
eventually secured agreement to that licence
condition.</div><a name="10010544000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
186</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000318"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> In the future, it might help the energy companies
that are being regulated to give their agreement to your licence
conditions if their understanding is that a scheme under the Act might
be forthcoming if they do not
agree.</div><a name="10010544000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> As I said, the scheme is on the statute and
is plugging the gap. It sits there and I am sure that that is not lost
on energy
suppliers.</div><a name="10010544000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
187</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000319"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> May I explore this a little further? The role of
Ofgem above anything else is to protect consumers, so protecting
disadvantaged consumers should be the most important thing about your
role. Suddenly we find that the Secretary of State is going to have a
job to protect them as well. Should these powers not have been given to
Ofgem in your view, rather than the Secretary of State having different
powers?</div>
<a name="10010544000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, we
know that the Minister would not do that, but under a different
Minister this might be open to political intervention, to say that the
people living in Scotland or the north-east have disadvantages because
it is colder and therefore we want to help them. Therefore, this should
be handled by an independent regulator, rather than a political
Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="10010544000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> That is a difficult question for a
regulator to answer. Our focus, given the objective to protect the
interests of consumers, is on whether we have the powers. Are we doing
the right thing? Are we putting in place the right licence obligations?
That is where we would be principally focused.</div>
<a name="10010544000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
decisions in other areas where there is political intervention, and
perhaps for those reasons. I can give an example in relation to
transmission charging, where there is a set of arrangements based on
the cost reflectivity, but separately Government have taken powers to
cap those charges in certain areas for particular needs. It is not an
example outside the disadvantaged customers arena but it is one that is
already there. What is important in this case is that the regulator has
the powers and the authority&#151;small &#147;a&#148;&#151;to
be able to put in place the protections to meet our principal
objective. That is what we sought to
do.</div><a name="10010544000193"></a>

up the facts. If he does not have the facts, he can make them
up:</div>

imagine any powers such as that applying to Ofgem&#151;powers under

<a name="10010544000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> Much of Ofgem&#146;s business is
conducted fully transparently. We consult on the basis of our

is there anything that you have been doing recently that you would have
done differently if those new powers existed now? For example, would
Project Discovery, which I think has been a very important piece of
work, have been handled in a different way or have reached different
conclusions if you had had a broader
remit?</div><a name="10010544000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> That is a difficult question to answer.
What would we do differently? We would wait for those circumstances to
present themselves. What I am clear about, and I hope I have made it
clear to the Committee, is that in what we are doing now&#151;for
example, with Project Discovery&#151;the changes provide legitimacy
to that work and further flexibility in the options and approaches that
Ofgem can look at in meeting its principal objective. I could give the
specific example of how we put in place the undue price discrimination
clause, in the face of some opposition. Had we been operating 
in the proposed environment and been advancing that proposal, it might
have had a smoother path to being put in
place.</div><a name="10010544000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
191</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000323"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Ofgem has always seen its remit as the Government
set policy, and Ofgem administers. This proposal rather changes that.
In the past, it could have been the Minister who said, &#147;This is
the balance that we think is appropriate between affordability or
climate change or energy security.&#148; Now, though, Ofgem will have
the ability to decide which is the most important of those. Do you not
think that that is an issue that should still remain with the Secretary
of State, who is accountable to
Parliament?</div><a name="10010544000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I think that the new duties further clarify
the role of Ofgem in protecting the interests of existing and future
consumers. We will therefore have to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>continue to balance those interests. I think we do so within a
context&#151;it is probably worth reminding the Committee of
this&#151;of social and environmental guidance, for example, that has
recently been laid in the House, to which Ofgem has to have regard in
fulfilling its functions and
duties.</div><a name="10010544000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the principles of the social and environmental guidance is that in
situations where actions might result in significant costs to industry
or consumers, those matters are reserved for Government&#151;quite
properly so, because they are reserved for those who are accountable
rather than to a regulator that is unelected and therefore
unaccountable. That is an important distinction that sits in the social
and environmental guidance that will endure under the existing
arrangements.</div><a name="10010544000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
192</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000324"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> Do you have a view on clause 27 on page 22, which
Charles Hendry has just mentioned? Subsection 7
states:</div><a name="10010544000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may make such assumptions and calculations as he or
she considers to be appropriate for the purposes of this
section&#148;.</div><a name="10010544000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the high standards that you have been speaking about, which you have to
apply to your own area of work, how do you feel looking over your
shoulder and seeing the Secretary of State wanting to operate in this
manner&#151;or doing so if this clause is
passed?</div><a name="10010544000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I think that I am also right in saying that
one of the sets of arrangements that apply to the existing scheme, in
respect of which the amendment is going to plug a gap, means that the
scheme as developed will be consulted on with Ofgem and with other
stakeholders. That will be an important part of the process of ensuring
that those arrangements are applied
effectively.</div><a name="10010544000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000325"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> So you have no problems with the wording of this
clause.</div><a name="10010544000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> I really do think that that is a matter for
the Government. I have made clear what our own approach is: we are
bound by the production of evidence and impact assessments, and all
those sorts of things. That is an important part of the transparent
process&#151;</div><a name="10010544000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000326"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I recognise
that.</div><a name="10010544000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> As are the Government. Let us be clear.
Those questions are best addressed
by&#151;</div><a name="10010544000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
193</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000327"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I do appreciate that and I appreciate that I am
probably testing the boundaries here. But I posed the question simply
because it must be frustrating to be on one side, trying to meet very
high standards of transparency, openness and accuracy, and seeing a
rather crude approach being taken on the other side of the
equation.</div><a name="10010544000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> That might be your view. I am sorry, but I
am really not in a position to
comment.</div><a name="10010544000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000328"></a>Mr.

Thank you very
much.</div><a name="10010544000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000329"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
194</b><a name="10010544000330"></a><b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): I apologise
for not having been here at the beginning. I will not trespass on other
detailed questions. Can I just ask a couple of things that may wrap up
and help
us?</div><a name="10010544000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
the proposals in part 3, can you just clarify which came from Ofgem to
Government, as opposed to being ideas from Government? Were any of the
proposals to improve the system not yours, and were any of your
proposals to Government not picked up by Government and not put in the
Bill?</div><a name="10010544000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> No, there are two specific issues that we
have raised with the Government. One is the proposal to introduce the
market power licence condition and the other is to extend our powers to
be able to impose financial penalties and recognise that the period is
beyond the 12 months&#146; limitation that stands at the moment.
Those are the two proposals that we specifically put
forward.</div><a name="10010544000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
195</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000331"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> From consumer groups and consumers there are
suggestions that Ofgem wants to have stronger powers. Can you tell us
what the other powers are that you are under pressure to adopt, or that
you have been lobbied to argue that you should have the power to enact?
In particular, I know that you have been lobbied to do something about
the multiplicity of tariffs that the utility companies are allowed to
have. Why do you think there is not anything in the Bill that would
allow you to be much more rigorous in restricting the number and
complexity of tariffs? If we amended the Bill to allow that, would you
be glad of that and would it make the consumer&#146;s life easier and
give better rights to
consumers?</div><a name="10010544000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> A right for consumers is obviously the
choice of a range of
tariffs.</div><a name="10010544000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000332"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> If you can understand the
choice.</div><a name="10010544000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>The challenge is to be able
to understand the tariffs and make sense of them. Again, coming back to
our energy supply probe, we looked at this issue in particular. That is
why we have put forward some specific new rules around giving better
information to customers, both on their energy bill and in an annual
statement about the tariff they are on&#151;and, perhaps, what other
choices there might be in respect of their energy consumption, such as
if they were to stay on the same tariff what the projected costs might
be in the next year. This is all designed to arm the customer with much
better information to make better choices or whatever choices they may
choose to make.</div>
<a name="10010544000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing I would draw your attention to in relation to the energy supply
probe is that we have also developed a set of standards of conduct.
These are very consumer-focused standards. In the area of tariff
complexity we have specifically said that suppliers should not develop
tariffs that are unnecessarily or unduly complex. That is a standard
that we will take account of as we apply the detailed licence
conditions that come into place as part of the new probe protections.
That is a very important message to the industry: in advancing
different products and different approaches, which is important for
consumers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>because this is about offering choice and ways in which you can manage
your energy consumption differently, they should be designed, presented
and marketed in a way that does not confuse, but aids and assists. We
will hold fast to how we look at those standards as we apply the
licence conditions going
forward.</div><a name="10010544000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other thing that I would just say to you is that in developing the
remedies that we did with the energy supply probe, we did not sit in a
vacuum and do this  on our own&#151;we tested them with our
own household panel. We have appointed our own panel of 100
householders who advise us on consumer issues. We took our specific
remedies to our householder panel. Certainly our householder panel was
very helpful and instrumental in helping to shape the very specific
remedies and actions that we have now developed. That is very important
to bear in mind throughout. A point that I think your question alludes
to is how the customer sees and works with those, which is important in
making sure that the protections are going to be effective for
customers at the end of the
day.</div><a name="10010544000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
196</b><b class="B"><a name="10010544000333"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> One last question. If we wanted to make a much
greater reduction in tariff options than what you described will
produce&#151;a check last year suggested that there were 4,000
different tariffs&#151;can we rely on you to deliver that? If so, in
what time, under the new arrangements? Alternatively, will we have to
legislate now to make sure that there is a limited number of simple
options, so that all customers can understand the choice for them,
rather than finding the choices so confusing that many give up on a
regular basis, as they still do now?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div><a name="10010544000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Harrison:</b></i> In my answer to the previous question I
very much signalled that there should not necessarily be limits on
choice and therefore there should not necessarily be limits on tariff.
I should make the point as well that while there may well be 4,000
tariffs in the energy markets, there are many, many more in the mobile
phone market. There is a very complex set of tariff options in other
markets as well. It is not unique to energy.</div>
<a name="10010544000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">But that is
not a reason not to make those tariffs clear. Therefore I would
argue&#151;we would argue&#151;for putting the onus and the
emphasis on the energy suppliers to make what they are offering clear
and understandable to customers, both in their marketing material and,
frankly, when they are on the doorstep; that is why we&#146;ve got
much stronger rules about doorstep selling now in place too.</div>
<a name="10010544000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">All these new
arrangements come into place on 18 January. So the emphasis
is on making them clearer to customers rather than necessarily limiting
the choice. If Parliament takes a different view, clearly, as is always
the case, Ofgem will absolutely respond and put in place and act on
whatever Parliament
decides.</div><a name="10010544000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010544000334"></a>The
Chairman:</b> If there are no further questions, may I thank
Sarah Harrison for coming here today and for making such a valuable
contribution to our deliberations on the Bill? We are
