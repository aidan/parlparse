                           </span> Good morning, Mr
Benton, and good morning, members of the Committee. [<span class="smallcaps">Hon.
Members:</span> “Good morning.”] It’s a good

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause is important, which is why I want to talk about it for a few
minutes. I disagree with the Minister about police and crime
commissioners, but I understand his arguments. People will have
opinions and judgments about the matter. There is a flaw in the
drafting. “Weakness” is a better word than flaw, and
there are certainly weaknesses in the Bill with respect to the role of
police and crime panels, and I am not sure that that aspect has been as
carefully worked through as some of the others. There is clearly a
tension between the desire to allow the police and crime commissioner
to have huge discretion and freedom to operate without restriction and,
at the same time, to be able to say, “That’s probably not
quite right. We need some restraint on the police and crime
commissioner and a review of his activity, so we need a police and
crime
panel.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
shall debate the composition of the panels under schedule 6, as the way
in which they have been established shows recognition of the force in
the argument that one person representing huge geographical areas
presents something of a problem, and the police and crime panels need
to be able to deal with it. It is not clear to me what the Government
want to achieve with police and crime panels. Is the panel to be a bit
of a review and scrutiny body or will it be holding the police and
crime commissioner to account? What will be its role?<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I ask the
Committee to reflect on the drafting of the clause. Apart from sitting
down and discussing what has happened, what will the panel do? As the
Minister knows, I am not the only one who asks such questions. His hon.
Friends, the hon. Members for Cambridge and for Edinburgh West, have
tabled amendment after amendment throughout the Bill seeking
clarification 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 374<a class="bkMark" name="Column374">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and to strengthen the role of the police and crime panel because they,
too, are worried about its involvement in the decisions of the police
and crime
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(2) enables a review of the draft police and crime plan by the police
and crime panel, after which it can make a report or recommendations.
It cannot do anything else. It can have a good discussion, tell the
police and crime commissioner what it thinks and then the police and
crime commissioner can totally ignore it. The Minister will say that
that is fine because, if that takes place in 2012 when the first
elections take place, there will be no need to worry because in 2016 it
will be possible to vote the person out. I am not sure that scrutiny of
the role of the police and crime commissioner will be as effective as
people expect.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let us
imagine a scenario in 2012 in which a meeting of the police and crime
panel is called under subsection (3), at which the new
police and crime commissioner is present. That is not the best example
to cite as the meeting will be set up to discuss the annual report and
the panel would have to have been in office for a year. Under
subsection (5),<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000020">&#160;</a>

                        <p>When
it has done that, it can make reports or recommendations; it cannot do
anything. It cannot say that the police and crime commissioner has got
something wrong. If that was in 2012—the Minister says,
“Don’t worry, the public will decide; it is democratic
accountability.”—the public would have to wait until 2016
to vote out the police and crime commissioner. In 2013, an annual
report would be made available to the police and crime panel by the
police and crime commissioner. The panel will have to arrange a meeting
to discuss the annual report, and then—what a staggering power
the Minister has included in the Bill—it can review it and make
recommendations; it cannot do anything. It cannot say to the police and
crime commissioner, “You have got it wrong. Change it.”
Well, it can say that, but he or she can totally ignore it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
subsection (6), the panel can publish the report or the recommendations
and send them to the local authority. There is no power—no teeth

can also cause votes to take place. <em>[Interruption.]</em> Will the
hon. Gentleman bear with me? Of course Select Committees can cause
votes to take place. They can propose a change to a particular piece of
legislation or to the way in which something is conducted. Members are
influenced by Select Committee reports. They read them very carefully
and sometimes take up their policy challenges, argue for them in the
House of Commons and sometimes even put forward legislative change
themselves as Back Benchers. Because they are influenced by those
reports, a legislative

raised the issue. He will have read schedule 6 carefully, and of course

subject to a referendum, in

Criminal Justice. The elected mayors—the ones who already exist
plus the additional elected mayors—will automatically be part of
the police and crime
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
I am an elected mayor in one part of a police force area—let us
say I am in Devon and Cornwall or Derbyshire and I am the elected mayor
for Heanor or Ilkeston. I choose them at random. The mayor
has to be the member for the participating authority, so he or she goes
on to the police and crime panel for Derbyshire. Let us say that I am
democratically elected in Ilkeston, Heanor or perhaps Amber Valley on
the basis of promises made about policing in my manifesto, and I answer
to the police and crime panel. In Derbyshire, there is one with a
democratic mandate but no power. The police and crime commissioner also
has a democratic mandate, according to the Minister. In such
circumstances, whose democratic mandate has more legitimacy? Is it the
person who is directly elected for a particular area or the person who
is elected across the whole force
area?<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am in favour of the localism agenda, but there is an issue about
elected mayors. It is not necessarily the fact that they should not be
on the police and crime panel, but there needs to be greater
clarification about what actually happens. In West Yorkshire, there may
be three or four elected mayors who are automatically part of the
police and crime panel—elected on mandates in Leeds or Bradford
to do certain things on policing. If the police and crime commissioner
says, “I am not doing that”, but the elected mayor says,
“But I have a democratic mandate from the people of Leeds or
Bradford”, whose democratic mandate carries the greater
legitimacy? The Minister might point out that such matters were covered
in the Bill—there will be regulations or some such thing. I do
not know. But it is difficult to understand how it will actually
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000035">&#160;</a>

are not necessarily the best voices to listen to. I will take a couple
of examples of local people at random. I have chosen Surrey, so that I
cannot be accused of bias, to make my point about police and crime

the local government and the police. If genuine concerns are

inadequately in my view, that the commissioner has a duty to
co-operate. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd
that the crime and disorder reduction partnerships are exceedingly
important. I understand that there is no requirement in the Bill for
the representative from the local authority to be the person who is
responsible for crime and disorder reduction within a local authority
area, which, if that is the case, the Minister might reconsider.
Everyone who works in this area is concerned about the undermining of
those local partnerships, where there is real accountability on what
people
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000046">&#160;</a>

Bill, the Government seem to be attempting here to introduce a mini,
scaled-down version of those authorities, and it is not at all clear
how that will work. I think that it was Professor Loader who said in
his evidence to the Committee that he thought there had been an element
of parallel development, with the Government having one set of
proposals for police and crime commissioners and, as an afterthought,
when they recognised that the commissioners would not fulfil the local
democratic function that was claimed, a separate and parallel set for
police and crime
panels.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000049">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That
is central to the issue. It is hard to see what function police and

clear that doubt about commissioners’ effectiveness is

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am struggling to come to terms with what the Government are trying to
do, and cannot see how this works. The police and crime commissioner
produces the annual report, which is his attempt to tell the public how
well he has fulfilled his function of holding the police to account,
and how well he has been doing the things that he got elected on, but
he is not required to go to the public and explain his annual report.
There is an intermediary now—the police and crime panel, which
no one has elected.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The panel is
required to step into the middle, hold a meeting and question the
commissioner in public. If this is about public accountability and
about people feeling that there is some democratic control over the
police, why are the public not invited to directly question the
commissioner? After all, he is the person who stood for election and
made promises. What is under scrutiny is whether he has fulfilled those
promises, so why is there not a direct relationship between his report
and the public’s ability to question him? I do not think that
the proposal is rational. This is the penalty for having an
afterthought and trying to create functions subsequently for the
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have been at pains to say that this is not an attempt to
politicise the police and to rule out the concerns of others but, as
schedule 6, paragraph 7 states, there is an expectation that the panels
should reflect the political balance of the areas that they represent.
There are not enough safeguards in that, however, to guarantee that the
public get a fair deal. What happens if the same party controls both
the commissioner and the panel? An overt element of political bias is
being introduced directly into the monitoring and control of our
police, and I do not see anywhere in the Bill any safeguard against the
risks of politicisation in that scenario. People would want to know
about the things that the police have been queried on in recent times,
such as the use of undercover officers and officers who are not serving
under the immediate commander for operations, and we would not want to
think that an element of political bias could keep that information
from
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Equally,
if the panel is really there to be the local face of public involvement
I wonder why we have given it such limited powers. I think it was De
Grazia Associates 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 379<a class="bkMark" name="Column379">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Ltd that argued in its submission that we should give the panels similar
powers to those of the panels that exist in New York. It was very
explicit that the panels in the UK should be able to hold confirmatory
hearings and take evidence on a very wide basis. It seems to me that,
unless I have misunderstood the clause, those powers are not permitted
by it. Again, that suggests that the panels have been created for
cosmetic purposes and that their real powers are
limited.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
fact, having read the clause I am not at all clear whose responsibility
it is to establish the police and crime panels. The clause makes it
clear that they have to be established, but in the case of multiple
authorities working together, who exactly is the person who must take
responsibility for ensuring that a panel is set up? It is not clear in
this legislation that anyone has that direct responsibility. It seems
to me that in a situation where several authorities are arguing about
the cost of establishing panels, the venues in which panels could meet
and who would pay for the running costs of those meetings, it would be
perfectly possible for there to be a long period of delay without
anyone taking responsibility for establishing a panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Then there is
the question of who is entitled to serve on the panels. As far as I can
see, there are no restrictions on convicted criminals or former
prisoners serving on them. So, in the interests of law and
order—<em>[</em>

                           <em>]</em> It seems to me that
in the interests of law and order what has happened is that we have a
Government who are quite happy for convicted criminals to stand as
police and crime commissioners and for prisoners to vote to elect those
commissioners, and now there are no restrictions on criminals serving
on the panels. No wonder clause 14 requires the police and crime
commissioner to take a special view of the plight of victims. That is
understandable, because this Bill sounds like a criminals’
charter rather than anything that is particularly motivated by the
interests of ordinary people.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am not sure
what happens when the members of the police and crime panel do not feel
that they are being given adequate information. That is an issue that
we spent some time debating in our previous sitting. The hon. Member
for Edinburgh West had tabled some amendments on it. He was concerned
about the lack of information available to panels and the fact that
that lack of information might make it quite difficult for the public
to feel that they could play their proper part. It would help if the
Minister informed us of the circumstances in which the commissioner or
the Mayor’s office will have the discretion to withhold
information from the police and crime panel. I am sure that there might
be circumstances in which the commissioner or the Mayor’s office
would regard certain information as sensitive. However, unless we know
what the guidelines about the withholding of information will be, it
seems to me that the commissioner or the Mayor’s office will be
at liberty to supply only the information that suits them. That will
make a mockery of the system.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is not
clear in clause 28 who is responsible for monitoring the running costs
and the expenditure of the panels. It is also unclear what will happen
if there is evidence that a panel is exceeding the costs of a previous
police authority. The Government say that they do not want that to
happen, but in this day and age most of us would accept that it
requires more than just the Government not wanting it to happen to
ensure that it does not

danger of creating a parallel system is that we might create parallel
costs too. We should be clear about such costs at this stage rather
than wait until the measure is put into
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions are intended to be an exercise in transparency and
accountability, so I am not clear why it is okay for the panels to be
appointed as they will be. The argument for doing away with police
authorities is that they are not sufficiently democratically
accountable—that people who serve on them are appointed as a
result of an indirect election and are not, therefore, the right people
to represent the public’s views.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
clause, however, there is nothing about the democratic legitimacy of
police and crime panels. In this day and age—particularly under
a Government who are obsessed with the idea of holding elections and
referendums at every opportunity—I should have thought it would
not be beyond somebody’s wit to devise a system to ensure, at
least, that such panels had the approval or endorsement of local
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At present, I
understand, the panels will mirror the current arrangements for police
authorities. They will largely be made up of people who are elected to
some kind of local council structure, who will then be indirectly
selected or seconded to the panel. The proposal is supposed to be an
exercise in democratic accountability, but one of its main elements
mirrors the system that the Government are setting out to abolish,
which does not seem to make a great deal of sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In addition,
I am unclear about the roles of police and crime panels—perhaps
there will be further explanatory notes. I was struck by the memorandum
that the Committee received from Linda Belgrove of the Essex police
authority, who expressed her concern about the lead roles that are
currently played by people who serve on police authorities. She
mentioned, for example, lead roles in relation to young people and
children, and diversity and fairness. I am not sure that anyone on the
police and crime panels is charged with such responsibilities, which
are an element of existing police authority work that I should have
thought the Government would have
supported.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
took part in an Adjournment debate recently with the Minister on the
particular issues that affect young people in their dealings with the
police. It is important that any body that is responsible for
monitoring and scrutinising the behaviour and performance of the police
should include individuals who are delegated to focus on
specific—perhaps vulnerable—groups who may come into
contact with the police.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, I am
interested in the composition of the panels. The best example to
illustrate my concern was provided in evidence from Staffordshire
police authority. It pointed out that the provisions will mean that the
smaller an area is, the greater its influence will be over the
monitoring and scrutiny of the police. It states that the police and
crime panel<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000065">&#160;</a>

                        <p>which takes no account
of population. The consequence of such a system will be that the
smaller districts will have a “disproportionate
influence” on the panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000066">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I certainly think that the Government should
consider the difficulty that the measure poses. It seems ridiculous
that there is no account of population. The whole basis of the argument
is a belief in creating greater democratic accountability, but actually
a distortion is being created so that there is a greater say for a
smaller population than for a larger one.

and most diverse of the seven authorities covered by the West Midlands
force—will have less say than, say, Walsall, which, with all due
respect to Walsall, does not seem the best way to ensure democratic
fairness and accountability. Certainly, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Vale of Clwyd said, it is not consistent with the views that the
Government seek to impose on the country in other legislation that they
are trying to force through Parliament. That again suggests that the

about empowering the communities in question we need to give the
relevant knowledge to people, especially in the poorest communities,
which are the communities most adversely affected by crime. Functional
illiteracy levels across the country are something like 15% to 17%, but
in the poorer, most deprived communities, they can rise to 35% to
40%.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000072">&#160;</a>

neighbourhoods suffering high crime levels. The clause states that a
public meeting should be arranged for the annual report. To look at
that from the north Wales perspective, it is 120 miles from the tip of
the Llyn peninsula to Alyn 
<div class="columnNumber">

police HQ in Colwyn Bay and someone from Alyn and Deeside or from Nefyn
in the Llyn peninsula wants to go there, it is 60 miles there and
another 60 back. If it is held in Alyn and Deeside, someone from Nefyn
or the Llyn peninsula will have to travel 120 miles there, and another
120 back—240 miles. The matter has been raised by my hon. Friend
the Member for Gedling, but we need more than one annual meeting. The
meetings should be spread around, and they should be held particularly
in communities that are experiencing high levels of
crime.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000076">&#160;</a>

need for the chief constable and senior officers to attend those

be specified in the Bill. Without that, the Bill will be weakened and
watered down. We know what will happen. The public will be there, they
will be angry about crime levels, they will ask specific questions, and
the commissioner or the panel will say, “We’ll get back
to you later.” It needs to be fully addressed in public, and
that can only be done if those key officers are there. Those are some
of my concerns, and I hope the Minister will address
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000077">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Good morning, Mr Benton. We have had an
interesting debate about the principle of police and crime panels. The
Committee will not be surprised that I disagree strongly with the
premise articulated by the hon. Members for Gedling, and for
Birmingham, Selly Oak, that police and crime panels do not have a
proper role, or that the role has not been thought through. On
reflection, I am sure they will see that the right balance has been
achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000078">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is absolutely clear that police and crime commissioners will replace
police authorities. The PCCs will be directly elected, they will have a
mandate from the public, and they will have the executive power, which
enables them to set the plan, appoint the chief constable, set the
budget, raise the precept and hold the force to account. That much is
clear. The two questions are: what are the checks and balances on that
directly elected individual, and what is the role of local authorities
within the police force area? The PCPs are a good answer to those
questions. In a sedentary intervention, the hon. Member for Vale of

regard to those representations and respond to them. The panel will
make reports and recommendations about the annual plan produced by the

make some progress and deal with the second key role of police and
crime panels, which is to ensure that local authorities in the area
covered by a police force continue to have a stake in the overall
governance of policing. Establishing a police and crime panel can do
so. It is important that every council in the police authority area can
nominate an individual to serve on the panel. In the case of a city,
the city mayor will serve on the panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000101">&#160;</a>

that we are making an advance. For the first time, district councils
will be able to nominate one of their number to serve on a police and
crime panel. That is not the case at the moment. District councils are
shut out of the governance of policing. Given their roles in community
safety, it is important that they should be part of the new
arrangements. In many respects, it is a step forward—it
certainly is for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000102">&#160;</a>

every council will be represented. The Bill does not use the term
“unitary authorities” because that term is not used
anywhere in legislation. The Committee might enjoy this
explanation:<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000103">&#160;</a>

statutory terms, a unitary authority is simply a district council that
has no county council over it, or a county council that has no district
council under it. All unitary authorities are either county councils or
district councils, and the Bill covers both in clause

long and short of it is that unitary authorities are included. I hope
that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. We will come to some of the
details about police and crime panels in our consideration of later
amendments, but I conclude by flatly rejecting the idea either that
things have not been properly thought through or that we have not
achieved the right balance. There is always room for debate about the
detail. I welcome that, as I have done during the consultation. The
Government have taken notice of the views expressed on several matters

us to think again about the panel’s wider role. We cannot allow
it to become a police authority, as it would create confusion and
conflict, and result in unelected people being able to strike down the
decisions of an elected individual, which would not make sense. That is

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his reply and his
clarification regarding unitary authorities. I had thought that that
was the case, but it was helpful to be given that definition, which I
have never heard before.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s point about the inclusion of districts is a good one,
and it is an improvement. However, he has set himself against virtually
every police representative organisation and every police authority in
the country. The problem always comes down to the Minister not
accepting what the police authorities say to him, and they all say that
the checks and balances of the police and crime commissioner
vis-à-vis the police and crime panel is neither sufficient nor
clear. I am not satisfied with the points that he has made; there is a
point of disagreement between us.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At
the end of the day, within all the recommendations and reports alluded
to by the Minister, there are only two real powers that police and
crime panels have. The first, as the Minister said, is the veto on the
issuing of a precept, and the other is the veto on the appointment of
the chief constable. The police and crime commissioner, as the Minister
says, replaces the police authority, and we all understand that. The
police and crime panel has been set up to provide some sort of check
and balance to the police and crime commissioner. My contention is that
that seems to have been a bit of an afterthought, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak said, and we need to do something
about it. The panel does not have sufficient powers properly to hold
the commissioner to account. I repeat: it is a toothless watchdog. It
does not provide panel’s scrutiny and review function with
sufficient powers, notwithstanding the point that the Minister made
about the democratic mandate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I take it
that the Minister means that when we come back to the question of
composition, he will return to the issue of the other people who will
be on the panel with a direct democratic mandate, which he has not yet
addressed. However, there is a point of disagreement between us on
clause 28, and I would like to test the opinion of the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000109">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This group of amendments deals with the
membership of the police and crime panel. It would give effect, in
particular, to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the schedule and the appointment
of local authority members. Those provisions deal directly with making
the arrangements of the panel such that, as far as is reasonably
practicable, the local authority members of a police and crime panel
represent all parts geographically of the relevant police area and the
political make-up of the participating authority or authorities. Under
the Bill, there are several circumstances in which that could be
difficult to achieve and the amendments have been tabled to provoke
debate on what changes could be made to deal with such problems. I make
that point, because I have tried to keep the amendments as simple as
possible with the strict intention of debating what a police and crime
panel should look
like.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
general, a police and crime panel would currently have 10 members from
participating local authorities. As the number of authorities
increases, that number of members could increase to allow each local
authority to have an extra member. However, a problem would emerge when
we near the point at which there are 10 participating local
authorities or even more. In that position, we would reach the maximum
number and would have one member from each participating local
authority from that point onwards, with no scope to deal with
geographical equality and political party representation under
paragraphs 6 and 7 of the
schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would increase the number of members from local authorities
and introduce wriggle room—not a huge amount, but by a certain
number of members to equalise representation. Let us take the West
Midlands 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 389<a class="bkMark" name="Column389">&#160;</a>
                           </div>force area as an example. It is often used in this Committee. I did a
little research into the political make-up and population statistics of
the local authorities that would contribute a member to the police and
crime panel. Seven local authorities would have members. As it stands,
it is likely that the make-up of the panel would be a Conservative
representative from five local authority constituents and two Labour
members. That is based crudely on the likelihood that the ruling party
or the largest party in coalition in local government would be the most
likely representative to be sent to the police and crime
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the present arrangements, three members would be left to deal with
political and geographical make-up. That is not a lot of members to
deal with the issues of balance that would be left. As has already been
said, Birmingham is by far the largest authority area, with a
population of more than a million, whereas the smallest has only
200,000. There is a distinct need to deal with the geographical make-up
of that police and crime panel. There is also a need to deal with its
political make-up because the potential membership of five Conservative
and two Labour members does not necessarily meet the political make-up
of the voters within those seven local authority areas. There are
significant numbers of Liberal Democrat councillors, for example, in a
number of those. In fact, Liberal Democrat members make up a quarter of
Birmingham council. So there are distinct challenges in trying deal
with those two problems with only three
members.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
amendment would, therefore, increase that number to five members and
increase significantly the opportunity to gain political and
geographical balance. It would make it far easier to give extra
representation to Birmingham to ensure more effective geographical
representation on the police and crime panel. The most extreme example
would be the Thames Valley force area, where there are 18 local
authorities. I will not go through the list, but there is a large
variation in size between them. As it stands, the panel would consist
of 18 members, one from each authority. The amendments seek to ensure
that there is always a minimum of an extra two members. In the Thames
Valley example, the membership would be 18 under the Bill and there
would be no opportunity to address any of the issues that could flow
from that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not want
to create a huge, overburdened and unwieldy police and crime panel so I
do not propose having large numbers of extra members to try to achieve
direct proportionality. But adding an extra two gives some opportunity
to deal with some of the issues. There would always be a minimum of two
extra members to help to balance the panels better. Each panel would
have a minimum of 12 members. The purpose of the amendments is to raise
the issue rather than present a definitive solution. The aim is
clear—to come up with a system that is better able to ensure
that the criteria in paragraphs 6 and 7 of schedule 6 can be
met.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000176">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That was a helpful contribution. It is not that
they have not all been helpful, but I thought that one was especially
helpful. It was a genuinely probing amendment. All the amendments we
have tabled have been intended to provoke debate about whether the
number of members should go up or down or how 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 390<a class="bkMark" name="Column390">&#160;</a>
                           </div>many independents there should be. There is a genuine debate to be had
about that. The hon. Gentleman’s amendment was probing and no
doubt will be withdrawn. In a sense, he is asking the Minister to think
again about whether the balance is right. We suggested reducing the
number simply so that we can have a debate about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Edinburgh West is right. Is it right for an authority with
150,000 people and another with 30,000 to be covered by one person?
Should it depend on the population number? It is administratively easy
to say that it should be one for each district, county or unitary
authority, but does that achieve the Minister’s objectives? The
issue needs to be reflected
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
the number of independents is two. I understand, and agree with, the
Minister’s desire for the inclusion of independents, but I do
not know whether two is the right number. How was that figure arrived
at? I do not want to be pedantic—if the figure was three, I
could have asked how that was arrived at, too—but it would be
interesting to hear the Minister’s thoughts. Although in a later
amendment we will argue that independent members should not be allowed
to vote, they bring interesting perspectives, skills, experience and
qualities that may not otherwise be
included.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000179">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thought the Minister was a bit dismissive of
this point when I raised it in relation to clause 28. The danger with
this kind of representation is that it would be possible for the police
and crime commissioner to choose which representatives of the police
and crime panels he would try to appease. It might be for political
reasons, or simply for population reasons, because it is easier to
satisfy smaller groups than larger
ones.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000180">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is an important point, and the Minister needs
to address it. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Edinburgh
West raises the issue of political balance. Paragraphs (6) and (7) are
the relevant parts of the schedule. Paragraph (6)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

                        <p>Again,
without wanting to get into semantics, what is meant by “the

relevant police area, but this country’s geography means that
that will
vary.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000182">&#160;</a>

will that happen? I understand the Bill’s
aspirations—that is why the amendment that I have tabled is a
probing one—and the importance of this particular part. We do
not want political dominance, because that would result in
politicisation, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly
Oak says, how will that be brought about other than by wishing it to
happen? There are issues in relation to population, political
representation, geography and political
balance.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000184">&#160;</a>

base, such an individual would be a particularly important person to
appease, as opposed to somebody else with a perfectly legitimate

reflected in the various amendments, would impact on the schedule. I
will leave those matters there. However, it is important to achieve
that geographic and political balance in composition, and in the number
of members who are independent and represent an authority. Perhaps the
Minister could say something about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000189">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
504 deals with people under 18 being on the police and crime panel. I
might come back to the matter on Report, but it is an important aspect.
I do not expect the Minister simply to say, yes, he accepts that.
However, I am sure we agree that the involvement of young people in
police and crime panels is important. I do not know if it is necessary
to specify that two members of the police and crime panel should be
under 18. However, there ought to be a way to say that the involvement
of young people in police and crime panels is important.
Notwithstanding our disagreement about the legislation, such a
provision would help improve it, even if it were not specifically in
the Bill. Will the Minister say something about
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000190">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> First, to offer clarity, I will set out what the
Bill provides in relation to the make-up of panels. It provides for
each panel to have at least 10 members drawn from the local authorities
in the police area, with at least one member from each authority. Where
the number of local authorities in the police area is fewer than 10,
some or all of the authorities will have to appoint more than one of
their members to the panel to make up the total of 10 local authority
members. Where the number of local authorities in the police area is
10 or more—that is true of 10 of the police areas in
England—they will appoint just one member each to the panel. It
follows in that case that the number of local authority members of the
panel may exceed 10, and will be equal to the number of local
authorities involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In Wales,
there will be an additional member on each panel appointed by Welsh
Ministers. That additional member will have to be an elected
representative of a constituency in the police area. He or she could be
a Welsh Assembly Member, a councillor or an elected mayor. At present
there are no elected mayors in Wales,

			Column number: 392<a class="bkMark" name="Column392">&#160;</a>
                           </div>but the Bill provides for the possibility. The Bill provides for the
local authority members of the panel—and, in Wales, the Welsh
Assembly Member—to co-opt two further independent
members.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have been
at pains to respect the devolution arrangements in Wales. I have
discussed these matters with the Welsh Assembly Minister, Carl
Sargeant, and officials have also had extensive discussions on the
issues. A legislative consent motion is proposed in the Welsh Assembly
to give effect to them. We are standing by the principle that policing
is a reserved matter. We wish to introduce police and crime
commissioners in Wales, but recognise that community safety is a
devolved matter, so we wanted to make special arrangements for Wales.
It should be noted that that requires the legislative consent motion to
be passed for those to take
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000193">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
priority is to create a structure that is sufficiently flexible to meet
local structures. In cases where there are only two local authorities
in a force area, we wanted to ensure that there were at least 10
members, providing critical mass and a body representative of the force
area. It would clearly not have made sense to have a tiny police and
crime panel. In addition, one of our key aims was to ensure that a
member of every local authority in a force area sat on the PCP. That is
why the provisions are flexible enough to allow that to occur,
regardless of the size of the force area. The key principle is that
every local authority should be
represented.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh West has tabled an amendment that
proposes that 12 members from local authorities be appointed to the
panel to ensure what he describes as greater geographic and political
balance. The Committee needs to reflect on that. The right principle is
that every local authority should be represented. We have to take care
about creating arrangements that allow for additional local authority
members and, therefore, complexity and argument. The right principle is
that every local authority should be able to nominate the councillor of
their choice, to reflect the political balance in the authority. A
wider question arises as to whether it is right that the PCP should
reflect the political balance of the whole area, when it may cut across
the wish of each elected local authority to nominate someone according
to the balance in that local authority. This is not a straightforward
matter. I would like to reflect on my hon. Friend’s amendments
and the feasibility of achieving a wider political balance in the force
area as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000195">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is extremely helpful, because there is an
issue here, which is why I said that the amendment was helpful. This is
not easy. Given the model that is being set up, it is reasonable to say
that there will be one member from each authority, but that will not
necessarily achieve what the Minister wants in the Bill. There is a
real point of principle here, and we have not got it right. On the
other hand, I do not know what the answer
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000196">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the
nature of his intervention, because I agree that it is not
straightforward. We have to get this right. It would not be wise to
require a local authority to nominate a councillor of a different
political party from the one that it wishes to nominate. That would be
a recipe for real trouble. Equally, I took the force of the point that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 393<a class="bkMark" name="Column393">&#160;</a>
                           </div>overall political balance is desirable. It may be difficult to achieve,
which is what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but we will go away and
reflect on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
292 to 306, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Gedling, propose
that there should be eight local authority members and seven co-optees
or independents on the panel. I will not dwell on them, because that is
more in the realms of returning to the existing police authority model.
The hon. Gentleman tabled them as probing amendments. He asked me to
carefully consider amendment 504, which requires that two of the seven
co-optees to the panel be aged under 18. The existing proposal is to
just have two co-optees or independents on a panel. My immediate
reaction is that it would not be right to require one of those to be

                           </div>under 18. Nor would it be appropriate to specify that any member of the
panel should be under the age of 18. That is not the right way to
address his point that we must ensure that the panel and the PCC take
young people’s interests into account. He has tabled this
amendment in relation to the panel only, but it makes a broader point:
is the PCC attending to the views of young people, who are deeply
affected by crime? Do we have the right arrangements to ensure that? I
doubt that the right arrangement is one that requires a young person to
be appointed to the panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020327000198">&#160;</a>
