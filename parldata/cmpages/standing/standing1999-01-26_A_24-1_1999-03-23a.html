<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> What a pleasure it is to have you in our company for this afternoon's sitting, Mr O'Hara.
<P>
Just before we broke, I said to the hon. Members for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) and for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)--who, I regret, is not in his place--that what I had to say on amendment No. 1102 would make pleasant hearing for them. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to the necessity of having a flow chart with regard to directions and gaining assent to planning applications. We will be happy to include such a flow chart in our forthcoming guidance.
<P>
Amendment No. 1102 would require the mayor to have regard to the provisions of a borough's development plan and to the spatial development strategy when exercising any power that the Secretary of State may give him to direct refusal of a planning application.
<P>
I am certainly in accord with the thinking behind the amendment as it refers to the SDS. The main purpose of giving the mayor the ability to have an input into strategically important development control cases is precisely that he can defend the policies and objectives set out in the SDS and present the pan-London view. As a matter of general administrative law, however, the mayor must have regard to the mayoral strategy when exercising the powers that the Secretary of State confers on him. We shall make that clear in any guidance that is issued. It is, therefore, not strictly necessary to specify it in the Bill.
<P>
The same applies to the borough's development plan, which, as a matter of administrative law, is likely to be a material consideration for the mayor. Provided that a borough's UDP is up to date, it should reflect and be in conformity with the mayoral spatial development strategy. That said, the spirit of the amendment appears to be consistent with our intentions and with the operation of the plan-led system. The appropriate place to convey the points that I have mentioned may be in the secondary legislation that will define the mayor's powers, rather than in the Bill. I would, therefore, like to take the amendment away and consider it further. With that commitment, I trust that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will withdraw it.
<P>
I want now to deal with the points that the hon. Gentleman raised when he spoke to the other amendments that were tabled in his name. Amendments Nos. 1099 and 1110 would give sole responsibility for ensuring that the objectives of the SDS are achieved through individual development control decisions to the local planning authority. They would not, however, secure the right balance between strategic and local interests. Even with a plan-led system, the success or failure of strategic policies is often ultimately determined through individual development control decisions. For that reason, it will be important for the mayor to be consulted on the limited number of applications that raise issues of genuine strategic importance and, in extremis, to have the fallback power to direct refusal if important strategic concerns cannot be resolved. The second amendment, No. 1110, would eliminate the mayor's fall-back power to direct refusal and is, I regret to tell the hon. Member for Croydon, South, unacceptable.
The first amendment, No. 1099, is unnecessary. As a matter of administrative law, the SDS will be a material consideration in the determination of planning applications in Greater London. There is therefore no need for the Bill to make express reference to that. Section 70 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 requires the local planning authority to have regard to material considerations when determining applications. The Act does not specify what the material considerations are. There is obviously an enormous number of them, and to begin setting them out in the Act would lead us into a never-ending task. However, existing case law provides that policy statements made by the Secretary of State are a material consideration. There can be no doubt that the statutory SDS will also be a material consideration for the purposes of section 70.
<P>
Amendment No. 1101 is also unnecessary. The Government have stated repeatedly that the mayor will be involved only in applications of strategic importance. Simply stating that in the Bill, would surely create a fertile area for confusion and conflict. That is why we propose to set down clear and unambiguous criteria for such cases in secondary legislation. On 15 March, the Government's detailed conclusions on the types of applications that will be sent to the mayor were announced. Applications will be sent to the mayor for comment and as a last resort he may direct refusal. The Government's proposals for ensuring that the mayor sees only applications of genuine strategic importance are clear, so the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 1103 seems to be an attempt to create a mayoral exclusion zone in the heart of London. Currently, only one building in London, commonly known as the NatWest tower, is higher than the proposed 150m threshold. St. Paul's cathedral is a mere 111m high. I find it hard to accept the Opposition's suggestion that developments of a similar height to the Barbican towers, which are 123m high, or the stock exchange, which is 100m high, both of which are clearly visible from many parts of London, are not of strategic importance. We find unacceptable the Opposition's belief that no matter how large a proposed development, it and the attendant employment or transport implications should be ignored and will not be of wider significance unless the proposed height exceeds a specified maximum.
<P>
The Government's detailed proposals for defining applications of strategic importance are somewhat more carefully considered. It is important that the mayor has an opportunity to consider large-scale proposals throughout London, but in recognition of the greater scale of development and capacity for change, separate thresholds for triggering consultation with the mayor are proposed for the City of London, whose thresholds will be higher than those of surrounding areas.
<P>
The threshold for consultation on high buildings in the City is 75m, compared with 30m elsewhere in London, except for sites fronting the River Thames. Similarly, the threshold for consultation on large-scale buildings is higher in the City, where it is set at 30,000 sq m, than in the rest of central London, where it is set at 20,000 sq m, or elsewhere, where it falls to 15,000 sq m. We believe that our proposals strike a fair and sensible balance between allowing the mayor to have a say in key planning applications and recognising that the vast majority of applications are properly a matter solely for local planning authorities.
<P>
Amendment No. 1104 is another attempt to restrict the type of applications on which the mayor could direct refusal, in this case by preventing consultation of the mayor unless the proposal in question does not accord with the development plan. It would therefore limit consultation to so-called departure applications.
<P>
While we accept that proposals that do not accord with the plan may be of particular interest to the mayor, provided that they are of sufficient scale and importance we do not believe that the scope of the mayor's consideration of applications of strategic importance should be restricted only to such proposals, even under a plan-led system. Just because a proposal is in accord with the development plan, it does not automatically mean that it does not require detailed consideration either by the local planning authority or by other appropriate bodies. There will always be plans that are insufficiently up to date or which are simply silent on the types of development proposed.
<P>
As we make clear in our detailed proposals for defining applications of strategic importance, applications above a certain scale can potentially have an impact over a much wider area and should be considered by the mayor. Similarly, the mayor should have an opportunity to consider the strategic implications of proposals on defined key strategic sites or involving an important strategic policy. Amendments Nos. 1103 and 1104 would harm the mayor's effectiveness in achieving his or her strategic objectives.
<P>
On amendment No. 1229, it would not be appropriate to give a power to direct the granting of planning permission to the mayor. Such a draconian power would be inconsistent with the national planning system--not even the Secretary of State has such a power--and would create the potential for the mayor to ride roughshod over a local planning authority with no right of appeal against such a decision.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Croydon, South that the mayor will have much opportunity for positive action. In particular, the mayor's spatial development strategy is an excellent platform from which the mayor can encourage and channel London's strategic development. In addition, despite fears to the contrary, we expect that the mayor will want actively to support many of the applications of which he is notified by the boroughs, particularly where they will contribute to the future well-being and prosperity of London and Londoners. I would therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South) : May I just double check that the Minister has spoken to Government amendment No. 1181?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I did indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg her pardon.
<P>
First, it would be churlish not to welcome the Minister's response to amendment No. 1102.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I misled the hon. Gentleman. I have not spoken to the Government amendments yet; I spoke exclusively to the Opposition amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The most sensible way of proceeding is for me to sit down and let the Minister speak again. I shall respond after that.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The Government amendments to which I briefly referred when the hon. Member for Croydon, South allowed me to intervene--I trust that it will be in order if I speak to all the amendments, Mr. 0'Hara--are amendments Nos. 1181 to 1183 and 1185. Planning applications may sometimes have an effect that is of more than local or regional importance. In such cases, we believe it right that the Secretary of State should consider whether they should be called in for his decision. However, in taking a view on call-in, the Secretary of State should also be able to take account of the views of the mayor, particularly when developments are referred to him under the strategic criteria which I set out in answer to the parliamentary question on Monday.
<P>
Amendment No. 1181 a will allow the Secretary of State to prescribe a period during which a local planning authority shall not act on a direction of the mayor to refuse, while the Secretary of State decides whether to call in an application. That will enable the mayor to give a view, which the Secretary of State would consider when deciding on call-in. As we have made clear, the timetable during which the mayor can give views will be strictly limited to avoid delay--concern was expressed about that this morning.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1182 and 1183 are essentially tidying-up amendments. Amendment No. 1182 is a simple consequential drafting change which follows from amendment No. 1181. Amendment No. 1183 removes some words that we now consider to be unnecessary. The deleted words provide that the mayor can be given discretion in deciding whether to direct. On reflection, we considered that that was already implicit in a power of direction and therefore need not be so specified.
<P>
Amendment No. 1185 gives a flexibility in the instruments that the Secretary of State may use to elaborate the mayor's powers. It will also allow him to use orders and, where appropriate, directions made under any such orders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I shall start again, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
I welcome the Government's reaction to amendment No. 1102; we would certainly withdraw it if we were obliged to do so. When the Minister considers the principle, perhaps she would consider also the need for consistency, in particular between the boroughs and the Secretary of State, both of whom have to apply section 74(a) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which is the presumption in favour of the development plan, in determining planning applications. The mayor should take the same approach, as our amendment provides. I hope that the Government will bear that in mind when they review the matter.
<P>
On amendment No. 1099, I asked whether the Government were aware of the consequences of what they are doing. They obviously are. I am glad that the Minister is of the opinion that the SDS will be a material factor that must be taken into account. I am sure that those in the planning world who scour these matters will note her words.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We tabled the other amendments to try to simplify the procedure. There is no philosophical divide between us; it is a question of planning law. We will not seek to divide the Committee on the matter, but the procedure will be complex, result in delay and invite legal challenge, as public authorities overrule one another in sequence on high-value developments. We saw amendment No. 1100 as the way out of that. Nevertheless, the Government have chosen to take their own course on the matter. So be it. Under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 1181, in page 121, line 18, leave out "and" and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(aa) for prohibiting a local planning authority to which any such direction is given from implementing the direction in prescribed circumstances or during prescribed periods; and".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 1182, in page 121, line 24, leave out "(1B)(a)" and insert "(1B)".
<P>
No. 1185, in page 121, line 24, leave out from "means" to "a" in line 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"prescribed by, or directions made under,".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 1183, in page 121, line 25, leave out from "order" to end of line 27.--[Ms Glenda Jackson.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1105, in page 121, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(9A) In section 320 (local inquiries) after subsection (2) there shall be inserted--
<P>
'"(3) Where an inquiry is held by virtue of this section and the Mayor of London has directed the local planning authority to refuse an application for planning permission the subject of the inquiry, the Mayor shall be deemed to be a party for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) of section 250 of the Local Government Act 1972."'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State has power to amend provisions of the Act relating to appeals. The amendment applies the power to award costs for or against the party in a planning inquiry to the mayor, if he has caused an inquiry to take place by directing a refusal. You will be unaware, Mr. O'Hara, that this point was raised prematurely this morning by the Liberal Democrats. We seek by this probing amendment to ascertain the Government's reaction to the question of costs of a planning inquiry, which may be significant.
<P>
If the mayor takes part in an appeal, the cost jurisdiction applies anyway, but if he directs refusal and does not take part, costs cannot be ordered without an amendment to section 320 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The amendment removes that loophole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): We support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) must have taken to heart my remark that the best compliments are pithily delivered, as I presume that approval of an amendment could be regarded as a compliment. However, I must tell him and the hon. Member for Croydon, South that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
We clearly spelt out in the White Paper that the mayor could face an award of costs against him if it was found by either an inspector or the Secretary of State that the power of direction had been used inappropriately. Clause 23(9), at paragraph (1B) (b), provides the power to modify the necessary provisions of the relevant Act to ensure that that can be achieved.
<P>
If the mayor made a frivolous direction, costs could certainly be awarded against the mayor at appeal. In the light of that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It seems that to amend the Act by order rather than by primary legislation is nothing but lazy drafting. Nevertheless, the Minister is satisfied that she has covered the matter, and I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I wish to raise two matters. First, it appears from the debates on the amendments to this part of the Bill that the mayor has a considerable role and the assembly has a rather small role. It would helpful if the Ministers could explain the role that they see the assembly playing in the strategic planning matters that are covered by the clause. Secondly, Liberal Democrat Members feel that subsection (9) goes too far in giving the mayor power in comparison with local authorities.
<P>
Before I turn to those matters I should place on the record that I have, since this morning's sitting, received a most attractively-drawn diagram, which not only looks as if it is in the Minister for London and Construction's fair hand but is indeed, so I am told, in his fair hand. I am further reliably informed that it has been approved as accurate by those who advise him, which is another commendation without pareil. I am grateful for the diagram, which clarifies what the Minister told me during a conversation that we had earlier. I am sure that he will not mind me sharing the information with the Committee. He said that it is easier to look at the planning circuit--which is effectively what it is--by separating development plan preparation tasks and planning application processes. I accept that and I am grateful to him for his relatively straightforward diagram. if other members of the Committee would like to see it, I am sure that the Minister would he happy to make copies more widely available.
<P>
The diagram demonstrates what the debate on this clause has revealed about both the development plan preparation process and the planning application process in terms of the powers of the Secretary of State and the mayor to intervene. I believe that the Secretary of State's power to intervene has always been there. I have taken part in a number of public inquiries over the years, as other hon. Members will have done, and I have a hazy view of the laws involved. My understanding of the development plan preparation stage is that although the Secretary of State may currently have a power to direct, it is more usual for a negotiated settlement to be arrived at rather than for a power to be used by the Secretary of State. My recollection of the UDPs in which I have been involved is that, ultimately, they required the agreement of the local authority. Will the Ministers clarify whether the ultimate power at the development plan preparation stage resides with the Secretary of State or is left to the local authority?
<P>
At the planning application stage the system is clearly intended, as the Minister for Transport in London indicated earlier, to allow the mayor to direct the refusal of an application. The normal processes of appeal can then take place if the applicant wants to appeal, and a timetable for a call-in is allowable.
<P>
The only aspect of the circuit about which I am not clear concerns a situation in which the mayor directs a refusal, say to the London borough of Greenwich, and the Secretary of State thinks that the matter should be given his or her consideration. The case may concern, for example, listed buildings around the Maritime museum. Would the refusal then be put on hold while the Secretary of State made his or her deliberation? When the decision was made, if the Secretary of State decided not to call in, the direction to refuse would bite. To continue with the example, the refusal would automatically have to be given by the London borough of Greenwich, but the applicant would still have the right to appeal. The applicant would have the right to invoke a Secretary of State appeal, through his or her inspectorate, even though the Secretary of State may have intervened earlier on. I know that it sounds technical, but in reality these things happen.
<P>
I have been involved in processes in which there was a stay while the Secretary of State decided what to do. A decision was made not to proceed, it went back to the local authority and it was invited to say no. Now that the mayor has an additional power to intervene, will the rights of applicants still apply so that the loop back into an appeals system remains? These are technical but important matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South and my colleagues are nervous about the balance of power. We have expressed our unease in debates on amendments so I shall not elaborate. We believe that the balance is wrong and that the power of the mayor in subsection (9) is over-prescriptive, so we will vote against the clause--

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): All of you?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is an unusually good question: we are normally here in great numbers but are temporarily depleted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Quality not quantity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Of course; some of us can fill that breach, or try to.
<P>
We will vote against the clause and we hope that even if we do not succeed, which we just may not, the Government will reflect on these matters before Report. If local authorities are left feeling that their planning powers will be significantly reduced, it could seriously undermine the process of considering applications at local authority level. By and large, local authorities try to do that job thoroughly, and do it well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We share the hon. Gentleman's views. Our unease about the clause falls into two categories. The first is the issue of general conformity. The balance is not right and I sincerely hope that the Government will have another look at it as the Bill continues to make its way through this House and the other place.
<P>
Secondly, on the issue of direction, the picture remains confusing. Amendment No. 1181 was not in the Government office for London paper produced by the Minister last week. As we explained earlier, it looks like a power to override the mayor, which is the wrong way to go about it. A much simpler way was set out in our amendments. Under those circumstances, we will vote against the clause.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I shall deal briefly with the opening point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. He touched very briefly--for which we all give much thanks--on the recurring argument that has informed most of his contributions and those of his hon. Friends on the role of the assembly and the balance of power between the assembly and the mayor. We have consistently said, and I will say it again, that the balance of power is right. The assembly will be able to scrutinise the SDS and the mayor will have to consult. The assembly will also be able to scrutinise the mayor's development control activities.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was also much concerned about whether an applicant would still have the power to appeal to the Secretary of State. That is indeed the case. The Secretary of State can even call in a case after the mayor has directed refusal, as long as the borough has not issued a refusal notice. The hon. Gentleman's concerns are covered.
<P>
The powers that we are discussing are already available to the boroughs and the Secretary of State. We believe that it is right that the mayor should also have powers. We are talking about a strategic approach to development in London, which is clearly a vital function of the mayor.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the existing powers between the Secretary of State and the boroughs. I think, and I hope that I am not paraphrasing too much, he referred to cutting a deal between the Secretary of State and the boroughs. In essence the boroughs will amend their UDP and the plans in this way. If it is clear that no amendment will take place it is within the powers of the Secretary of State to order them so to do.
<P>
I should like to touch on the points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey a little earlier about the powers of appeal. I think that he was referring--
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I trust that any newspapers and journals being read in Committee are relevant and form preparation for contributions to debates.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I think that the hon Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, might have been considering the contribution made by his hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam, who built a somewhat fantastic scenario on his basic premise that because there is no requirement for the mayor's political advisers to detail all the advice that they give the mayor, he or she could--I am cutting this down considerably--have made some kind of frivolous decision about the application.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam was also concerned about the mayor's requirements in that instance, which, as I say, is a fantasy, to meet costs, and whether costs would be awarded should that decision be contested. Of course the mayor could be liable for costs in this interim instance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam was also concerned that there would be no rights of appeal. As I had occasion to say to him then, of course there would be the right of appeal to the Secretary of State. There is also the right of judicial review. The mayor is obliged to give reasons for any of the decisions that he or she makes in this area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam apologises for not being present to hear the Minister's response; he is in the Chamber. I am grateful to the Minister for her responses to the reassurances that I sought on the process. Will she deal with one last specific point? On that development plan process--the cutting of the deal--am I right in thinking that although there is an exchange of views the existing law gives the final say to the Secretary of State of the day should he or she want to use it and that that will remain the position in London after the Bill becomes law? Will she confirm that the Secretary of State will not have any greater powers than at present?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is quite right in his analysis. As I have had occasion to say in our earlier exchanges, the powers have been exercised very infrequently by the Secretary of State. Clearly the realisation that that power is there and could and would be exercised if amendments were not made occasions local authorities to amend such plans.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also raised concerns about subsection (9), where provision is made for the mayor's role in planning applications. The clause allows the Secretary of State, by development order, to empower the mayor to direct the borough to refuse planning permission for certain strategically important applications. The Secretary of State's existing order-making powers enable him to define the mayor as a statutory consultee and therefore to set deadlines for a response. Those powers ensure that the mayor has a real influence on strategic applications in London without undue interference in the role of the boroughs or delay to the process concerned. As Government and Opposition Members have made abundantly clear, neither sort of interference would be acceptable.

Given my response, I trust that clause 237 will stand part of the Bill.

Clause 237, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 238</center></H4>
<H4><center>Monitoring and data collection</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to amendment No. 111, in page 122, leave out lines 12 and 13.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: 
<P>
No. 1230, in page 122, line 15, leave out from "councils" to end of line 16.
<P>
No. 112, in page 122, line 15, leave out "with the approval of".
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> My hon. Friends and I tabled amendment No. 111 many weeks ago. Amendment No. 112 is equally long-standing. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) has tabled amendment No. 1230.
<P>
It gives me great joy to say that clause 238 is overly prescriptive. Occasionally, that argument is levelled at us.
<P>
Our amendments seek to reduce the most extreme examples of overprescriptiveness, which appear in subsections (6) and (7) on page 122 of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 238 (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It shall be the duty of the Mayor--
<P>
(a) to monitor the implementation of the spatial development strategy;
<P>
(b) to monitor the unitary development plan of each London borough council; and
<P>
(c) to monitor and collect information about matters relevant to the preparation, review alteration, replacement or implementation of the spatial development strategy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Taken out of context, that appears to be slightly overprescriptive. However, when we turn the page, we read in subsection (5) that monitoring schemes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may contain such supplementary provisions as the Mayor thinks necessary or expedient."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is in case the mayor does not think of doing that himself.
<P>
Monitoring schemes may therefore be dreamt up by the mayor sitting in the wonderful new building that will be built on the other side of the river, but they will not come into force until they are approved by the Secretary of State. Even the mayor's power to monitor is subject to the Secretary of State's control.
<P>
I thought that the Secretary of State would be busy testing the Archimedes principle in the Indian ocean or testing the resistance of coral reefs as he peered into them.
<P>
<B>Siobhain McDonagh </B>(Mitcham and Morden): The hon. Gentleman would not say that if my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State were here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Oh yes, I would.
<P>
I thought that the Secretary of State would be busy examining strategic development plans or dealing with global climate change. But no, I am wrong about that. The Secretary of State will be asked to examine the monitoring schemes devised by the mayor and to give them approval. That is nonsensical.
<P>
Subsection (7) states that the monitoring scheme may--wait for it--"be varied or"--how exciting--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"revoked by the Mayor after consultation with the London borough councils",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but only if the Secretary of State says so.
<P>
The Secretary of State is a lovely man, but not so lovely that he needs to be on the back of the mayor, whoever that may be, every moment of his or her life. In the name of the first and all future mayors, I say give them a bit of space and start by allowing them their own little monitoring scheme, to be varied or revoked without the Secretary of State's say so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I am not entirely ad idem with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but the telepathy that links me with various Greater London constituencies now also applies to his, as my amendment, to which he referred, is against the general tendency in the Bill for Henry VIII clauses which confer more power on the Secretary of State. I took the opportunity on the Floor of the House of likening the Deputy Prime Minister to Sancho Panza. I now can cast him in the role -- to which he is not ill-suited of Henry VIII. Having provided him with the opportunity of having been written about by Cervantes, it is a considerable pleasure to think of him painted by Holbein.
<P>
I think that I have vividly made the point that I share the views of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. We are trying to make progress this evening and my speech has been quite long enough to sustain the amendment that I tabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): This clause is, of course, quite ludicrous. It imposes on the mayor a duty to meddle and interfere, to seek details from borough councils and to do everything possible to prevent them from getting on with their normal business, as well as being a cost to the council tax payers of London. The only conceivably redeeming feature is that, perversely enough, the Secretary of State--particularly a Conservative Secretary of State--might not permit any such monitoring scheme to be published. He or she could veto the scheme and, God willing, any subsequent monitoring scheme, during the tenure of his or her office.
<P>
Such schemes are superfluous, costly, meddlesome, bureaucratic and pettifogging, and would duplicate functions that should be carried out by the boroughs. Therefore I am not hostile to the power of the Secretary of State to prevent a monitoring scheme from coming into being. However, there is an inherent contradiction in the clause between a requirement for the mayor to set up a monitoring scheme and require boroughs to pursue it, and, a requirement for the Secretary of State to act as the permissive authority for that function.
<P>
The clause is a dog's breakfast. It would be tidied up by the amendments, although there is a certain belt-and-braces element to subsection (5) that I am quite happy about--certainly in the case of a Conservative Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): I oppose the views expressed by Opposition Members. It is quite easy for them to make fun of the provision, but it is necessary. The structure involves the mayor developing the spatial development strategy to which the boroughs must conform. For the strategy to develop and be reviewed over the years to benefit London, it should be monitored. Therefore, there must be a structure or a clause that provides for information to go backwards and forwards. Clearly, if the mayor were too demanding in respect of the information that came from the boroughs, that could cause them difficulties; it could, however, work the other way. Therefore, the Secretary of State's role seems appropriate. The clause is workmanlike and should be in the Bill in principle. In that way, as the mayor develops the strategy over the years, the relevant information can be obtained from the boroughs.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Opposition Members will not be surprised to hear that I do not agree with the position that they have set out. They will, however, be surprised to hear that I do not agree with it because they have not gone far enough. The amendments make small, minor adjustments to matters that relate only to the Secretary of State's powers. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) said, matters are rather complex for a monitoring system that is designed to provide information to make it possible to see how the planning process operates.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) rightly stressed the importance of having a workable monitoring scheme in place to provide the necessary information. We agree with that. However, it is possible to simplify the procedures considerably. We intend to table amendments later radically to improve the clause.
<P>
The key to the arrangements that we intend to put into effect will be close co-operation between the mayor and the boroughs. Obviously, as the mayor has not yet been elected, we are having to discuss the framework with the boroughs. We are doing that now. I pay tribute to the co-operation of the Association of London Government, which has been extremely helpful and supportive to us as we have introduced our proposals--contrary to the view implied from time to time by Opposition Members. We are delighted at the association's positive approach. We are working with it to introduce arrangements that will meet the objectives that Liberal Democrat Members have expressed in their verbal contributions, but which their amendments would not achieve. I therefore urge them to withdraw their amendments.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) described my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister in florid terms. Any person who is worthy of being painted by Holbein and written about by Cervantes is clearly a person of great substance. I am delighted to learn that my right hon. Friend returned unscathed from his visit to India and the Maldives, unlike Cervantes, who was unfortunately injured defending western civilization at Lepanto. That takes us into an entirely different story, however, and I will not pursue it. I hope that hon. Members, having heard my comments, will agree to withdraw their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister has revealed that instead of over-prescriptive draftsmanship, we will have close encounters of a monitoring kind and a new form of political liaison. If councillors, Ministers and civil servants are getting together in a comfortable huddle and agreeing, who am I to stand in their way?
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster painted the picture of a Minister at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions taking on an Elizabethan role. As he did so, I reflected that the Minister for Transport in London might return in her once famous role as Elizabeth I and that the Secretary of State might appear as Henry VIII--anything is possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I am Falstaff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have to work hard to be Falstaff; but if Vinnie Jones could appear on the boards of the Globe last Saturday as Romeo, anything is possible. We look forward next Christmas not just to a singalong like the one that we had with the Leader of the House last Christmas but to a panto run by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. If we are invited, we will all take part--[Interruption.] I am being provoked by the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound), who does a comic turn. I did not realise that such a gentle probing would produce such a fulsome result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd (Lord Commissioner to the Treasury):</B> What have you had for lunch?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> South African wine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> All of it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is degenerating into farce.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Comedy, tragedy and tragedy, comedy--all are rolled into one, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
On the understanding that a replacement clause will be tabled at a later stage, I am delighted to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1106, in page 122, line 16, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(8) The Mayor shall defray any expenses reasonably incurred by each London borough council in compliance with its duties under this section.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 The amendment simply provides that the monitoring scheme should be paid for by the mayor. The mayor is demanding information from the boroughs, so in our view he should pay the boroughs' costs in carrying out his monitoring scheme. A few moments ago, the Minister prayed in aid the Association of London Government. He will know that the ALG also supports this amendment. I am therefore hoping for a good response from the Minister, if not quite so fulsome as the last one.
<P>
5.21 pm
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
5.36 pm
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My remarks will be extremely brief. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South rapped the Liberal Democrats' knuckles earlier this afternoon by saying that they had asked questions about costs prematurely. Very graciously, he did not rap my knuckles for having asked about costs. In their turn, the Ministers were gracious enough to say that the Government would return to the matter when the Committee debates clause 238. I join my hon. Friend in looking forward to hearing their answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendment deals specifically with costs incurred in the preparation of the monitoring arrangements, which we discussed during the debate on the previous clause. As right hon. and hon. Members will know from what I said in that debate, it is the Government's objective to simplify the procedures, to minimise their cost implications and to produce arrangements that will ensure the availability of information that is of benefit both to the boroughs and to London as a whole and which can be produced at minimal cost. That is our objective, rather than setting in place an unduly prescriptive arrangement for reimbursing costs, which could remove from the procedures and systems under discussion the incentive to be cost-effective.
<P>
The Government are engaged in discussions with London boroughs about the arrangements, and we will continue those discussions. Our objective is to produce a simple procedure that will give information that is in everyone's interests in the most cost-effective way. I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will agree that he should ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's constructive response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Clause 238 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clause 239 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 240</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abolition of joint planning committee for Greater London</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> It again falls on me to offer a eulogy.
<P>
<B> Mr. Raynsford:</B> A brief one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> A very brief one.
<P>
The clause has the title "Abolition of joint planning committee for Greater London". As we have gone through the Bill, we have noted bodies that we are killing off in the process of setting up the Greater London authority. This is one of those bodies.
<P>
It was created when the Greater London Council was abolished to ensure that there was still some common planning view in London. It brought together representatives of each of the 33 local authorities. It was therefore a democratic substitute for Londonwide government during the interim phase when we did not have one. If I may say so, it did an extremely good and competent job in that role. Since LPAC was created, all of its officers and members--without distinction between which party was in the chair, because members of different parties have chaired LPAC over the years--have been assiduous in ensuring that they do highly competent work. They have always been available to those in local government and in Parliament, to be consulted and to give advice. On occasion, they have definitely influenced Government policy and big strategic planning decisions in London for the better, while we have had no strategic government for London. They have been helpful in forming unitary development plans and the like.
<P>
The current chair is an eminent successor to those who have gone before her. Among those who have been in the chair is my noble Friend Baroness Hamwee, who I believe was chair for two periods of four years. I pay tribute to her work as well as that of others, all of whom did assiduous work.
<P>
Finally, the chief officer and his team have throughout ensured that the best strategic planning, correct analysis of data, clear presentation and persuasive argument have been deployed for the all-too-long period during which London has been without strategic government. We thank them for what they have done; we look forward to working with them for their remaining months. They will hand on a secure legacy of work, but it would be wrong just to write them out of the script without saying how much many of us value their extremely hard work over more than a decade.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): Following the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, I say--extremely briefly--thank you. I was on the committee for four years and thoroughly enjoyed it. A stage was reached at which the partisan was reduced to the secondary, and members of all parties--Conservatives included--worked in the interests of the strategic concerns of London.
<P>
The committee got it wrong only once, when I was in the unusual position--although others may think otherwise--of being a lone voice. A vote on LPAC went 34 to 1, I think it was. That was a couple of years ago, when we discussed the millennium Ferris wheel, which I voted against. I am proud to have voted against it, and hope that it never sees the light of day. [Interruption.] The dome is wonderful, but I am totally against the Ferris wheel.
<P>
Seriously, we should mark LPAC's passing with those constructive and unusually brief words from the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, with which I am sure that all members of the Committee--especially me, as an ex-member--would associate themselves.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am sure that all members of the Committee welcome the opportunity afforded them by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) personally to express our thanks to him, a living, breathing representative of LPAC. Obviously, all members of the Committee would want to associate themselves with the warm tribute that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey paid to members of LPAC, both present and past--praise that is entirely justified, for the reasons that he gave.
<P>
However, his eulogy may be a little premature, because in truth the staff and resources are to be absorbed into the mayor's office, where they will continue to provide advice on strategic planning policy. So it is less of an interment and more of a translation--whether to a higher place, we must wait to see.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The clause provides for the committee, established under the previous pieces of legislation, to be abolished. As I said, the staff and resources will be absorbed into the mayoral office, but there will no longer be the need for the provision of a statutory joint committee of the boroughs to provide strategic planning advice. The mayor will of course continue to be required to consult the boroughs in preparing the mayoral strategy, and will work in partnership with them. I repeat the thanks to LPAC on behalf of all members of the Committee, and move that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is a good idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> That is the best speech that the hon. Gentleman has ever made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I hope to carry the hon. Gentleman with me.
<P>
As we have just heard, the Bill abolishes the joint planning Committee for London and gives the strategic planning role exclusively to the mayor. The new clause would give the boroughs a voice in these new circumstances. It would set up an assembly-borough Committee to take over LPAC's advisory role and approve the SDS. The Bill puts strategic planning for London entirely in the hands of the mayor and the Secretary of State--the assembly and the London boroughs have no rights other than to be consulted. The joint Committee for London is to be abolished, risking a split between the concerns and experiences of London boroughs and the mayor's office. That is a theme to which we have alluded on several occasions.
<P>
The London planning committee that we propose would be composed of assembly members and borough representatives. It would take over LPAC's advisory role and representation on the south-east regional planning conference. The mayor would have to obtain the Committee's authority for his spatial development strategy. That would create a democratic and locally related check on the mayor's planning policy. You may be interested to know, Mr. O'Hara, that the Nolan Committee received more letters from the public about planning during its work on local government than about any other subject, which illustrates the depth of feeling that can be aroused. As planning is such a controversial matter, the SDS should reflect more than one person's opinion. The London boroughs would still carry out most of the planning in London and should have a proper say about the SDS. These plans are clearly set out in new clause 86 and new schedule 10, and I am optimistic that the Minister will find good cause to support the proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We support the proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The eulogy that we gave to LPAC a moment ago would be rather premature if we were to accept the new clause, as its purpose is simply to replicate a body that would in many respects be similar to LPAC. That would be entirely inappropriate, despite the crocodile tears of the official Opposition. The creation of LPAC stemmed from the outrageous abolition of the strategic planning authority for London by the previous Conservative Government. In the absence of a proper strategic planning authority, it was necessary to create LPAC to keep the flag flying for strategic planning in London. that has done a very good job. I pay tribute to the work of the many members and officers who have served on LPAC and I in particular, to Martin Simmons, the chief planner, who has earned enormous respect throughout London for the work that LPAC has done over the years. But it was work that would not have been necessary had there not been that cavalier abolition of the proper, democratically elected strategic authority.
<P>
We are restoring a democratic strategic authority. The mayor will perform that function--he will ensure that Londonwide strategic interests are considered. The boroughs will continue rightly and properly to have a significant role. Against that background, it would be utterly wrong to accept the new clause. It would dilute the mayor' s powers and create a confused structure in which there was no clarity of responsibilty between the strategic and the local; it would also create another tier of bureaucracy. That is the last thing that London needs and I sincerely hope that if the hon. Member for Croydon, South does not withdraw the new clause, my hon. Friends will vote it down decisively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That was a disappointing reply. The Minister can on occasion be generous and magnanimous. As I said, Liberal Democrats are merely playing a supportive role in this instance.
<P>
The proposal is for representatives from each of the local authorities to have an opportunity which is recognised to come together and give collective opinions. There will be no other structure. Of course there is a strategic role for the mayor and the assembly, but it seems entirely proper to provide for another place where a collective local government view can he expressed.
<P>
To take one slightly controversial example, a recent planning proposal in favour of the development of Crystal Palace was led by the London borough of Bromley and supported by the London boroughs of Southwark, Bexley, Croydon and Lewisham. It has been controversial because it was alleged that it would have environmental disadvantages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Livingstone </B>(Brent, East): Alleged? It is guilty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am not expressing a view. My colleagues in Bromley, where it is an all-party matter, have been persuaded that the proposal should be supported. That is exactly the sort of issue on which, if we remove the structure that LPAC has provided without replacing it, there is no opportunity for local government--which is the development control authority--to come together and form a common view. That is why the forum is proposed. It is not bureaucratic, labyrinthine or complex; it would provide a partnership model through which local authorities would have a planning role, which would be extremely welcome. I am surprised that the Minister did not see its benefit, but he may well come to see it very soon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I accept that these are not the hon. Gentleman's proposals, but that they have been tabled by the Conservative Opposition. However, if the hon. Gentleman seriously believes that the suggested body is not labyrinthine or bureaucratic and that it will not be a talking shop, I invite him to read the new clause and schedule. He will realise exactly how labyrinthine and bureaucratic it will be. If he reads subsection (3) of new clause 86 carefully, he will see the crucial element--I am not surprised that Liberal Democrat Members support it. It states clearly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Mayor may not publish the Spatial Development Strategy until it has been approved by the London Planning Committee."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would neuter the mayor, making it impossible for him to act decisively and rendering him beholden to this complex body with its large number of representatives. It is the kind of format that would delight a Liberal Democrat debating society, but it is not appropriate for efficient government in London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Member for Croydon, South is pleased to have it suggested that the proposal is a Liberal Democrat amendment when it actually comes from core of the residue of London Toryism.
<P>
The subsection to which the Minister alluded would require a simple majority; if 17 out of 32 local authorities were in favour, that would give approval to the spatial development strategy; it need not necessarily be complicated. There will be a need for partnership between the new authority and local government. I am not defending every jot, tittle and full stop, but the concept of local government having a place to which one person from each of the 33 local councils could be sent so that it might take part in the process of looking at London's strategic development. I have a sneaking suspicion that the Association of London Government, with which the Minister said earlier he had a close and comfortable relationship, might favour a measure that gave it an opportunity to participate in that process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It takes the biscuit for the Minister to criticise our well--drafted proposals for being bureaucratic when I can flick through more than 100 pages of schedules to the Bill. If we had made our new schedule any briefer, the hon. Gentleman would have said, "It's not workable. It is badly structured." We set out a decent structure, and he has the nerve to say that it is bureaucratic. As I wade through the lists of Committees that are set out in the schedules, I think that the Minister has had a nice try but has not persuaded anyone.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Oh yes he has.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister is easily persuaded.
<P>
The Minister spoke about the establishment of the London planning committee--LPAC--as being a riposte to the abolition of the old Greater London council. I want him to know that we make no apologies for scrapping the GLC. If ever there was a feature of the GLC that discredited it, it was the delays, the cost and the bureaucracy of its planning department. For him almost to imply that he wanted to return to that and that the establishment of LPAC was a matter of regret, was a more bizarre position to adopt than the one that he took on the wording of our new schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I thought that that might finally provoke the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone).
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Amid all the passion, does the hon. Gentleman not recall that a Conservative Government created the mishmash of planning functions? In 1981, the GLC wanted to devolve all minor planning functions to the boroughs, but the Government of the day were not prepared to co-operate and to introduce legislation quickly. In creating a structure by which the mayor will deal with only the major planning applications, the Government have got it right. The legacy of the Government of Harold Macmillan was to leave us with the mess of Labour boroughs having to argue over piddling little things with the GLC.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the Government's proposals are right, I am even more worried.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I am looking forward to running it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Exactly--that is what concerns me most.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): That is what concerns the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My hon. Friend is right, and I think that the Minister will take note of those words. Through the new clause and new schedule, we have endeavoured to give the boroughs a voice. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was absolutely right when he said that the Association of London Government will probably support the proposal to establish a Committee, and that it will probably carry it through in any event. We seek to give the proposal statutory effect, and so wish to press the new clause to a division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1137, in page 123, line 4, after "a", insert "biennial".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 422 in page 123, line 10, leave out "three years" and insert "one year".
<P>
No. 1138, in page 123, line 10, leave out "three" and insert "two".
<P>
No. 423, in page 123, line 13, leave out "four" and insert "two".
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Amendment No. 1137 was tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friends. I shall speak also to the other amendments tabled in our names and to amendment No. 422, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood.
<P>
We are moving on. This is the first debate on part IX of the Bill, which deals with environmental functions. It will encourage the Committee to be reminded that there are only 12 parts to the Bill. We are certainly on the downhill slope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> That is a bit like the Liberals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is not like the Liberals at all. The Labour party can only go down whereas some of us may find going up much easier.
<P>
The amendments are linked and deal with the mayor's environmental report, which we welcome as a concept. We welcomed the national state of the environment report and have supported it. In fact, I argued for such a report when I was environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats and spoke to Conservatives Ministers about it. The concept was accepted by the previous Conservative Administration and has been continued by the current Labour one.
<P>
If we have an environmental report for the United Kingdom and have increasingly good global environmental reports produced by the United Nations environment programme, it is essential and sensible that we should have an environmental report for London. The creation of citywide government for London means that it is right that we should do that.
<P>
The timetable in the clause sets out that the first report must be produced before the end of three years from the election of the GLA, which means by 2003. Subsequent reports will be produced at four-yearly intervals. There is no theology in our argument, but Liberal Democrats believe that we should have two-yearly reports. That would enable us to assess how London is doing in meeting its share of national targets such as those that relate to the reduction of pollution, to effects on the climate and to international agreements into which this country has entered. Biennial, rather than four-yearly reports, would mean that the first report would be produced within two years of the election of the GLA.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood proposes that we should amend line 10 of page 123, so that the first report is produced after one year. His proposal for the first report is more demanding than that of the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
The matter does not need to be greatly elaborated. Even if the Minister starts from the point of defending the Bill's drafting, I hope that he will at least say that he is prepared to talk about what might be the right structure.
<P>
My final point raises issues similar to those we have heard in previous debates. How much should the Bill be able to determine what the mayor and the assembly do? It is entitled to refer to the frequency with which reports are produced because the Government already undertake a cycle of reporting. They have undertaken to produce not only a governmental annual report--they produced the first one last year--but an annual environmental report. The previous Conservative Government made that commitment and I understand that it has not been changed by this Labour Administration. If that is the case, it is arguable whether there should be an annual London report, though there will be an annual London debate. There could be a compromise in favour of a report every two years.
<P>
We must see how far we are progressing towards meeting the targets. We in London have some of the most polluted streets in the country, and I will deal with our strategy later. However, a table this week showed that Pall Mall was the most polluted street in the country. Several other London streets were also in the top 10 of the league table. That demonstrates the importance of the issues with which we are dealing. We proposed our amendments in order to see where we are going. We hope that they find favour, however gradually, with Ministers and the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood has had to leave the Committee briefly, but I know that he would support the amendments. The time scale for reporting is too long, given the importance of the issues. The range of environmental indicators was, according to the White Paper, to be set by the mayor. In fact, they are set out in the clause. If that has changed, perhaps the time scale can be reviewed.
<P>
The Labour party manifesto said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We will put concern for the environment at the heart of policy-making",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 but putting it at the heart of policy making once every three years is not quite the heartbeat that we expect. I hope that the Minister will reflect carefully before rejecting the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is Perhaps ironic that in the course of this afternoon's debate there was an emerging consensus that we should not be too prescriptive. When I responded to amendments moved by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and said that we would seek to amend the Bill to be less prescriptive, he described that as generous, which was welcome. However, he is now falling into the trap with this amendment of being unduly prescriptive.
<P>
Our framework is entirely consistent with the White Paper. If the Government set certain objectives in a White Paper, they should normally seek to give effect to them, unless there is a good reason for not doing so. I remind the hon. Gentleman that paragraph 5.116 of the White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The first report will have to be produced within three years of the first mayor taking office and be updated every four years after that."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what we said, and that is what the Bill will achieve.
<P>
There must be a report during the first term of the first mayor--three years--before either the first mayor comes up for re-election or there is an election for a new mayor if the first does not seek re-election. Thereafter, on a four-yearly cycle, there must be an updating of the environment report. That is the minimum requirement. It will be open to the mayor to report more frequently, but to impose a more frequent obligation would be over-prescriptive and inconsistent with the White Paper. therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The last sentence or two gave me encouragement. I understand the Minister's argument about the cycle, but I would like some clarification because the wording of clause 242 (2) is not clear. It requires the mayor to produce a report, under subsection (2)(b),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in the case of each state of the environment report subsequent to the first, before the end of the period of four years beginning with the day on which the previous state of the environment report was published."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that means, which it certainly could in one interpretation, that it could be done, if the mayor chose to do that, yearly or biannually, I am comfortable with that. We were not trying to be prescriptive. We were trying to make sure that the pressure to comply with various targets, which will be felt increasingly in London, will not have to wait for a four-year report-back. If the Minister says that the Government are setting the minimum requirement but that they can go below that we are happy with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks; it is only fair to him. His interpretation of clause 242(2)(b) is absolutely correct. It is a minimum requirement that there must be one report at least every four years to fit in with the cycle, but that does not preclude the mayor producing a report on a more frequent basis if he or she chooses to do so. I hope on that basis that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 960, in page 123, line 24, leave out "warming" and insert "climate change".<P>

<P>
I hope that this will be an interesting debate and that I can persuade the Government to think again about the proposal that we are putting to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If he does it briefly the hon. Gentleman might succeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I sensed that we might succeed as I have a bit of hidden ammunition here. The amendment is simple. At present subsection (3) lists the things that should be set out in the state of the environment report. The fifth item is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"energy consumption and the emission of substances which contribute to global warming".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We simply seek to change the description of that last condition from "global warming" to "climate change". We do that because we believe that climate change is now the more commonly accepted state-of-the-art definition. It is commonly accepted not just outside this country but by us and the Government.
<P>
I should like briefly to give four examples. The 1992 earth summit in Rio established the framework convention on climate change to which we are signatories. The 1997 Kyoto conference attended by our star of the afternoon, the Secretary of State, established the climate change protocol, again using that same description. The Minister's own Department produced a consultation paper headed "The UK Climate Change Programme". It was produced last October, and in his foreward the Deputy Prime Minister says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The world's scientists tell us that man-made climate change is one of the greatest environmental threats that we face today."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase "global warming" is used.
<P>
Self-evidently, tying all those things together is the argument that what we do affects the climate, not just by warming it but by lowering temperatures. Therefore we need a title that allows us to talk about the climatic consequences of our activity, not just those which warm it. A bit like the hon. Member for Croydon South, I hope that by adopting the phraseology that appears to be already adopted elsewhere by the Government, we can correct the Bill and make it consistent with what is described elsewhere.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I put a question mark over the premise on which the clause is based. It says that the environmental report shall contain information about a number of matters including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"energy consumption and the emission of substances which contribute to global warming".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark. North and Bermondsey wants to change "global warming" to "global change". As a subscriber to National Geographic I was struck by an article a few years ago which reported on the activities of the Russians in drilling into the ice cap. They are now taking samples from the ice cap that was formed 250,000 years ago. By using technology on those samples, they can demonstrate that global warming occurred many hundreds of thousands of years ago.
<P>
From that, it is probably safe to say that global warming or climate change is not necessarily caused by mankind, although we may add to it or have some incremental impact on it. Clause 242 assumes that the emission of substances and energy consumption cause global warming. I question that premise.
<P>
I am now going to sit down, but my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) is welcome to make a speech, should he wish to do so.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I have been left exposed to make my own contribution, instead of parasitically riding on the back of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. However, I support my hon. Friend--who is rightly sceptical--by saying that the efforts of man have limited effects. Even at their most extreme and exuberant, such efforts are as nothing compared with the effect of volcanoes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I presumed that we were going to have an interesting and focused debate on terminology and the merits of the phrases "global warming" and "climate change". Instead, the hon. Member for Croydon, South has taken us into a far wider arena in which interesting theories about what might contribute to global warming and the factors influencing it are up for discussion. I fear that following that course of action will soon get me into your bad books, Mr. O'Hara, for going far wider than the amendment would allow. I shall therefore resist the temptation to explore the interesting theories normally associated with the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) and other members of the flat earth society. Their views on global warming have been widely circulated.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made a pleasingly good case for the use of "climate change" in preference to "global warming". He has done his research, and made his case persuasive by making it succinct.
<P>
In the spirit of good will which, I hope, characterises most of the Committee's proceedings, I am inclined to agree with the hon. Gentleman's proposition. We will take further advice before agreeing to a change. If the hon. Gentleman withdraws his amendment, I am happy to take further advice. I am happy to introduce an amendment at a later stage to give effect to his intention, assuming that we are satisfied that the phraseology achieves the purpose that he desires.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is a rare day when unconditional acceptance of an Opposition proposition is the Government line. I hoped that we had achieved that end, and sensed that we might have done so. However, we were told that the modest change that we proposed--replacing two words in the Bill with another two--would require great deliberation. The Minister could have fooled us if thinks that a lot of technical redrafting is required.
<P>
Liberal Democrats are, by definition, patient people. We are growing more impatient, but we are still relatively patient. Given that the Minister warmed us with his response, and given the undertaking that a beautifully drafted substitute amendment will be tabled, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, which is itself pretty well formed.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg leave to move amendment No. 1139, in page 123, line 26, after "production", insert "minimisation".

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I move amendment No. 1159, and I shall speak to the 15 other amendments that have been grouped with it.
<P>
When colleagues see 15 amendments together tabled in our names, they may worry that we may detain the Committee for a long time, but they should be reassured because the amendments effectively make the same point. We suggest that in a later item in the same list as that to which I referred in the previous debate--the list of information that is to be contained in the state of the environment report--which is waste matters, we should add to the production, recycling and disposal of waste another important element to tell us how well we are doing in minimising waste.
<P>
The lead amendment would insert the noun "minimisation" in line 26, and make similar amendments elsewhere. Amendment No. 147 would, to be logical, change the name of the waste strategy from "waste management strategy" to "waste minimisation and management strategy". Amendments Nos. 1149, 1150, 1151, 1152, 1156, 1157, 1158, 1159, 1160, 1161 and 1162, which are all amendments to later clauses, would make the same change to those clauses as amendment No. 1147 makes to clause 244.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1131 and 1155, which are both amendments to clause 244, but which are grouped here, would ensure that the waste strategy included proposals and policies for the minimisation of waste, and that the mayor consulted bodies concerned with waste minimisation when preparing or revising the waste strategy.
<P>
The point is encapsulated in this simple proposition. As a society, we create a lot of rubbish. One environmental challenge is to produce less waste. The obvious example is packaging; we all struggle with and suffer from having far too many overpackaged products for sale. It is important to measure how we are doing in terms of reducing the amount of waste, not just producing, recycling and disposing of it. I hope that the Minister will respond to that appealing proposition as positively as he did to the last one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey had a hit in his previous amendment, and I stressed that I was attracted not just by its wording but by the economical and succinct way in which he moved it. He is now having another go. He almost spoilt the effect by associating with his amendment 15 others. I hope that he will not be disappointed when I say that I am attracted by the first, but not the others. Let me explain why.
<P>
We stated in our consultation paper on the new national waste strategy, "Less Waste, More Value", that the best way to reduce the impact of waste can be simply to avoid producing it. That is of particular importance in the industrial and commercial sectors, in which businesses must face the full cost implications of the waste that they produce, in order to encourage them to cut down.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that there may well be merit in specifically highlighting waste minimisation in the state of the environment report, because that would reflect the importance of minimising the production of waste. We would therefore be happy further to consider the lead amendment and, in due course--assuming that there are no difficulties; I do not expect there to be--incorporating the provision in an amendment at a later stage.
<P>
However, the other amendments would add waste minimisation to the list of core operations that must be covered by the mayor's municipal waste management strategy. Any municipal waste strategy that does not involve coherent plans for promoting waste minimisation will not be worth the paper that it is written on. Clearly, waste minimisation will be an integral part of any sensible waste management strategy. It would be dangerous, however, for the Bill to refer to the two phrases separately, which would imply that minimisation is not the same as effective waste management. We will resist the other amendments because they would undermine the concept that integration should be an integral part of a waste management strategy.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will accept the logic of my remarks. With the offer to consider his first amendment because its proposed wording should be specified as one of the objectives, I hope that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It will please the Minister to know that I think that he has a good point about the remaining amendments, bar the last one in the group, about which I should like to make a serious point. I am grateful for his remarks on the lead amendment and I accept his point in respect of the other 14. He should, however, consider amendment No. 1155, which seeks to add to the consultation part of clause 244. Clause 244(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In preparing or revising the municipal waste management strategy the Mayor shall consult".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A list of consultees follows, the last of which is specified in paragraph (e), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any other body which is concerned with the recovery, treatment or disposal of waste".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To use an apposite phrase, that paragraph breaks down waste management into its component parts. I hope that the Minister will accept that amendment No. 1155 is also worth considerating in the same way as the lead amendment. It is the other amendment in the group that relates to a breakdown of the component processes in the waste strategy as a whole.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I said that I was not enamoured with the 15 amendments grouped under amendment No. 1139, but he is reducing the number to 14. I accept the validity of this second amendment, No. 1155, which has a similar objective to that of the first amendment, towards which I indicated our sympathy. We will think about this amendment and give him a considered view at a later stage. We do not accept that the other amendments are appropriate. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Deal accepted; double whammy. Having been given that undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 968, in page 123, line 28, leave out "and".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 1049, in page 123, line 29, at end insert "and (1) biodiversity.".

<P>
I remind the Committee that we are working to a revised selection list, and that amendment No. 1056 was not on the original list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am slightly thrown by the point about amendment No. 1056, so I shall ask a colleague to pass me another list.
<P>
Such is the mystique of amending legislation that although Amendment No. 968 is the lead amendment there is almost nothing to commend it to the Committee because it is consequential on the other amendments. It proposes merely the removal of the word "and" which is hardly an earth-shattering proposal.
<P>
We tabled the amendment because we wish to raise the other issues with which the group deals. The amendments seek to add to the environmental report. I shall deal with them briefly and in turn.
<P>
Amendment No. 1049 seeks to ensure that the state of the environment report contains information about biodiversity. The point is also of interest to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington--I apologise, I mean the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall), who will no doubt say a word about it in a moment.
<P>
I appreciate that we are coming to the biodiversity action plan in clause 243 and beyond. That should not preclude the inclusion of biodiversity matters in the report. Clearly, if we are talking about the state of the London environment, the list should include, for example, details of how many sites of special scientific interest remain, what species there are under an administration as compared with the previous one, how many types of tree there are in London, and how much green space there is.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second item in the list--I remember that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster issued a rebuke earlier--is not of our making. Amendment No. 969 comes to us from constituents of mine, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, which is an extremely eminent organisation and which I am proud to have in my constituency. It suggested the content of the amendment, which would require the environment report to contain information about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"housing conditions ... communicable diseases ... occupational health and safety ... food safety, and ... the effects of the environment on human health."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Colleagues may think that that goes wide. I understand that there may be an overlap or a coincidence of interest between the public health debates that we had earlier and the environment debates that we are having now. All that I can say is that it is now generally received wisdom that if we are talking about the environment, we mean the physical environment in which people live as well as the outdoors environment, where they seek their recreation and move around.
<P>
Public health issues are important indicators of the state of our environment. In the olden days, in the early part of this century, TB was rife in London. That was an indicator of the lack of clean air, clean water and the easy transmission of communicable diseases. Public health is still as much of a relevant environmental factor now.
<P>
The occupational health and safety issue is about people's workplace environment, which is an important test and criterion. Food safety is--self-evidently in this day and age--a matter of increasing importance. It, too, has an impact on people's environmental well-being and on health indicators. To take a self-evident example, the effects of smoking on people who do not smoke--passive smoking--has increasing relevance.
<P>
I have described where the list comes from; it is not our list. Clearly, work may need to be done. I hope, however, that the general proposition is accepted.
<P>
I am wary of prioritising, but amendment No. 1140 is probably the most important in terms of the new issue that it would introduce. We want to argue strongly that however frequently the environment report is produced--the Minister conceded that it will be at least every four years--it should contain information about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the percentage of new developments built on greenfield and brownfield sites".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I read only this morning in a paper somewhere about how important it is that we concentrate on building on brown-field sites. The regeneration of our cities will work well only if we make the best use of our already spoilt sites. Until today, I did not know that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who is not here because he was excused by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, was the president of the London Green Belt Council. That relates to exactly the issues about which I am talking. We need to monitor whether we are losing green belt and how much new build goes on greenfield sites.
<P>
There was a controversial debate a few years ago. The local authority in Southwark sought to reclaim some of Burgess park for development. My local councillor colleagues and the people who lived around the park in Walworth, Camberwell and Peckham strongly opposed the proposal, and rightly so. When the park was created in the war, it was intended under the Abercrombie plan, to be a metropolitan park--a green lung in the middle of a very densely populated part of London. We need to know what is happening and whether there is an encroachment. I hope that the Minister will find this an appealing proposition. I do not argue that the drafting is perfect; I merely hope that the Committee will accept our proposals.
<P>
Amendment No. 1141 concerns another important matter. It would require the environment report to contain information on the pollution and biodiversity of all the waterways in London, not just the Thames or the tidal reaches of rivers such as the Lea. The latter makes people feel a need for reassurance that progress is being made; the London river provides the best test of whether we are becoming more environmentally responsible. Certainly, it is at its mouth one of the grimmest bits of the London scene that one can imagine. As I look down on it when I travel out of the east end through the docks, it reminds me that we have a long way to go.
<P>
The proposal includes the canals--the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster alluded to their importance earlier. They are a wonderful asset. We can cycle, run, and walk along them and use them for recreational rowing and other activities--[Interruption.] Until one reaches a lock, which needs a bit more energy. Nevertheless, most of us manage to deal with the locks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> What about the Surrey canal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Surrey canal is now rather lockless, as well as a bit waterless.
<P>
I hope that the proposition is accepted, as it is an important issue. Moreover, such waterways are important for wildlife and natural habitats. The banks of canals and rivers--just like the banks of motorways, bizarrely and paradoxically--can be some of the most fertile territory for butterflies, moths and creatures slightly smaller than ourselves.
<P>
Amendment No. 1142 would add to the report information about air emissions from industrial sites. I know that we will discuss air quality standards shortly, but this is the bit of the Bill that deals with the annual report and composited information.
<P>
This morning, at the invitation of London First, I had the great pleasure of spending an hour--for which I am very grateful--at an early-morning viewing of the Monet exhibition. I had not realised how heavily industrialised the south bank of the river was just next to Charing Cross bridge: the Monet paintings from about the turn of the century contain chimney stack after chimney stack; They are not set back in deepest Lambeth or deepest Southwark; they are right by the river. It was an educative experience.
<P>
What Monet liked most about London was its fogs--they kept him coming back to stay in the Savoy and paint. He had an extraordinarily well-ordered day. He would do one bit of painting from one site in the morning, one at lunchtime, and one in the evening, and then he would repeat it in a sequence.
<P>
Air quality was the great succes story of post-war London's environmental improvements. Although we are now monitoring the situation, there are still bits of London which look as if we are not controlling emissions.
<P>
Amendment No. 1143 deals with a crucial issue that is currently the subject of a huge amount of interest among hon. Members of all parties--three Bills dealing with it are going through Parliament. It is all about ensuring that we have good, energy-efficient housing. I do not need to make the arguments to the Committee; I think that we have all been persuaded of how many lives we can save, how much illness we can prevent and how much money people--particularly those on low incomes--can save by having energy-efficient housing.
<P>
We have encapsulated a range of issues in a list of items to be added to the report. I am, of course, wary of the Minister arguing that we are being over-prescriptive. I say to him that I am entirely sympathetic to that. One cannot have a list as long as the Bill--although given how long the Bill now is, a long list could keep it relatively in proportion.
<P>
We must try somewhere to include all the areas in which we are working to establish national and international progress. Liberal Democrat Members accept the Ministers' argument--the Minister for Transport in London has made it often--that if the new authority is to make progress, whatever disagreements we may have about its component parts and their relative powers, it must reflect the monitoring that takes place nationally. It is no good trying to ensure that we protect biodiversity or clean up the waterways in Britain as a whole if we do not know how well we are doing in London. This is the only agency that we will have for doing that. I hope that the Ministers will give our propositions a sympathetic response. We would be happy to have discussions with the Government and interested parties about ensuring the best, most consistent list, so that the monitoring and the report are begun on the best possible framework.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I smiled wryly when the hon. member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey described his visit to the Monet exhibition. When I was an invited guest at that exhibition, I spent most of the time preparing my thoughts on a Liberal Democrat amendment. I smiled even more wryly in the light of our most recent debate, during which the hon. Gentleman was happy to squander and dispose of 14 amendments to secure two amendments on the minimisation of waste. It occurred to me that the aim of minimising waste could have prompted him not to table 14 amendments.
<P>
Part IX of the Bill is wall-to-wall with Liberal Democrat amendments. I am reminded of the anecdote from the first world war about Margot Asquith, who of course married into No. 10 when we last had a Liberal Prime Minister. It was remarked that she was absolutely marvellous during her visits to the war wounded in hospital--she could make the blind to see, the deaf to hear and even the dumb to talk, if only they could get a word in edgeways.
<P>
In the light of what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was saying about environmental health in his constituency, I commend to any member of the Committee who is not aware of it the table that has recently been produced by the Economic and Social Research Council, which lists the country's 659 constituencies by indices of poverty, morbidity and levels of health. I was a junior Back Bencher when the Black report came out, and I think that I am one of the rare people in this land who actually possesses a copy of it, which I attribute solely to luck.
<P>
The hon. Member for Romford (Mrs. Gordon) and I today attended a meeting that was held by the National Federation of City Farms in the Attlee Room. In the light of amendment No. 1140, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, I point out that the organisation is worried that the concentration on brownfield sites is likely to cause a reduction in the number of city farms and community gardens in the future. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey alluded to canals--a typically keen observation that should have belonged to my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, on whom the hon. Gentleman recently sought to foist the constituency of Hayes and Harlington.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friend's name appears in connection with some of the amendments, and I hope that we may hear from him shortly.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 1056, for which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, having spent the morning with the Monets, was not entirely prepared.
<P>
Litter is not the only aspect of the streetscape that causes offence. Other nuisances include holes in the road, badly maintained roads, graffiti, chewing gum and broken or unsightly street furniture. The Department that is represented by two of the three Ministers who are leading for the Government publishes a national roads maintenance survey. Its report for 1996 showed that the deterioration level of urban roads nationally was about 15 per cent. and that of urban footways was about 17 per cent.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Eighteen wasted years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In the light of the Minister's sotto voce remarks, I should say that Westminster scored well, with deterioration of only 5 per cent. for roads and footways. To those who want to pursue the matter further, I commend Judy Hillman's book "A New Look for London". A distinguished journalist, she played a notable part in Dame Jenifer Jenkins's review of the royal parks, which the Royal Fine Art Commission published in 1988. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says in response to my amendment.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I almost want to tell the Minister that, when I tabled amendment No. 1049, it seemed like a good idea. That was before I saw the large number of lists that has appeared in the name of the Liberal Democrats and before I saw that their names had been added to my own, as if I was to be implicated in proposing the long list of worthy causes that should be included in the Bill.
<P>
I am not a great lover of lists. In one context, lists are important for me. I am a keen bird watcher, and bird watchers keep lists of things. While I listen to the Ministers' speeches with all the attention that they deserve, my eyes wander outside and I see various birds flying past. I have to report that I have seen quite a few species. I have seen three species of gull, a heron, a sparrow-hawk, a kestrel and many cormorants, and I am hoping for a shag--to fly past. As you will know, Mr. O'Hara, it is a close congener of the cormorant, and I live in hope that I will see one before the end of the Committee.
<P>
London's biodiversity is undoubted. The Minister will tell me that many of my concerns will be answered in clause 243, which refers to the London biodiversity action plan. My only worry is that there does not seem to be a way in that clause effectively to measure the progress of the mayor's biodiversity plan. That is why I seek to add biodiversity to the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> It is tough matter to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge. His little essay on bird life put me in mind of a little-known fact, which even he, with his skill, may not have come across. It is a fact that the common cormorant or shag lays eggs inside a paper bag. That is a mystery until one finds out that it is in fact defending its potential offspring against hordes of wandering bears with buns who steal the bags to hold the crumbs. However, I did not intervene to say that.
<P>
In fairness to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, who is having an especially good afternoon and scoring heavily, I should explain something. The hon. Gentleman was talking about canals, and I yield to no one in my interest in canals. I have walked hundreds of miles of the Grand Union, the Stratford-on-Avon and the Kennet and Avon. He referred to canals as a place where one can satisfactorily row. My knowledge of canals suggests that they are perhaps the most hazardous place to row. That is particularly true for someone who is rowing by himself, which means that he is proceeding with his back facing in the direction that he is going. In my experience, lock gates are totally unyielding. I would warn anybody in the Committee who is thinking about going rowing not to row on a canal. There are some wondrous things on the canals, and I shall come to wildlife in a moment. Anybody who has a spare Sunday in the summer and goes to see the Foxton inclined plane will find that it is a wonder of industrial archaeology. So is the lift--I think that it is called the Anderton lift--that connects the Liverpool and Leeds canal to the Weaver navigation, which, with the best will in the world, I do not think will ever be restored.
<P>
Interestingly, I have a constituency connection with the Grand Union canal. Its summit is situated in Solihull, which is its highest point as it makes its way from London to Birmingham. Birmingham is on pretty high ground, and when the canal was built from Birmingham to Worcester, across a drop of some 300 ft, the canal engineers were afraid of the severe risk that joining Birmingham's system to the Severn at Worcester would empty it into the Severn. They compensated for that effect by pumping.
<P>
All summits of canals naturally lose their water in both directions. Whichever way barges travel, the top section loses water every time it is opened, so a reservoir has to be situtated above it. I live by the reservoir at the top of the Grand Union canal. My address is Mereside way, because I live beside the mere, which is not natural, but man made. It is an artificial mere that went with the canal age, but is a wonderful source of bird life, and a wonderful habitat, with trees growing all around it. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey may care to note that a very active sailing club is based there, although nobody rows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had a fascinating debate, which has revealed many of the hobbies and talents of Committee members, and has touched on the natural habitats in which they live. There was a glorious moment as the hon. Member for Solihull neared the end of his speech. He revealed his home address, alongside the mere that fuels the Grand Union canal. I thought it a fitting moment to end the debate, and recalled the famous words of Tennyson, who wrote
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"And on the mere the wailing died away."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 The Committee has not, however, heard any wailing during the debate. It has covered some important issues in relation to the state of the environment report that the mayor is obliged to publish.
<P>
Clause 242 contains a list of subjects that the mayor must include in the report. It consists of air quality and emissions, including emissions from road traffic, road traffic levels, water quality and emissions to water, ground water levels, energy consumption and the emission of substances which contribute to global warming--or climate change, depending on one's preference in terminology--land quality, the production, recycling and disposal of waste, noise, natural resources and litter.
<P>
The list is intended to ensure that the report covers a full range of environmental issues with no significant omissions and without being unduly prescriptive. I agree with the views of the hon. Member for Uxbridge, who suggested that we should not end up producing a list that is too long.
<P>
The clause also states that the report
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may contain information about any other matters in relation to Greater London which the Mayor considers appropriate."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision gives the mayor discretion to include matters of his or her choice to which the Bill does not specifically refer. It allows the mayor a pretty free hand to include anything that he or she considers relevant to Londoners or of interest to them.
<P>
The issues that the state of the environment report could deal with are endless, and I am wary of adding indiscriminately to the list. Each additional topic places on the mayor a further burden of gathering information. The Government's general approach is that we should add to the list only when there is an overriding reason for doing so.
<P>
We see some merit in one amendment in the group, and we are prepared to take it away and consider it. I regret to say that I cannot support the rest of the amendments in the group. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has had good luck so far this afternoon, but I must disappoint him now. It will not be his amendment that we take away. I must surprise and astonish the hon. Member for Uxbridge by telling him that he has hit the jackpot in this group. He was diffident and concerned that his amendment had been surrounded by Liberal Democrat amendments, and that Liberal Democrat Members had appended their names to his amendment, but I must tell him that there is good reason for others to add their names to his amendment.
<P>
The mayor is required to include sections in the report on all of his or her direct environmental functions--such as waste, air quality and noise--other than biodiversity. The omission of biodiversity appears to be an oversight on our part. We are therefore prepared to consider the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, and propose to table an amendment later to achieve that effect. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be pleased by that, and that that will ensure that he pays scrupulous attention in Committee in future, and is not diverted by the prospect of odd birds flying past the window.
<P>
I was delighted that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster recalled Margot Asquith. He did not tell the most famous story for which she is renowned--that of her encounter with Jean Harlow. It is probably wiser for me not to pursue that any further in Committee, especially in view of the bird identified by the hon. Member for Uxbridge.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way. The reason that I did not tell that story was that I knew that Mr. O'Hara would immediately rule me out of order. The story that I told about Margot Asquith was entirely relevant to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It may have been entirely relevant, but it was not such a good story. However, let us at once pass on.
<P>
I must now move on to the bad news. As I have already said, we cannot accept the other amendments because they would simply add a considerable number of items to the list of matters that the mayor would be required to include in the report, covering a number of areas that are not fundamental to the mayor's responsibilities. That is not to say that many of them are not important, but the mayor should have discretion to determine whether they should be included.
<P>
In particular, I highlight the issue of the percentage of new developments on green and brown-field sites, mentioned in amendment No. 1140, which was given especial emphasis by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. That is already a matter for report by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Imposing a duty on the mayor would duplicate existing obligations and therefore is unnecessary to ensure that the information is in the public domain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am interested in the Minister's last point. Is he saying that that information would be kept for Greater London as well as nationally, for that is the issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It would be unreasonable for me to expect the hon. Gentleman to be aware that today we have announced the new PPG3--the framework that will determine the planning approach towards provision for housing and household growth. That new guidance specifically emphasises the importance that we attach to close monitoring on a regional basis of the proportion of development on brown-field as compared to green-field sites.
<P>
I can tell the hon. Gentleman that at the last count, London was leading the country in the proportion of development on brownfield sites, for understandable reasons, with some 72 per cent. of new housing on such sites. We certainly intend that there should be clear regional indicators demonstrating how individual regions are performing. London will be covered in that respect in the same way as other regions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful that the Minister conceded that it would have been unreasonable to expect me to have known about planning guidance issued while we were sitting here working, when information does not reach us.
<P>
I am grateful for the information. Is the Minister saying that the Government will now require someone to produce that information on a regional and regular basis? If so, that is a perfectly appropriate bit of information to be fed to the Greater London authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he wants. The DETR will be monitoring that on a regular basis, but, equally, it will seek the active involvement of regional bodies--in London, that will clearly be the Greater London authority and the boroughs--to ensure the most effective implementation of our policies be the Greater London authority and the boroughs--to ensure the most effective implementation of our policies, to maximise development on brown-field sites and to monitor the situation. That is in line with the philosophy underpinning the Government's planning policy on household growth, which is different from the old predict-and-provide approach; it is characterised by the words plan, monitor and manage. If we are not monitoring, we do not know what the figures are and we cannot manage as well as we would like. The Department will certainly take responsibility in that field.

The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster talked about streetscape. While I am immensely attracted by the way in which the right hon. Gentleman presented his argument, and while I entirely agree with the tribute that he paid to Judy Hillman and her work for the report that Dame Jennifer Jenkins published on the royal parks--I believe that Judy Hillman wrote much of that report--his amendment is not feasible or practical. A requirement for the mayor to report on items such as graffiti and holes in the road across the whole of London would be an incredibly difficult obligation to observe efficiently and thoroughly. There would inevitably be gaps and weaknesses and criticisms for the failure to keep an oversight on all the streetscape throughout London. It would be an unreasonably burdensome obligation.
<P>
However, I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that we expect the mayor, as part of his wider environmental and transport responsibilities, to keep an overall view on the quality of London's built environment, including its streetscape. I am sure that the extent to which we are enhancing the quality of our life will be a recurring theme in debates in the assembly. We all know that in an increasingly competitive world, cities will have to enhance the quality of life of their citizens and visitors if they are to remain attractive places in which to live and work. As a world city with every reason to seek to enhance its competitiveness, London has a direct interest in improving the quality of the urban environment. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman accepts that we share his overall objective, although we cannot accept his amendment, which would impose an unreasonable and burdensome duty on the mayor.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members concede that the amendmento should be withdrawn, on the understanding that we will take away the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Uxbridge and find the best way of incorporating it in the Bill at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> To the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster I can only say that I apologise for having ignored his perfectly good amendment. It may console him to know that although he was preparing work on the amendments while I was at the Monet exhibition, that was only because, happily, we had done some work on our amendments beforehand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> It has not shown.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It has shown on all but one occasion, when something slipped through slightly unexpectedly.
<P>
On the Minister's reflecting that he cannot offer me my third success in a row, I would say that I regard even the shared success that we have been able to enjoy by associating ourselves with the hon. Member for Uxbridge as some consolation. We were wise enough to see the wisdom of his amendment and to associate ourselves with it.
<P>
The Minister quoted Tennyson. I only remember--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I remember loads of Tennyson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I remember loads of Tennyson, too, but I will not trouble hon. Members with all of it. I can remember being told in the sixth form that one specific quote was inappropriate. I have never checked to see where it came from, but it was the best example that the English teacher could give of litotes. It went as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Her breath it came in short hot pants",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is clearly a sighting that leaves even the hon. Member for Uxbridge in the cold.
<P>
I have a final serious point. We saw yesterday the Environment Agency's report on the industrial units that have contributed to pollution. I accept the Minister's comment that our list could be used by the mayor as an addition to his or her list. However, it is important that amendment No. 1142 flags up the fact that submissions should come from individual sites rather than collectively, because unless the culprits can be identified, the problem often cannot be dealt with.
<P>
We are feeling generous in the warm glow of so many concessions this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> And of South African wine at lunchtime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Yes, and South African wine at lunchtime. Dinner is drawing near, and we can be sure that the mayor will have on his or her shelf a bound version of the Committee's deliberations. We will be happy to make that our gift to the new GLA building. In that spirit of generosity, I beg to ask leave to withdraw this lovely amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
