							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Prisk</b> (Hertford and Stortford) (Con):
						I beg
to move amendment No. 1, in clause 5, page 3, line 36, leave out
&#145;before each financial year publish&#146; and insert
&#145;publish
triennially&#146;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
afternoon, Mr. Weir. I am delighted that we are moving on to
clause 5. I presume that I should deal with amendment No. 1 on its own
and that we will then consider other matters
thereafter.</div>
					<a name="070417104000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is simple but important; namely, to remove the
phrase</div>
					<a name="070417104000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;before each
financial year
publish&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">and insert
&#147;publish triennially&#148;&#151;I said that word carefully.
&#147;Triennially&#148; involved a challenge, and we made sure that
we spelled it correctly. Otherwise, three documents might have been
published each year. However, I am reliably told by my &#147;Oxford
English Dictionary&#148; that our wording is
correct.</div>
					<a name="070417104000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment is simple. The forward work programme should provide a
strategic framework within which the new National Consumer Council will
operate, so it is logical to suggest that it be published every three
years rather than every year. The forward work programme, as its very
name suggests, should deal with a period or more than a year. Indeed,
the council will separately publish an annual report, so there will be
an annual process of reporting on what has been
achieved.</div>
					<a name="070417104000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
probing amendment whose purpose isto establish the reasoning
behind an annual work programme. There are examples of organisations
and functions that operate on the basis of a three-year programme. A
good number of police authorities have a three-year forward work
programme, which seemsto work perfectly well. Similarly, local
planning authorities have local development schemes that cover a
three-year
period.</div>
					<a name="070417104000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The period
can be adjusted, of course. It can be altered, it is not set in stone
or completely immutable. The purpose is to provide the organisation
with a perspective beyond the 12-month cycle. I suspect that with
triennial publication of the forward work programme, the council would
be able better to plan and use its resources. That is one reason why
wewould like to explore with the Minister whether the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>
						Government have considered that approach. It would
sit well with the other publications, documents and reporting that the
Government anticipate. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
remarks.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070417104000397"></a>
							<b class="B">Susan
Kramer</b> (Richmond Park) (LD): I waited for an explanation
of the amendment before coming to any conclusion about it. However, I
am unconvinced by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument.</div>
					<a name="070417104000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NCC&#146;s work will
cover a wide range of different businesses, all on different
timetables, and there will be opportunities for issues to arise at any
time. Who could have said three years ago that we would be considering
a proposal to close 2,500 post offices in the next two years? If that
had not been included in a forward plan, the NCC would not have had a
position on dealing with the consequences of it. Could we have known
three years in advance that we would go through a phase in which,
instead of steadily declining energy prices and a consequently fairly
predictable pattern of consumer pricing, there would suddenly be a
volatile period of rapid rises and declines, with some very poor
industry responses to that
pattern?</div>
					<a name="070417104000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unpredictability
characterises the issues with which consumers must deal daily, and it
is inappropriate to lock into a programme for three years
and&#151;more importantly&#151;to lock into the funding which, as
we have said earlier, essentially follows the forward programme on a
three-year basis.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000398"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> Mr. Weir, I am glad that you so
enjoyed the events of this morning that you have come back for the
afternoon sitting. I hope that we can make progress this
afternoon.</div>
					<a name="070417104000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the amendment is a probing one. However&#151;although
I do not say it to influence the views of hon. Members&#151;it was
moved in another place, where it was opposed by Conservative, Liberal
Democrat and Labour Members, for good reason. It might assist if I
explain why the proposals as they stand are consistent with good
practice and maximum transparency.</div>
					<a name="070417104000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not confuse the
purpose of the proposals with the purpose of an annual report. An
annual report sets out the achievements of the previous financial year
in the work programme, along with what is coming up. The clause deals
with something different. The hon. Member for Richmond Park hit the
nail on the head, and I shall return to her helpful comments in due
course.</div>
					<a name="070417104000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would cause the new council great difficulties. We believe in
maximum transparency, and consumers have a right to expect not only an
annual report but a forward work programme, in line with good practice.
The publication of an annual forward work programme
strikes a balance with the requirement to prepare an annual report in
line with financial years. The forward work programme represents the
means whereby the new council sets out a programme for consumer
advocacy, together with its aims and priorities and the funding
requirement for carrying out those aims and
priorities.</div>
					<a name="070417104000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issues to be addressed in the regulated sectors may be
fast-moving&#151;the hon. Lady alluded to the fast-moving nature of
some of the markets in which the NCC will work&#151;and if the
council were required to produce a forward work programme only once
every 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>
						three years, there could be difficulty. In the end,
the bottom line must be the capacity of the council to intervene on
consumers&#146; behalf, to take action, to consider research and to
make proposals for the resolution of problems, including both those
that have arisen or that could arise because of marketplace changes.
Publication of an annual forward work programme, on which the council
must consult, will ensure that the proposed activities of the council
will indeed be transparent, and that it can be held to account for
those activities, not only through the work programme process but
through the printed responses delivered in connection with the annual
report.</div>
					<a name="070417104000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consultation
will allow the new council to obtain the views of key stakeholders in
determining its priorities and the activities that it will undertake to
achieve them. In many cases, organisations want and need to take a
longer-term view for planning purposes. The hon. Member for Hertford
and Stortford mentioned local authority district plans. Local
authorities work on a 10-year statutory cycle, which ensures that once
agreement is reached about land uses and other planning law matters,
the local authority&#146;s planning department and its elected
planning committee members can make decisions over the 10-year period
that are consistent with planning law and with the decisions made
through public consultation and decision making&#151;including
potential public
inquiries.</div>
					<a name="070417104000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
process in the Bill is different, in the sense that there is a
fast-moving marketplace, a need to represent consumers&#146;
interests and a need to accommodate the possibility of intervention by
an independent body on consumers&#146; behalf. The process must
include the possibility of discussion with the regulator, with the
relevant organisations, including bodies in Scotland, Wales, Northern
Ireland and the regions, and with other stakeholders. It is therefore
critical that there is scope for such decisions to be made on the basis
of flexibility and proper priorities.</div>
					<a name="070417104000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to be able to update
and renew that vision each year. Although the speech made by the hon.
Member for Richmond Park was short, I am referring to it a lot. A short
contribution can contain some important fundamentals.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I shall give way to the hon. Member for
Bournemouth, East, who has been enjoying interrupting me from a
sedentary
position.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070417104000399"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Tobias Ellwood</b> (Bournemouth, East) (Con): I am grateful to
the Minister for giving way&#151;I believe that we are developing a
bit of rapport, which allows me to make the occasional sedentary
intervention. If he feels slightly hurt by that, I shall certainly take
guidance from you, Mr. Weir, and curtail my remarks.
However, as I am standing here, let me say that this probing amendment
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford was
designed to elicit a little more information on what the forward work
programmes would be, not only in a curtailed 12-month programme, but
looking ahead to the second and third years beyond that. Although it
may be appropriate to have such programmes for a 12-month focus, does
the Minister concede that a compromise solution would be for the
programmes also to include what might be on the horizon in a second and
third year, and to include those things that might be coming up. We
spoke at the beginning about the&#151;</div>

							<a name="070417104000402"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I say to the hon. Gentleman that I do not mind
whether his interventions are sitting or standing, as long as they are
sensible. The hon. Gentleman started off by saying that this was a
probing amendment, but then said that he was trying to negotiate a
compromise. However, even the blue blood&#151;the raw tooth and
claw&#151;of the Conservative party in the House of Lords would not
support the Front Bench proposal. There was good reason for that: it is
one of those probing amendments that has been badly drafted. However,
at least it provides the opportunity for discussion of a legitimate
issue.</div>
					<a name="070417104000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The balance
already exists. The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me: he is asking
for flexibility, and that is precisely what the clause brings. The
amendment does not provide that flexibility. We cannot use one snapshot
in timing, such as January next year, for example, to make a decision
that cannot be amended until
2011.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000403"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:
						</b> Clause 5 states clearly that the forward work
programme is</div>
					<a name="070417104000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
statement of any priorities of the Council for the year in relation to
designated
consumers&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
what we are asking is for those projects that will extend beyond that
year to be taken into consideration. If the Minister is able to put it
on the record that the document will include those projects and work
programmes that go beyond the year and that that can be highlighted for
the record, I think that this side of the House would be willing to
support that.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000404"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I do not question that, but I am resisting the
amendment because our proposals provide an effective approach. What the
hon. Gentleman is saying is that once the independent NCC establishes
its work programme, it will reflect the priorities for the coming
period. Thereafter, as the hon. Member for Richmond Park rightly said,
if circumstances arise where a marketplace intervention by the council
is needed, it will do that. It has the right to adjust its programme
accordingly, and that is what we are trying to do. The amendment does
not allow for that, and that is why the Committee ought to resist
it.</div>

							<a name="070417104000405"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> It is a shame that the Minister is so negative this
afternoon; I am not sure whether he had a little raw liver at lunch, or
something to make him a little more testy than this morning. The
purpose ofthe amendment is to try to elicit from him
whetherthe Minister and the Department, and therefore the
council, would plan for a degree of flexibility in its forward work
programme. I do not accept the argument that having a three-year work
programme would somehow prevent the NCC from being able even to
contemplate a change of circumstances in the marketplace, any more than
the existing clause does within a 12-year programme. I am glad the
Minister has at least been able to set out what he regards as the
importance of flexibility, with which we certainly concur. On that
note, having fulfilled my purpose, which was to get a proper debate
going, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="070417104000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is fair to say that the Government love targets. If the Treasury had
had its way, there would be more targets than one could shake a stick
at. However, all too often some of them are vague. All that the
amendment would do is establish that the objectives should be
measurable. I suspect that the Minister will say that they will be, in
which case I shall be more than happy not to press the amendment to a
Division. I hope that he will clarify that they will be
measurable.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000407"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> My short intervention concerns a particular
bug-a-boo of mine. These days, objectives are nearly always treated as
though they have to be measurable. That means that we end up with
distorted objectives because they are shaped in such a way that we can
get a measurement. That is sometimes desirable, and I assume that those
sort of objectives are within the scope of the measure. However, at
other times, for example, in relation to including more women in
decision making or engaging disabled people in a particular project,
specific quotas and targets bring us into the realm of something that
becomes so driven by the number that it loses all sight of common
sense. I am in favour of &#147;measurable&#148; being included in
the clause, as long as scope is retained for worthwhile objectives that
are not necessarily
measurable.</div>

McCartney:
						</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford on one of the most elegant climbdowns on an amendment that I
have witnessed in my 10 years as a Minister in Committee.
[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;He has not been doing it
for 10 years.&#148;] I have been watching the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
progress very closely. From where I am standing, my comment was very
flattering and, if I were him, I would take it as such.</div>
					<a name="070417104000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that what I am about to
say balances both what the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for
Richmond Park have said. The hon. Lady spoke some common sense. I shall
assess what the hon. Gentleman said, although I am not sure whether he
meant thata measurable objective was equivalent to a target or
whether a target was equivalent to a measurable objective. It all
depends on the basis of his
argument.</div>
					<a name="070417104000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment requires the new council in describing projects to be
undertaken in the forward work programme to include measurable
objectives. It is another attempt to reduce flexibility for the new
council without offering anything positive in return. Some projects
simply do not lend themselves to measurable objectives. For example, if
more consumers switched suppliers owing to an energy supplier and the
new council running awareness campaigns at the same time, how would the
new council measure how much of the success was down to it and how much
to the advertising by the supplier in the market? An element of
subjective assessment, including assessment by the new council, will be
necessary in some cases, as the hon. Lady pointed out.</div>
					<a name="070417104000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any event, measurable
objectives will usually be set out for the new council as part of its
budget-setting exercise in conjunction with the Department. That is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>established practice and the correct process for setting measurable
objectives, which genuinely meets the aim that the hon. Member for
Hertford and Stortford seeks. That issue is also covered elsewhere in
the Bill. Clause 7 requires the council to include in its annual report
a statement on the progress of projects in the forward work programme.
The provision is doubly locked in respect of the budget-setting
process, the reporting process and the forward work programme. The
amendment calls for rigidity where flexibility is needed and, for that
reason, I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman an acceptable
explanation.</div>

Expenditure incurred under subsection (3) must not exceed such amount

					<a name="070417104000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment, which deals with the relationship between the
Government and the new consumer council. It would allow Ministers to
set a cap on the council&#146;s spending. It is important that there
be a clear limit on such spending, although within that it would
clearly be for the council to decide what it regards as a priority. The
essence of the amendment is to gain an understanding of whether the
Minister, and therefore the Department, believes that controls are in
place to ensure that the new organisation&#146;s remit focuses on
efficiency and the right priorities. The amendment would simply give
Ministers the power to set a cap, should they wish to do so, and I
shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000411"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> Again, I accept that the hon. Gentleman has
moved a probing amendment, and I hope that my explanation will reassure
him and other members of the Committee about the intentions behind the
clause.</div>
					<a name="070417104000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment takes a particularly bureaucratic approach to what we want to
do. A statutory limitation on the new council&#146;s spending is not
the best way to ensure that consumer interests are met. Expenditure by
the new council will be subject to a budget agreed with my Department
each year, as is usual practice for non-departmental public bodies. As
with similar bodies, it is likely that rolling three-year budgets will
be reviewed annually to provide for as much planning certainty as
possible. At the outset, therefore, there will be an understanding of
the overall budget for the three years, but that will be reviewed each
year to ensure that things are working effectively. To take up a point
that hon. Members raised earlier, that will allow certainty about the
planning process and outcomes, as resources will be dealt with in a
transparent way to meet requirements.</div>
					<a name="070417104000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another important point is
that the budget will be subject to close consultation&#151;the hon.
Gentleman did not raise this in his amendment, but I am sure that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>relates to the intentions behind it&#151;between the Department, the
gas, electricity and postal services companies and, later, the water
companies regarding their respective contributions. It is particularly
important that those sectors are involved, since they are being asked
to contribute significant resources to secure the NCC&#146;s work,
albeit for public interest reasons, to which we are all
committed.</div>
					<a name="070417104000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">When, in
a previous life, I introduced the national minimum wage, I always
argued that we would need a Low Pay Commission. If we impose a wage
settlement on employers and ask them to put their hands in their
pockets, there is a requirement for them to be involved in discussions
and decision making about the level of the settlement. For a different
reason, the process before us is very similar: we are trying to ensure
that industries are engaged at every level as regards their respective
contributions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000412"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> The Minister is absolutely right that I wanted to
understand the relationship not only between the council and Ministers,
but between the council and its contributory organisations. At what
point will those organisations and their industries first be informed?
I was not quite clear about that from what he
said.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000413"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> The minute the process of establishing the
budget and the financial resources commences, there will be engagement
with the partners, including the organisations that I mentioned, the
Department, the new NCC and its executive officers. It is incredibly
important that we proceed on that basis. At the end of the
decision-making process, we will come to an holistic figure for the
three-year programme, which will be reviewed annually on a specific
basis.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000414"></a>Mr.

						</b> In those circumstances, how is it envisaged that a
dispute between, for example, the Secretary of State and the other
contributory organisations will be
resolved?</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000415"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> The best way to describe it is to say that it
would be resolved by the Secretary of State, in the sense that there is
an absolute necessity in those situations to establish a budget
reflecting the agreed programme of work. That has a consultation
process in its own right too, and it is important that that is
so.</div>
					<a name="070417104000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer a
point that I think was also alluded to, the budget-setting process
inevitably includes efficiency and value-for-money criteria, which will
be worked up and are not for discussion here. A limit could have the
effect of preventing the new council from addressing urgent and
unforeseen issues that could arise during the year, and we should not
inhibit the council in that way. In the light of my explanation, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will accept my efforts to reassure him and his
colleagues.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="070417104000416"></a>Mr.

the amendment for which I am responsible is very crude. Naturally, it
is a device that we are using, and I fully accept that it would not be
something that, were I in his seat&#151;</div>

had the opportunity to swap places, then, like him, I would take the
view that the amendment is crude in form. However, its purpose was
simple. Rightly, the Minister has taken us through the relationships
that will prevail between the council and the Secretary of State and
other contributors. The financial services industry makes a significant
contribution to funding the Financial Services Authority, and the
processes set out in the Bill are similar. I certainly found the
Minister&#146;s remarks helpful. I hope that the industry will have
done so too, and on that basis I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="070417104000421"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Weir. Amendment no. 9 is
at the very beginning of the clause and its purpose, like that of
several other amendments, is to try to establish on the record the
clear independence of the council. The Minister alluded to that in some
earlier remarks, and we are keen to ensure that that is explored
properly as we debate these probing amendments.</div>
					<a name="070417104000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members will be aware that if
the new NCC is to maintain the well regarded reputation of the existing
council, it is important that its independence and that of its work
force are clear for all to see. Let us take, for example, the obvious
controversy surrounding post office closures. In that context, if the
NCC were not seen to be clearly independent, there would be a danger of
its reputation&#151;and, from a Minister&#146;s point of view, its
effectiveness and authority&#151;being diminished. It is therefore
important to establish the independence of the NCC.</div>
					<a name="070417104000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The essence of the argument
also relates to research. This is a most important area where the NCC
must be seen to have an independent character if is to work
effectively, as envisaged in the Bill. In relation to amendment No. 9,
I want the Minister to give us a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>
						clear and unequivocal statement not only on the
organisation&#146;s independence in principle, but on how that will
work in practice.</div>
					<a name="070417104000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendment No. 7, we seek to address what I would describe as rather
woolly language, which could mean that the forward work programme is
just a generalised framework and therefore does not provide sufficient
direction. That is parallel to a discussion that we have already
had.</div>
				
					
					<a name="070417104000369"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="070417104000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
careful to seek in the amendment a requirement not that the end
elements of the programme be implemented, because that will clearly be
a matter for the council, but rather that the programme that includes
those elements be implemented. The underlying concern is that the
danger that a large effort might go into producing constantly updated
and, as we now know, annual forward work programmes that are not
actually implemented. That is a problem, and I will welcome the
Minister&#146;s reply to that
point.</div>
					<a name="070417104000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment
No. 8, we seek to leave out the words
</div>
					<a name="070417104000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have regard to the
need to&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose is
to tighten up the language of subsection (6), to be confident
that the most efficient use is made of resources, rather than the
council merely having regard to the need for the possibility of
efficiency, which is language that clearly leaves a lot of
leeway.</div>
					<a name="070417104000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is that the NCC&#146;s powers of investigation are widely drawn, yet
the Bill is somewhat lacking in detail on the prudent expenditure of
resources. We heard from the Minister in a previous debate a comforting
setting out of the procedures by which the overall budgeting will be
guided, but it would be helpful if he were a little clearer on the use
of resources. The purpose of the amendment is to seek to put in place a
specific duty, and I hope that the Minister will respond to that
point.</div>
					<a name="070417104000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
amendment to which I shall speak in this
group&#151;amendment No. 14&#151;would amend clause 11(1)
by inserting the words</div>
					<a name="070417104000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and provide an account of how
its resources were used in an efficient
way.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has clearly
been grouped with the other amendments because it relates to a similar
principle: to try to place a clear obligation in the Bill. Some may say
that such an obligation would be unnecessary and bureaucratic, but that
a simple, standard measurement of manpower and money used would
suffice. That would focus minds on providing value for money, which is
the essence of the
matter.</div>
					<a name="070417104000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of each of these probing amendments is to draw from the Minister a
clear set of principles on how resources will be used and to clarify
the council&#146;s role. In particular, to return to amendment No. 9,
we seek the independence of the council. I hope that the Minister will
respond positively to the
debate.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000422"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> Before I speak to amendment No. 21, I want to make
a quick comment on the amendments tabled by the Conservative party. We
support
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>amendment No. 9, on the independence of the National Consumer Council,
which is absolutely crucial, and I see no reason not to support the
tightening proposed in amendment No. 7. However, we have problems with
amendment No. 8, which will become apparent as I speak to clause 6(8),
which refers to sustainable development. It might make the objective of
sustainable development difficult if we had a such a narrow benchmark
as is proposed in amendment No. 8, so I have concerns about
it.</div>
					<a name="070417104000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for amendment
No. 14, it seems to us to be a recipe for endless pieces of paper. We
assume that there should be good practice, imposed by the auditors on
the National Consumer Council, so that it will track the efficiency and
effectiveness of its projects, and, presumably, carry out various forms
of cost-benefit analysis. However, producing a piece of paper
discussing efficiency for everything it does strikes us as waste of
time and a recipe for inefficiency.</div>
					<a name="070417104000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment No. 21 is one of
the more significant amendments in the group, and addresses sustainable
development. I am conscious that, as a consequence of the debate in the
other place, the Government strengthened the language on sustainable
development, because of which I do not intend to press the amendment.
However, it seems to me that this was an opportunity to express
concerns that sustainability should be at the very core of the National
Consumer Council&#146;s work. We should have been very pleased if the
Government had seen their way to using the slightly stronger language
used in our amendment.</div>
					<a name="070417104000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The National Consumer Council
as it is today has engaged very much with issues of sustainability, and
I know that the staff are very concerned that that should continue as a
central focus of what they do. In the other place, the case of
&#147;Greening supermarkets&#148;&#151;the NCC report of
September 2006&#151;was quoted. The NCC called on leading
supermarkets to green up their act; it put the top eight to the test on
four green indicators. Lo and behold, organisations that had previously
looked the other way on sustainability matters were suddenly in a race
to prove themselves the greenest, when it was known that that public
document was in the works. Before and after the launch, significantly,
they improved their performance and commitments.</div>
					<a name="070417104000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have since been two
other relevant NCC reports, which were not available to be covered in
the other place. &#147;Information blackout: why electronics
consumers are in the dark&#148; revealed that shoppers who want to
choose energy-efficient electronic household products such as TVs, DVDs
or laptops were, in effect, left in the dark. Of 350 items researched,
only one&#151;a television&#151;had an energy label sticker on it.
Now the NCC is calling for a colour-coded scheme for such goods. The
effectiveness of that work has yet to be proved in the marketplace, but
we expect it to be as effective as the earlier report.</div>
					<a name="070417104000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, in the same month,
a report entitled &#147;Energy shouldn&#146;t cost the
Earth&#148; brought together the issues of fuel poverty and energy
efficiency. It pointed out that many people in fuel poverty are also in
a very energy-inefficient environment. About 80 per cent. of people in
fuel poverty live in homes with below average energy efficiency. Once
again, that work leads towards a blueprint that may, hopefully, bring
change. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>report indeed calls for much more rapid smart metering technology, among
other things, to encourage energy efficiency, even for the least well
off.</div>
					<a name="070417104000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I raise those
matters as illustrations. I hope that we will get a strong commitment
from the Minister that sustainability will be at the core of the
NCC&#146;s activities. If he can see his way to strengthening the
language further, that is extremely
desirable.</div>

Tom Clarke</b> (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) (Lab):
Rather late in the day, I add my welcome to your chairmanship,
Mr. Weir, and I want to say how muchI have enjoyed
the proceedings. It is typical of the generosity of my right hon.
Friend the Minister that he did not discourage me from speaking to this
groupof amendments; perhaps, between us, and with the support
of the Committee, we may emerge with more clarity in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="070417104000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">My attention
was drawn to clause 6 and the amendments, because when we take a
decision on those matters, we establish the ethos of the NCC as we
would like to see it. That is important, particularly in respect of
vulnerable groups.</div>
					<a name="070417104000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. Friend the
Minister shares my interest in these matters. Indeed, I had the
opportunity some years ago to visit a group in his constituency who
were involved in learning disabilities. They presented me with a
wonderful set of carpet bowls, which remain in my cabinet to this day.
I regret to say that I have not yet used them; perhaps others will
regret it still more.</div>

					<a name="070417104000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it stands, I find clause 6
a little ambiguous. For example, clause 6(4)

best calculated to contribute to the achievement of sustainable
development.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be
honest, I think that this matter really must be clarified.</div>
					<a name="070417104000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it happens, although I had
planned to say a word or two about this matter today if I caught your
eye, Mr. Weir, we were assisted this morning by the
memorandum that appeared almost out of the blue from BOC Gases. I
should like to quote BOC&#146;s perception of what is going on. On
energy prices, which I mentioned on Second Reading, BOC
says:</div>
					<a name="070417104000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Generally
speaking the market is dominated by very large companies and customers
are at a commercial
disadvantage.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
its view. My heavens, if that is the case, customers who happen to be
disabled, disadvantaged or on a low income surely have the right to ask
us, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>&#147;Well, aren&#146;t you thinking about us as well?&#148; I am
sure that the Minister would want to bear that in mind.</div>
					<a name="070417104000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">BOC goes on to
say:</div>

is, while a primary one, only one of a number of duties, BOC believes
that a body such as the present Energywatch organisation with a
specific and focused purpose to look after customers is
required.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see
that that aim has been achieved in clause 6, which is why I am
interested in my right hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s response to
the discussion on the amendments. Because he has an open mind, I know
that he will want to address this point genuinely and
honestly.</div>
					<a name="070417104000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern, particularly on energy prices, which impact on a huge number
of consumers, especially the disadvantaged ones whom I mention, is that
Ofgem is apparently planning in the upcoming supply license review to
regulate even less regarding disabled customers, arguing that that is
covered by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</div>
					<a name="070417104000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that subject, I say very
simply and briefly that I was heavily involved as that Act was going
through Parliament, doing the job that the hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford is doing now, but I was then facing the right hon. Member for
Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), who had responsibility for the
issue. I do not think that he would ever have argued&#151;I certainly
did not argue&#151;that the DDA took on board the kind of advocacy
role for disadvantaged and disabled people, including people with
learning disabilities. There was an excellent debate about people with
mental illnesses in the Chamber yesterday. None of us would have argued
that we saw it as the role of the council, or of Ofgem, to take that on
board.</div>
				
					
					<a name="070417104000370"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="070417104000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
spirit, I say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that there is a
great deal of interest in his response. We want the council to be
proactive; we feel that it ought to deal not only with whether the
market is right and whether regulators ought to be focused almost
exclusively on that. We think that there is a role for advocacy and for
monitoring what happens to people with disabilities and others,
particularly whenit comes to the problems in respect of
pre-payment energy meters. We can all tell stories from our
constituencies of the traumas that arise from such issues.</div>
					<a name="070417104000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. Friend is a
person of vision. We need give the NCC the real powers that are
important to enable the organisation to act in the way to which my
party was committed in its general election manifesto. I hope that my
right hon. Friend will give some regard to the points that I have made.
I am sure that many people, particularly organisations of and for
disabled people and pensioners on low pay, are looking forward to his
response.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000426"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> This has been a short debate, but it has
covered some fundamental issues. In my response, I shall attempt to be
empathetic and sympathetic to what has been said, both generally and
specifically. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford spoke to the
probing amendments effectively. I recognise what the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>hon. Member for Richmond Park said, and I shall come to each amendment
in turn. I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge,
Chryston and Bellshill for what seemed like a tour round the area in
which I was brought up. I was very misty-eyed. I shall respond to
him.</div>
					<a name="070417104000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the end
of the Bill&#146;s progress, there will be other debates about issues
concerning vulnerable customers, which will allow a more detailed
discussion. It is critically important that we establish the NCC and
that we follow the good practice that exists for current regulators and
those who represent vulnerable consumers. The term &#147;vulnerable
consumers&#148; covers a wide spectrum, which ranges from people with
physical and mental disabilities to people with impairments from
alcoholism, drug abuse and mental illness. Itis a huge
spectrum of individuals who require sustainability. They require a
specific relationshipto look after their needs, to provide
support and to advocate on their behalf, to ensure that the access to
the marketplace that we give to consumers generally is given to those
who are most vulnerable and difficult to reach. It is most difficult
for them to exercise the rights that we give to the community in
general. We therefore need to build capacity of the structure of
services and of the skill match and the nature of the skills with which
we provide our staff in the advocacy
process.</div>
					<a name="070417104000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
areas, with Ofgem and other bodies, there is already a fundamental
change in the practices of companies and their internal workings with
consumers, particularly vulnerable consumers. We are all at one on the
establishment of the NCC. Its role in representing vulnerable consumers
is a moving feast; from the outset, the focus of that role must be
practical to enable it to deal with the needs not only of vulnerable
groups, but of individual consumers in their own right. That will
require us to take the best practice programmes of existing
organisations and build on them.</div>
					<a name="070417104000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The skill match is important.
Those who will be on the front line looking after the interests of
people with a disability or other special needs should have an
understanding, rapport and empathy with such issues. I know that from
my former role at the Department for Work and Pensions. When we
established the Pension Service, we had to change the skill sets of
thousands of staff in an 18-month period. Under previous Governments of
all persuasions, their role had been that of gatekeeper on behalf of
the state, to prevent fraud&#151;and rightly so. However, with the
Pension Service, their role is now more than that. It is an advocacy
service on behalf of people with special needs, and that requires
special skills and talent. There will be a challenge, but the relevant
people will be up to it. We have already seen the changes that are
taking place. When we get to other clauses, perhaps we shall be able to
debate more fully the issues around people with
vulnerabilities.</div>
					<a name="070417104000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a final point about vulnerabilities. Membersof Parliament
know about it; we have to ensure that our staff have the skills to deal
with vulnerable constituents. The first thing to establish with someone
who has a vulnerability is a sense of being able to trust people. The
hon. Members for Richmond Park and for Hertford and Stortford made an
important point about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>the National Consumer Council and its reputation. It is vital, not only
in its advocacy role in respect of policy making but in its role of
representing people with vulnerabilities. The big thing about
vulnerability is a mistrust of the system and of authority. To be able
to advocate effectively, trust has to be built and that means having
staff on the front line with the capacity to do
that.</div>
					<a name="070417104000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
those general comments are helpful about the direction that I want the
new organisation to take and why the clause offers a wide remit for it
to work with the regulators and work on its role with various groups in
respect of the needs of vulnerable
people.</div>
					<a name="070417104000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
with the other amendments. I reassure the Committee that the new
council will be independent, exercising its statutory functions as it
sees fit for the benefit of consumers. Amendment No. 9 attempts to set
that out in the Bill and would require the new council to act
independently of the Government, regulators and providers of goods and
services. However, the amendment lacks clarity and causes uncertainty;
I do not say that as a criticism, but as a response.</div>
					<a name="070417104000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the term
&#147;Government&#148; include local authorities, Government
agencies and other non-departmental public bodies? The list is not
exhaustive; the amendment does not target what it exactly means in its
wording. I also remind the Committee that the new council will be a
statutory body with statutory functions, which cannot be interceded
upon by the Secretary of State. It must prepare a forward work
programme annually and consult on it. The programme must contain a
general description of the main activities, including any projects;
that is what the hon. Gentleman wanted to know. It will be
project-specific. Frankly, if it was not, that would be a complete
waste of time. It is important that a work programme should mean
exactly that&#151;after consultation, a clear, transparent set of
circumstances in which the organisation will task itself to
perform.</div>
					<a name="070417104000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
year, the council will plan to undertake the programme, and the
activities that it proposes to undertake will be in the public domain.
It is also important that there should be clarity for the public and
the consumer in general about the activities of the council. If the
council proposes at any stage to act in response to representations
made to it, again, it will have the independence to do so. For example,
if the hon. Gentleman had an issue about something that had happened in
the marketplace, he might put down a parliamentary question. He might
even ask for a debate, or he might raise the issue in Parliament in
some other form&#151;writing to and asking for a meeting with
Ministers, for example. However, because of the independence of the
council, he could directly ask it to investigate without any recourse
through the prism of a Department or a Minister and a Department. That
is important. How we see the independence of the organisation is very
important. If it were not independent, it would not be able to do the
job required of it&#151;that of representing and advocating for
consumers in general and in particular.</div>
					<a name="070417104000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The council should be
independent. It is important that legislators create an independent
body that can respond intellectually to issues that arise from changes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>in the market place&#151;I shall come back to the issue of sustainable
development. Legislators will have a body that will help fashion
priorities in terms of public need and public right. That is important.
The council must not only be independent in the sense that a Minister
has said that it is, but by the fact that it has statutory independence
and an absolute right to operate independently.</div>
					<a name="070417104000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also question the logic of
requiring the new council to act independently of Government, the
regulators, and providers of goods and services at all times. I can
envisage instances in which significant consumer benefit can be derived
from joint working between the council and a regulator. For example,
they could work together on a particular project. Indeed, clause 20
requires the new council to enter into co-operation arrangements with
the Office of Fair Trading. We envisage that such arrangements will
cover, among other key areas, the issue of consumer education and how
the two bodies will work together to improve consumers&#146;
knowledge of their rights and entitlements should things go
wrong.</div>
					<a name="070417104000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a sense,
the easy job is to establish the NCC. It might be difficult in itself
but, relatively speaking, it is an easy programme of work. It is not so
easy, however, as Governments of all persuasions know, to let people
know about their new rights or to give them the capacity to exercise
those rights. That goes back to the point made by my right hon. Friend
the Memberfor Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill and in the
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Richmond Park about giving
people who cannot exercise their rights independently assistance to get
access to their rights. It is absolutely essential that we proceed
inthat way.</div>
					<a name="070417104000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns were also raised in
another place about the independence of the new council from
Government. The Bill does not contain a power of direction over the
council by the Secretary of State, which is significant. There is no
power of direction in the Bill. The legislation therefore contains a
clear signal that the council is an independent body and that will
informthe decisions that it makes. The fact that the council
will be required to report to the Secretary of State is critically
important because through that, the council is accountable to
Parliament. However, it is a reporting and not a controlling
mechanism&#151;it will not curtail the council&#146;s
independence.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070417104000427"></a>
							<b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): Forgive my
ignorance, but why does the reporting mechanism have to involve the
Secretary of State? Why is the council not required to report to
Parliament itself? If the report goes to the Secretary of State, it can
be delayed unnecessarily by a Government of whatever political
persuasion.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000428"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> When we discussed schedule 1 this morning, we
heard about the process by which the council will have a duty to report
to the Parliament. I do not know how long the hon. Gentleman has been a
Member, but the whole purpose of having Secretaries of State report to
Parliament is to make the Executive accountable. There are a range of
ways in which to make the Executive accountable: the discussion we are
having in this Public Bill Committee, for example, or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>through parliamentary questions, or&#151;my toes begin to
tingle&#151;through the Select Committee process. We can argue about
whether those processes are as effective as they should be, but that is
another matter. The whole purpose of coming through the Secretary of
Stateis to ensure the accountability of the Executive to
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="070417104000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 7, I agree that it is important for the new council to
undertake a work programme that has been subject to public scrutiny and
consultation. However, the amendment would affect council&#146;s
flexibility and ability to respond to unforeseen changes in priorities
that may only come to light after the forward work programme has been
published, by requiring it to stick rigidly to the programme. We
discussed that matter in more detail earlier and we need not add more
to it, or to the discussion on the issue of the council being required
to produce an annual forward work programme. The important thing is the
matter of unforeseen issues. Hon. Members have spoken about the
capacity of the NCC to intervene and to advocate and represent the
interests of consumers in a fast-changing market place.</div>
					<a name="070417104000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 8 would
similarly place a duty on the new council to use its resources in the
most efficient and economic way. I reassure Committee members that we
expect the new council to use its resources as efficiently and as
economically as possible&#151;the Government will be responsible for
a share of its funding. We went into the detail of how the process of
the forward work programme would work when we discussed amendment No.
6. The only thing that I would add is that there will be, as there
usually is, a chief accounting officer. Normally that would
bethe chief executive but that would be up to the organisation
to establish. The chief accounting officer will have clear
responsibilities to ensure that that is the case. The amendment places
an onerous burden on the council to demonstrate compliance as stated by
the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford. However, having worded the
amendment in the way that he did, he made a sensible and very fair
point. It is critical that anybody who is funded from the public purse
or receives funds in the way that this body will, from the public purse
and from industry sources, uses those funds transparently and
effectively.</div>
				
					
					<a name="070417104000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="070417104000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will make an
assumption here if I may. Anyone who is appointed senior executive has
responsibility for those processes. Part of their contract will be to
ensure that they operate the organisation financially effectively and
evince the normal standards that one would expect of accountancy and
transparency of accountancy. I hope that that reassures the Committee
that the accounting officer will ensure that all funds are used
economically. Furthermore, the National Audit Office will be able to
review the efficiency with which the council uses its resources to
ensure that the requirements are being met. Of course, those reports
are made public and a Select Committee can call them into account along
with the organisations mentioned.</div>
					<a name="070417104000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 21 would remove
the existing provision for the council to judge how best to contribute
to the achievement of sustainable development. The hon. Member for
Richmond Park 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>very kindly reminded the Committee that that issue was raised by our
colleagues in the other place. We brought forward an amendment that I
believe meets her
requirements.</div>
					<a name="070417104000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
objective of the new council as drafted will ensure that it exercises
its functions in a manner thatit considers is best calculated
to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. The term
&#147;functions&#148; is defined in clause 41 as including powers
and, importantly, duties. In developing policies and in discharging its
duties, the council is already required to act in a manner that it
considers is best calculated to contribute to the achievement of
sustainable development. That could be in relation to fuel policy,
energy efficiency, issues that come up in future energy White Papers
and subsequent legislation.</div>
					<a name="070417104000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, DEFRA&#146;s
proposal for legislation on sustainable development that is coming
before the House in the coming session. Those will all impact on the
work of the NCC. As the years go by, there will be other issues because
we are coming to a common approach across parties on sustainability and
sustainable development. There will be nuances and, in some areas,
there may even be a difference of opinion. However, there is one area
in which there is no difference of opinion. Policy makers, bodies that
are required to carry out decisions of Parliament, and bodies acting on
behalf of consumers or in conjunction with regulators will all have a
requirement and duty to ensure that the consumer interest is served
effectively.</div>
					<a name="070417104000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford was absolutely right about the
NCC&#146;s work. There is no intention of throwing away any work that
is going on now when the new body is created. There will be a transfer
of the ongoing work and activities that willbe incorporated
into its work programme. The work that is being done by the various
organisations on sustainability will go on, but in a more co-ordinated
and more effective fashion. Therefore, there is much more to be said
and done on the matter. Perhaps before the end of the session, we will
have a full debateagain on the issue. There is a common
agreement here that the NCC must be a significant major
playeron sustainable development when it comes to implementing
policies and programmes to help the consumer to make good choices and
decisions. The products consumers purchase for sustainability should be
effective, and the processes used by the various organisations to
provide goods and services to them should be taken into account when it
comes to making policies on sustainable development.</div>
					<a name="070417104000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The objective as drafted
follows the precedent of section 35(1) of the Water Act 2003 which
inserted a new section 27A(12) into the Water Industry Act 1991, which
placed an equivalent sustainable development duty on the Consumer
Council for Water.</div>
					<a name="070417104000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make that point not just about the change we madein the House
of Lords, but remembering that inthe future&#151;in 2008,
after consultation&#151;Ofwat will compact the process. We are
thinking ahead and pre-planning to ensure that any additional
activities that come into the NCC have got an ethos of
sustainability.</div>
					<a name="070417104000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 14 is not clear. It would appear to permit the new council to
include an account of how efficiently it has used its resources when
undertaking an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>investigation into a consumer matter or into a problem affecting
consumers&#151;generally or of a particular description&#151;under
its power in clause 11(1)(b). Clause 6(6) already places the
duty on the new council to have regard for using its resources most
efficiently and effectively. We have now done all aspects of the
financial management almost to death. I do not say that in a critical
way, because it is important for sending out signals to anybody who
runs the new organisation about our expectations of value for money and
effectively utilising public
resources.</div>
					<a name="070417104000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
clause 7 provides for the preparation of an annual report on the
council&#146;s activities for each financial year, which the council
must publish. In addition, it is routine practice for bodies such as
the new council to be set performance targets in the course of
discussions over the budget. Achievement against those targets is
monitored by the sponsoring Department. The accounts of the new council
willbe certified and reported, as in paragraph 32 of schedule
1, clarified by this morning&#146;s
amendments.</div>
					<a name="070417104000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that, with those explanations, the hon. Ladies and Gentlemen will now
be prepared, first, to withdraw their amendments and, second, to give
me the benefit of the doubt for the further discussions that we will
have on vulnerability and sustainability later in the
Bill.</div>

He secured a helpful and informed contribution&#151;as we would

subject and I will do my best to return to the essence of the issue.
The debate has been useful. We have touched on questions of ethos and
on the new organisation&#146;s independence, accountability and
indeed sustainability. I am encouraged by many of the points made by
the Minister in response to my probing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>
						amendments, particularly on the issue of independence.
He very clearly set out the independent route that will be important
for the consumer council to adopt and to have at the heart of its
purpose.</div>

amendments&#151;on accountability and efficiency&#151;I was
encouraged by the clear statement from the Minister on the wish to see
the work implemented. That is very important, and we have that on the
record. With reference to amendment No. 14, I entirely agree on the
issue of the National Audit Office being able to participate in
ensuring that the new organisation is efficient and uses its resources
effectively. His clear statement on that is most
encouraging.</div>

not to lose the focus that it has been building on sustainable
development, which will be an inherent part of where it goes in the
future. He spent a lot of time talking about the issues of
vulnerability and disadvantage, but we see that there are relevant
places further on in discussion of the Bill where they will need to be
raised again. We will look forward to hearing once again what really is

						</b> Sorry for any confusion, Mr. Weir. It is
a bit of a two-handed job for Liberal Democrat Members. I hope that
other hon. Members will not think of an appropriate epithet for us. As
long as it is not Thelma and Louise, I really do not mind.</div>
					<a name="070417104000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 44 represents
the essence of what we wish to convey. We want to replace
&#147;may&#148; with &#147;shall&#148;. A great deal was made
of this in another place and by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond
Park on Second Reading. I do not need to labour this as the point has
been made on a number of occasions. We are not just trying to split
semantic hairs here. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>are concerned that these basic functions should have to be fulfilled.
Saying &#147;may&#148; makes it optional, but saying
&#147;shall&#148; means that it will be
done.</div>
					<a name="070417104000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">What underlies
our insistence that we should like to see this is the cost-cutting
options that may be involved if we adopt &#147;may&#148; rather
than &#147;shall&#148;. The body could choose to sit on its hands
and do nothing and that is the last thing that we would wish to see. I
am sure that the Minister would agree that we have nothing to worry
about in that respect but in that case I should be grateful if he
accepted that the stronger word &#147;shall&#148; should be
adopted.</div>
					<a name="070417104000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 45 and 46 insert the word &#147;appropriate&#148; and give
leeway for common sense. Because we have moved from &#147;may&#148;
to &#147;shall&#148; an adjustment is needed for reasonableness. If
the Government find our drafting clumsy, we would be more than happy to
accept any of their consequential amendments if they are prepared to
accept amendment No. 44.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Ben Wallace</b> (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con): I just want to
pick up on the earlier point made by the right hon. Member for
Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill about the very ethos of the consumer
council and where we go with it. I am a believer in
transparencyin government. My one concern here is that in
subsection (2) the council will decide who should see its
representations or its information. It is a consumer body to represent
us, often against business or unfair practices by other
authorities.</div>
				
					
					<a name="070417104000372"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15pm</div>
					<a name="070417104000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that it is not left to the council to decide under
subsection (2)(f) who</div>
					<a name="070417104000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;might have an interest in the
matter in question.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to make that decision and I think many consumers would. It
would be a good step forward if the Government considered, perhaps
before Third reading, whether there is any way in which they can
increase transparency. If we are to have faith in the system&#151;I
notice that it involves many Ministers&#151;why can we not have
access and decide more about where things
go?</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000440"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> I entirely concur with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
support for transparency in Government, which is normally a
characteristic of Opposition politicians rather than members of the
Government. Is he asking for a long stop whereby politicians are
involved at the entry point, or is he saying that we should define
every interested party? Surely the logic of his suggestion is that we
have a massive list of people who fall within the ambit of interested
parties, because ultimately anyone could be interested. Should there
not be some mechanism by which the new NCC, acting in good faith, can
define its terms and, if it fails to do so, will have the sanction of
our
opprobrium?</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000441"></a>Mr.
Wallace:
						</b> We should look across the channelat some
of the German lander where there is transparency throughout and
complete openness. There is no presumption that anyone must decide. The
council can put the report in a package, stamp it and decide who to
send it to, but everything should be open 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>
						for deliberation and for us to look at. Of course,
confidentiality of complaints would have to be protected, but the
council could just publish recommendations or put them on the website
so that we can look and see what is going on. I do not see any reason
why that cannot be the case, other than perhaps for the investigative
part, which includes sensitive issues. That should be the start point,
and reasons should be given for rolling back from that start point.
That is the ethos of where the council should be. It is supposed to be
the champion for the people, so transparency is a good principle for it
to embrace.</div>
					<a name="070417104000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the main thrust that I wanted to make in my contribution. The only
other clarity that I want from the Minister is about the persons in
subsection (2) who can receive representations. It
states:</div>
					<a name="070417104000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any Minister of
the Crown or government
department&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why are the
words &#147;or government department&#148; included when they are
not included with Scottish and Welsh Ministers? This is a technical
query, because I presume that every &#147;government
department&#148; has a Minister of the Crown at its head, but I am
sure that I shall be
corrected.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000442"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I thank the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely
Burt) for the way in which she moved her amendment, and I thank my hon.
Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) for his incisive
probing of the Conservatives&#146; position. I also thank the hon.
Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) for his
comments, and hope that I can respond to
them.</div>
					<a name="070417104000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clear
intention behind amendment No. 44 isthat the council should be
required to fulfil its representative functions provided by the Bill. I
am happy to make it absolutely clear to the Committee that we have
given the new council three statutory core functions, which are set out
in the Bill. It cannot sit on its hands and do nothing, because it will
have a legal requirement.</div>
					<a name="070417104000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, its representative
function is critical. The other two are research and information. The
representative function is advocacy. The research function is
influencing future policy and direction not just inthe
marketplace, but in public policy areas. The information function,
which we discussed during our previous debate, is critical and gives
people not just rights, but the capacity to exercise those rights.
Information is critical for consumers in the sort of marketplace that
we now operate in, and consumers need to be able to make a valued
judgment. The only way to do that is to have the knowledge to make that
judgment, and if something goes wrong when it has been exercised
effectively and fairly, to have the additional knowledge of who to seek
out in the system to obtain redress when goods or services have been
sold inappropriately or not on the basis of a legal requirement on the
body or organisation that is selling the goods or
services.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000443"></a>Lorely
Burt:
						</b> The Minister talks about core responsibilities and
functions. The same terminology, &#147;may&#148;, is used in
respect of the research and information functions. I understand his
saying that
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>
						this is so hugely a core function, but there is
still no requirement to comply. My understanding of the wording is that
the council might decide not to implement this function, so what in the
word &#147;may&#148; enables or requires it to fulfil those
functions.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000444"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I was getting to the point that the hon. Lady
made. First, let us agree that these are statutory functions, and as
such there is the interlinkof the independence to carry out
those functions. Secondly, the reason why there is discretion to
exercise the functions and why we do not compel the bodies to discharge
them is not a get-out clause; this is about ensuring that they have the
capacity within their resources and work programme to be able to deal
with these functions as they see fit.</div>
					<a name="070417104000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, the reason why
the council may provide advice about the consumer matters under the
clause is because it must decide first on which consumer matters it
should provide advice and to whom. That is very important. That is why
it is given discretion to determine the type of advice and to whom it
should be given. The exercise of these functions flows from the
decisions of the council and the priorities identified in its forward
work programme.</div>
					<a name="070417104000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that forward work
programme is accountable, because it is a public consultation process.
So, this is about the substance of the council&#146;s activities.
Thereis a statutory opt-in, as well as transparency and
accountability to the work programme. That is the right approach,
because Parliament is establishing this body on the basis of giving it
the responsibility of acting on behalf of the consumers in an effective
way. For example, it may well be that an additional resource will be
required for an information campaign. Why should the body not be able
to make a decision when that is a priority and part of its work
programme? Should it say, &#147;We can&#146;t make that a priority
because we have to spend 33 and a third per cent. on all of the issues
on that basis. Were we not to do so, it wouldlook like we are
not carrying out our obligations effectively&#148;? Such a situation
would be nonsense, because an organisation cannot operate effectively
in that way.</div>
					<a name="070417104000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that organisations are given the maximum potential for making
those decisions. We should remember that when they make those decisions
they are accountable in the annual report, in the programme and in the
carrying out of that programme. It is important that we do not view
these clauses in isolation, because each adds something to the creation
of the new, stronger consumer advocacy body and they all fit together,
piece by piece, to complete the picture. We have set out the core
functions of the council, and the provisions in clause 5 set out the
need for the body to determine its priorities, including how these
functions will be exercised. That is important because of what I said
just a moment ago.</div>
					<a name="070417104000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new council will be a
stronger consumer champion and will have the benefit of significant
expertise in representing the consumer interest at its disposal. We
shall surely be in a better position than we are today to determine how
its functions might best be exercised to the benefit of consumers. I
cannot accept the amendment because it is right that the new body 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>
						should have the flexibility to be able to make
decisions on what actions are appropriate in the interests of
consumers.</div>
					<a name="070417104000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
essence of amendments Nos. 45 and 46 isabout ensuring that the
new body, in conductingits representative function, represents
the views of consumers on consumer matters to the appropriate bodies. I
again confirm that that is our intention. Although I do not accept
amendment No. 44, the sentiments behind it are exactly those behind
what the body will carry out in practice. On amendment No. 45, I give a
commitment that the intention behind the clause is as I have
mentioned.</div>
					<a name="070417104000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we
are able to identify specifically some of the people who might be
involved, such as a &#147;Minister of the Crown&#148; or a
&#147;government department&#148;, a Scottish Minister or a Welsh
Minister, it is necessary to allow the new council the flexibility to
work with others as it considers what is most suitable at the time.
That goes to the heart of independence, does it not? We cannot give
independence and then say, &#147;This independence can be exercised
only through the Crown. You can&#146;t possibility do this unless you
go through the Minister.&#148; That goes to the point made by the
hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. The new NCC does not have to go
through the prism of either a Government Department or a Minister of
the Crown; that was the point of the previous amendments. It can go
direct, of its own volition or on behalf of a constituent.</div>
					<a name="070417104000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause specifies a
Minister of the Crown or a Government Department because the
Departments with responsibility for bodies that provide goods and
services have opinions. For example, if there were a future EU
directive similar to this legislation, each Department would have a
view on it and would be entitled to express it. It would be entirely
wrong if the NCC could not&#151;independently of the Department of
Trade and Industry&#151;discuss with those Departments its view on
consumer interests. This is about independence, and that means setting
out what that independence means in practice in all circumstances. I
hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that that is what the
discretion is about&#151;it allows the NCC the right to work with
whomever it wishes to work with. That might mean that it goes direct to
the Liberal Democrats, Scottish Nationalists or another political
party, or to an advocacy organisation or non-governmental
organisation.</div>
					<a name="070417104000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, there are many organisations that are active in the field of
sustainable development and hundreds at national, regional and local
level working on behalf of people with disabilities. It should not be
for the Secretary of State to determine which of them the NCC should
engage with. That would curtail its independence. It is important for
its advocacy role that it should have absolute latitude to determine
who its partners are. I hope that my explanations have helped the hon.
Members for Solihull and for Lancaster and Wyre to accept that the
Government&#146;s intentions are completely honourable. We want to
give the council maximum opportunity to operate
effectively, independent of Ministers and the Department where
appropriate.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000445"></a>Mr.
Wallace:
						</b> I want to test the Minister slightly more on the
matter of Departments. I am not talking about the Secretary of State
directing where the council should go. Let us say that we are
considering the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>
						impact of an EU directive, or an allegation about a
Department that provides a service but is acting against the consumer.
It is important that the council should have the right to go to that
Department, but surely it should go through the Minister of that
Department, because that would oblige that Minister to take
responsibility. If it is pointed out to a Minister that his or her
Department is acting against the consumer, but nothing happens, we in
this place have a right to ask that Minister, &#147;Why did you do
nothing about it?&#148; Why does subsection (2)(a) need to
say</div>
					<a name="070417104000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any Minister of the
Crown or government
department&#148;?</div>
					<a name="070417104000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is the
&#147;or government department&#148; added on? Can it not be just
that it has to go to any appropriate Minister of the
Crown?</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000446"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> This is a function of Government. On some
occasions, the council will require direct access to the Secretary of
State for a specific reason. On others, as part of a consultation
process, it will ask for something to be prepared on behalf of the
Department for Ministers to review, or will want their opinion consumer
issues. That is how it is done. If it were not done that way,
Government would grind to a halt. Every day, hundreds of legitimate
representations are made to Departments across Whitehall by
organisations that have a relationship with
Government, seeking information or consulting on the development of
policy or its implementation. That is reflected here. It is not unique.
It happens on all
occasions.</div>
					<a name="070417104000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to
Scottish and Welsh Ministers, the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre
was a Member of the Scottish Parliament, so he knows how that works
better than I do. The issue is accountability, and the capacity of the
NCC to determine for itself whether it sees fit in the first instance
to approach a Department or a Minister of the Crown. It should be able
to make that choice.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="070417104000447"></a>Lorely
Burt:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the time and
trouble that he has taken to give a full and moving explanation as to
how he feels that the clause will work. I have no doubt about his
intentions to make it work in the way that all Committee members want
it to. I have a tinge of anxiety due to the wording, but I shall not

						</b> I understand that any Department&#146;s
response is made in the name of the Minister of the Crown. There is no
third party or lack of liability. Any response, by the lowliest civil
servant or the most senior, is made in the name of the Crown. To say
that putting &#147;Ministers of the Crown&#148; would delay that
process is not logical, because every day questions are put by civil
servants to each other in the name of the Minister of the Crown. If I
were to say, &#147;The National Consumer Council went not to a
Minister, but just to the Ministry of Defence&#148;, the defence from
that ministry would be that no one was in charge; the matter just went
to the MOD. Surely, we do not need to say &#147;or government
department&#148;, just &#147;Minister of the Crown&#148;. That is
the accountability trail. I do not understand why that would delay
things. How many things happen every day that do not go via the
Minister at all, although we know that they are done in the name of the
Minister of the Crown?</div>

Prisk:
						</b> I should like to deal with the two amendments
together and with the arguments at the heart of each of them. The
amendments seek to ensure that the new National Consumer Council
provides the essential information about its activities and functions
to all consumers. We debated earlier the need for openness and the
vital function of that transparency if the National Consumer Council is
to establish itself as a genuine voice and an advocate, as the Minister
put it, for
consumers.</div>
					<a name="070417104000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, the clause merely suggests that the Secretary of State
may</div>
					<a name="070417104000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;facilitate the
dissemination...of advice and
information&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
well-meaning phrase, but it feels rather generalised and undirected,
could be open to interpretation and will fall short of how I suspect
most consumers would expect that new body to function. There is also a
danger that, unless there is a clear prescriptive intention, the
council and its various component parts&#151;we learned earlier that
many of the council&#146;s functions will be delegated down through
its territorial and other committees&#151;might not ensure that many
key consumer issues are
disseminated.</div>
					<a name="070417104000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns
also extend to the dissemination of information about the council and
its functions. As I have argued elsewhere, it is vital that not only is
the council open in its functions and operation, but is seen to be
open. The Minister has been positive in respect of similar amendments,
so I should be interested to hear whether he accepts my points and
whether, in doing so, he can provide some
assurance.</div>

amendment No. 44. To be fair to the Liberal Democrats and
Conservatives, they have both tabled 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>similar amendments in the Lords during general debate and on Report. I
apologise to the Committee if some of the things that I say are similar
to what has been said, but I must be consistent in my response to do
justice to the amendment.</div>
					<a name="070417104000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we made clear during
discussion on amendment No. 44, the new council has been given three
statutory core functions, and the amendment relates to the information
function. We have a clear expectation that the council will make use of
all three functions effectively and transparently. However, the
amendment again raises the question of whether we should or will
attempt to require the council to undertake all the functions at the
same time, or set out its core functions and leave the new body to
determine how and when they are exercised according to priority and
need and in accordance with its forward work
programme.</div>

Member for Hertford and Stortford raised a fair point, not just
intellectually but in practical terms. If we give the council three
statutory core functions, what certainty and bottom line will there be?
Will it be clear what the three functions are and how they operate?
Will someone looking at the work programme be able to say, &#147;Yes,
this body is taking seriously all aspects of its functions&#148;?
Attached to those functions are two other things: financial resource
and human resource. The council must have the capacity to put all three
things together transparently.</div>
					<a name="070417104000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point should not be taken
in isolation but with all the discussions that we have had on other
clauses. They should be pieced together to get the picture. There will
be a statutory function, a consultation process for the work programme
and consultation and transparency about financial resources and which
parts fall to Government and to other appropriate bodies. For those
parts that fall to other appropriate bodies, to ensure transparency in
the system, those bodies must say how and how effectively those
resources are spent, and what their capacity is to meet the budget. The
other locks are not just the annual report but the report on how the
NCC is carrying out its work programme and its capacity to make
determinations when the programme needs to change to meet
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="070417104000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have chosen the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second option. We cannot compel
the council to discharge the core functions, because the functions do
not stand by themselves. We cannot say that the council shall or must
provide advice and information without saying to whom and about what it
must provide it. The council must make that choice. It goes back in the
end to the matter of independence, but independence does not mean an
excuse to do nothing, or to turn a blind eye to a blatant injustice for
the consumer in the marketplace.
</div>
					<a name="070417104000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no doubts
whatever about how we are establishing the NCC. It will bring together
the redress schemes and the panoply of other measures in the Bill. The
NCC&#146;s whole sense of direction when established will be that of
an advocate, with a strong ethos of acting in the consumer&#146;s
interest. I am certain that in all circumstances, it will give the
consumer the benefit of the doubt on the issues brought before it,
whether policy issues or individual or collective complaints needing
redress. It is therefore important that we give the council the
opportunity to do so, which is why we have chosen this
option.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>
					<a name="070417104000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 11, what we
are trying to achieve is the creation of a strong body that can
influence and bring about change for the better on consumers&#146;
behalf. We are giving it the right to advocate for individuals or
collective groups of consumers where something goes wrong, but we also
want to give it as a preventive strategy the ability to influence
policy outcomes to ensure that the marketplace operates effectively on
the consumer&#146;s behalf, and that those who provide goods and
services have an ethos and a way of managing their business that
protects the consumer&#146;s interests and not just those of their
own organisation. It is important that we provide the opportunity to
act on behalf of consumers. To achieve that, there will be certain
functions and circumstances in relation to which an autonomous approach
can be taken. An example is the new council&#146;s powers under
clause 17 to prepare and
publish</div>
					<a name="070417104000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a report in
relation to any matter falling within the scope of its
functions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the new body also needs to be able to work with and through others. A
prime example involves the relationship to consumer education. That is
an area in which the Office of Fair Trading has a statutory function
under section 6 of the Enterprise Act 2002
to</div>
					<a name="070417104000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;publish educational
materials or carry out other educational
activities&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
to</div>
					<a name="070417104000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;support...such
activities or the provision by others of information or
advice.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new council would be expected to contribute to that process with a view
to advocating the consumer interest in the provision of education and
information by the OFT or other parties. That is very important. It is
an innovation. The council will have not only an influence over its own
role and remit, but a specific influence over the remit and role of
others who have a duty towards consumers. That is vital and is why we
have drafted the function as we have. It permits the council not only
to facilitate the dissemination of information and advice by others,
but to disseminate information itself. That is vital if the council is
to be out there and seen there, marching forward on behalf of
consumers. The ability is not just to put information out itself, but
to ensure that others do so as well. That is
innovation.</div>
					<a name="070417104000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 11 would remove the ability of the new council to operate in this
fashion, which is why I will resist it. I assume that it will not be
accepted. I assume that it was tabled to enable me to give the
Committee assurances about what the clause means and the role that we
expect the NCC to play in operating the clause in a practical way on
behalf of
consumers.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000455"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> The Minister and I share a view that this debate is
about practicalities as much as it is any form of discussion as to the
intellectual essence of what the organisation should be. Clearly, in a
legislative process, one challenge is how we ensure that what is
written in the Bill is put into practice. As the Minister correctly
articulated, that is the purpose of these probing
amendments.</div>
					<a name="070417104000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had not
considered this before the debate&#151;we all learn something every
day&#151;but I accept that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>collaborative approach would be restrained by amendment No. 11. Clearly,
that was not its purpose, so I think that the Minister has raised a
very good point. There is a strong argument for the council to be able
to work in partnership. We see that later in the Bill. It is an
important ethos, not least given the increased complexity of issues in
the consumer field. Therefore, the Minister has raised an important
issue.</div>
					<a name="070417104000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
essential point, which I wanted to draw from the Minister and which I
am glad he has put on the record, is the key word
&#147;expectation&#148;. It is the expectation of the Government
that the council will ensure that the functions set out in the Bill are
implemented. That is the critical part of the process. I am delighted
to hear that put on the record and I am therefore only too pleased to
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="070417104000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
reasonably straightforward. Its purpose is to seek from the Minister
the rationale behind the criteria chosen, rather than necessarily to
remove any criteria from being chosen. I have a further point related
to that. Will a &#147;novel issue&#148;, which is the term
highlighted in the clause, have to be entirely new? One thought that
occurred to me was whether, if an issue arose in Scotland and then a
similar issue arose in Hertfordshire, it would be determined to be
novel, not least given the fact that the two locations have different
legal systems. Will the Minister clarify exactly what he means by
&#147;novel&#148; and what its limits would
be?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000457"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I will try to give the hon. Gentleman a
rational explanation of what we are attempting to achieve with the
clause. I accept from the outset that it is a probing amendment, and I
hope to give a response to it and to provide the Committee with
information that will be helpful in relation to the
clause.</div>
					<a name="070417104000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 11
will provide the new council with general powers of investigation, and
subsection (1)(a) will permit the council to investigate</div>
					<a name="070417104000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a complaint made by or on behalf
of a consumer which appears to the Council to raise one or more issues
of general relevance&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
consumer could make a specific complaint on their own behalf and a
wider issue could be raised by a general complaint. We need the
capacity to deal with wider issues, while dealing with specific issues
raised by the individual consumer. In other words, a distinction will
be drawn between the investigation of a complaint that may be relevant
to consumers generally and an individual complaint. The new council
will not have a role in the investigation of individual complaints,
other than those made by vulnerable consumers in the designated
sectors.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>
					<a name="070417104000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will provide new and
better ways to handle individual complaints and introduce new
complaints handling standards, which will be set by the regulators in
energy and postal services. It will provide a new redress scheme to
determine issues that cannot be resolved by a consumer&#146;s
supplier.</div>
					<a name="070417104000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On general
complaints, subsection (2) empowers the new council to investigate
complaints that involve novel issues that affect a group of consumers
or consumers generally, or that may have an important effect on a group
of consumers or consumers generally. The hon. Gentleman asked what a
novel issue will be, and my practical explanation is that, as I said at
the outset, it is an issue that is raised in a way that has wider
implications for consumers&#146; rights in the marketplace.
Therefore, a judgment will be made ina particular instance
about what would affect such
changes.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000458"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> I wish to ask for clarification on a point. As the
Minister takes us through this helpful discussion of the general powers
of investigation, he will be conscious that people&#146;s complaints
have been important in exposing general underlying problems, rather
than just an isolated problem. Information from complaints has not only
been important to the various watchdogs, but to the regulators. Given
the proposed change in structure, will the Minister discuss how the
information flow that he describes as complaints to or from the
National Consumer Council will also transfer, where relevant, to the
regulators for their
purposes?</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000459"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> In that respect, &#147;novel&#148; does
indeed mean new, but clause 11 will permit the new council to
investigate other issues as well. We are therefore providing the new
council with a wide scope, which I am sure that we all want to see, as
it will give the council direction when exercising its powers of
investigation.</div>
					<a name="070417104000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have heard the assertion that consumers will be stranded by the new
arrangements. In the discussions on planning for implementation, the
consumer bodies made it clear that they have no consistent means of
recording contacts, inquiries and complaints and that they have no
means of distinguishing the instances where consumers may be merely
referred to companies or elsewhere for assistance. Consequently,
consumer bodies have asked my Department to undertake a special project
to get to the bottom of that matter, and we have agreed to do so with
their assistance. That relates to one of the points made by the hon.
Member for Richmond Park about certainty of what the process involves
and about learning from the experiences of consumers, the issues that
they raise and how best to resolve
them.</div>
					<a name="070417104000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The project
consultants will first review the classification criteria across
bodies&#151;for example, contacts, inquiries, complaints, complex
complaints and complex inquiries. Secondly, they will identify a set of
comparable data between the bodies on volume and type of all contacts.
Thirdly, they will map how inquiries and complaints are handled.
Fourthly, they will develop recommendations for how designated
vulnerable consumers, as defined by the Bill, will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>identified across the bodies. Fifthly, they will apply any definition
developed to provide a cut of the current data relating to consumers
who might be identified as designated vulnerable consumers. It is
important to future debates that we can make decisions based on
evidence and in a way that is effective for consumers, particularly
vulnerable consumers.</div>
					<a name="070417104000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The project is currently under
way, and I hope that work will be complete by the end of April or the
beginning of May. I assure the hon. Members for Richmond Park and for
Hertford and Stortford that when work is complete, I will brief them on
the outcome. From my perspective, I want to provide certainty and an
assurance to all concerned in the implementation of the project that no
one will be left guessing about the direction that we are taking to set
up the new organisation. When it is established, the
organisation&#146;s introduction will be phased in, so that
everyone&#151;not just consumers, but those who have taken the time
to develop the proposal&#146;s structure&#151;can be certain about
it. I hope that that explanation helps hon.
Members.</div>
					<a name="070417104000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady&#146;s legitimate question referred to the implementation
strategy, which we will discuss in more detail during a later sitting,

matter.</div>

Kramer:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 47, in
clause 12, page 7, line 18, after
&#145;vulnerable&#146;, insert &#145;or otherwise
disadvantaged&#146;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause discusses the investigation of complaints made by vulnerable
designated consumers. The opening subsection
states:</div>
					<a name="070417104000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsection
(3) applies to a complaint which is made...by or on behalf of a
vulnerable person in that person&#146;s capacity as a designated
consumer&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would change the word &#147;vulnerable&#148; to &#147;vulnerable
or otherwise
disadvantaged&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have serious concerns about the subjectivity of the use of the word
&#147;vulnerable&#148; as a definition, as it is not a word that is
widely and commonly used and there is not a wide and common
understanding of it. There is an attempt to define it in subsection
(2), which
states:</div>
					<a name="070417104000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
this purpose a person is &#145;vulnerable&#146; if the Council is
satisfied that it is not reasonable to expect that person to pursue the
complaint on that person&#146;s own
behalf.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that is
an extremely subjective set of judgments. There is not a lot of history
to it and most people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>might very much disagree about whether they are part of that vulnerable
community. Honest people and those of integrity and judgment could
disagree about whether they fell into that category.</div>
					<a name="070417104000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We therefore propose not the
removal of the word &#147;vulnerable&#148; but the addition of the
word &#147;disadvantaged&#148;, about which there is a much broader
sense of understanding. People on low incomes, older people and those
with a range of disabilities would understand themselves to fall within
the disadvantaged category. I feel that &#147;vulnerable&#148; is a
fairly insulting notion, because it suggests that someone is short on
the ability to understand or to be capable, when it might simply be
that they find it difficult to exercise their rights, which can
certainly be true.</div>
					<a name="070417104000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to ensure that the category includes the people whom we recognise
more typically as disadvantaged. We discussed a proposal, tabled by the
right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, that had a
much fuller listing of groups that I would have called vulnerable or
disadvantaged, but which have disappeared from the set of definitions
in the clause. I should be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s
comments on the issue and to have at least some reassurance that the
intent of the clause and its language is to cover the group that we
would consider to be disadvantaged, not to provide the opportunity for
a very much narrower set of definitions, which is how I fear some will
interpret the
clause.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000462"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> What I shall say about the amendment is in
addition to what I said in previous discussions and to what I will say
in other discussions that we will have on the matter. I accept what the
hon. Lady said about language. It is indeed of critical importance, but
the amendment would not produce more appropriate language than is in
the Bill, and I shall explain why. In the end, it is down to what we
are trying to achieve in practical terms and, importantly, for
whom.</div>
					<a name="070417104000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some examples
are provided in the explanatory notes, but even those examples
represent a huge, diverse community of people who, for different
reasons, will require the support of advocacy bodies. In addition, the
organisations that provide postal, water, gas and electricity services,
whether supply or distribution, will be required to make changes to
their complaints processes to ensure that they can deal effectively
with the issues raised by vulnerable consumers. They must be
accountable.</div>
					<a name="070417104000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that what I say will reassure the hon. Lady. I want to give an example
of the activities that are now taking place because of campaigning by
the NCCand other organisations that represent a range of
consumers who have not special needs, but needs that require
appropriate responses and resources to ensure that there are effective
opportunities to resolve the issues that affect them in the provision
of goods or services. I hope that I am able, through my remarks, to
build further confidence in what we want to achieve through the NCC and
by encouraging and building on cultural and organisational change in
the organisations that provide the goods and
services.</div>
					<a name="070417104000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any list of
specific examples of vulnerability carries a high risk of leaving out a
group of consumers who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>could be provided with much-needed assistance by the new council.
Instead, the Bill leaves it to the new council&#146;s discretion to
assist consumers who are in need of assistance. The addition of the
words &#147;or otherwise disadvantaged&#148; simply would not add
anything worth while to the meaning of the
provision.</div>
					<a name="070417104000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
12(2) provides that, for the purposes of the clause, a person is
vulnerable</div>
					<a name="070417104000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if the
Council is satisfied that it is not reasonable to expect that person to
pursue the complaint on that person&#146;s own
behalf.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
vulnerability may be of a long-term or a short-term nature. For
example, grief can so overwhelm a person when a close relative dies
that they are incapable of dealing with aspects of their life,
including issues around gas, electricity, water, postage and so on.
They need help, too. I doubt that it would be possible to find a legal,
technical definition for what we are attempting to do by including
someone like that. The debilitating loss of a loved one and the
physical and emotional consequences affect hundreds and thousands of
people in Britain each
month.</div>
					<a name="070417104000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
people who end up during the course of a complaint with a disability
because of a trauma. There must be the ability between the opening up
of a complaint and the resolving of it to ensure that an individual
whose circumstances change is treated appropriately. That cannot be
expressed in legislation in the way that has been
suggested.</div>
					<a name="070417104000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
language is important. Wide discretion is not discretion to do nothing;
it is discretion to try to maximise the pool of opportunity for those
who need support and assistance for whatever reason, and it is
important that we view it in that way. The Bill does not go any further
in defining what &#147;vulnerable&#148; means, because there are
many ways in which consumers can be vulnerable. It will provide the
necessary flexibility for the council to examine cases with the
benefitof increasing understanding of what constitutes
vulnerability in any given
circumstance.</div>
				
					
					<a name="070417104000375"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="070417104000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to give
the hon. Lady an assurance. There is a challenge here, is there not?
Going back to my earlier remarks, the challenge is to ensure that we
have the knowledge base and the skill sets so that at the point of
contact, the individual concerned is dealt with with dignity, respect
and understanding of the issues in their life that will affect their
advocacy opportunities. That is why, for example, the Energy Retail
Association has a complaints charter, and we need to examine such good
practice and involve it in the new NCC. For example, the ERA has a
support strategy to try to ensure that no vulnerable customer is
disconnected from their energy supply, in accordance with ERA
guidelines. It is now trying to train staff specifically to handle
complaints and provide staff specifically trained to deal with
vulnerable customers, and senior managers are
empowered to resolved disputes on behalf of
vulnerable
customers.</div>
					<a name="070417104000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter
is not just about the role of the NCC. It goes back to another point
that I made earlier to my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge,
Chryston and Bellshill: it is about changing the structure and the way
in which companies operate in the relevant sectors, so that they
operate effectivelyon behalf of the consumer and recognise
their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>responsibility. The impact if they fail to do so will be that they end
up in a redress situation. I am certain that in those circumstances the
redress schemes will be effective. I cannot think of a company that
wants to spend its time getting a bad name because of how it deals with
consumers and seeing tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds a month
leaving its coffers because it acts inappropriately towards
disadvantaged consumers. There is a big emphasis on their
gettingit right&#151;prevention as part of the cure. It is
also important that there is a process for learning from mistakes and
sharing best practice.</div>
					<a name="070417104000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must improve the skill mix
and capacity for the system to work effectively, and I give the hon.
Lady the assurance that part of the process of implementation will be
about that, to ensure that the commitments given in the clause can be
implemented practically in people&#146;s day-to-day experiences. I
believe that that is what the hon. Lady is on about&#151;giving
certainty to consumers&#146; day-to-day experiences when they have an
interface with the NCC, the companies concerned and the redress scheme.
That is important, and I accept what she says. I hope that, with those
assurances, she will be able to accept what I am
saying.</div>
					<a name="070417104000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
47 would add to the word &#147;vulnerable&#148; the words
&#147;or otherwise disadvantaged&#148;. Again, that is not
necessary. As I said, any list of examples of vulnerability carries the
risk of leaving out a particular individual or group of
consumers.</div>
					<a name="070417104000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the hon. Lady accepts that I have genuinely tried to set out the
ethos of what we want to do; the challenges that we face in doing it;
the training and improvement that we need in the skill mix so that the
NCC can act as advocate, and the role that companies need to play by
changing. Some have to change dramatically, and I have no doubt that
the redress schemes will change the landscape dramatically. It will no
longer be a matter of shrugging one&#146;s shoulders and saying,
&#147;Well, we&#146;ll get to that complaint. Sorry, it
won&#146;t happen again.&#148; There will be an obligation on all
in the system to make it operate effectively and to ensure that for
anyone who has a disadvantage, for whatever reason, we have the
ability, skills and ethos in the organisation to deal effectively with
their issues.</div>
					<a name="070417104000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn
to a final point that I believe is important to the hon. Lady and is
also important to me as a Minister. It is inevitable when a new
organisation is established that there will be a problem with working
it in and getting it established, up and working. No organisation has
ever been created and from day one operated at 100 per cent.
effectiveness. I do not wish to make an excuse in advance, and the
implementation strategy is to make the organisation as effective as we
can from day one. It is therefore important in the process of
implementing the strategy that we havethe capacity to consider
thoroughly how to ensure that the commitments given in the clause work
effectively. The experience that the clause is intended to create is an
effective one on behalf of those with a disadvantage.</div>
					<a name="070417104000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I will be happy during
the implementation stage after the Bill has become an Act to be as
transparent and open as I can. I give another commitment that the new
body will consult not only Ministers but those who represent people out
in the community who have specific needs. It is important to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>build such partnerships. There are skills and knowledge out there that
need to be utilised and developed.</div>
					<a name="070417104000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">In giving that assurance, I
return to another point, which will be my final one. We are not only
giving it a duty to provide information but a research duty, and part
of that research must surely be for the organisation, in representing
consumers, to be able to look to whether or where improvements can take
place in a quite transparent, honest and effective way. This is one
area that, if Members do not mind me saying so, is like building the
Forth road bridge. Once we start the process of change then, on a
step-by-step and ongoing basis, we will see the ability to right the
wrongs that have gone on for many years in the public and private
sectors&#151;a failure to provide proper advocacy and other services
for disadvantaged individuals and groups. When something goes wrong, it
is always those who are disadvantaged that end up the poorer, whether
it is a public service, or a service provided by the private sector for
the public one, or a private sector provider of goods and services who
does not do it appropriately.</div>
					<a name="070417104000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an important area,
which we will build on. There will be an ongoing process of learning
and improvement for the organisation and the role that it plays next
year, the year after and the one after again, in effecting services on
the part of people who are disadvantaged. I hope that my comments will
reassure the hon. Lady, at least to the point that we are in the same
game and want to achieve the same objectives so that, in a practical
way, the experiences that disadvantaged people have had in the past
will not be repeated in future.</div>

							<a name="070417104000463"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> I appreciate the robust definitions that the
Minister has given of people who should perhaps fall within this
vulnerable category, and who could look for support and help from the
National Consumer Council. I will give way by withdrawing the
amendment, but in terms of the underlying sentiment the Minister should
be aware of some of the difficulties around the language.</div>
					<a name="070417104000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give an example; I have
a constituent with a severe speech impediment, and when he attempts to
contact me on the phone, it is a long and difficult process to
understand what he is telling me. I am sure that he would be considered
&#147;vulnerable&#148; in the eyes of this definition. If we were
to look into his face and tell him that he was vulnerable, he would be
utterly insulted. He would regard himself as disadvantaged by society,
but would not see himself as falling into that category of helplessness
that one calls &#147;vulnerable&#148;. That is a point frequently
missed in the kinds of language and definitions that we use, so I feel
strongly that it would be wise to look at this again.</div>
					<a name="070417104000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I fully accept what
the Minister says&#151;that this is in a process in motion, as it
were, and that change will come over a period of time. He has provided
some extensive reassurances that the use of &#147;vulnerable&#148;
is not an attempt to narrow but to broaden. I therefore beg leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>
					<a name="070417104000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">This amendment may seem among
the tiniest that could be found, but it is a crucial one. We are
looking now at subsection 3 of clause 12, which reads,</div>
					<a name="070417104000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where a complaint to
which this subsection applies is referred to the Council by or on
behalf of the designated consumer, the Council may investigate the
complaint for the purpose of determining whether it is appropriate to
take any action under subsection
(4)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We feel strongly
that of all the places where &#147;may&#148; is
inappropriate&#151;and where &#147;shall&#148; should be
inserted&#151;this one is overwhelmingly important, because this is
about any requirement on the NCC to follow through and deal with
individual complaints from the kind of vulnerable consumers that we
have just discussed.</div>
					<a name="070417104000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier, when my hon. Friend
the Member for Solihull raised the issue of changing the word
&#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148;, when looking at the
various duties of the NCC, the Minister gave an extremely enlightening
reply that, regarding this clause, was exceedingly worrying. I do not
have it verbatim but he was saying, in effect, that it is necessary for
the NCC to have flexibility within its work programme function not to
carry out an activity perhaps to the fullest extent. There had to be
regard to the way that money was spent, and to funding.</div>
					<a name="070417104000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must say that, in this area,
where we are talking about vulnerable customers&#151;someone
identified under the definition as &#147;vulnerable&#148; and
therefore in need of support&#151;to turn around and say that there
is any possible scenario in which they cannot rely on the NCC to take
their case forward&#151;we are only talking about taking it forward
to the point of investigation, and we are not saying that the NCC must
carry this right the way through to get a resolution, because they are
not even required to give advice or whatever, just to determine whether
or not an investigation would be appropriate&#151;it seems to me that
there should be no possibility that a person could hear the word
&#147;no&#148; in that kind of instance.</div>
					<a name="070417104000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I say to the Minister that,
although I understand that he is concerned about independence, it seems
to me that there must be a necessary balance here. People who are
highly vulnerable need to know that the advocate is there for them, and
there for sure. Therefore, to put in a provision for the independent
council to decide that, in some cases, or in all cases, or in a
percentage of cases, or after a certain number of cases have been
reported in the year, or whatever else, that it need not exercise this
particular set of roles is exceedingly worrying.</div>
					<a name="070417104000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am responding to the
comments that the Minister made, that flexibility is required; here is
a case where flexibility should not be required. I ask the Minister to
reconsider in this instance, and to recognise, by character, that it is
different from the other instances where we have raised what sounds
like a similar issue, but this issue, by all measures, is far more
important.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000465"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> An advocacy organisation is best judged by its
effectiveness, by the decisions that it makes at the outset, when it
receives a complaint, as to the appropriate place where that complaint
should be taken, and who has the responsibility to take it to that
point and ensure that the complaint is dealt with in a relevant
way.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>
					<a name="070417104000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I think that the
amendment is not particularly helpful for consumers in general and
vulnerable consumers in particular. That is because there will be
occasions when the complaint is not best dealt with by the NCC, but by
someone else, because it is their responsibility. What the clause seeks
to do is to ensure that, whatever access the consumer makes, at that
access point someone takes responsibility to assist them and not simply
say: &#147;Not ours, Guv&#146;. Go somewhere else. Look up Yellow
Pages, but it&#146;s not us. Go to the CAB, but it&#146;s not
us.&#148; I do not think thatthat approach is reasonable or
right. Therefore it is important that the new council must consider
complaints from vulnerable consumers and assess whether those
complaints should be investigated by the council or should be referred
to another party better placed to resolve the issue.</div>
					<a name="070417104000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the end, what is the bottom
line here? When a complaint is made, the bottom line is to ensure that
it is accessed at the right point to be resolved, and hopefully
resolved to the benefit of the consumer. For example, a breach of a
license condition would be better dealt with by the appropriate
regulator, not by the NCC, as set out in clauses 14 or 15. Those
clauses allow the new council to refer matters to Ofgem or Postcomm,
ifit considers that the regulators should use their
enforcement powers to remedy the problem.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000466"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> I appreciate the Minister giving way. Let me read
again the measure&#151;clause 12(3)&#151;that I am referring to. It
says:</div>
					<a name="070417104000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where a
complaint to which this subsection applies is referred to the Council
by or on behalf of the designated consumer, the Council may investigate
the complaint for the purpose of determining whether it is appropriate
to take any action&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, we are even using the word &#147;may&#148; about
whether or not the complaint should be sent off to another body, or
retained within the NCC. The clause does not say that the council must
carry the process out to the far end. There is not even an obligation
on the council to decide whether the matter is one with which it should
deal or one that should go somewhere else. The case that the Minister
is making relates to the step afterwards&#151;after the
&#147;shall&#148; has taken place, so I question whether he really
intends that &#147;may&#148; should stand, at least within the
meaning ofthe
Bill.</div>

							<a name="070417104000467"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I can see where the hon. Ladyis coming
from, but she is misconstruing the Government&#146;s intention. There
is no point in having an advocacy body and yet giving it a bureaucratic
obligation to deal with matters that should be dealt with by some other
body that has the appropriate powers. Nor would it be right to create a
body under the clause which could opt out and say, &#147;This has
nothing to do with us.&#148; The proposals must be seen practically.
The NCC is an advocacy body, and we are trying to ensure certainty
that, when complaints are made, an assessment will be made of the best
body to deal with them&#151;based on the statutory reasons, or
reasons of skill, or a mixture of both&#151;so that they are directed
where they should go. That is important.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>
					<a name="070417104000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">We see that type of process all
the time in our capacity as MPs. Every day, people come to our offices
as advocates, and our staff have to make an assessment. If we want to
be friendly with everyone and give a good impression, we say,
&#147;Don&#146;t worry, I will deal with this complaint&#148;,
and they leave feeling happy. But two days or two weeks later they come
back and say, &#147;What happened to my complaint?&#148; Our staff
system is not designed to deal with complaints in that way&#151;our
job is to be advocates on behalf of our
constituents.</div>
					<a name="070417104000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
same point applies in relation to the clause in a broad sense. We need
the most appropriate person: first, to advocate; secondly to resolve;
and thirdly to remedy. If a remedy cannot be found, there should be
redress. That is why it is important to deal with things in the way
that we are proposing.</div>
					<a name="070417104000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">If Ofgem can use its powers of
determination over connection changes to the distribution network, it
should do so, but when the matter is best dealt with by agreement
between Postcomm and the council, it should be dealt with in that way.
The most important consideration is to ensure that the arrangements
provide greatest ease of use by
consumers.</div>
					<a name="070417104000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Richmond Park agrees with that position, and her objective
is the same as mine. She just does not believe that the clause goes far
enough. However, ultimately, the question is not just one of the words
on paper. I keep coming back to the point that the question is also one
of organisational ethos, skills, structure, advocacy and the ability to
give effective representation. When users come forward, they should be
signposted to the appropriate people. That is why the provision is
framed in the way it
is.</div>
					<a name="070417104000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should not ask
the hon. Lady to trust me&#151;that would not be fair. She is acting
as a legitimate advocate. However, I seek to reassure her on the basis
thatthe legislation is not drafted on a minimalist but a
maximalist
approach.</div>
					<a name="070417104000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me be
controversial. An advocacy organisation can be effective only if part
of its advocacy role includes telling people, &#147;You ain&#146;t
got a case&#148;, or telling people that their case should be dealt
with somewhere else. That is fine, as long as the quality of the
relationship between the advocacy organisation and the other body is
made clear. There should be relationships to ensure that individuals
who enter the complaints process and initially go to the wrong
organisation are directed by that organisation to the right place. That
is what the clause is about and I assure the hon. Lady that that is
what we are trying to achieve.

I still think that the drafting of the Bill is in error, however. It

his drafting team will take an opportunity to examine the language; I
think that they have fallen into the trap of using &#147;may&#148;
automatically as they work through the Bill, and have not recognised
that they are dealing with a clause of a different character. From
everything that the Minister has said, it seems thathis

						</b> With these amendments, we seek to extend the powers
where the council feels that there is a reasonable possibility of a
threat of disconnection being made. They are probing amendments, in
that we want to ascertain from the Minister what constitutesa
threat, bearing in mind that the process of disconnection can be quite
long. If one receives a letter saying that one may be disconnected if
the bill is not paid following a missed payment, does that constitute a
threat? A lot of utility companies use low-level threats early on in
the process, which can lead to a great deal of emotional distress to
the many vulnerable&#151;dare I say 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>it?&#151;customers who often receive such threats. By vulnerable I
mean elderly people and people whoare used to a
straightforward relationship with the company to which they make their
bill payments, who can receive a letter threatening to disconnect them
if the matter is not resolved. The companies can start to issue threats
at an early stage. I should like to know the stage at which the
Minister feels that the reasonable probability of disconnection
constitutes a threat to the individual.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000474"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 49 to 51 would change the scope
of the new council&#146;s duty to investigate disconnection or the
threat of disconnection of a consumer&#146;s gas or electricity
supply, to cover the circumstances in which there would be a reasonable
probability that a threat to disconnect would be made. What constitutes
a threat? That varies from supplier to supplier. Some mention
disconnection at a very early stage; some do so at a very late stage
and allow the consumer to build up a considerable backlog of debt. It
is important that the new council should use its discretion on the
issue to ensure a security of supply in almost all circumstances.
Without that, other problems will arise. It is important that those who
deal with such complaints do so with regard to the
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="070417104000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give an example of something that regularly happens to me as a
constituency MP. Someone makes contact and says that they are being
threatened with disconnection. First, how do they know that they have
been threatened? Have they received a notice? What form does the threat
take? They say, &#147;Well, I haven&#146;t paid my bill.&#148;
There needs to be more than that. There has to be a linkage; if there
is not, all that will happen is a huge paper chase. We have to use
advocates who are specifically able to deal with people who are
vulnerable to disconnection or a threat to disconnect. Such
advocates&#146; resources and time should be usedto secure
an arrangement that gives effect to the continuation of supply for the
vulnerable consumer.</div>
					<a name="070417104000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments are not needed.
A threat to disconnect is already covered in clause 13(1), which
obliges the council to investigate a complaint to decide on the
appropriate action to avoid disconnection, when appropriate. The
amendments would place an undue burden on the council, which would have
to assess in the case of each complaint whether there was a reasonable
probability of a threat to disconnect. No risk assessment would have to
be made; no evidence would have to be provided&#151;only someone
making contact and saying, &#147;I may be at risk.&#148; That would
take up a disproportionate amount of time, which would, as I said, be
more usefully employed in investigating complaints about actual or
threatened disconnection on the basis of evidence that such a thing
existed under clause 13(1).</div>
					<a name="070417104000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">If vulnerable consumers were
fearful that a threat to disconnect might have been made, they would be
covered by the provisions in clause 12, which empowers the new council
to investigate any matter concerning gas, electricity, postal
services&#151;and, in future, water&#151;when the consumer is
vulnerable. Accepting the amendments would offer no benefits to general
consumers. The hon. Member for Solihull tabled them&#151;the phrase
&#147;belt and braces&#148; comes to mind&#151;to ensure that in
all circumstances, irrespective of any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>evidence, the NCC should put resources at the disposal of the person
concerned. I do not agree with that; that is not the role of an
advocacy body.</div>
					<a name="070417104000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						For
example, if someone simply made contact with the supplier and said,
&#147;I have had a phone call telling me that you are going to
disconnect.&#148; How many calls would have to be made, and what
proportion would state that disconnection was going to take place? The
relevant NCC advocate may have to deal with 50or 60 actual
disconnections; I should rather they concentrated on them than on those
who have no evidence whatever other than a concern or fear. I do not
criticise people with concerns or fears but there needs to be an
ability in the system to make a proper risk assessment and use the
resources effectively, particularly for those who are under threat of
disconnection and require advocacy to make sure that it does not
happen.</div>

						</b> My right hon. Friend makes a telling point about
how a bill could build up. I consider British Gas to lead the market on
the ethical approach. Typically, it takes 140 days to disconnect
following non-payment. It writes an average of 10 letters; as a result,
the total number of gas customers disconnected by British Gas in 2006
was three. The system exists, and surely the NCC should oversee that,
rather than, as my right hon. Friend so strongly said, provide a belt
and braces
system.</div>

McCartney:
						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right and makes an
excellent point. As I said at the outset, the whole purpose is to
change the culture of the organisations that provide the goods and
services. That is a preventive strategy. The more preventive our
strategy is, the less need there is for resources for
intervention.</div>

failure. It is important that the providers&#151;in this instance
energy suppliers&#151;have an effective process for engaging with
their vulnerable consumers. If a consumer, vulnerable or otherwise,
gets into difficulties with the payment for their supply, a
decision-making process in the organisation&#146;s ethos should help
to prevent disconnection. The skills, knowledge and experience are
needed within the organisation to act and advocate on behalf of the
consumer on that basis. Only when that fails should the NCC be brought
into play. It should not be the first and only port of call. After a
year of the system operating in that way, we would end up with far more
disconnections. The hon. Lady&#146;s intentions are good, but the
reality is that the amendment would act against vulnerable consumers,
rather than for
them.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in
clause 13, page 9, line 22, after
&#145;payment&#146;, insert &#145;,
or</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">&#145;(iii) A failure of an
authorised supplier to recalibrate a repayment meter at the
consumer&#146;s premises within one month of any change in tariffs
charged by that supplier for supply of gas or
electricity.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="070417104000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment attempts to address the failure of some power companies to
recalibrate pre-payment meters in a timely way, thereby forcing an
exceedingly onerous debt on to the individual who has been the innocent
victim of the delay in recalibration. Most people who choose to have a
pre-payment meter do so because they are on a pretty low income and are
determined to manage their money sensibly. They want to know where
their pennies are going and how much is being spent on heating, cooking
and so on, and they are careful not to exceed their budget.</div>
					<a name="070417104000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the past year, individuals
on very low incomes have found that, because of delays in
recalibration, they face debts of &#163;400 or
&#163;600&#151;amounts that are completely beyond their means. Most
people who are on token meters are on incomes of less than
&#163;10,000 a year. Even the smallest debt is therefore extremely
burdensome. We have also discussed these issues in Westminster Hall,
and it is clear from my discussions with Energywatch that people on
pre-payment meters probably pay around &#163;180 more a year for the
privilege of giving a risk-free pre-payment to an electricity company,
compared with someone who might be on a direct debit scheme. These
people already carry a high
burden.</div>
					<a name="070417104000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
aware that the utility companies could deal with the problem in one
fell swoop by switching over to smart metering. However, there have
been such delays in instigating that sort of programme
thatthey frequently have to go door to door to recalibrate
meters.</div>
					<a name="070417104000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some utility
companies are responsible for how they handle recalibration: if there
are delays, they do not force the charge to fall on the individual
consumer. We should congratulate Scottish and Southern Energy and EDF
Energy on such matters. British Gas has recently changed its scheme, so
that it no longer charges back payments to people who would, in effect,
owe money because of a deferment in the recalibration. However,
Scottish Power, npower and Powergen continue with their systems of back
charges. We have crafted an amendment to hang a threat over those
companies that still take what I consider to be an entirely socially
unacceptable position, although I must admit that we are trying to
shoehorn it into the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="070417104000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are working
into the disconnection language a new paragraph (iii) that would treat
as a disconnection a
failure</div>
					<a name="070417104000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of an

					<a name="070417104000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">One month might sound a fairly cruel
timetable, but frankly, the companies have been behaving in a cruel
manner. Since they have not, through exhortation, changed their
practice, it will take threat for them to do so, and the Bill looks
like the perfect opportunity to introduce
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000479"></a>Mr.
Clarke:
						</b> I have no great desire to delay the Committee
unduly, but the hon. Lady referred tothe debate in Westminster
Hall that I initiated. Incidentally, by moving the amendment, she is
doing a great service to those who suffer from the problems that were
raised at the time, although I look forward to hearing the response of
my right hon. Friend the Minister.</div>
					<a name="070417104000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Lady has done, it
is important to register the fact that the problem is extremely
serious. I am not convinced that Ofgem has such powers or, if it has,
is willing to use them when inevitably the poorest people who are
obliged to use pre-payment meters are placed in the position in which
they suffer from the decision of companies that refuse to pass on the
reductions in wholesale prices by way of reducing retail prices
overa lengthy period, thus putting consumers at a big
disadvantage. If those consumers happen to be people on pre-payment
meters and are subjected to back payments, it is wholly
unacceptable.</div>
					<a name="070417104000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister agrees that the problem
must be put right. The hon. Member for Richmond Park mentioned several
companies such as Scottish Power. We who represent Lanarkshire
constituencies wrote to all the companies, including Scottish Power, on
this and other issues. The response was a long letter that we took to
mean that such matters were none of our business. A week or so after we
received it, Scottish Power, having ensured that its shareholders had
the benefits of the reductions in wholesale prices, decided to sell out
to the Spaniards, and where were the consumers, including those that
the amendment would
cover?</div>
					<a name="070417104000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I met Ofgem.
It knew that I was not satisfied with the response. Given the robust
nature of the Minister&#146;s contributions this afternoon, I shall
leave the sitting with far greater hope that such issues are being
dealt with. Consumers, particularly those who experience enormous
difficulty because of gas and electricity prices to the extent that the
amendment addresses, will consider that there is a body that sees its
responsibility not simply as a supplier to companies, but one that
feels an obligation to them. I am sure that, if we agree by the end of
our sitting to insist that those responsible for advocating and
defending the rights of consumers should show that they have teeth and
are prepared to use them, the Minister will respond in that
light.</div>
					
					<a name="070417104000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070417104000480"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> Like many people, I find myself being seduced by
the hon. Member for Richmond Park&#151;intellectually, I hasten to
add; she is a woman of taste as well as intellect. However, she has
conflated two issues, the first of which is the weighting of the tariff
on pre-payment charges. That is undoubtedly an injustice, and there can
be no more powerful advocate against it than my right hon. Friend the
Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. However, she
suggests&#151;it is implicit in the amendment&#151;not the
abolition of pre-payment but recalibration within a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>fixed time, which she referred to as being cruel. The problem is that
every company would like to have its systems recalibrated. All modern
meters are capable of remote updating, and that is what people want.
However, not everyone who uses a pre-payment system is on his uppers.
Some people with second homes find it a convenient way to
pay.</div>
					<a name="070417104000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief issue
is practicality. If we in the House were to say, &#147;Something
shall be done within four weeks,&#148; we might feel a warm glow of
satisfaction that we had achieved something. However, what would it
mean in practice? In most cases, entry warrants would have to be issued
by magistrates courts up and down the country. I do not know what it is
like in your constituency, Mr. Weir, but I know some parts
of Scotland. The distant but &#146;n bens on the borders
ofthe berry fields are probably hard to get to. In my
constituency, we are not always over-welcoming to those who call in the
tower blocks at the dead of night. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> They might be
Liberal Democrat canvassers. One cannot be too careful nowadays.
Ultimately, recalibration will be resolved by technology; remote
updating is happening. It is not practical to say that we must provide
new meters across the nation within a month.</div>
					<a name="070417104000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely agree with the hon.
Lady&#151;something I would always prefer to do&#151;about good and
bad practice. She referred to British Gas. I do not think that any of
us has a financial interest in British Gas except, as in my case, as an
extremely satisfied consumer. However, its announcement last year that
it would not recover any underpayments identified as a result of
recalibration was an extraordinarily generous and ethical step to take.
It should be congratulated on that.
</div>
					<a name="070417104000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge my right hon.
Friend the Minister&#151;although it is against his nature, because
he is a warm and welcoming person and a man who believes in the henotic
qualities of office&#151;to resist the amendment, not because of its
spirit, as it flows from a warm heart, but because of its sheer
impracticality. It would be impossible in most constituencies for every
consumer to allow access for recalibration&#151;there are millions of
them. Ofgem has accepted that point. We have not been terribly kind to
it, but it should be given credit when that is due, and it has said
that it would prefer to see a system under which the utility suppliers
use</div>
					<a name="070417104000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all reasonable
steps to ensure that the meter is reset within a reasonable time after
a price change.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070417104000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will not be a problem in
future thanks to remote updating, but for the moment, the
practicalities make the amendment impossible to sustain. I hope,
reluctant though he will undoubtedly be, that my right hon. Friend the
Minister will resist the warm blandishments of the hon. Member for
Richmond Park on this occasion, though perhaps not onevery
one.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>Chryston and Bellshill, we are discussing a number of issues, all of
which are important. One is whether or not people with a pre-payment
meter should be disadvantaged, when people such as myself&#151;I have
arrangements to pay both here in London and in my
constituency&#151;can get a reduction in cost by paying in advance.
The amendment is about the recalibration of pre-payment meters and
whether that should be a role for the NCC in all
circumstances.</div>

					<a name="070417104000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is critical
in structures dealing with consumer issues that the responsibility
should lie in appropriate places. The appropriate place for this issue
is with Ofgem, the regulator. Ofgem has completed its consultation on
proposed licence changes for timely recalibration. The consultation
ended on 2 March, and I am advised that Ofgem will be publishing its
proposals later this month.</div>
					<a name="070417104000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">To avoid interfering in
Ofgem&#146;s administrative affairs, and given the strength of
feeling in today&#146;s discussion, my officials or I will approach
Ofgem to seek certainty about whether the proposal will be announced
before the end of the Committee&#146;s proceedings. If so, it might
be helpful for Committee members to have those proposals before them. I
cannot guarantee it, nor am I putting any pressure on Ofgem, but given
the nature of today&#146;s debate and its consequences on discussion
of the clause, it might well be appropriate. I will do that tomorrow,
or my officials will do it on my behalf. Using Ofgem is the right way
forward, rather than adding to the list of complaints that the new
council must investigate. It will mean that the cause of the problem is
being tackled directly, as it should be, by the
regulator.</div>
					<a name="070417104000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
and more general issue is about fairness and individual
companies&#146; attitude to pre-payment meters. The new council will
be able to consider whether further action is required on pre-payment
meters because we are giving it general powers of investigation under
clause 11 that will permit it to carry out full investigations. It will
be appropriate in some areas for the NCC to investigate and make
recommendations, and we should separate those from the
regulator&#146;s obligations. The council will also have powers under
clause 8 to represent consumer interests. Clause 10 will provide for
information to consumers. The Bill is about putting all the building
blocks together.</div>
					<a name="070417104000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
light of my explanations, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the
amendment. We have provided the certainty that we will await
Ofgem&#146;s proposals and see whether they will be in the public
domain beforethe end of this Committee&#146;s proceedings,
as well as assurances that within the contexts of clauses 8, 10 and 11,
the new NCC will have the capacity to consider general issues of
complaints about pre-payment meters. I hope that that addresses the
complaints on behalf of which my right hon. Friend the Member for
Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill has so readily, enthusiastically and

Scotland has benefited twice in the Bill today, first, from the overall
general direction of the NCC in representing Scottish consumers and,
secondly, from the capacity to devolve to Scotland the ability to have
an advocacy body on a day-to-day basis to represent particular aspects
of Scottish consumer issues. This Government have delivered that with

rather cruelly indicated that my lack of knowledge of non-ministerial

saythat Ministers of the Crown were answerable forall
Government Departments, which the Minister disputed. I have managed to
get from the Cabinet its published list of non-ministerial departments.
There are 19 at the moment, but there might be more, although the
Assets Recovery Agency has been abolished. Interestingly
enough&#151;the Committee might like to know this&#151;one of the
non-ministerial departments, UK Trade and Investment, belongs to the
Minister himself and is directly answerable to this House through his
office. All non-ministerial departments are answerable to Parliament
through a Minister of the Crown. Therefore, given that the Minister is
not returning on Thursday, would he like to take this opportunity to
reflect on his comments and his reasoning as to why there was a need to
