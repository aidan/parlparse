               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 192
is intended to strengthen transparency in NHS foundation trusts by
requiring boards of directors to hold their meetings in public. The
Bill already proposes legislative changes that will establish a
stronger, more transparent and more accountable governance regime for
foundation trusts. In particular, the roles of governors and directors
are clarified: governors can already remove the chair and non-executive
directors, but we are giving them more explicit practical powers to
help them to hold the board to account, for example, by questioning
directors at special general
meetings.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have always encouraged the holding of public board meetings in
foundation trusts. Our concern was about forcing change through
legislation, as it is argued that that can be counter-productive. As we
discussed in March, holding open board meetings is really about
cultural change within an organisation. Genuine accountability for
decision making in foundation trusts is best achieved by governors and
directors agreeing locally the arrangements that work best for them,
the foundation trust and the public it serves.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000025">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">NHS
Future Forum recommended that there must be transparency about how
public money is spent, how and why decisions are made and the outcomes
being achieved at every level of the system, including a requirement on
foundation trusts to hold their corporate board meetings in public. All
other NHS organisations are required to hold public board meetings,
although that requirement has never applied to foundation trusts and is
a matter for each to decide. Although many foundation trusts do hold
their board of directors meetings in public, others do not. The
Foundation Trust Governors’ Association says that open board
meetings help governors to hold the board of directors to account more
effectively and would like that to be made
compulsory.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would ensure that all foundation trusts hold open board
meetings, so that the membership and wider public can understand the
internal arguments, tensions and restrictions that lead to a decision,
and better scrutinise and contribute to decisions on the
delivery of local health care provision. As I said, NHS
trusts must hold public board meetings, and because our
clear expectation is that the majority of NHS trusts will become
foundation trusts by 2014, the amendment would address the
risk of some trust boards choosing to become less open at
the point of foundation trust
authorisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Like
all other public bodies that are required to hold open board meetings
and as NHS trust boards do now, foundation trusts would be able to have
a closed part of their meetings to discuss confidential and sensitive
matters. Requiring public board meetings in foundation trusts is a
response to our listening exercise and mirrors the existing requirement
on other public bodies and boards of governors of foundation trusts. It
demonstrates our commitment to make the NHS more accountable and
transparent.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000028">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Mr Hood, it is absolutely lovely
to serve under your direction, and terrific that it is the last day of
the Committee. On that we absolutely agree. Another matter on which we
completely agree with Ministers is that this is an excellent amendment
—a first-rate amendment. In truth, it bears remarkable
similarity to Opposition amendment 641, tabled in the previous
iteration of this fine Committee, which suggested that the board of
directors should meet in public.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the time,
we thought that would be a pretty straightforward and good admission to
the statute book, but apparently the Government did not agree. We
thought the amendment was a good idea for all the reasons the Minister
has just enunciated. Boards of directors make crucial decisions about
changes in services, staffing levels, a trust’s priorities and
budgets, and whether they want to merge with another trust or change
the number of patients being treated privately in that trust,
as opposed to publicly, for example. At the time, the
Minister of State, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, said that he
was stunned at our suggesting such a requirement. He thought it quite
extraordinary that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and
Finsbury was suggesting such a thing. He went on to
say:<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000030">&#160;</a>

further questions for the Minister, because I do not think that he has

happened in the intervening period to persuade him that he was
fundamentally wrong last time and is absolutely right this time. I
would be grateful if he did so.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000040">&#160;</a>

substantive point is that, under the amendment, new paragraph 18E(2) of

               <p>The
crucial question is: what sort of special reasons? Non-FTs may or may
not meet in public, just like FTs, and when we tabled amendment 641 I
think we conceded that FTs in particular ought to be obligated to meet
in public. That was clearly an omission from earlier legislation,
because it is a good idea that they do so. Will the Minister spell out
the special reasons for which a board of directors might decide to meet
in camera? Can he provide some examples of when it might want to meet
in camera? I do not think that is too much to
ask.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000042">&#160;</a>

                  </div>a general duty on FT boards to be more open about
their meetings. Clause 165 sets out that the directors of an FT must
avoid conflicts of interest—not just declare conflicts of
interest, but avoid them—and not accept benefits from third
parties which relate in any way to their role in the foundation trust.

hon. Member for Pontypridd asked why the Government tabled the
amendment, which he powerfully welcomed as a sensible measure. The
answer is simple: we as a Government decided to pause, listen and
reflect; and having done all those things and respected the
representations we received from outside the Committee, we have changed
our mind. Given that he claimed ownership of the amendment, I hoped
that he would already be assured that foundation trusts exercising
their responsibility as public bodies that choose in certain
circumstances to meet in private would do so properly in accordance
with the provisions set out in the Public Bodies (Admission to
Meetings) Act 1960. In the amendment, we are attempting to give effect
in this Bill to those provisions, which give a clear guide to what is
and is not a matter that can be dealt with in
camera.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000059">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Let
me give a couple of examples. A discussion in the board might involve a
breach of data protection legislation if it were held in public, so it
would be necessary for that discussion to take place in private. If
there was a concern that the common law duty of confidentiality might
be breached by discussing a matter in public, the board would have to
consider discussing it in private. Similarly, if a commercially
sensitive matter was being discussed, such as the sale of intellectual
property rights and so on, the board might well decide that it needed
to meet in private. The hon. Gentleman asked about discussions on
whether a trust would take on a larger case load of private paying
patients. We can see absolutely no circumstances that would allow a
board to decide to meet in private to discuss and make decisions on a
matter that is fundamental to the purpose of foundation trusts, which
is to provide services to the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000060">&#160;</a>

               <p>The
Future Forum made recommendations to the Government on other
provisions. Notably, recommendation 16  suggested
that health and well-being boards ought to have a role in identifying
and addressing conflicts of interest in commissioning consortia, but
the Government have rejected that. The clause talks about conflicts of
interest only in relation to trusts, which gives rise to a couple of
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All
FT trusts have on their board a medical director, who is normally also
a consultant or senior clinician in the trust. My simple question is:
would that individual be obliged to declare an interest or to absent
himself from a meeting of the board of directors if the board was
considering increasing the proportion of private patients to be treated
in the FT, because of the clear risk that that consultant, certainly if
he practised in a mainstream area of medicine, would be among those who
treated those patients privately in that hospital and would thereby
benefit financially from it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The reason
why we are particularly worried about abolishing the private patient
cap is that, in our view, it is another area where the Government did
not listen adequately during the pause. They did not listen what to the
Future Forum was telling them. I am not talking about its
report—the Future Forum has conceded that it did not raise the
private patient cap vigorously enough in its report—however, it
has raised it
subsequently.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will finish with a quote. In his evidence to the Committee, Steve Field
said of the private patient
cap:<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“If

think Professor Field means that this is one of the key areas in which
changing the nature of what have hitherto been social providers, by
shifting them in the eyes of the law to a more commercial setting,
risks destructively subjecting them to EU competition law in the
courts. That is what we have been saying all along. I would be grateful
if the Minister cleared up whether medical directors should absent
themselves from decisions on shifting the proportion of patients. What

                  </strong> I rise to reinforce my hon. Friend’s
point. Proposed new paragraph 18B(1)(a) of schedule 7 to the National
Health Service Act 2006 sets out a duty that foundation trust directors
must avoid conflicts of interest, rather than simply declaring them;
and proposed new paragraph 18B(1)(b) specifies that directors must not
accept benefits from third parties that are related in any way to their
role within the foundation trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000076">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister elaborate on that duty to avoid conflicts of interest? I am
particularly thinking of foundation trust directors who come from
private sector health care companies and who might seek some advantage.
The board as a whole might see some advantage in having outside
expertise, but my concern is that it may be used as a Trojan horse to
bring a private sector interest into a foundation trust. I would
welcome the Minister’s views on that and any reassurances that
he can

               <p class="tabbed">When
it comes to directors avoiding conflicts of interest with third-party
benefits and so on, foundation trusts have always been able to
participate in joint ventures. Principles of public law mean that
foundation trust directors are already subject to the same duties as
directors of other organisations. The clause specifically clarifies the
duty on all conflicts of

               <p class="hs_brev">“We
have heard concerns about our proposal to lift the cap on the amount of
income foundation trusts can earn from treating private patients. Some
fear that this could lead to NHS resources being used to
cross-subsidise private care. Any cross-subsidy of this kind would
breach the fundamental principles of the NHS, as set out in the NHS
Constitution, which makes clear that ‘public funds for
healthcare will be devoted solely to the benefit of the people that the
NHS serves’. To provide assurance and transparency, we will
require foundation trusts to produce separate accounts for NHS and
private-funded
services.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
sets out the Government’s approach clearly. We want transparency
and separate accounting for any resources generated through private
activity, and, because these are public benefit organisations that have
a legal, statutory duty to provide services to the NHS, we

<div class="columnNumber">

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other intriguing aspect of the debate about the cap is that, even
towards the end of the previous Administration, there was recognition
that the current arrangement was inconsistent and unfair. It was unfair
because it resulted in a situation where NHS trusts have no restriction
whatever on the level of private activity that they can engage
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000084">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It may
interest the Committee to hear about the top 10 NHS
organisations—FTs and non-FTs—when it comes to their
income from private activities. Those activities are not just about
treating patients; they can be joint ventures, the realisation of value
from intellectual property through research and so on. We find that
Great Ormond Street hospital, which is an NHS trust, earns 7.8% of its
total income from private patients. The figure for Imperial College
Healthcare NHS Trust is 4.6%. The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt
orthopaedic and district hospital earns 4%. Royal Free Hampstead NHS
Trust, which is number 11 on the list, has a figure of 4%.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The reality
is that those organisations are not in any way eroding the fundamental
principles of the NHS as a service—to provide support, care and
treatment for people that is free at the point of use and based on
people’s needs. If they had been, the Labour Government would
surely have taken the opportunity over the past 13 years to impose a
cap on them as well. They chose not

The Minister just made an important point. Does he agree that, under

in the hospital, as he has just outlined? Does he also agree that there

               <p class="tabbed">It
was very clear, and remains clear, that the previous Government
recognise the legitimate case that foundation trusts were making about
the lifting of the caps not being a threat to the fundamental values of
the NHS, because those organisations are required to adhere to the NHS
constitution and they are clearly there for the benefit of the public
they serve. For those reasons, I hope that the clause will stand part
and that my hon. Friends will support it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000106">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The question I would have loved to ask the
Minister—I believe it would be good if Liberal Democrats
attending his conference were to hear the answer—is whether he
really believes that it is in the interests of the national health
service for the cap on private patients not to be altered, amended or
improved, but to be lifted. Is that his position? If so, there are many
people who would be very interested to hear it and does he speak on
behalf of the Liberal Democrats in Parliament when saying
so?<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000107">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I shall respond briefly, because my Liberal
Democrat colleagues are somewhat less gullible than the hon. Lady might
want to suggest. What they know, and what they were very interested to
know, is that there are many organisations that are not foundation
trusts, are not subject to a cap, never have been, and, as a result,
generate significant earnings from their private patient incomes. I
have mentioned them already and I will not rehearse them again. Given
that the Opposition now seem to be so obsessed with this, it surprises
me that in 13 years in government they did not take the opportunity to
deal with it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000108">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Fine. The Minister listed the percentages, which
prompts me to ask whether he thinks there is an upper limit to which
trusts or foundation trusts should adhere. Or is it the
Minister’s view that there is absolutely no limit, and that FTs
can raise as much income as they want from private operations such as
research, treating private patients or any of the other things that he
listed? If he thinks that there is absolutely no limit, it is hard to
see how the stipulation in the Bill that the principal role of FTs is
to provide public NHS goods and services—to provide health care
on the NHS—can be met. A particularly entrepreneurial trust
might seek to ratchet up such activities over the years to levels that
impinged on its ability to deliver its prime duty. Does the Minister
think that that is wholly unforeseeable and that the Government will
not have to legislate in future to redress that balance?<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000112">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
are making a number of the changes to the Bill in the amendments
because during the listening exercise particular concerns were
expressed about quality and patient care. People felt that that might
be compromised if NHS trusts were pushed to apply for foundation trust
status before they were ready. Although the NHS Future Forum did not
specifically suggest this, we have decided that we should go further.
Alongside our commitment for all NHS trusts to achieve foundation trust
status, we have already given assurances that there will be no lowering
of the bar in Monitor’s stringent tests, including in the way in
which the quality of services is considered during the application
process. We maintain that undertaking.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000133">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Applicants
will need to have strong boards, be clinically and financially robust
in order to succeed, and quality will be at the heart of the assessment
process. We now need to go further, building on the work that has been
done in response to the first Mid Staffordshire inquiry findings.
Monitor, as foundation trust regulator, and the
Care Quality Commission, as quality regulator, have improved the
authorisation process for new foundation trusts. They have already
signed, and work to, a memorandum of understanding governing their
co-operation and collaboration to assure the quality of services
provided by NHS trusts in advance of their authorisation by Monitor as
foundation trusts. However—and it is an important loophole at
the moment—this is only a voluntary agreement and it is not
legally
enforceable.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment therefore creates a statutory basis for these improvements,
made after the tragic failings at Mid Staffordshire, ensuring that the
new arrangements remain an essential part of the authorisation process.
It does that by placing a statutory requirement on Monitor to gain
assurance from the CQC that the quality of services provided
by a trust meets the requirements necessary  to remain
registered. The amendment is needed to ensure that quality
is not compromised in any way and remains paramount in a successful
foundation trust application. The amendment underscores the
Government’s commitment to quality as a vital organising
principle of the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000135">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This is a technical and slightly curious amendment.
I take the Minister’s word that it places on a statutory footing
the need for Monitor to consult the CQC before authorising foundation
trusts. I also heard what he said about there being no lowering of the
bar in respect of the authorisation of trusts as FT trusts. I am not
sure that that is correct or exactly what will be achieved, so I want
to explore precisely what the clause does and how it builds on previous
legislation, because it is very
complicated.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000136">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister said, the clause effectively places a duty on Monitor to
consult the CQC to determine that it is happy that the trust is up to
scratch in quality terms before granting it FT status. According to the
clause, the sorts of thing that the CQC must consider are established
in statute under sections 12(2) and 20 of the Health and Social Care
Act 2008. Those provisions broadly provide a list of the sorts of
activity in which the trust is engaged. It is not a detailed list of
precisely what a trust does. That additional safeguard, as the Minister
put it, is required because clause 156 changes the nature of
authorisation from an ongoing process to a one-off process. Hitherto,
when FTs have been authorised, the authorisation was an ongoing set of
riding orders for the trust, with the implication that if the trust
resiled from carrying out some of the things it agreed to do when
authorised, thus shifting the nature of what it offered, that
authorisation could be called into
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
this is pretty complicated I shall quote the explanatory notes, because
they make the position

               <p>Crucially,
the clause goes further and repeals the duty placed on FTs by section

               <p>As
I said, the licensing regime does not specifically mandate or force the
trust to provide, every time, all the services that it offers at the
point at which it is authorised. The explanatory notes state:<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000146">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“The

               </p>
               <p>Previously,
that authorisation was ongoing and contingent on the trust providing a
specific set of services. The latest application I could find was from
Southampton University Hospitals. That trust lists cardiac surgery,
vascular services, haematology, radiotherapy, children’s
oncology and so on—all of the services that are provided. That
is a useful benchmark, laid down in the procedures, that allows the
public to look at what the hospital provides, and to see if it chooses
in future not to provide some free services that it was thought it
would provide. Opposition Members believe that is important. We assume
that the NHS will provide comprehensive services, certainly in large
hospitals.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000147">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
fear that when hospitals have greater autonomy they may start to shift
the nature of the services they provide, for example, choosing to do
more elective work with private patients, or less expensive work in
areas that are less lucrative. That is a serious concern. The Minister
said that the measure did not lower the bar, but I believe that there
is a risk that it will do so. It is a lesser duty offering fewer
guarantees that services and goods—spelled out previously as
provided by a trust—will not be changed or reduced, either when
the trust shifts to become a foundation trust, or later. It is clear
that it could be done at a later stage. That prompts the question of
why the Government want to do this. Why would they want to set a lower
bar? Why would they want less public insight into what the trust
provides? The answer is clear: they are interested in providing greater
autonomy and less oversight of the trusts. As the Minister said,
top-down management is to be eschewed at all
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000148">&#160;</a>

services, which is why they shifted to NHS foundation trusts. The
Government have said on myriad occasions that they are not in favour of
top-down management. One man’s top-down management is another
man’s oversight and surety for the public that the hospital will
provide in future all the services it has in the past, and will not, in
exercising increased commercial freedom, decide to drop some services,
or increase provision where it may be more lucrative, for example, in
respect of private patients. That is a simple test for the Minister.
Can he guarantee that the stringency of the test will not be reduced,

                  </strong> Thank you, Mr Hood. I welcome the amendment. My
hon. Friend the Minister made it clear that its introduction was partly
motivated by the experience at the Mid Staffordshire foundation trust.
What has emerged from the initial Francis report and the ongoing public
inquiry is that the interaction between Monitor and the then Healthcare
Commission, now the Care Quality Commission, was not sufficient.
Monitor relied on the Healthcare Commission’s work, which was
not adequate for those purposes. I therefore welcome two things in the
Bill: the amendment and the duty on both Monitor and the Care Quality
Commission to work together more closely. The amendment will make it
clear to the CQC that it has to produce an in-depth report on any trust
that is going for foundation-trust status and that Monitor has to take
that seriously. Indeed, if the CQC has any concerns, Monitor should
listen to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000153">&#160;</a>

contribution. A moment ago, he said that he thought that this amendment
would place a duty on the CQC to provide a detailed report. It does not
actually say that. It simply says that it needs to be satisfied before
it offers its imprimatur to the foundation trust. I assume that that
involves some sort of paper assessment. If the hon. Gentleman looks at
sections 12 and 20 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008, he will see
that they are very vague about what it needs to do. Those provisions
are not detailed enough for us to be certain that the CQC will do a
detailed analysis.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000154">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">

satisfied. It will not be satisfied with poor or even mediocre
standards of care. It has to be satisfied with very high standards of
care. To some extent, we have to say that if the CQC is not going to
set those very high standards of care and be satisfied with them, we
must look very carefully at what it is doing. I believe that 
the leadership of the CQC will do that, and that is the standard

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman made a valid point in referring
to the change to section 33(2) of the 2006 Act. Under the Act as it
stands—this point relates to the whole clause rather than the
specific amendment—foundation trusts will be able to extend
their remit into areas that they were not originally authorised for or
to withdraw from them without, as I see it, going back for
re-authorisation. I stand to be corrected on that. I will explain the
relevance of the amendment. If what I have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 517<a class="bkMark" name="Column517">&#160;</a>
                  </div>referred to happened—I am thinking not so
much about the withdrawal from areas of service, but about the addition
of further areas of service by a foundation trust—what
responsibility would the CQC have in investigating whether that
foundation trust was capable and up to engaging in those new areas of
activity, which might be substantial? That is a genuine question,
because the amendment does not deal precisely with that point. Bearing
in mind the shortage of time today, I will now conclude my
remarks.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000164">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is lovely to see you in the Chair, Mr Hood.
My remarks will focus on what the Secretary of State has said about
employees being given the option of a management buy-out of a
foundation trust. Underpinning that proposal is the need for funds, so
I want to know where those funds will come from. Usually, the source
would be venture capital or private equity companies, so an employee
buy-out would create not what the Government described as akin to a
social enterprise, but a private equity-owned
hospital.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000165">&#160;</a>

                  </span>
My hon. Friend poses an interesting question to the Minister about
where the equity will come from for any social enterprise model, mutual
or co-operative that employees wish to take on. Is there any suggestion
that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will give
grants to those organisations to engage, via the back door, with a
potential localised privatisation and co-opting the co-operative model
for other
purposes?<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000166">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is a good question. Those are the sorts of
things that we still do not know about. If there is a need to obtain
funding from private equity companies, the majority shareholder will
have the right to dictate how the organisation is run. Even if the
employees can structure funding as debt secured on the assets, the
lender is still likely to dictate the terms to ensure that the interest
is paid. Can the Minister answer that question? Will he also explain
how the views of the community, who are ultimately the users of the
services, will be taken into account in that
process?<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000167">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I will start with that question because it is
important to give a slightly broader context. Foundation trusts are
already required to have governors and members. They are required to
have a governance structure that is outward looking to their local
communities. With the Bill, the Government are further strengthening
the role of governors in holding to account the boards of directors of
foundation trusts, further to increase transparency  in the way
in which they operate. In fact, that partly answers the question asked
by the hon. Member for Pontypridd about how the public and the public
interest would be protected if a foundation trust decided to change the
mix of services that it provided. It also in some ways answers the
question asked by the hon. Member for Stafford. However, it is not the
only answer to those questions, and I will rehearse some of the
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth has said at earlier
stages, to understand a clause in the Bill, one often needs to look at
several clauses to see the context. In that regard, we need
to take into account 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 518<a class="bkMark" name="Column518">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the role of commissioners in maintaining
continuity of service, in assuring themselves of the quality of service
and in ensuring that identified population needs are translated into
commissioning plans that in turn are delivered by providers that are
commissioned to deliver the services. Other clauses provide for the
role of overview and scrutiny, which ensures that providers can also be
called to account in that way. A number of other provisions, over and
above those in this part of the Bill about FTs’ governance,
answer the questions that the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend asked
about transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000169">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I take the point about commissioners having a role
in determining whether the mix of services is satisfactory, but the
clause changes the nature of authorisation from an ongoing process to a
one-off process. Does that mean that we have less control over the
subsequent changes post-authorisation—post-licensing? If a
comprehensive list of services will no longer be required up front, as
it is under existing legislation, will the commissioners not
consequently have less insight when it comes to judging any subsequent
changes?<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000170">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The answer to both questions is no, and I will
explain why. The hon. Gentleman has talked a lot about our emphasis on
autonomy, which seemed to me to be an area of agreement between us,
because the previous Administration decided to pursue the same
direction in their FT policy. Of course, with autonomy must come
greater accountability, which is why we have set out in the Bill the
enhancements on which I have
elaborated.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
need to bear in mind the CQC’s history. It was established in
legislation in 2008 and it adopted its current role as a body that
licenses against essential standards in October last year. The business
planning and the work to determine the level of resources that it would
require were done under the previous Administration. It is a matter
that deserves proper scrutiny and it will probably get such scrutiny in
due course. We need to be careful what we say about CQC delivering its
responsibilities, which is why we are undertaking reviews of cases such
as Winterbourne View and will bring the findings back to the House. We
also expect the Select Committee on Health to do its work in that
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000172">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me deal
with the questions about authorisation moving from an ongoing to a
one-off process. At the heart of the Opposition’s
misunderstanding of this part of the Bill—one of many
misunderstandings—is the question whether the licensing regime
forces providers to do things. Monitor will have the power to enforce
licensing conditions. The hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that it
would not, so I draw the Committee’s attention to clauses 105 to
111. His misunderstanding about the licensing regime is worrying, so
let me say a little about the enforcement powers that the Bill
provides.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Monitor will
have the power to enforce licence conditions; it will be able to take
actions including fining, requiring providers to take action or
requiring them to undo actions that they have already taken. A clear
range of powers is available to Monitor. As for the suggestion that
somehow the Government are interested in lowering the bar and reducing
accountability, nothing could be further from the truth. We want more
oversight of FTs and, as I have explained, we are strengthening local
accountability. We want organisations to become foundation 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 519<a class="bkMark" name="Column519">&#160;</a>
                  </div>trusts only when they are clinically and financially sustainable, which
is what the tests that I have already outlined are all about. We are
not lowering the bar; with this amendment and this clause we are making
it clear on a statutory basis that Monitor needs to engage with the CQC
in discharging its ongoing legal duties concerning essential standards
of safety and quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000174">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I end with a
brief reference to the questions from the hon. Member for Oldham East
and Saddleworth about changing the status of organisations, although I
am not sure that that is directly related to the clause and the matters
before the Committee. If on reflection and after rereading her comments
in <em>Hansard</em> I see that it is, I will write to
her.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000175">&#160;</a>

remind Members that the Secretary of State criticised foundation trusts
when they were first introduced. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000176">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I confess that I am not wholly convinced by the
remarks of the Minister, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. He
suggested that the reason why I argued that this was a lowering of the
bar—shifting from the ongoing process with an up-front listing
to a one-off process at the beginning of the authorisation through the
licence conditions—was that I had misunderstood what was in the
Bill in respect of Monitor’s ability to enforce conditions. I do
not think I misunderstood that for one second. I will read the relevant
clause, as the Minister clearly is not sufficiently familiar with it to
understand it himself.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
said that Monitor will have the powers to enforce conditions.
Absolutely. However, clause 98, on standard conditions,
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“licences

               </p>
               <p>So
they may; it does not say that there must be a listing of what those
goods and services are. Under clause 99, on special
conditions,<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Monitor

               <p>for
trust status in this instance, “include a special

Monitor suggesting—not insisting—that a special
condition, such as the listing of the comprehensive services provided,
ought or ought not to be included in its initial licence.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000182">&#160;</a>

then lists some of those conditions. At no point does the Bill say that
Monitor will list what those services are. At no
point does it say that they will be included in the licences, or that
they ought to be included as standard in the licences. At no point does
the Bill make it clear that that is a fundamental shift in the nature

                  </strong> It is helpful to have further illumination on the

               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
194 and 196 are minor technical amendments. They do not change policy,
but together they will remove any ambiguity on the approval
requirements for organisational mergers and acquisitions involving
foundation trusts and NHS trusts. Clauses 165 and 166 apply
to organisational mergers and acquisitions where two whole trusts merge
or one trust acquires
another.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
165 addresses mergers between a foundation trust and another foundation
trust or an NHS trust; and clause 166 addresses a foundation
trust’s acquisition of another foundation trust or an NHS trust.
The current wording of clauses 165(2) and 166(2) requires each
applicant to attain the approval of the majority of its governors
before a merger or acquisition can take place. The amendments are
needed to clarify that the requirements for governor support apply only
to foundation trusts. I beg to move that the clause, as amended, stand
part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000193">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> No, I do not think the confusion has been caused by
Opposition Members. We have been entirely
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley has said, we have
exposed the Government’s confusion on which regulator will look
at mergers at which juncture. The amendments seek to address which
sorts of mergers between which sorts of bodies ought to be looked at by
the regulator, and clause 165 provides that any foundation trusts
wishing to merge must apply to the regulator under section 56 of the
2006
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
prompts this straightforward question: which regulator? The 2006 Act
does not specify which regulator foundation trusts are to look to. We
heard last week that the OFT will look at some mergers and that Monitor
will look at some mergers via, or in conjunction with, the Co-operation
and Competition Panel. I would be grateful if the Minister could clear
that up, because last week he clearly said that the threshold that will
be
applied—<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000201">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister is right, but it feels like a week
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
threshold that will be applied is that set out in the Enterprise Act
2002. The Minister told us for the first time that the cut-off at which
the OFT, rather than Monitor, will be employed to review a merger is
where turnover is more than £70 million or where more than 25%
of the market would be
supplied.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister also said that mergers between foundation trusts would always
be looked at by Monitor. Having already been asked which regulator is
meant in section 56 of the 2006 Act, the Minister also said that FT to
FT mergers would be subject to Monitor. Is it not right, however, that
the Co-operation and Competition Panel will look at NHS trust to FT
mergers in future? I think that is the case. FT to FT mergers will be
the preserve of the OFT, but FT to non-FT NHS trust mergers will be the
preserve of Monitor, which is what I understand to be the case from
information from the CCP.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If that is
the case, how can it be right that the £70 million
turnover threshold applies, because that is the arbiter as to where it
is the responsibility of Monitor 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 522<a class="bkMark" name="Column522">&#160;</a>
                  </div>or the OFT? Some NHS trusts, and certainly the FTs with whom they are
potentially merging, will have a turnover of more than £70
million. I will be grateful if the Minister looks at that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000206">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
prompted me to go back and look at the Enterprise Act 2002, because he
was absolutely right—I apologise—that it is in the Act,
not in regulations, that the £70 million figure is cited; it
appears in section 23. Section 28 of the 2002 Act refers to
the turnover test. As I said on Tuesday, I am slightly surprised that
the revenues expended by an NHS trust should be considered as turnover.
That is peculiar, because turnover usually suggests a commercial
entity, which of course is what is meant in the Act. The explanatory
notes
state:<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
test will apply to turnover in the UK, and will be set initially at
£70 million, but this figure will be alterable by statutory
instrument.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000241">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
therefore presume that that has not been altered since the 2002 Act and
that the figure of £70 million is still in place. The
explanatory notes continue at point
119:<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
test will be determined by reference to the turnover of the enterprise
being taken
over”—<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000242">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>this
is the good
bit—<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“(i.e.
if the turnover of the target company exceeds £70 million, the
merger qualifies for
investigation).”<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000243">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
underlines the point that we made about mergers on Tuesday. The
application of that sort of language and legislation to mergers between
NHS trusts makes it all the more likely that the courts will,
subsequently to the Bill, interpret them as being increasingly
commercial ventures and therefore subject to far more stringent review
from competition law. I ask the Minister to comment on that again in
the light of what I have just read out. Does he think that we are
wholly wrong about it and that it is not possible that the courts may
take a more hard-line view in future on whether NHS trusts engage in
commercial or NHS
activities?<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
mergers, the Minister said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
OFT has a discretion not to refer where patient benefits outweigh the
adverse effects on competition. Patient benefits would include
consideration of availability of patient choice and greater innovation
and provision of high quality
services.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Health and

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
again prompts a key question that my right hon. Friend the Member for
Rother Valley raised on Tuesday. What on earth is the expertise that
the OFT has to determine what constitutes the quality of services in
the NHS? The point that the Ministers and the Secretary of State have
been keen to make in response to the Future Forum is that a sectoral
regulator—Monitor—with specific expertise in the NHS is
needed because the NHS is different. It is not like determining whether
Kellogg’s ought to be able to merge with
Nestlé.<a class="bkMark" name="11071466000212">&#160;</a>
