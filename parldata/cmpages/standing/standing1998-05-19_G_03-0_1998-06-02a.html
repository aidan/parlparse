<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I am sure that members of the Committee spent a great part of the recess considering amendment No. 85 in some detail. I hope that the Under-Secretary, who had the luxury of being present at our previous sitting, also took the time to consider the issue raised by the amendment, especially as we had just reached a point of great importance.<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) moved amendment No. 85, which would leave out line 4 of clause 2, which refers to trade. By a process of dialogue, we discovered that his amendment goes deeper than even he had first imagined. He argued that the reference to effect on trade was otiose. He was right; it is. Anything that distorts competition is presumably intended to be caught by the Bill and the fact of affecting trade or otherwise is not material.<P>
The Under-Secretary has been caught by the word “and”—an inclusive word—in much the same way as he had been caught earlier in our discussions by the word “or”—an exclusive word. The phrase which the amendment covers is of particular interest and goes to the heart of the Bill’s drafting problems. The clause was drafted by someone who had been studying in number, not in shape, what used to be article 85 of the treaty of European Union. There was a particular reason for that article containing an inclusive word—“and”; it was to demarcate the particular area of competition that should come within the competence of the competition authorities in Directorates—General IV. Such demarcation cover the area of inter-European member state trade and the type of competition.<P>
I am sure that members of the Committee who are also members of European Standing Committee B would agree that there is every reason why the European treaty should be so structured. The Commission should be prevented from exercising its authority except in cases where the matters in question are not just of a distortion of competition, but affect inter-state trade.<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): For the purpose of clarification, will my hon. Friend tell us what his understanding is of the meaning of the word “affect”? It seems a mealy-mouthed term. It does not have the specificity and intelligibility that good legislation should have.<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend is right—the word is extraordinarily vague. In fact, both the words “affect” and “trade” are vague. That is of less importance in the context of the treaties of the European Community because, alas, the European Court of Justice is well known to take a teleological interpretation. It interprets all such phrases to mean what it thinks the treaties should have meant if they had been more tightly drafted. Unfortunately, the Bill contains a transposition of a doubly vague phrase, appropriately crafted in the context of the treaties, into English law. In that respect, we suffer two severe disadvantages.<P>
The Under-Secretary and his officials have failed to spot two critical differences between the Bill and the paradigm of the European treaties. The first is precisely the one to which my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) animadverts. There is absolutely no doubt that the English courts, in the fine tradition of statutory construction in English justice, will look much more closely at the words than the European Court of Justice is wont to do. I have no way of telling—I suggest that no member of the Committee, least of all the Under-Secretary, has any way of telling—what an English court might do with that astonishing phrase, “affect trade”.<P>
The second critical defect is much the greater. Whereas it makes sense, in the context of the European treaties, to limit the competence of the Commission to dealing with cases with some effect on inter-state trade, however vaguely put, there is no such reason in the context of United Kingdom law. We reached that conclusion at the end of the previous sitting. The problem is that mindlessly copying over the text, the sole change being that it applies “within the United Kingdom” rather than between member states, will affect the entire structure of the Bill. If the Under-Secretary paused to consider the matter during the recess, I suspect that he would have discovered what mature reflection has suggested to our minds is the case—namely, that it is highly likely that the entire purpose of chapter I will be vitiated by the unnecessary insertion of line 4, which amendment No. 85 would remove.<P>
None of us can tell what trade is, or why it should be so demarcated in the Bill. Our best guess is that the Bill means to create a distinction between trade and commerce. I cannot think how an inclusive clause, which deals with competition, can affect anything except trade or commerce, or both. It is extremely difficult to see in what other domain competition could obtain.<P>
Members of the Committee should imagine a court coming to this crucial chapter I prohibition and asking itself the critical question, “Why is there an inclusive phrase?” It will ask, “Why should the agreement both affect trade within the United Kingdom and distort competition? What can Parliament have had in mind?” It must conclude that the reason for mentioning trade is that Parliament wanted to exclude commerce, the only other item that could otherwise have been included.<P>
I bow to the Under-Secretary’s superior knowledge and understanding. He has access to officials in the Government’s legal service, who are vastly more learned that we Opposition Members can hope to be about such matters. He may have a reason why my line of argument is wholly false. If so, it would be extremely good to hear it—either now or when he replies to the debate.<P>
On an amateurs interpretation, it seems that the English courts are likely to interpret that provision as excluding commerce. If so, the chapter I prohibition will have the bizarre feature of affecting all those agreements that have an impact on trade, but none of those that have an impact on commerce.<P>
No member of the Committee can be sure what lies in the realm of commerce and what lies in the realm of trade. However, the reasonable presumption must be that the entirety of the financial services industry lies in the realm of commerce. Further, the presumption must be that most of those services similar to financial services because no real commodity is being traded—for example, oil futures or futures in other energy sectors—<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Milk quotas.<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes, milk quotas. All those services would be in the realm of commerce rather than trade. If that is the distinction—perhaps the Under-Secretary will enlighten us on that—the chapter I prohibition, if it is unchanged by the magisterial amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, would have the absurd effect of dramatically reducing the current effectiveness of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, because that Act has the great merit of covering commerce.<P>
Mr. John Redwood (Wokingham): May I introduce into my hon. Friend’s thinking another complexity that I fear the clumsy drafting of the clause and schedule 3 has produced? Let us consider the general exclusions in schedule 3 to the prohibition  that we are debating. Schedule 3 states that the prohibition does not apply<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
My hon. Friend may want to consider whether “general economic interest” is another phrase designed to cover commerce but not trade or both commerce and trade. It is beyond belief that the draftsmen have come up with yet another complexity—a different form of words to prohibit some activities while removing many others from the prohibition.<P>
Mr. Letwin: My right hon. Friend, with his customary acuity, directs the Committee’s attention to that phrase. In the, alas, admittedly brief period of the recess that I spent considering the Bill, I came across that phrase and was wholly perplexed by it.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> While my hon. Friend is collecting observations relating to what he has said, would he care to consider two further points? First, is “general economic interest” broadly to be interpreted by Ministers as the public economic interest? That returns us to our earlier discussions about the operation of the monetary policy committee. Secondly, does my hon. Friend think that behind that wording lies what might be called a late emanation of physicalism, and a belief that somehow the production of goods is the only economic activity worthy of note, and not the mere construction of services?<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend is being uncharitable. I must suppose that the phrase “general economic interest”, which is, in the colloquial expression, Greek to me, has not been conceived with ulterior purpose, but is simply a loose piece of drafting. <P>
There is a multiplicity of loose pieces of drafting in the Bill, but the critical one is the reference to trade. That originates from a mindless imposition of the terms in which the underlying article in the European Union treaty is phrased. That provision has no useful place in the Bill. It might—unless the Under-Secretary can convincingly rebut this assertion—have the effect of excluding from the chapter I prohibition a vast array of transactions that are of especial concern to those people who want genuine competition in this country. It is therefore wholly misplaced.<P>
It would be nice if the Under-Secretary were to tell the Committee that he has had the opportunity for mature reflection and discussion with genuine experts, and that, as this is an entirely technical point within the spirit of the Bill and not in any sense a matter of party politics, he will return to the Committee, or to the House, with an amendment to remove line 4.<P>

<P>

<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> Welcome back, Mr. Maxton.<P>
The point being made by the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) is spurious. He admitted that he had but an amateur understanding of the matter, which was brave, and, I must confirm, honest of him.<P>
The effect on trade test is required to ensure that the United Kingdom’s chapter I prohibition has exactly the same scope as article 85. That is why it is included. Subsection (7) makes it clear that for the prohibition to apply there is no need to show an effect on the movement of trade between different parts of the United Kingdom. It must be clear in the Bill that the EC requirement of an effect on movement of trade is not relevant. However, the effect on trade test under article 85 has another function. It requires that the agreement must involve matters that constitute trade that is relevant to the United Kingdom prohibition. That is why the previous Conservative Government included the words in their draft Bill. The hon. Member for West Dorset shakes his head. There is a repudiation of everything that the previous Government did, yet the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) was a prominent member of that Government.<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I preface this intervention by emphasising that the fact that a mistake was made by officials and Ministers under the previous Government does not justify repeating the mistake now, as I am sure my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham would agree. What activity could have as its object competition, other than trade or commerce? What additional effect is the Under-Secretary trying to generate by restricting the provision to trade?<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Value added.<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Value added, as my hon. friend rightly says.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The specific requirement of article 85 is trade. As we want to ensure an alignment—<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Between states.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentlemen says “between states”, but to enable British companies to apply a consistent set of rules and regulations, the application of the Bill’s terms should be consistent for trading both abroad and internally. It is important to ensure consistency. The wording of paragraphs (a) and (b) has therefore remained unchanged for several years, despite having been considered several times.<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): Does not the Under-Secretary realise that consistency does not require uniformity of text? Consistency between the two texts requires businesses to understand clearly that article 85 language is intended to circumscribe the European Union’s jurisdiction to trade between member states, whereas within the United Kingdom that prohibition extends to comp-etition, which embraces trade within the United Kingdom.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Of course, and the term “trade” applies to a wide range of economic activity. The amendment nit-picks—<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> No, I am responding to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire.<P>
The amendment nit-picks; if our proceedings are to continue in that spirit, as was suggested two weeks ago, I fear that it will be hard to make progress. There is considerable overlap between the effects of trade and what affects competition, but that does not render the effect on trade test redundant. Under article 85, it is a separate requirement. We risk diverging from the meaning of the European Commission prohibition if we do not include it. The Bosman case, about a football player’s right to work for a football club in another country, raised the question of whether football constitutes trade. It is a live issue at European Commission level.<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary is being unfair to my hon. Friends. We are not trying to waste our time, or his. This serious point goes to the heart of the Bill. Ministers have said, both in Committee and on the Floor of the House, that the intention is to construct a tougher competition law. My hon. Friends argue that there is a danger that the wording could be unpicked by clever lawyers in the future, to render it a weaker law than the one that it is designed to replace. We must ask the Under-Secretary to forget the party politics and the “who did what whens”, and to concentrate on explaining why the provision specifies trade, rather than trade and commerce; why it needs to be there at all; and how it relates to the phrase “general economic interest”—another large exclusion which schedule 3 drives into clause 2. Our worry is that the combination of provisions in the Bill will provide many businesses with an opportunity to avoid a prohibition, whereas the current law would catch them.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Of course, the right hon. Gentleman does not want to go into the “who, what, why, where and when” of the past, because they are so embarrassing to him and his party. That is precisely why we shall dwell on them.<P>
The second function of the effect on trade test limits the scope of article 85. The agreement must involve matters that can be said to constitute trade. That is an important element of clause 2, and it is the reason we are determined to resist any move to alter the wording of the Bill or that of its draft predecessor. It has a valuable function. In fact, the amendment is an attempt by the Opposition to undermine the Bill. It is one of many such attempts, as is shown by their amendments, many of which are spurious. We cannot wait to debate them.<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> This is the most breathtakingly stumbling performance that I have ever heard an Under-Secretary give. In the light of the honestly and intelligently argued case of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, it is simply not good enough for the Under-Secretary to decry our motives and to say, “European law says, therefore we must do.” Instead, will he be serious and answer two simple questions? First, what does he understand by the term “may affect trade”? Secondly, what is his understanding of the difference between the words “trade” and “commerce”?<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The provision will apply to any transaction between two parties that is designed to distort or restrict competition in the market. Obviously, a market—whether in goods or services—requires trade; activities between two or three countries will be covered. Of course, the position is clearer in other countries than in the United Kingdom, although we have 25 years’ experience of dealing with the cross-border trade element between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland using article 85. It is our strong desire to ensure that that experience and the expertise that companies have built up in dealing with cross-border trade issues within Europe in the past 25 years is not set aside, which is what deleting subsection 1(a) would do.<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> If subsection 1(a) were deleted, the clause would be strengthened—cannot the Under-Secretary understand that? Under the amendment, the prohibition would relate to any possible agreement or concerted practice that distorts competition. Limiting the provision to practices that “may affect trade” will either do nothing or weaken it. We worry that it will weaken the provision.<P>
The Under-Secretary has a problem—in trying to apply an international treaty to national competition law, he is discovering the hard way that they do not match. The reason why the treaty is about trade is that those who drafted it were trying to keep within the then vires of the European Community and to relate matters to trade between member states. There was a purpose in having an international, rather than a national, body of law. It is not possible to take the exact wording of the international law and apply it as a national law; the wording must be amended to ensure that it works as a national law.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Right hon. Gentleman is making an intervention, not a speech. I ask all hon. Members to make their interventions brief.<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Maxton. I think that I have made my point. The subsection will either do nothing or weaken the provision. We fear that it will do the latter, so will the Under-Secretary remove it?<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I repeat myself—no. If the Right hon. Gentleman could provide a distinction between commerce and trade, he would reinforce his point. However, he cannot provide that distinction because none is made. I understand that no such distinction is made in European law. The term “trade” is widely interpreted as covering all economic activity. For example, a couple of charities organising a flag day, which arguably could affect competition among charities, is unlikely to qualify as affecting trade. That is an important distinction and I want to reassure charities about that.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that the light is beginning to dawn on the Under-Secretary’s argument. Will he clarify that he is arguing that the word “trade” embraces, first, international exchanges between member states of the European Community—which is the point to which my right hon. Friend and others referred—and secondly, domestic economic activity?<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am arguing that in order to comply in full with article 85, the words in subsection (1) (a) must remain in the Bill. With regard to amendments Nos. 20 and 88, clause 60 requires that there should be an appreciable effect on competition for the prohibition to apply. The Director General of Fair Trading has made available draft guidelines that already reflect the test. The text of article 85 contains no express significance or appreciability test. Inserting an express test in the Bill could be interpreted by the courts to mean that we wanted a different result from the EC test, but EC jurisprudence is not written elsewhere in the Bill—<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to catch the Under-Secretary before he moves on to the appreciability test.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a bit late.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that he understands the term “trade” in this context to mean any economic activity? It would help us greatly if he would clarify that.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The answer is yes.<P>
I shall now deal with amendment No. 78 and agreements that place barriers on trade between the United Kingdom and other member states, which could cause serious concerns. Such agreements already come within the prohibition when they have an appreciable effect on competition and trade in the UK and which are implemented in the UK. In any event, those agreements already come within the scope of article 85, which provides a mechanism for dealing with them. When the offending undertakings are outside the UK, the matter is best left to the European Commission which, unlike the UK authorities, has enforcement powers across the whole Community. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): It was fortunate that the Under-Secretary finished his comments at amendment No. 78, because it gives me an opportunity to probe a little further. His words were reassuring, but he must know that there are some classic cases of what appear to be anti-competitive practices throughout the European Community, especially in trade with the United Kingdom. That is the main reason why I tabled amendment No. 78.<P>
I have two examples to which I ask the Under-Secretary to respond. The first involves the motor industry. The hon. Gentleman will know that there is a fantastic distortion in the price of cars that are purchased in other EU countries and in the UK. There are many examples of people trying to purchase cars in other countries and then being blocked because of cartels or deals that are stitched up between suppliers, manufacturers and franchise holders. It is of great concern to me and my colleagues that the UK has long been out of line on prices for motor cars, compared with the rest of Europe.<P>
Despite the Under-Secretary’s words of comfort, we wonder whether the Bill will put a halt to those practices, which have been going on for so many years. There are now cases before the European Court of major manufacturers being investigated by EU officials. Raids on offices of major manufacturers have been made because of concern about anti-competitive practices. I am not sure that we can be satisfied that the Bill will offer the protection to which customers in the UK are entitled. Will the Under-Secretary address the issue of the retail prices of ordinary cars in this country, which are considerably higher than they should be under normal competition rules throughout the EU?<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My second example is another well-publicised and well-documented problem, concerning the clothing industry. The Under-Secretary will be aware that some of the larger supermarkets in this country have been battling for months—if not years—with the suppliers and manufacturers of fashion clothing. Although I am not in the habit of purchasing fashion accessories myself, I am sure that many of my colleagues would like to be able to buy their Tommy Hillfiger baseball caps at a reasonable price from Tesco, rather than having to go to a specific outlet.<P>
It cannot be right that manufacturers, through selective distribution agreements, force up prices by imposing on retailers conditions on the supply and display of their goods. There are many examples of the sort of rules with which shops have to comply before they can be supplied with such goods. I shall mention some examples.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> rose—<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I see that fashion is the buzz word.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am glad to rise to the hon. Gentleman’s bait. Even though I am not a fashion expert, there are those in my family who are. Is the hon. Gentleman entirely comfortable with making those assertions about the limitations on trade in connection with the fashion industry—or indeed, the motor car or design industries—when his new clause 4, which we shall come to later, relates to a specific exclusion of items that are copyright and subject to the tribunal?<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> That is a very good point and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising it. He is trying to trap me in his own inimitable way, but the basic distinction is between a manufactured product in this instance and the intellectual property of a creator, which I look forward to discussing later in the day.<P>
It cannot be reasonable to limit the sale of fashion clothing by imposing restrictions on the retailer, such as the provision of changing rooms, the right ambience, limits on where goods may be displayed and so on. All those restrictions are designed to make it difficult for mass retailers to offer such products at a competitive price and one that the average consumer can afford.<P>
I am sure that there are many more examples, but I mention only the motor and fashion clothing industries. Amendment No. 78 has given me an opportunity to discuss with the Under-Secretary whether the Bill will be effective in stamping out those anti-competitive practices and I very much look forward to his response.<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I appreciate the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) raising the issue because it has attracted widespread concern, but I must correct something. Looking at studies of car prices, there has not been a long-term trend of British car prices being higher than those in other countries. I hope to make available to the hon. Gentleman the information that has been gathered in the past few years on that subject. <P>
The Bill does not extend to, for example, actions by continental car distributors to make it difficult for UK nationals to obtain a supply of right-hand-drive vehicles. That is a matter that is left to the Commission to address under article 85. As the hon. Member for Eastleigh mentioned, the Commission has taken action: a fine in excess of £50 million was levied on Volkswagen for failing to supply a European distributor outside Germany. The Commission has shown that it has teeth; I shall obviously follow with interest any further action that it takes in the interests of European consumers.<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary’s positive response. Is he not concerned that a recent EU report shows that 85 per cent. of the most popular models in the United Kingdom are priced higher than the band that the EU recommends—a maximum of 12 per cent. above the average costs in the European Union? That is happening now, and I am anxious to know whether we will stamp it out in future.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The Commission is considering that matter. Of course car buyers are right to be concerned about being overcharged. As I pointed out, the Commission has taken tough action and levied a substantial fine on a major international car manufacturer for the sort of practice about which the hon. Gentleman complains. Is he suggesting that additional action needs to be taken? We do not believe that that is necessary.<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am not suggesting additional action. My concern is that articles 85 and 96 have been well established in European Union law for some time, and yet the problem remains. I an mot convinced that by incorporating articles 85 and 96 into our law we will achieve a better resolution of the problem.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> There is some evidence that this problem is recent. The survey of car prices across Europe shows that, whereas two or three years ago the price of British cars was not in the top half of the range in Europe, it now is. In the light of the Commission’s decision to investigate the matter, we think it best left to the Commission to apply article 85. It has shown that it can take tough action, and it is not necessary for us to duplicate that. That is why there is no specific provision for such action in the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I suspect that you, Mr Maxton, would not be grateful if we were to widen this debate into a discussion about the present rather abnormal—shall we say—strength of sterling, and its implications for domestic car prices. May I pick up a specific point arising from the exchanges between the Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for Eastleigh? The Under-Secretary helpfully offered to provide the hon. Gentleman with some information. As the matter is of current concern, and not just in the context of the Bill, it would be most helpful if the Under-Secretary would circulate that information to the Committee. We need to understand the background to the decisions that he has made and the arguments that he has advanced.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am willing to circulate any publicly available information as widely as possible, and will certainly ensure that a copy is placed in the Library for the convenience of all Members of the House.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I wish briefly to respond, as the Under-Secretary referred earlier to the two amendments tabled in my name. One would impose an appreciability test; the other would leave out line 4. <P>
I was grateful to my hon. Friends for their support for the amendments, and especially to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, who helpfully elaborated the argument. The Under-Secretary was tested, and his response was interesting. The only example that the Under-Secretary cited to demonstrate the distinction between trade and economic activity was that of charity flag days. How does he intend to define trade under the clause? If there is to be a boundary between trade and that which is not trade, the courts will test that boundary. We may find the example of a charity flag day acceptable, but the courts will try to derive from that example a general proposition as to what is, or is not, comprised within the meaning of trade.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not simply a matter of jurisdiction and decisions of courts, but that of preparing advice for commercial organisations? In-house lawyers or trade-association lawyers will also have to pay regard to the test and reach a workable understanding of what is in the mind of the Under-Secretary in respect of the Bill.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. I expect considerable effort to be put in to test the view of the Office of Fair Trading of what constitutes trade within the United Kingdom. Given his remarks, the Under-Secretary will create a new boundary between that which is trade within the United Kingdom and that which is not. By so doing, he will run counter to the whole purpose and structure of the Bill.<P>
The purpose of the Bill is to prohibit anti-competitive activity. If we are to do that, we must do it properly. Let us have the prohibition under clause 2 (1)(b) that covers decisions, activities and agreements that distort competition. As is implicit in legal and economic discourse, we must understand that competition will be construed by courts as embracing everything that might be comprised under the term “trade” and probably other matters, too. It may embrace professional agreements and charity activities of the sort referred to by the Under-Secretary.<P>
The Bill contains a mechanism that deals with such matters. If it were not intended to prohibit certain activities or agreements that would have the effect of distorting competition, there is a whole structure of exemptions for that purpose. Given that the Bill stems from clauses 2 and 3, it is reasonable for us to want to examine clause 2 with particular care—something about which the Under-Secretary seems irritated. If he is about to import into clause 2 something that is other than a complete prohibition on anti-competitive activity before we consider exemptions and exclusions, it is reasonable for us to want to understand what the boundary will be.<P>
The Under-Secretary has not been put into such a position by choice; he has stumbled into it by accident. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham said, the hon. Gentleman has adopted uniformity of text in pursuit of consistency. But he has done so without regard to the purposes for which the text was written in article 85 of the treaty or to the manner in which it ought to be interpreted into UK statute.<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned one example, but there was the Bosman example—the footballer. Because the matter constituted trade, it was caught. It is important that the words remain in the clause. The Bosman example is more relevant to our debate that the example cited by the hon. Gentleman, which is important in another context.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for making that point. I had forgotten it. He, in fact, has strengthened our argument rather than undermined it. The European Court had to decide whether the Bosman case affected trade between member states. Of course, it did. The case was concerned not only with whether it occurred between member states, but whether it was trade. Within the United Kingdom, our objective is not to try to narrow in on trade activity within the United Kingdom, but to prohibit anti-competitive activities. We would make consistency with the intention of the European legislation more complete by omitting paragraph (a) and resting on paragraph (b). The Bosman case would not arise within the United Kingdom. An agreement designed to distort competition would be prohibited unless an exemption excludes it.<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of clarification, I distinctly heard the Under-Secretary tie his remarks about the Bosman case to the conduct of international trade, which is exactly the opposite of the case that we are exploring in relation to this paragraph and the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend understands the argument, and makes the right point. The Under-Secretary wilfully misunderstands the point of the amendment and our argument. We do not dispute that it is appropriate that article 85 should have a text that specifies “may affect trade between member states”, but there is an implicit danger in importing that language into UK statute law in the proposed form. The danger may not be as great as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset illustrated, but he illustrated for the purposes of argument that trade could be interpreted to exclude commerce. The Under-Secretary is happy that trade comprises commerce, but there are boundaries. Every new example that he throws into the ring, whether it be agreements between football clubs and players, or between charities for flag day collections, is a further reason to remove paragraph (a). Doing so would provide a mechanism in the Bill to ensure that such agreements are not caught by the prohibition, in a way that is much clearer than allowing courts subsequently to try to interpret what constitutes trade within the United Kingdom.<P>
I understand and have some sympathy with the Under-Secretary’s argument that clause 60 is designed to bring EC jurisprudence into the ambit of the operation of the Bill. I do not dispute that it would be a mistake to try to interpret current jurisprudence, to include it in the Bill and to let it stand there, set in stone. As time goes by, further case law in EC jurisprudence will tend to diverge from UK statute law, and problems will ensue. However, I tabled the amendment because I am persuaded that appreciability as a test constitutes not simply EC jurisprudence, but an enunciated principle of the application of the law that is sufficiently permanent that there is a benefit in including it in the Bill.<P>
I disagree with the hon. Member for Eastleigh in that we should do so precisely, using the word “appreciable”. Even to divert from it to use the word “significantly” seems a mistake. The Confederation of British Industry has argued that there is a benefit in doing so: what is being legislated for should be specified in the Bill. People should not have to resort to OFT guidelines to understand its general principles. The CBI argues—I think rightly—that many less sizeable businesses, which do not have competition lawyers constantly at their elbows, may not be clear from the Bill about how appreciability tests will apply, without examining OFT guidelines.<P>
Amendment No. 88 has another purpose, which perhaps I did not adequately explain at the outset. It would be interesting to hear the Under-Secretary’s response. The amendment is framed to test the appreciability criterion in two respects. The first is whether there is an appreciable effect on competition, which is how the test would normally be applied in the European Court, because the Court would consider competition between member states. The second is whether there is an appreciable effect on competition within the United Kingdom. There are, therefore, two appreciability criteria: first, whether there is an appreciable effect on competition, and secondly, whether that effect on competition, if it is appreciable, has an appreciable effect within the United Kingdom.<P>
I am not sure—the Under-Secretary may be able to help us in this—whether the appreciability test, which is referred to only in the most oblique of terms by the OFT, will be applied in both cases—first, if there is an appreciable effect on competition; and, secondly, whether those agreements that have not had an appreciable effect within the United Kingdom will be excluded.<P>
I have listened to the debate. I have heard nothing from the Under-Secretary to persuade me to not to press amendments Nos. 85 and 88 to a vote.<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): I want to speak to amendment No. 20, following on from what was said by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. Appreciability and significance, like reasonableness, can be interpreted in a variety of ways. The Committee has accepted that everything in the Bill flows from clauses 1 and 2. The amendment seeks to ensure that the chapter I prohibition does not apply if the effect on competition is negligible.<P>
Article 85 applies only if the effect on competition is appreciable. We heard from the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire what that appreciable test might be, but the amendment would make it explicit that agreements that do not significantly affect trade should not be unnecessarily subject to prohibition. That will clearly lessen the burden of unnecessary notification.<P>
During the recess, I received a copy of the cost analysis requested at our first sitting. It presupposes that there will not be a huge number of notifications. With no clarification, or without the word “significant”, I suspect that a considerable number of business will seek to ensure that they are not caught by the legislation. The amendment would lessen the burden of unnecessary notification so that it aligns with the proposed costs.<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I want to put two questions to the hon. Gentleman, one about purpose, the other about effect. First, can he distinguish between the terms “significant” and “appreciable”? We would then know the connotation of these terms and their likely effect. Secondly, does the hon. Gentleman seek to ensure that relatively small enterprises, whose activities may not significantly or appreciably impinge upon competition, are protected?<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> There does need to be a degree of protection for small businesses, particularly because of the potential costs of such an exercise. Small businesses are relatively unlikely to be affected significantly or appreciably. We should not make too much of a distinction between those two words. It may sometimes help to have different words in different parts of a Bill; if the wording of individual clauses ever has to be debated, it may add to the sum of people’s knowledge to have two different words that are similar in meaning.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> There is a difference. Even in normal language, “appreciable” is an objective test. If I observe something, it is appreciable: I can see it. However, I may regard it as not significant. In normal language, that which is appreciable is not necessarily significant. Therefore, it is better to use the word “appreciable”, otherwise there is a danger that courts will, in time, arrive at a doctrine of what is significant.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I have some sympathy with that point. However, it might be more helpful to determine what is significant, rather than what is appreciable.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster </B>(Hastings and Rye): On that point, might not the use of the word “significantly” add to the confusion? My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has said that it is not necessary to use the word “appreciable” because what is meant is made clear in jurisprudence. Does the hon. Gentleman mean significant in value, volume or public opinion? Is there not a raft of other possibilities that could cause confusion and uncertainty?<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Something could be significant in all those ways and, indeed, many more. If something is significant, clearly it will come under the aegis of the Bill; if it is not significant, it will not. Businesses will easily understand whether they are likely to become caught up in the legislation if they think that their activity is, or is not, significant in the market in which they operate.<P>
In a debate in the other place, Lord Simon of Highbury said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the competition regime should concern itself only with a situation where the anti-competitive effects of an agreement are significant or appreciable.”—[Official Report, House of Lords, 13 November 1997; Vol. 583, c. 259.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
He used both words in the same sentence. If the Under-Secretary believes that that is the intention of the Bill, it is difficult to understand why it is not stated in the Bill. Perhaps it is because of the Government’s wish to keep the wording in the precise form of article 85. I have been persuaded that trade between countries is different from trade within countries, especially as trading concerns have grown up under different legislation and have been subject to different markets in their own countries compared with those abroad.<P>
If a business is uncertain whether the arrangement that it has entered into must be notified, there is clearly a risk of administrative overload. The inclusion of the word “significant” or “appreciable” would provide at least some means of clarifying whether a business is subject to the legislation.<P>
I can understand the Under-Secretary’s wish to keep the wording precisely to that of article 85 and to keep it as general as possible. However, the burdens that that is likely to place on business will far outweigh those of the cost analysis. The administrative burden that might be created would provide the Commission with work for many years to come. The block exemptions—no doubt we shall debate them later—that will then have to be agreed will begin to remove much of the guts of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Although I have considerable sympathy with the points that have just been made, I should like to speak to amendment No. 85 and return the Committee to subsection 1(a). The Under-Secretary was beginning to be helpful when he described trade as “economic activity” and when he intimated that he was especially concerned about charities, with which the Opposition have huge sympathy. We all accept that charities must be exempted.<P>
Can the Under-Secretary cast more light on what he has said, given the strong points that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire made about the inapplicability of the footballing example? If the Under-Secretary’s main purpose is to limit the scope of clause 2 to non-charitable activities—what we would normally understand as economic activities—why does he believe that it is better to retain subsection 1(a) than to introduce a clearly drafted exemption for charities? We would all accept that and it would clear away the problem.<P>
My second question arises from the Under-Secretary's helpful elucidation of trade as meaning economic activity. If he means what he says—that trade encompasses all economic activity, that returns us to the question raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham. He drew the Committee’s attention to paragraph 4 of schedule 3, which excludes<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“services of general economic interest”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That paragraph also excludes revenue-producing monopolies.<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Under-Secretary could explain what domain remains when we start with a universe consisting of all economic activity, subtract activities of general economic interest and further subtract revenue-producing monopolies. What area of economic activity is left that the Under-Secretary is trying to catch? That is a serious question, not a debating point. It follows from the apt comments made by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), which chime with what I said about costs during a previous sitting. When businesses are considering the possible impact of the Bill and expensive legal consultation, the Under-Secretary’s response to that question will be extremely important.<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am closely following the thrust of my hon Friend’s argument. Does he agree that it would also be helpful, if only for my personal benefit, if the Under-Secretary were also to focus on the word “entrusted” on the one hand and the word  “assigned” on the other? That appears to imply an allocated obligation. I may be over-interpreting those words, but elucidation of their meaning would be helpful, at least to me. <P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I wholly agree with my hon. Friend. That brings me to the third question that I would like to pose to the Under-Secretary, which is also of great importance. In a previous sitting—I have had the opportunity to check that my memory is accurate by referring to the Official Report—the specific issue of the Bank of England and its monetary policy committee was raised. Under repeated questioning, the Under-Secretary made it clear that the Bank of England did not need to be exempted from the provisions because it was never caught by them in the first place.<P>
If that was the Under-Secretary's intended line of reasoning, I take it that the Bank of England cannot be an item that has been “entrusted”—the word that would be used in the context—with a service of general economic interest. That raises great doubt about what is a service of general economic interest. If the Under-Secretary tells the Committee that that was not his intended line of reasoning, and that the Bank of England is a prime example of a body entrusted with a service of general economic interest, at least we will have a better grip on the purpose of subtracting services of general economic interest from the definition of trade—which is general economic activity. It would be helpful to know how wide that definition goes, because I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham that the word “entrusted” suggests a measure of public policy.<P>
I apologise for detaining the Committee on this point, but it will be of real importance to individuals trying to run businesses that they understand the provision.<P>
There is another exclusion from clause 2 in paragraph 7 of schedule 3: the exclusion of public policy. If the Under-Secretary tells us that he needs to exclude charities by means of the trade test, and what he has excluded by paragraph 4—the general economic interest test and the revenue-producing monopoly test, which I find the oddest of all—it remains for him to explain what part of the remaining domain may need to be excluded on grounds of public policy. If the Bank of England and all other such items have already been excluded in full by the general economic interest test, and if charities have been excluded by the trade test, I entirely fail to see why the Secretary of State should be given the discretion to judge that another group of activities should be excluded on grounds of public policy.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> May I clarify a point about charities? Most charities also have trading companies, from which they derive profits. There must be a distinction between charities and charities’ trading companies, which will be caught by the Bill, because they are trading concerns with an economic activity.<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman’s point. I take it that the Under-Secretary will tell us that charities’ trading companies will be caught by the definition in the Bill. But if the route that I am suggesting were followed and an exclusion for charities were made, it could be explicitly drafted so as not to exclude the trading companies associated with charities.<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will clarify what will be left as the economic domain when one subtracts from the economic activity his definition of trade as being services of general economic interest and revenue-producing monopolies. If charities will nevertheless be caught within that domain, why does the Under-Secretary believe that the appropriate way to exclude them is by reference to trade rather than by specific exclusion? Why has the Secretary of State been given the ability to exclude a further set of items—undescribed—on the ground of public policy?<P>

</FONT><B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 84, in page 2, line 5, leave out ‘or effect’.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 83, in page 2, line 5, after first ‘or’ insert ‘reasonably foreseeable’.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the further opportunity to explore clause 2. Both amendments refer to a particular aspect of it. I fear that I shall incur the Under-Secretary’s irritation by prolonging the debate on how the Bill will work, but I shall live under that stricture.<P>
I know that the Under-Secretary will chastise me with the wickedness that would result from accepting amendment No. 84. I recognise that were we to press it, we would end up with a prohibition that would prohibit those agreements that had the object of distorting competition but not necessarily those that had the effect—if not the intention—of distorting competition. I assure the Under-Secretary that such an outcome is not my intention. The purpose of my two amendments is to ascertain how certain eventualities would be dealt with by the Under-Secretary. I am talking in the theoretical sense at this stage because we are debating the general prohibition.<P>
Amendment No. 84 would remove the words “or effect”, so that if an agreement had the effect of distorting competition, but that had not been the objective, it would not be prohibited.<P>
People engaging in a market will enter routinely into a range of agreements intended to promote their position in the marketplace. It is in the nature of the beast that they will wish to gain advantage within the marketplace and, hence, if they were to succeed in the long run that would, in effect, reduce competition. We are dealing with a difficult beast. Given the market’s tendency towards concentration and the desire of competitors to increase their market power over others, there would be a tendency for competition to decline—other things being equal. We are trying to maintain competition in the marketplace by constraining that effect.<P>
A person operating in the marketplace may examine the clause and say, “This is all very well, but my object when engaging in such a practice or making an agreement was to pursue my legitimate competitive interest in a way that was not intended to distort competition, but to give myself a competitive advantage in a legitimate way. Why could the OFT say that, although I have been successful in reducing competition in a particular market, the agreement into which I entered was intended to have the affect of distorting competition and that it will rule it illegal and prohibit it”? The agreement would have been prohibited from the moment when it was entered into.<P>
What will be the effect of the prohibition, given that it will reach back to the point at which the agreement was made? That element of retrospection might have significant adverse effects. If the Committee accepted that and said that it did not necessarily want to prohibit agreements at that stage, we would be creating a distinction and saying that two sorts of eventualities are built into subsection (1) (b)—those undertakings and so on that have as their object<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition”—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
and those undertakings and so on that have as their effect<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
At the moment, the Bill deals with both eventualities in the same light. When we examine exemptions, penalties and investigations, both sets of undertakings will be treated the same, yet in the normal course of events people will treat them differently. It will be said that those who enter an undertaking with the object of distorting competition should incur a penalty from that moment and that their agreements should be prohibited retrospectively. When someone enters into an undertaking without the object to prevent, restrict or distort competition—but it is proven subsequently to have had that effect—that person may argue, with some justification, that he should be treated differently and that the extent of retrospection and penalties should be curbed.<P>
In such cases, perhaps the manner of investigation should be different and confined to establishing that there was no such intention at the outset and to identifying an intermediate point at which it became clear that the effect was to prevent, restrict or distort competition. Otherwise, the undertaking may be the subject of a retrospective prohibition and the penalties may reach back to the point at which the agreement or undertaking was entered into. <P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that an enterprise would be guilty of intending to prevent, restrict or distort competition only if it sought to erect formal or informal barriers to entry to a market?<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I follow what my hon. Friend says. It is true, but only up to a point. I should have thought that both artificially raising barriers to entry to a marketplace and artificially reducing the number of one’s competitors by distortion in such a way as to reduce competitiveness in a marketplace to which there are already considerable barriers to entry—if my hon. Friend follows me—would be covered.<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
 I should like to elaborate on the relationship between amendments Nos. 84 and 83; I assume that the Government will not countenance amendment No. 84 because if it were accepted, we should have to reconstruct the Bill—to set up by way of amendments or new clauses a whole structure to deal with undertakings and so forth which have the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition. I do not imagine that that is the Under-Secretary’s intention.<P>
I tabled amendment No. 83 to test whether the Government feel that it is reasonable for the prohibition to be applied not to all undertakings and so forth that have the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition, but only to those where that effect is “reasonably foreseeable”. The OFT, a court or the Competition Commission would consider not evidence of intention when undertakings were entered into, but whether, given the nature of those undertakings when they were entered into, and the nature of the marketplace—precisely the sort of considerations with which competition authorities are familiar—the reasonably foreseeable effect was to prevent, restrict or distort competition. If, when an undertaking was entered into, not only was there no intention to distort competition but, given the nature of the marketplace and the undertaking, there was no reasonably foreseeable adverse effect on competition, penalties should not be applied.<P>
The point at which an undertaking has such a reasonably foreseeable effect would be the point at which the Bill would bite. If a complaint were made to the OFT and on investigation it found an agreement or activity to be anti-competitive, not only could it impose a cease and desist order, it could look back to the point at which the agreement had such a reasonably foreseeable effect. There would be a degree of retrospection, but only to the point at which the anti-competitive result was reasonably foreseeable. I have explained the amendments in a theoretical sense. My hon. Friends and others may be able to apply them better to particular instances. Amendment No. 83 represents my substantive proposition; amendment No. 84 is its theoretical precursor, as it were. There is a danger if we proceed with the Bill as drafted. When we discuss the chapter II prohibition, we will talk further about what is known as the chilling effect on innovation in the marketplace. There will be a chilling effect on the market if it perceives the rigours of the prohibition on anti-competitive activity to be excessive. It may well conclude that the prohibition is excessive if it bites on agreements entered into from which there was no reasonably foreseeable effect at the time of distorting competition, but which subsequently have such an effect. We know that the penalty level is high.<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that a new enterprise may believe that the existing market is relatively uncompetitive and over-priced, thereby damaging the consumer, and that it should therefore enter the market and seek competitively to lower prices; which activity could damage other enterprises, even though the intended effect was to make the business profitable and to help the customer?<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes his point well. Those who enter a market do so on the basis that the market is insufficiently competitive and that that they can be super-competitive. Such activity often leads to the market being no more competitive than originally, because the super-competitiveness of their activity or product leads to them taking a dominant position. We are now touching on chapter II territory, but even in relation to the undertakings of chapter I, such businesses may have thought of a way of serving the market—through distribution or in other ways—that is super-competitive in relation to that marketplace, but which has the long-term effect of distorting competition.<P>
That brings me back to my concluding point. It would be perverse if the distorting of competition in the long run was interpreted as being an agreement or an undertaking that should have been prohibited at the outset. Such activity should be prohibited only when it is reasonably foreseeable that its effect would be to distort competition.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am conscious that my hon. Friend is about to sit down, but I want to introduce into the argument the consideration that, although there might be a degree of competition at the outset, either contingently—because of the failure of a competitor, which had nothing to do with the new entrant—or for other reasons, such a change in technology, the situation may change over time. Although the current situation may properly be a cause for investigation, it is unfair to tar the new entrant for something that could not possibly have been foreseen at the time of entering the market.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. To get the construction of clause 2 right, it may now be necessary to ask the Under-Secretary to look forward a little and to ask what he anticipates will be the structure of OFT investigations and the application of penalties. The Under-Secretary indicates that he might well do that to help us, if a long-standing agreement had the effect of distorting competition, but was not framed with the intention or object of distorting competition, and which may not have had that effect for a considerable time, it would be wholly unreasonable for a structure of penalties to reach back to the earlier stages, when the agreement was entered into.<P>
I ask those questions of the Under-Secretary, but I shall seek the support of my right hon. Friend and hon. Friends on amendment No. 83.<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I begin by taking the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire one step further. If I do not, the Under-Secretary will respond by drawing the Committee’s attention to Government amendment No. 38, which limits the scope of clause 2 in respect of penalties. The objective test or potentially objective test of object will be replaced by the test of intentionally, which is more difficult to satisfy. If I understand amendment No. 38 correctly, the Minister of State intends thereby to exclude the levying of penalties on that class of people to whom my hon. Friend referred, a class of people who are later shown to have had as their potentially objective object—I am not familiar with that concept, but the Minister of State was eloquent about it at the previous sitting—the intent to distort trade but who did not actually intend to distort trade. Government amendment No. 38 would exclude such cases from penalty.<P>
The problem with such a response to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire is that it takes us some of the way, but not sufficiently far. It would be obnoxious in the extreme to levy penalties on people who were subsequently found by a court objectively to have had certain effects or objects—if one can subsequently be found objectively to have had an object—but who had not earlier intended that effect.<P>
If, at any stage of the Committee, we succeed in drawing the Under-Secretary’s attention to business preference, we might imagine a business that engages in an agreement that is important, perhaps critical, to the conduct of that business. That business did not—and the courts may subsequently accept that—intend to have the effect of distorting competition, and it was not negligent either. Amendment No. 38 is, rightly, designed to exempt negligence, and consequently the business would not be subject to penalties. Nevertheless, there may be a de facto penalty of enormous importance.<P>
I understand that subsection (1)(b) would retrospectively undo the agreement, making it improper and illegal. Under amendment No. 38, it would not do so to the extent of causing a criminal penalty to be levied, but it might expose the business to colossal damages. In circumstances where the business had no intention of bringing about that effect and could not have reasonably foreseen it, the fact that, under amendment No. 38—by the grace of the Almighty or of the Under-Secretary—it is exempted from penalties levied by the courts does not help much if it is driven into bankruptcy by the damages. The Under-Secretary must consider whether he intends to risk exposing to the danger of bankruptcy businesses that had not reasonably foreseen—because it was not reasonably foreseeable—an effect on competition that was later judged by the subjective test of object, or the test of effect, to have distorted competition.<P>
I hope that we can confidently expect the Under-Secretary to respond to those points, unlike my previous points. Lest he be tempted not to respond to my hon. Friend and me, the official record will stand. We would then assume that the courts would read the interpretation that we have conveyed, unless the Under-Secretary refutes that interpretation. It falls to the hon. Gentleman to make clear whether he intends the provision, through retrospection, potentially to bankrupt businesses that could not have reasonably foreseen the consequences of their actions.<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I agree that it is essential that the Under-Secretary responds satisfactorily to those points. Unless we receive a satisfactory response, it is possible that a business that had become unsuccessful, or had been driven into bankruptcy as a result of its own uncompetitive pricing or behaviour, would nevertheless have recourse against a more successful business, no part of whose purpose was ever to damage the one that had gone out of business. That would be an extraordinary state of affairs.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend because his point brings me neatly to my second point. I agree that there is a severe danger. The Under-Secretary should consider the example of the United States. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act—which in many respects is a fine Act; indeed, it is vastly superior legislation to that which is before us—raises some of the same problems. In the United States, it has given rise to a degree and intensity of litigation wholly unprecedented in this country.<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am thinking of the numerous companies that were set up specifically with the purpose of suing A T and T, the then monopolist of the telephone industry. In many ways their purpose was similar to that under subsection 1(b), without amendment No. 84. They had no intention of servicing a single customer. They believed that they could make tens of hundreds of millions of dollars out of the civil pursuit of A T and T. In the end, they proved that they could do so. That occasioned what can only be described as a field day for lawyers.<P>
The estimates of the possible non-recurrent costs of the Bill that I somewhat hazardly advanced during the previous sitting are nothing compared with those that that case engendered. I believe that for five years—it might have been seven—an  entire hotel in Washington was occupied by A T and T’s defence attorneys. I cannot recall the exact cost of the litigation, but I think that it exceeded $1 billion. I admit that that is probably the most extreme case in the history of such things, but there are many cases of a somewhat smaller scale where the legal costs have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. They represent a traditional pattern of activity in the United States under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.<P>
The Bill will give rise to precisely the possibility to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire alerted the Committee. Those who either are or are not bona fide competitors will rely on subsection (1) (b) because they can either exploit it or because they have been disadvantaged in the industry. They will have recourse to the courts to try to recapture through damages that which they would otherwise have been able to make through serving customers but failed to do, either because they did not try or because they tried but failed.<P>
It is of the utmost importance—this is not an academic point—that the Under-Secretary is clear as to whether the phrase<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“have as their object or effect”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
will give rise to the slightest possibility of litigation in bad faith, but in the great hope of profit, in the United Kingdom. Such litigation could severely damage our industry. Clearly, we all want—I assume that the Under-Secretary wants this as much as any of us—the clause not to have that effect, but to capture those who intentionally move into a sphere to destroy competitors and those who do not do so intentionally but have the effect of doing so in a way that is genuinely against the public interest.<P>
Mr. Bercow: Would my hon. Friend care to add to what he has just said those people who do not intend to do so, but who could and should reasonably have been able to foresee that that would be the effect of their activities?<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree that the way to get at those firms that either distort competition intentionally or do something that is against the public interest is to insert the phrase “reasonably foreseeable”. The Under-Secretary might be devoted to avoiding the phrase “public interest” because it does not cohere with European precedent—I see no other reason for doing so.<P>
The reason why that phrase would be effective is not that the firms involved would have reasonably foreseen the action that distorted competition, but that competitors—bona fide, or otherwise—would find it much more difficult to take to court those firms whose effects were subsequently shown to have been anti-competitive, because they would have to show that the reasonably foreseeable test had also been passed. The history of the agreement and what was known when it was made would have to be considered. In other words, it would be a powerful deterrent mechanism against bad faith litigation.<P>
The reasonably foreseeable test would do two things. First, it would mean that those agreements entered into in good faith that were not intended to distort competition, which could not have reasonably have been expected to distort competition, would not be unwound retrospectively. It would protect from bankruptcy those people whose agreements were fundamental to their business and who were acting in good faith.<P>
Secondly, the amendment would deter those who were litigants, either in bad faith or because they discovered subsequently that they had been ill-treated by the marketplace and were seeking to recoup their profits, and make it more difficult for them to pursue the party which had, in the court’s view, distorted competition. Surely the avoidance of the likely bankruptcy of businesses for which the agreements were central to their operation and the deterrent against bad faith litigation are in the public interest.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that British courts are robust enough to deal with the litigant who brings an action in bad faith? Moreover, if loss is to be suffered, is there any reason why, albeit innocently, the loser should not recover that loss from the unjust enrichment of the company that created the unfair competition? Penal damages would not arise in cases of innocent misrepresentation, but actual loss should be recoverable.<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The problem with that line of argument is that none of us has the slightest idea of how the courts will deal with such wholly unfamiliar terms such as “object” or “affect”. At our previous sitting, the Under-Secretary introduced the notion that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“some agreements, by their nature, have the object of restricting competition.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
He said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“What the Opposition must grasp is that the object of an agreement is its purpose objectively considered.”—[Official Report, Standing Committee G, 21 May 1998; c. 70.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Despite having spent some years as a student and teacher of philosophy in Cambridge, I do not know the meaning of having a purpose objectively considered. No doubt the Under-Secretary, or whoever carefully crafted those words for him, had in mind enlarging the scope beyond intention. I do not have the slightest idea how a court would respond to that. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman does either, not because he is lacking in intelligence or ingenuity, but because no human being alive could imagine how a court would respond to it.<P>
“Object” is meant to be distinguished form “effect”. It is an object objectively considered, which is different from effect. At this point, my feet leave bottom. Even those judges who are of the highest intellectual calibre—perhaps higher than any other people in the United Kingdom—may find it difficult to determine what they are meant to do with such a phrase. Given such circumstances, there is real doubt about the matter and there are grounds for hoping that we can litigate successfully.<P>
With, for example, no-win, no-fee litigation, we can imagine the formation of a new class of litigation with which judges were unfamiliar. They may eventually become sufficiently robust to protect us against the evils of enormously costly litigation, but that may take many years. In the meantime, the costs to the United Kingdom economy may wholly outweigh the immediate benefits of the Bill, given that a good deal of competition legislation is already in place.<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> In the short term, the cost would not be only to the UKs economy—important though that would be—but most unjustly to individual enterprises.<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is absolutely right; I am grateful for the latitude given to me by my hon. Friend. It has drawn me back to amendment No. 83, which would protect the individual firm against having its agreements retrospectively—perhaps with the effect of bankruptcy—unwound. It would also protect that firm against bad faith litigation exploiting the ambiguities necessarily embodied in a phrase which means nothing in English to the ordinary person. It behoves the Under-Secretary to explain why—other than because of his steadfast intent to avoid the slightest deviation from the European text—he intends to resist my hon. Friend’s admirable amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): It is known to my hon. Friends—I think that it is known to you, Mr. Maxton, or to your Clerk, and possibly to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)—that I am temporarily acting as an Opposition Whip. One of my favourite quotations from the canons of whippery comes from Winston Churchill’s account of the life of his great ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough, to the effect that the military epitaph of all time on the Margrave of Baden should be that his absence from a crucial field of battle was well worth the loss of 15,000 men.<P>
In my capacity as Opposition Whip, I have been observing the number of Labour Members present. I think that I am correct in stating that until the arrival of the hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward) at 10.45 am, the Government were relying on the Opposition to provide a quorum for the Committee.<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> That was very kind of the Opposition.<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It is a testimony to the Government’s confidence in the assiduity of myself and my colleagues towards the Bill that they have no hesitation in letting great reams of their Back Benchers leave the Room.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster:</B> The Committee is probably entitled to an explanation. The hon. Member for Watford and I were stuck in a lift that was apparently last serviced under the previous Government.<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I have been here a little longer than the hon. Gentleman. It may well be that being stuck in a lift passes for an excuse among Government Members; it certainly would not among Opposition Members. At the risk of digressing, Mr. Maxton, when I was pairing Whip, I once offered a prize for the most original excuse given by one of my hon. Friends. Lord Braine, then Sir Bernard Braine and Father of the House, advanced the excuse that when a Division occurred he had been meditating in a Hindu temple, and the matter had temporarily slipped his mind.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will my right hon. Friend give way.<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I do not want to be led into digression.<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. I noted his comments about the number of Labour Members present. One point that has struck me most forcefully during the past few moments—in the context of amendment No. 83, of course, Mr. Maxton—is that the hon. Member for Watford, to whom my right hon. Friend referred, appears to be sitting in the position customarily occupied by the parliamentary private secretary. I therefore wonder whether congratulations are now in order.<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> When I grew up, parliamentary private secretaries did not utter. I do not know whether that has changed under the current dispensation, but I am confident that the hon. Lady will not interrupt me—<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> But I shall. I should be very grateful if, after some amusing exchanges, the right hon. Gentleman would now return to the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I stand wholly corrected, Mr. Maxton.<P>
In response to previous amendments, the Under-Secretary has been inclined to suggest that our arguments were spurious. The purpose of the Opposition—I include the Liberal Democrat members of the Committee in this—is to protect British business from being sucked into a marsh because of the uncertainties contained in the Bill. The Under-Secretary is occasionally a little disdainful about the points that we are making, but we are also interested in protecting his parliamentary reputation, because that will rest on the legislation that is enacted.<P>
On Second Reading, I cited our operation on the Companies Bill in 1978. My noble Friend Lord Parkinson, who led for the Conservative party on that occasion, said that it was rather interesting—it is one of the glories of the Committee system—that an amendment that does not appear to be going anywhere particularly significant—or even, to borrow the language of the previous group of amendments, appreciable—actually turns out to have fastened on to a matter of considerable importance. That has been amply proved today. My comments are relevant to the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, because the circumstances of the agreement that he cited could not be believed to have had the effect that they subsequently had; it was confirmed only by the movement of events.<P>
<H5>12.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
I now come to my hon. Friend’s reference to “reasonably foreseeable”. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe will remember a previous Committee on which we both served, when I cited the case of the street in which Miss Katherine Whitehorn once lived, which was affected by the building of a motorway box. Miss Whitehorn said that the only house in the street that was specifically affected had been purchased three months earlier by a well-known clairvoyant. Even with the words “reasonably foreseeable”, one enters murky territory.<P>
The case advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire on the potential penalty of retrospection, which was admirably tempered by the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, was wholly convincing. The Committee stands in debt to him for having mentioned it.<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Amendment No. 84 is not a probing amendment, it is a joke—a dangerous joke. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) was wise enough to say nothing at all about it—unlike his newer and less experienced colleagues. Amendment No. 84 would do irreparable damage to the Bill. I challenge the hon. Members for West Dorset and for South Cambridgeshire not to force the amendment to a vote, and to prove that they are not completely and utterly wasting the Committee’s time and dragging matters out.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shall conclude my remarks, and then give way to the hon. Gentleman.<P>
The most serious anti-competitive agreements, such as price fixing and market sharing, have been held under EC law to have the object of restricting, preventing or distorting competition. For example, a joint venture agreement between competitors to develop a new product may not be said to have the object of restricting competition, but the terms of the arrangement could seriously adversely affect third parties wishing to enter the market. We want to ensure that such anti-competitive effects could be tackled under the prohibition. That is what the clause is about.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman once I have concluded my comments on both his amendments. I am being brief, but I look forward to going into the matter in far more depth, so the hon. Gentleman need be in no doubt that I shall willingly give way.<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster was right to focus on amendment No. 83, because it is a serious amendment. It therefore deserves a serious and considered response. Unfortunately, it would significantly reduce the effectiveness of the prohibition regime. I understand the motivation behind it, but I shall explain why it is not acceptable. In doing so, I shall, of course, refer to clause 37; the Committee has already heard of the motives for doing so, and I shall briefly touch upon them in a moment.<P>
It is critical to tackle agreements that have anti-competitive effects to the detriment of United Kingdom businesses and consumers. The foresight of parties is not relevant to whether an agreement is in breach, which is the subject of the clause. An agreement between competitors to share facilities may increase efficiency, but if it prevents new companies from entering the market, it may be seriously anti-competitive, even if such an effect was neither intended nor foreseen. However, foresight is relevant when assessing penalties. The Government have therefore considered the thoughtful comments made in another place and are presenting their own amendment to clause 37. Opposition Members have failed to separate out the need to tackle anti-competitive effects, regardless of object, and give the Director General of Fair Trading the power to examine foresight closely to ensure that penalties can be applied only when he is satisfied that an infringement has been committed intentionally or negligently.<P>
<B>Mr Bercow:</B> Unless I am much mistaken, the principal defect so far in the Under-Secretary’s response to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire is that although he used the word “foresaw”, or the phrase “failed to foresee”, he did not refer to the word “reasonably”. The expression “reasonably foreseeable” constitutes the essence of my hon Friend’s amendment. If other businesses in a sector react uncompetitively and inadequately, surely the initial business that did not foresee and could not reasonably have been expected to foresee should not be subject to penalty or blame for others failure?<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the Director General of Fair Trading will act on unreasonable grounds, he is much mistaken and does not know how the Office of Fair Trading works. The issue is foresight, and reasonableness is involved. We do not specify “reasonable” in legislation to qualify every provision. The question of reasonableness is taken for granted in British courts and by the director general and others.<P>
The hon Member for West Dorset made a substantial point about the United States and the cost of litigation. Many people in Britain are horrified by the cost of litigation. Admittedly, he gave extreme example, but we all know that in all sectors of business and private life in the United States, especially medicine, horrific cases are fought, which involve far more in legal fees than the victim of anti-competitive behaviour or medical negligence ever receives.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Just to pick up and intensify my hon. Friend’s point, we are not worried only about the cost, we are also worried about the potential frequency of, or over-ready recourse to, litigation as a normal means of conducting commerce.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> That would be a legitimate anxiety if the Bill took us in that direction, but there is no evidence in Europe of such American-style litigation. Comparisons with American anti-trust laws are not helpful. The hon. Member for West Dorset is right to raise them, but in the United States there is scope for treble damages and a culture of litigation that I, for one—and I think that I speak on behalf of the entire Committee—would not want here.<P>
Perhaps I was slightly harsh in my opening remarks about amendment No. 84. I know that such amendments are often tabled to take up the Committee’s time. Had I not served in opposition, I should not have recognised that.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I was about to move on, but if the hon. Gentleman wants to say more, he is entitled to do so.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way now, but it would have helped the Committee if he had responded to the debate. I made it perfectly clear that I would not press amendment No. 84 to a Division. I said that the amendment was intended to show that we were dealing with two separate issues and I went on to discuss the substantive point under amendment No. 83. It is discourteous of him to make the speech that he would have made had I pressed amendment No. 84.<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman has taken up the Committee’s time by trying to reverse a key element in the Bill. A failure that has been highlighted by the OFT and, possibly, even by previous Ministers, Presidents of the Board of Trade and Secretaries of State, is that when sophisticated players conspire to distort the market, often there is no evidence.<P>
The key problem is the need to focus on the effect. Removing the word “effect” from the Bill would do untold damage. That is why I urge the Committee to reject amendment No. 84 out of hand and to reject amendment No. 83 on the ground that we shall take foresight into account when penalties are assessed. We shall debate that on clause 37; clause 2 is not the place to do it.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I do not propose to press amendment No. 84, as I made perfectly clear. In responding to the substantive debate on whether the words “reasonably foreseeable” should be inserted before the word “effect”, as proposed in amendment No. 83, the Under-Secretary has not satisfied me or given the Committee an adequate response. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset expertly elaborated the argument that it is not simply a question of penalties. By disallowing the agreement or undertaking from the point at which it was made, we must consider what might flow from that in terms of exposure to litigation and the reversal of the relationship that would have developed over a period. Applying prohibition retrospectively will open up participants in an undertaking, which had no reasonably foreseeable effect of distorting competition, to significant economic disadvantage.<P>
I understand that we are debating amendments Nos. 84 and 83, but amendment No. 38 is also relevant. If amendment No. 83 is not accepted, clearly amendment No. 38 would be better than none at all, but I am not sure that it does the job. People who might have reasonably foreseen that the effect of their agreement or undertaking would be to distort competition could argue that they should not be subject to penalties because that was not their intention and they were not necessarily negligent.<P>
I do not want to anticipate what will happen in that debate, but we are rigorous in pursuing amendment No. 83. We are not offering an escape route. If an agreement or undertaking could reasonably be foreseen to have the effect of distorting competition, it would be prohibited and penalties would apply from that point. That is a better way round of doing things.<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend has made a powerful and interesting case. Has he noticed that under clause 5, the director general must have “reasonable grounds” or “reasonable suspicion” before acting. The Under-Secretary said that there was no need to include the word “reasonable” because it was always assumed. Therefore, it is odd that the word “reasonable” is regularly used elsewhere in the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. The reason the word “reasonable” is used is that its absence would give people an opportunity to avoid the law in precisely the way that the Under-Secretary outlined. He knows that I am familiar with the thinking of previous Secretaries of State on competition policy. Of course, he is right to say that if we were to rely on objects and intentions alone, it would be extraordinarily difficult for investigations to bite on the full range of anti-competitive agreements and undertakings.<P>
No one would doubt that we must consider effects, but equally we cannot rely solely on finding evidence of what people foresaw when they entered into an undertaking or agreement. The court or an investigator must be able to say that a business might or might not have foreseen the consequence of its actions, but it is reasonable that they should have done.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perhaps I can suggest to my hon. Friend, as I have done before, that there might be a consideration at the pre-investigation stage when companies or other bodies are concluding agreements. Even if they are relatively small and unsophisticated, if they have access to legal advice it would be standard practice for their legal advisers to ask them if they had considered whether there might be any effect on competition. It is precisely because one would key that to the test of reasonability that they should and would normally be invited to consider any effect on competition at that time.<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, I think that I agree with my hon. Friend; I would not detract from what he says. I seem to irritate the Under-Secretary every time I speak because I take up the Committee’s time to debate what the Bill is intended to achieve. On this occasion, I make no apology for doing so because the debate has been important. On that basis, and given the inadequacy of the Under-Secretary’s response to the points made about amendment No. 83, I shall press that amendment to a Division. <P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>

Question accordingly negatived.<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 2, line 23, at end insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘, or if it has an effect within the United Kingdom.’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
This amendment would alter subsection (3) so that it would apply not only if an agreement were implemented in the United Kingdom, but if it had<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“an effect within the United Kingdom.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clearly, that rests on the question of whether in practice undertakings or agreements not implemented in the United Kingdom may have an effect within the United Kingdom. I submit that there are such agreements or undertakings. They may be between parties within or outside the United Kingdom, and their intention and legal implementation may be outwith the United Kingdom, but they may none the less have an effect within the United Kingdom.<P>
Of course, the danger is that by such means we may enter the area of extra-territoriality. However, I suspect—I shall be advised if I am wrong—that in the context of the Bill the amendment would not generally be extra-territorial in its effect, but would reinforce the Bill’s intention, which is to bite upon anti-competitive agreements or undertakings that have effect within the United Kingdom.<P>
I freely admit that the amendment was linked in my mind to the deletion of subsection (1)(a), which we discussed earlier and which the Committee rejected. We therefore already have within the clause reference to practices which affect trade within the United Kingdom. None the less, it appears to me useful to question whether the effect of subsection (3) in relation to subsection (1) might inadvertently be to restrict the application of the prohibition. Under the clause as drafted, agreements and so forth that are not implemented directly in the United Kingdom that have an effect here may not be caught by the prohibition.<P>
The Under-Secretary has been at pains to tell us to consider effects rather than intention. The amendment would reinforce subsection (3) and enable us to consider the effects of such agreements in the United Kingdom. The amendment is intended to be elucidatory.<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire stressed that he recognised the dangers  of extra-territoriality, which is a key problem. To come directly to the point, that is why we cannot accept the amendment and why I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.<P>
The amendment would considerably expand the territorial application of the prohibition in a way that would conflict with the United Kingdom’s policy on extra-territoriality in relation to competition. Our policy is not to claim jurisdiction over activities outside the United Kingdom on the sole basis of the economic effects of such activities felt within the United Kingdom. That would be the result of the amendment.<P>
The limitation on territorial scope in the Bill was contained in the draft published by the previous Conservative Government. To take an example, the prohibition would apply to an agreement made in France between two companies to collude on prices that they charged for goods on sale in the United Kingdom. We are satisfied that, in line with the policy that we have adopted, the wording of the Bill will ensure that companies are protected as far as is practicable, but not in all circumstances. We are mindful of the comments of the hon. Member for West Dorset about legal costs, and there would be serious consequences for firms trying to chase costs from abroad.<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his helpful contribution to the debate. Was he saying that, under the Bill, the two French companies colluding in his theoretical example would have an action in a British court, or was he implying that, under the treaty, they would have an action through the European Commission? <P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The prohibition could be enforced in respect of the agreement only if the companies were within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his response. I was genuinely uncertain about how extra-territoriality would apply in such instances. In the light of what the hon. Gentleman said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I beg to move amendment no. 21, in page 2, line 32, leave out ‘part’ and insert ‘definable area’.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 22, in page 2, line 33, leave out “part” and insert ‘area’.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> The amendment would make it clear that an agreement may affect trade in this country even it operated only in part of the United Kingdom. I am still on a steep learning curve in such matters, but I believe that our proposal can be described as a probing amendment. It is designed to find out how the Government define a “part”. I am not nit-picking it is an important point given the businesses that now trade and operate within large areas of this country and Europe.<P>
According to the OFT, a monopoly is defined as<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“a situation where a company supplies or purchases 25 per cent. or more of all the goods or services of a particular type in the UK or a defined part of it.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The clause differs from that definition in that it refers only to a “part”, not a “defined part”. Does a “part” mean a region? Does it apply to local markets and economies? Large supermarkets provide us with a good example. Retail competition—or sometimes the lack of it—takes place essentially at a local level. Many supermarkets have far more than 25 per cent. of the local market. Competition law should reflect the fact that local and regional monopolies exist in food retailing and other trading activities.<P>
Do the Government intend to expand on what is meant by a “part” of the United Kingdom? We suggest that it could be a definable area. We are now moving towards regionality and so on, which may not please some Opposition Members, but the words<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“part of the United Kingdom”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
could be defined, which would bring the full rigour of competition law to bear on local markets.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Great though my affection for the Liberal Democrat party may be, I am unable to advise my colleagues to have any great sympathy for the amendment. As the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall conceded, the proposal is to some extent a probing amendment. However, it has an element of rationality about it with which I have sympathy. England represents about 83 per cent. of the total population of the United Kingdom. If there were to be a provision that differentiated between various parts of the United Kingdom, one that left England as a whole clearly would have a different effect in respect of England than in respect of my wife’s home country of Wales, or Scotland or Northern Ireland. In that sense, the hon. Gentleman is right.<P>
Before I come to the substance of what the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall says—I shall be interested to hear the Under-Secretary’s comments and discover whether he reads the proposals as I do—I should like to pause for a moment. The amendment raised in my mind the possibility that the whole provision may be redundant. If the Under-Secretary is serious in what he says about the attempt to curb anti-competitive action within the United Kingdom, it is not clear to me why it is necessary to include in subsection (7) reference to parts of the United Kingdom.<P>

I appreciate that there is a different—and, I am sure you would argue, Mr. Maxton, a superior—legal system in Scotland; we will no doubt debate that when we reach other clauses. Nevertheless, Scotland is a comparatively small part of the United Kingdom, in terms of population, and it is not clear why a special provision is made within a single market and what is broadly a single body of legislation and jurisdiction. I am not sure that we need subsection (7) at all. However, if we are to retain it, I concede to the Under-Secretary that it may be a suitable half-way house provision, and it is less objectionable to me in principle than the provision for which the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall has just argued.<P>
On my reading of the hon. Gentleman’s proposal, it raises a number of serious problems. <P>
First, it is not clear how one could define an area. I know that the hon. Gentleman was probing and he asked what the Under-Secretary had in mind. Does he have a region in mind? If so, I suppose that I ought to declare a tangential interest, because I happen to live 300 m into my constituency, and into the east Midlands. <P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Metres?<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) complains because I have used a European measurement. I will alter it to 330 yd if that makes him feel more comfortable. I was going to point out in non-metric measurements that my regional headquarters in Nottingham is 100 miles from my home, whereas London is about 70 miles away. Many Members of the Committee will be in similar situations. The more we chop up the United Kingdom into bits that may or may not have much historical justification, the more we give rise to such demarcation disputes.<P>
If we go beyond the legal parts of the United Kingdom as constituted, it is not clear to me how we can possibly define which are the relevant parts.<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend should be reminded that the concept of a part in the context of a nation is at least 2,000 years old. The opening words of Caesar’s “Conquest of Gaul” are:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
For many years in English schools, the standard translation was, “Gaul is divided into three halves.” [Laughter.] There is some ribaldry on the Opposition Benches. My intervention is entirely serious; I am trying to speak to the etymology of the word “part”, and to suggest that it is not a term of art; it has been seriously considered.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am, as ever, grateful to my hon. Friend for his helpful interjection. That is indeed the legal origin of the word “part”. Those of us who were classicists some years ago will hardly forget that, but my hon. Friend has reminded the Committee of it.<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the argument made by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall is further underminded by the hon. Gentleman’s own reference to the word “locality”? Whereas the term “region” is readily definable—although we may not think that it should be defined for the purposes of the Bill—the term “locality” is not readily definable.<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I accept my hon. Friend’s remarks, which intensify the case. If we are to consider the amendment with any degree of favour, we need to know how it would be defined. How would it be defined in terms of the Bill? For example, would a schedule need to be attached to define regions, which might be definable, or localities, which would be difficult to define? Would it be possible for a Minister to add to it by order if he did not like the way in which competition law was working in practice?<P>
I do not want to belabour the issue, but it is still not clear what wrong is being addressed. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall talked about some locally non-competitive practices. I suppose that it is possible to find in some parts of the country certain classes of consumer without ready access to private transport who might be unable to shop at a variety of places. But the impression that I get from constituency cases is one of lively competition, with three supermarkets scrambling to come into the same small town.<P>
It is not clear what will be put right by these provisions. It is not clear either how it would be possible to define circumstances in which it could be shown that there was a case of anti-competitive practice. More to the point, I am concerned that if we effectively further embellish the Bill’s provisions by bringing in some shaky new concepts of locality, which may or may not be definable, we shall impose further burdens and challenges on business as to whether they are compliant with the anti-competitive objectives of the Bill. The amendment would add to the complexity, might add to the confusion and would almost certainly add to the cost. Unless the Under-Secretary provides new insights into the matter, I shall not advise my hon. Friends to support the amendment in a Division.<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> The draft guidance on the geographic market produced by the Director General of Fair Trading, which is available in the Library, is important. From experience of more than 20 years, the OFT has examined regional cartels and anti-competitive practices that operate on an area basis. In order to assess whether an agreement will have an appreciable effect on competition, the director general will have to define the relevant geographic and product market. The term “part” does not limit it. Whether a tine part can constitute a relevant geographic market will depend on the facts. In assessing the relevant geographic market, the director general will make a proper economic assessment of whether one area of the United Kingdom can be said to be a separate market from other parts of the United Kingdom.<P>
The factors that will be used when assessing the geographic market are set out in paragraph 4 of the draft advice, a copy of which is, as I said, in the Library. They will depend on the product involved. In the case of cement, for example, which cannot be transported cheaply over long distances, a regional market might be the right definition. I hope that that explanation is helpful.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his response. He will know that in the past few months I have been interested in the retailing market and the activities of our large supermarkets, all of which have considerably less than 25 per cent. threshold to which I referred earlier, but almost all of which have considerably more than that in the areas in which the local stores operate. It is the combination of all those stores, when added together on a national basis, which keep the supermarkets below the 25 per cent. threshold.  However, they should be considered as individual businesses. If they operate in sparsely populated or rural areas where only one supermarket might be reasonably accessible, they might have as much as 50 per cent. of the market. Therefore, it is extremely important to consider the affect of competition law on such companies, which can use current legislation to ensure that they are not subjected to a referral under the 25 per cent. threshold purely because they have constructed across the national scene businesses that in their locality are clearly in excess of the 25 per cent. threshold. Surely competition law must address such circumstances.<P>
It does not surprise me that 20 years of experience has not shown up that problem because it has taken about 20 years for the large retailing operations, such as supermarkets, to reach their current position—they are clearly dominant in several markets. I hope that the Bill will address those circumstances, which are likely to become less competitive if existing large companies merge further.<P>
The 25 per cent. threshold was reasonable when it was adopted on a truly national basis and where there was an even spread of business throughout the definable part. Those businesses that operate nationally but are concentrated on certain areas must be dealt with to ensure that they, too, are brought into the scope of the Bill.<P>
I accept what the Under-Secretary has said and, as I said earlier this is a probing amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I can see the purport of what the hon. Gentleman is arguing; it is not entirely unreasonable. To get a grip on his motives, may I ask him whether he believes that the purpose of most out-of-town superstores is to prevent, restrict or distort competition or whether it is to serve the public? The distinction is crucial. If they intend only to serve the public, we are concerned only with effects, rather than objects.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The intentions are important, and I am sure that we shall deal with such them when debating other commercial matters, perhaps newspapers. However, we must consider the effects. Whatever the original intention, the effects on the local marketplace must be addressed, even though they are within current legislation on mergers and monopolies, because the phenomenon, which has been built up over the past few years, is developing against the long-term public interest. However, I accept that there are short-term beneficial effects of convenience, choice and price, which are in the public interest.<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Many of us who represent rural constituencies have enormous sympathy with the particular point that the hon. Gentleman is making. However, is he referring to agreements in this context or to the chapter II prohibitions of dominant position? Perhaps I can induce him to return to the argument that he is using in the debate on the appropriate amendment to the chapter II prohibitions—he would then gain our support.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I shall discuss that helpful intervention with my colleagues. There is an important matter to be addressed—if not now, perhaps when debating the provisions on dominant position. As I have said, this is a probing amendment. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
