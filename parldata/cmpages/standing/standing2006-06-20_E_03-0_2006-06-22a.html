&#145;, or
provision,'.</div><a name="06062340000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
clause was added in the other place as a result of the efforts of my
right hon. and noble Friend Lord Hunt. It is an important step forward
in allowing an offer of access to rehabilitation to be made without its
being an admission of negligence, and it is in keeping with the
thinking of insurers and those who advise claimants, such as citizens
advice bureaux. The purpose of the amendment is to add a little extra
clarity by saying that if the offer were accepted the principle would
still stand. I hope that the Minister will accept it.
</div><a name="06062340000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062340000368"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hollobone</b> (Kettering) (Con): I have some comments
to make on clause 2, but as a relatively new Member I seek your
guidance, Mr. Atkinson, as to whether I should make them now, on this
relatively straightforward amendment, or in the stand part
debate.</div>
<a name="06062340000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000369"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think that it would be helpful if the hon.
Gentleman were to continue now.</div>
<a name="06062340000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000370"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. The National Accident
Helpline, which is based in my constituency, has a proud reputation in
the field. It is concerned about clause 2. Throughout the legislation,
it has been concerned about who will be covered by the measures and who
will be exempt. It would like the playing field to be as level as
possible.</div> <a name="06062340000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">On this
clause, the National Accident Helpline wants me to ask the Minister for
an assurance that it will not be possible for the acceptance of an
apology, an offer of treatment or other redress to be made conditional
on the abandonment of any legitimate claim. It would be good to know
from her what protection the Government will put in place to ensure
that the clause is not abused in that way. The National Accident
Helpline is also concerned that the clause might be used by liability
insurers to offer rehabilitation to legitimate claimants in order to
deter them from making a claim. The result of that could be that the
clause would inadvertently discourage access to justice,
because a claimant might accept redress or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 68</div>rehabilitation that is lower than the amount that should be due. The
National Accident Helpline believes that an offer of redress or
rehabilitation should not be taken in all circumstances as a sufficient
or satisfactory alternative to pursuing a claim through the legal
system. That is why it has asked me to seek ministerial assurance on
the matter.</div>
<a name="06062340000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062340000371"></a><b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): I welcome
you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. My hon. Friend the Member for
Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) gave my excuses this morning. I
was at the funeral of a friend and former councillor colleague in
Southwark. I have added my name to the amendment because clause 2 is a
very good clause, and the amendment seeks to clarify one aspect of it
that might be regarded as something that somebody might not want to do
because it might suggest a liability. It adds something extra, and I
hope that the Minister will be sympathetic. It is about ensuring that
people are not deterred from being courteous and humane because they
see that as a risk to liability.</div>
<a name="06062340000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that context, we heard the
terrible report the week before last of the little girl in Aylesbury
who was injured by the side of a road while a large number of people
went past her and did not stop. The proposal is about trying to
minimise that sort of society and ensure that people feel that to
assist others, whether or not they had been involved personally or had
responsibility for the injury or harm of those people, should be
regarded as separate from the later matter of liability. The Minister
may have better ideas, but such an extension would not contradict the
purpose of the clause, which points in the right direction and which we
support.</div><a name="06062340000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062340000372"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Julian Brazier</b> (Canterbury) (Con): Following your ruling,
Mr. Atkinson, and the two earlier interventions, I had intended to make
a brief intervention in the clause stand part debate, but I might as
well make it
now.</div><a name="06062340000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000373"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is such a small clause that it would
be sensible for the Committee to treat the discussion as a stand part
debate.</div><a name="06062340000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000374"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> Exactly. My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering
(Mr. Hollobone) was absolutely right to refer to issues raised with him
by a legitimate employer in his constituency. I seek clarification. I
imagine that the National Accident Helpline earns revenue from
litigation and, as such, has a vested interest in its taking place. If
I am wrong, my hon. Friend will obviously correct
me.</div><a name="06062340000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the views
of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald),
who tabled the amendment. It is a sensible extension. I also agreed
with the good, short speech of the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), who supported the clause in general. Lord
Hunt of Wirral and the others from different parties who proposed it
did the country a great
service.</div><a name="06062340000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
make two additional points, the first of which is particularly relevant
in several areas that are a long way away from those that we discussed
when we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 69</div>debated clause 1. I have been told that often people end up pursuing NHS
cases because they were so angry that they did not receive an apology.
If that were the case, many small cases could, in fact, be
avoided.</div><a name="06062340000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The less
common, but more harrowing, example is that of social services. I
declare an interest as co-chairman of the all-party group on adoption
and fostering. It is incredible that social services departments are
not required to tell the truth when placing extremely vulnerable
children for adoption and/or fostering. Furthermore, in some cases
their insurance companies actually forbid them from telling the truth.
I shall give a specific example. A child may become less easy to place
if the parents are told that the child has been sexually abused. If
that sexual abuse took place around bath time, as is often the case,
the child may as a result be absolutely terrified of going into a
bathroom. If the adoptive or foster parents have not been told, it
makes it much harder for them to look after the
child.</div><a name="06062340000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under pressure
from insurance companies, I am told that it is still quite frequent
practice for social services departments not to disclose things that
should be disclosed about children in their care. As a result of the
clause at least allowing an apology when there has been a failure to
make a proper disclosure, some of the insurance sting can be unwound.
It is a can of worms that Parliament on another occasion needs to go
much further into, but I genuinely believe that the clause will help a
little in that emotional area, which involves a relatively small number
of extreme cases.</div><a name="06062340000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the worries of one or two lawyers that the provision will
mean less business for them. However, if it means that some people who
could have perhaps gone to court are happy to settle with a smile and
an offer of treatment or whatever, it will make a better country not a
less better one, even though it means less money for the
lawyers.</div><a name="06062340000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062340000375"></a><b class="B">Lembit
&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): I support clause 2. My
hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey and the hon.
Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) have covered most of the key
points, together with the mover of the amendment. I have two additional
thoughts on the matter.</div>
<a name="06062340000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment will most benefit
those people who have expertise in a particular area. I know of one
occasion when a male nurse refused to treat somebody in the street in
Newcastle upon Tyne because he said that on account of his specific
medical qualifications, he was more likely to be sued if the individual
chose that course of action. We end up with the tragic irony that those
most qualified to help people in extremis are most vulnerable to being
prosecuted. The phrase &#147;provision of&#148; would be important
in that sense.</div><a name="06062340000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point relates to the humanity of the clause. Many of us, even
when we have not done anything wrong, are inclined to want to apologise
because that is what people are like; people are reasonable and they
care about others, especially when there has been an accident. If we
also take into account the shock and trauma of an incident and the
immediate effects on both the victims and the ones who have perhaps
caused an accident, it becomes obvious that the clause reflects the
human condition in an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 70</div>empathetic way. I am pleased that the Minister has included the clause,
and I hope that she can accept this technical amendment, which will
make it clear that individuals should not feel discouraged from helping
their fellow humans in moments of great
crisis.</div>
<a name="06062340000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000376"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Having heard what you said after I spoke about
this probably being a clause stand part debate, Mr. Atkinson, may I ask
the Minister one point that I would have made later? This request does
not specifically address it, but will she make a statement that makes
it clear that if somebody who clearly was not involved in the original
incident comes across it, for example someone who might offer first
aid, nothing they can do when they are volunteering to assist would put
them in a position where they would be liable for consequential
problems that are clearly attributable to the original incident? She
knows exactly what I
mean.</div><a name="06062340000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remember being
at a constituency function where a former Labour mayor of Southwark was
taken ill. Happily, another councillor, who was a nursing sister, was
able to hold the fort and do things until the ambulance arrived. As it
was a Saturday night, it took a long time to do so&#151;much longer
than people were comfortable with. If the nursing sister had not been
there, the rest of us, who had fewer qualifications&#151;this is a
slightly different point from the one made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Montgomeryshire&#151;might have done what we could with our
first-aid knowledge, as lay people; we would not have used the
professional knowledge of doctors or
nurses.</div><a name="06062340000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful if a statement were made about what the liability risk of such
people is, because we clearly want to encourage people who are not
professionals to do what they can. That is not an invitation for people
to act ridiculously, foolishly or stupidly, but if people are seeking
in good faith to alleviate somebody&#146;s illness or injury, the
message ought to be that it is to be encouraged; good citizenship
requires it.</div>
<a name="06062340000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000377"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
(Bridget Prentice):</b> This has been a short but important
debate. I welcome the addition of this clause in the other place. I am
grateful to the noble Lords who tabled it. My noble Friend the Baroness
Ashton of Upholland was willing and happy to accept it. I have sympathy
with everything that has been said in this debate. The idea that we
should be more comfortable with giving an apology straightforwardly and
straight away would alleviate much of the angst that people have in
relation to accidents and so on. I agree that it will help to develop
that attitude of good citizenship that we all
support.</div><a name="06062340000337"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="06062340000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, I am not entirely convinced that the amendment is necessary,
mainly because in practical terms the provision of any treatment would
almost inevitably be preceded by an offer of treatment. It is difficult
to see how it could then be reasonably argued that the provision of
treatment that was offered and accepted would amount to an admission,
when the offer itself is not. I will give way to the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire; I think he might be about to give his roadside
example.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000378"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> To save time, I shall make this point early.
I accused the Minister of being pedantic in wanting to cover everything
when resisting previous amendments. I now accuse her of being the
opposite. I can give one example where an offer of help cannot be made:
when the person is unconscious. It is necessary to make a judgment
about providing medical help at that moment, regardless of the presumed
wishes of the individual. I will not pursue that with the Minister: she
understands my point. The Government are being a little intransigent. I
suggest that that is a materially important reassurance, for all the
reasons given by the various speakers.</div>
<a name="06062340000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000379"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> A little unusually, I accept what the hon.
Gentleman has said. If he will allow me, I shall think about that
aspect of the reasoning behind the amendment, and perhaps get back to
him on Report. Given what has been said, such a provision may need to
be added to the Bill.</div>
<a name="06062340000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Kettering
raised a constituency point. Basically, it is important to know that if
someone says, &#147;I am offering you this treatment on the basis
that you do not pursue your claim&#148;, it is entirely a matter for
the claimant to make a decision as to whether they accept the treatment
or not. Clause 2 does not affect the basis on which an apology, offer
of treatment or other redress may be made, or indeed how it may be
accepted.</div><a name="06062340000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000380"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> Briefly, following the extremely welcome remark
that the Minister made, I should like to reinforce the comments by the
hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. We received some particularly telling
testimony&#151;I am not sure that I could find it, two years
on&#151;from the St. John Ambulance brigade making precisely the
point that he made, during the failure of progress of my private
Member&#146;s Bill.</div>
<a name="06062340000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000381"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
point. I was thinking of the St. John Ambulance as an
organisation that might well find itself in such a situation on a
fairly regular basis. Of course, it should be emphasised that anyone
who provides treatment should only provide treatment for which they are
appropriately qualified. They would be subject to all the other
associated caveats. I leave it there, and I am happy to think again
about this particular amendment and what it will add to the
Bill.</div><a name="06062340000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062340000382"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Hamilton</b> (Midlothian) (Lab): I realise that the
Minister is finishing, but I would like her to consider this point. I
passed my first aid test in the 1980s, on the St. Andrew&#146;s first
aid course. The very day after I passed the test, a motorcyclist went
over the top of a car. If I had just passed my test now, I would have
the same concerns that have been expressed today. I had none at that
time and I held on to the person until the ambulance came along. I
would ask the Minister to consider that
issue.</div><a name="06062340000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000383"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Again, we have an example of a member of the
Committee with direct experience in this area, and it is for the
reasons stated that I will consider the
matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000384"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The Minister is being very helpful and I am
grateful for her offer. I hope that she will be able to make a
statement that covers the potential risk in an authoritative way. It
will be very helpful for the Red Cross, St. John Ambulance and all the
other people we are concerned
about.</div><a name="06062340000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000385"></a>Bridget

members want them to
have.</div><a name="06062340000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000386"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000389"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> This group of amendments is all about ensuring that
the regulation of claims management services is comprehensive. It is
clear that self-regulation has not worked in this field and I welcome
the Government&#146;s decision to pass legislation that will
effectively regulate claims management services.</div>
<a name="06062340000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to concerns raised
by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in the Lords
and the Regulatory Reform Committee in this place, the Government have
passed a significant number of amendments to what was originally
proposed. Basically, that has ensured that some of the key points are
in the Bill rather than leaving them to secondary legislation. I
welcome that. The Minister who dealt with the matter in the Lords was
very constructive.</div>
<a name="06062340000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The growth in the claims
management sector came about as a result of the Government&#146;s
decision to pretty well abolish civil legal aid as it then operated and
establish conditional fee agreements. As members of the Committee will
know, civil legal aid has seen its budget reduced by 24 per cent. in
real terms and considerable difficulties have been highlighted by the
Access to Justice Alliance. Amendment No. 15 tackles the problem that
two kinds of services appear to be referred to in the Bill: regulated
and unregulated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 73</div>services. The effect of removing the word &#147;regulated&#148;,
which is what I suggest, is that clause 3(1) would read, &#147;A
person may not provide claims management services unless&#151;(a) he
is an authorised person, (b) he is an exempt person&#148; and the
other provisions would then apply.</div>
<a name="06062340000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question for the Minister
is: what are unregulated claims management services? The word
&#147;regulated&#148; has not been used by accident. The
implication is that there must be such a thing as an unregulated claims
management service, and as the Minister knows I am concerned that the
Government might have worded the clause so as to ensure that some
bodies that deal with claims management, such as trade unions, are
exempt. If so, it is hard to see how that fits in with the clause on
exemptions. I would be interested if the Minister clarified why the
word &#147;regulated&#148; is
used.</div><a name="06062340000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The president of
the Chartered Insurance Institute, Mr. Hales, has branded claims
management firms as a national disgrace and blamed them for the surge
in unjust and vexatious complaints against life offices and advisers.
The Law Society has talked of the significant body of evidence that the
public need protectionfrom unregulated claims companies who
employ unacceptable practices such as cold calling, aggressive selling,
insurance mis-selling and encouraging all kinds of frivolous
claims.</div> <a name="06062340000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Constitutional Affairs report on &#147;Effects of
advertising in respect of compensation claims for personal
injuries&#148; supports that view and shows that claims management
companies employ unacceptable practices. Chart 11 on page 22 of the
report shows that 20 per cent. of those who made a claim found out
about their claims management company from an unsolicited phone call,
18 per cent. did so from television adverts, 17 per cent. were
approached in the street and 3 per cent. were approached while in
hospital. Clearly we do not want the concept of the ambulance-chaser to
become established in our country, and therefore firm regulation is
needed.</div> <a name="06062340000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is no
surprise that companies target the area in an aggressive way. If we
consider the endowment business, the Boleat report states that
insurance companies estimate that there will be about a million
endowment compensation claims this year, with a typical compensation
figure of &#163;6,000. That is obviously very lucrative for claims
management companies and, as the Boleat report notes, all they have to
do is write one letter in order to get the money. About 30 per cent. of
claims come though the claims management companies, which are taking 35
per cent. plus VAT on each transaction.</div>
<a name="06062340000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Claims management companies can
expect to earn hundreds of millions of pounds through such claims. It
is a serious and urgent problem, and in drawing up the legislation we
must avoid any loopholes. That is why I should like the Minister to
explain &#147;regulated&#148;.</div>
<a name="06062340000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 18 is small, but
it would add &#147;or other&#148; after &#147;legal&#148; and
therefore affect the processing of &#147;a legal or other&#148;
claim. The idea is to be comprehensive, but there is no doubt that
insurance or administration, which was not directly legal in every
aspect, could be considered a part of claims management
companies&#146; work. As the Minister will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 74</div>recall, when Claims Direct and the Accident Group were taken through the
courts, they argued that they were insurance services and therefore
exempt.</div><a name="06062340000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
19 is again designed to be comprehensive. If it were accepted, clause
3(3)(a)(iii) would read &#147;referring or introducing one person to
another,&#148; and would be followed by a new sub-paragraph,
&#147;any service offered for money or money&#146;s worth to
persons bringing claims&#148;. Adding those words would catch those
people who carry out what are effectively claims management services,
but who carefully do not present themselves as so doing. It would still
exclude those who provide free advice.</div>
<a name="06062340000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not too far-fetched to
imagine in a sector as inventive as the one under discussion that
claims management companies seeking to avoid regulation may move into
the rehabilitation sector and then provide all the other services as an
ancillary service. I dare say that the Minister will tell me that the
provision is inclusive and not exhaustive, but we must be careful.
</div><a name="06062340000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000390"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I support the amendments. They all seem to go in
the right direction. I said on Second Reading that we should have as
little legislation as possible in this country. We legislate far too
much. The problem is often with administration, and if we administered
better we would need to legislate less. I approach all legislation on
the basis that we should not legislate unless we absolutely have to and
we are persuaded by the evidence. There are sufficient considered views
about the issue in part 2 to make it appropriate to legislate, and
therefore to regulate.</div>
<a name="06062340000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noticed&#151;amusingly but
understandably&#151;that at the end of our discussions about part 1,
civil servant team A departed and the Bill team for part 2 arrived.
There are clearly experts on this sector here to assist the Minister,
and no doubt they have had many issues to consider as the
Constitutional Affairs Committee and others have reported. The
Government have been under much non-partisan pressure to regulate this
area. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire broke down using a
verbal pie chart the ways in which the literature comes our way: being
stopped in the street is one way; and others include advertising, and
the stuff that one picks up in shops or finds in newspapers.</div>
<a name="06062340000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are making a rod for our own
back if we start part 2 with &#147;Claims Management Services&#148;
and then state that it will deal with regulated claims management
services only. There could be a wonderful debate about what a claims
management service is, but it is better to have one such debate, and if
necessary leave it to the courts, rather than two, the first being
about whether something is a claims management service, and the second
about whether it is regulated.</div>
<a name="06062340000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying to deal with an
abuse of the free market in which person A or company A exploits person
B or organisation B. We ought to catch all the fish in the net, not
start to limit the definition in the title of the clause. I
see where it goes: one looks for the definition of regulated, and in
typical legalese, subsection (2)(e) says that</div>
<a name="06062340000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;services are regulated if they
are&#151;&#148;</div><a name="06062340000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">and we get a
circular
definition&#151;</div><a name="06062340000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of a
kind prescribed by the Secretary of State&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 75</div><a name="06062340000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We immediately set ourselves up for
secondary legislation, which the Secretary of State must produce and to
which Parliament must agree. The alternative definition is that
services are regulated if they
are</div><a name="06062340000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provided in cases or
circumstances of a kind prescribed by
order&#148;.</div><a name="06062340000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, there is
only one way forward: secondary legislation. It is better that we
define a claims management service and then leave it, letting the
market decide. If there is a debate in court over whether something is
a claims management service, we should let that
happen.</div><a name="06062340000338"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="06062340000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last reason
is that, as the hon. Gentleman hinted, it is impossible to think ahead
to how such things might happen. At the moment, we are thinking mainly
of people who advertise on television, radio, hoardings and flyers. In
the age of the internet and e-mail, people could proffer such services
there, but they could also do so in other ways. A weekend community
event in any of our constituencies could be sponsored by an individual
or a company that wanted to advertise in a different way by selling
something at a
stall.</div><a name="06062340000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am worried
that if we start trying to define this by regulation, we will always
have to be regulating. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment,
resist over-prescription and over-definition, and try to ensure less
unnecessary work for Parliament and lawyers, and less secondary
legislation, which would be
void.</div><a name="06062340000073"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000391"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> There seems to be confusion in the
Government&#146;s mind about who should be covered by the draft
legislation. That concern has been relayed to me by the National
Accident Helpline, based in my constituency. I shall relate the angle
from which it considers the Bill, particularly clause
3.</div><a name="06062340000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the National
Accident Helpline was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for
Canterbury, I shall clarify that it provides initial free advice to
people who have suffered a personal injury and facilitates their
contact with a quality solicitor who can advise them on the merits of
their
claim.</div><a name="06062340000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062340000392"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Kevan Jones</b> (North Durham) (Lab): I am interested in the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about initial advice. Does the claims
management company give legal advice? If so, does it employ people
legally qualified to do
so?</div><a name="06062340000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000393"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. Yes, the
company employs law graduates to provide initial advice. It is almost
like a first-aid legal service for those people before they are passed
on to
solicitors.</div><a name="06062340000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000394"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> That is not a clear-cut answer, because there are
law graduates and many people with law degrees who are not qualified
solicitors covered by the Law Society. Who regulates such
individuals?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 76</div><a name="06062340000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000395"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> That is a good question, and I shall undertake
to give the hon. Gentleman a definitive answer in
writing.</div>
<a name="06062340000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000396"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> Does that not explain the underhand way in which
such companies operate? They are trying to give the public the
impression that they are some type of legal organisation when clearly
they are not, if they are not employed or governed by the Law Society
as firms of solicitors are. Is that not exactly why the sector needs
regulation?</div><a name="06062340000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000397"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> That is exactly the point. We need regulation,
and the National Accident Helpline welcomes the Bill. It wants a level
playing field so that as many organisations involved with claims
management and legal services as possible are brought under the same
regulation. It is concerned that the Government&#146;s thinking in
introducing the Bill is not clear enough in the definitions of who
should be caught by its provisions, particularly clause 3. I shall come
back to the hon. Gentleman with the answer to his
question.</div><a name="06062340000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The helpline
is not a claims management company, but it will be caught by the Bill.
It has a very good reputation in the field, and its intention is to
ensure that genuine accident victims can access justice and are
protected from unscrupulous players in the market. The helpline has
been working closely with the Department for Constitutional Affairs in
the drafting of the Bill, which it sees as a valuable opportunity to
introduce quality regulation to the marketplace to tackle disreputable
practice. I am sure that we all agree that such practice has damaged
the sector&#146;s
reputation.</div><a name="06062340000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000398"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
fierce defence of an organisation that I do not think can be defended.
Will he tell me why someone who has had an accident should not go
directly to a solicitor who has expertise and legal knowledge of
accident law? Why should he have to go through a middleman such as the
National Accident Helpline, which has no legal qualification and acts
as a barrier between the claimant and
justice?</div><a name="06062340000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000399"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> My understanding is that there is no obligation
for anybody to access the National Accident Helpline. Anyone can go
straight to a solicitor if they so
wish.</div><a name="06062340000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000400"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Surely we should avoid as often as possible
sending people to
lawyers.</div><a name="06062340000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000401"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b>
No.</div><a name="06062340000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000402"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I clearly have different
views, but if somebody can go to an organisation that can give
preliminary advice&#151;I am not defending this particular
organisation, but there are citizens advice bureaux and all sorts of
other places&#151;the last thing we should do is expect anybody to
talk to a lawyer when they want first advice. The lawyers should come
last in the list&#151;and I am a
lawyer.</div><a name="06062340000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000403"></a>Mr.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 77</div><a name="06062340000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000404"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Hollobone, you had better have the
Floor.</div><a name="06062340000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000405"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I am grateful for the
intervention.</div><a name="06062340000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
makes it clear that the detailed implementation of regulation will take
place via secondary legislation. During consideration in the Lords and
in the response to the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee, the Department made considerable progress in fleshing
out some areas of the Bill and providing more detail on how it was
envisaged the regulation would work. The National Accident Helpline is
concerned that there is a need for greater clarification in a number of
areas&#151;in particular, who is covered by the
legislation.</div><a name="06062340000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000406"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend will put me right if
I am wrong, but is not the National Accident Helpline made up of
solicitors? It is a network of solicitors, and it has solicitors in
each part of the country. Someone ringing up the helpline is told which
one is in their locality. It is not right to think of the helpline as
an operation independent of
solicitors.</div><a name="06062340000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000407"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend is absolutely
right. Perhaps I may copy him in on the correspondence that I will have
with the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr.
Jones).</div><a name="06062340000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062340000408"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Michael Clapham</b> (Barnsley, West and Penistone) (Lab): On
the back of the previous intervention, if the National Accident
Helpline is a network of solicitors and acts to garner claims that go
out to various areas, where do its fees come from? Are they levied on
the claimant who telephones it for help, are they deducted by the
solicitor and paid back to the National Accident Helpline, or is the
payment made in another
way?</div><a name="06062340000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000409"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I do not want to put on the parliamentary
record an inaccurate answer to that legitimate and detailed question,
but I undertake to ask the National Accident Helpline, in writing, to
contact the hon. Gentleman and outline its fee
structure.</div><a name="06062340000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062340000410"></a><b class="B">John
Mann</b> (Bassetlaw) (Lab): I am sure that the hon. Gentleman
will be able to answer this question: what is the remedy for a consumer
complaint if a consumer is unhappy about the action taken or advice
given by the
helpline?</div><a name="06062340000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000411"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> That is one of the elements of the Bill that we
are discussing. Whatever arrangements apply to the National Accident
Helpline under clause 3 should also apply to all the other
organisations covered by the
clause.</div><a name="06062340000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000412"></a>John
Mann:</b> Just to clarify my question, what is the remedy for
the consumer under current
law?</div><a name="06062340000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000413"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I do not
know.</div><a name="06062340000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000414"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I shall try to keep my intervention to two
sentences. The answer to the question put to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 78</div>hon. Gentleman is that the first stage is that people get free advice
over the phone&#151;that advice is not regulated and is given by a
law graduate&#151;and they are then passed on to a solicitor who is
regulated in the same way as every other solicitor. That is how the
National Accident Helpline works. The measure would regulate it from
the beginning of the process and not from the second stage.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> No, the first stage is
free.</div><a name="06062340000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000415"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I confirm that when customers phone the
helpline, the initial advice given to them is free. There is no charge
for it. If they go on to engage with one of the solicitors in the
helpline network, there is a fee at that
stage.</div>
<a name="06062340000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000416"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> Those are important points. What happens if someone
rings the helpline and is put in touch with a law graduate, which is
what the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey described the
individuals as being, and that person gives the wrong advice? Who
regulates the advice that that person gives? Clearly, the solicitor is
regulated as a solicitor. A law graduate might be involved, but clearly
they are not so regulated. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw
(John Mann), I am intrigued to know what the payment situation is
between the helpline and the
solicitors.</div><a name="06062340000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000417"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> Absolutely. That is why it is appropriate to
answer the questions asked by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member
for Bassetlaw in the best way, which is by asking the National Accident
Helpline to write to them with the details of its
structure.</div><a name="06062340000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could
make the same point about citizens advice bureaux. I used to be a
volunteer at the Kettering bureau. I do not know what the complaints
procedure is if someone goes to a citizens advice bureau and a
volunteer gives the wrong advice.</div>
<a name="06062340000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000418"></a>John
Mann:</b> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, whom I thank for
giving way for a third time, we are attempting to legislate. It is,
therefore, not good enough for him to say, &#147;I will get a third
party to write to you.&#148; We are expected&#151;perhaps even this
afternoon&#151;to make decisions on the clause, so the question is
fundamental. What are the consumer rights? The financial relationship
is also fundamental. Are the consumer rights proposed in the Bill
sufficient in their strength and breadth to ensure full consumer rights
at all stages? That question is fundamental to the issue at stake this
afternoon.</div><a name="06062340000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000419"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000420"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before the hon. Member for Kettering
continues, I must point out that he is not responsible for the National
Accident Helpline. We are in danger of extending the debate too
widely.</div>
<a name="06062340000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000421"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I am happy to take
interventions, but as you rightly say I am not employed by the
helpline. I speak on its behalf as its constituency MP. However, I do
not think that the hon. Member for Bassetlaw and I disagree. We are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 79</div>talking about bringing in new legislation to cover a variety of
different organisations and individuals who work in the sector, among
them the National Accident Helpline. The fundamental points that the
helpline is asking for are that the playing field be as level as
possible and that the definition of who is captured by the Bill be
comprehensively examined by Parliament before the law is
passed.</div><a name="06062340000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The helpline
has been working constructively with the Department to consider the
model rules for authorisation that set out which claims, management
activities and business models will be covered by the regulations. The
definition is extremely broad. Clause 3 mentions those who provide
&#147;financial services or assistance&#148;. That could cover
individuals going from door to door and street canvassing, but the
broad definition could also cover before-the-event insurers, who manage
and sell claims to solicitors; liability insurers involved in third
party capture of claimants who are not their policy holders, to divert
them from independent legal advice; individuals passing on claims to
solicitors for reward; and, potentially, even banks and bank managers
involved in arranging litigation
funding.</div><a name="06062340000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department&#146;s thinking on breadth in relation to those who will
be covered needs to be probed further, which is what we are doing this
afternoon, to ensure a level playing field. The helpline is firmly of
the view that the Department needs to give more clarity on who it
intends to be
covered.</div><a name="06062340000339"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="06062340000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently, it
is envisaged that it will be the responsibility of personal injury
lawyers to ensure that the conduct of individuals introducing claims to
them complies with business rules. The helpline believes that
individuals who seek out and pass on &#147;warm&#148; leads are
often the most disreputable players in the sector and that their
activities have caused much of the damage to its reputation that the
Government are trying to tackle through the
Bill.</div><a name="06062340000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The helpline
contends that it is unrealistic to rely on solicitors receiving leads
to investigate sources and methods and to regulate them. To exclude
such individuals from direct regulation could be unjustified and
potentially greatly damaging to the effectiveness of any new regulatory
regime. Expecting other authorised businesses to be responsible for
policing such individuals would not be
effective.</div><a name="06062340000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000422"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I have some sympathy with that argument, because I
think that one of the biggest scandals of the Law Society and the
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease scheme, and its involvement in
claims handling, is that the Law Society and lawyers have not been
careful about whom they deal
with.</div><a name="06062340000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman said, however, that the National Accident Helpline should not
be covered and that it is different from other types of claims handling
organisation. Will he give evidence for how it is different? It
advertises nationally, and the people who give the initial advice are
clearly not legally qualified, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div>so why should it have a different status from that of the doorstep
sellers whom myself and other hon. Members have come across in the COPD
scheme?</div><a name="06062340000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000423"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I think that it was asking not for a separate
status, but for the Government to define who is going to be caught by
the legislation and to ensure that those engaged in the sector are
regulated to the same level. That is the point that the helpline wants
to get across. And that concludes my
remarks.</div><a name="06062340000115"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000424"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I would like to say a word or two prompted by that
exchange. Again, I hold no brief for these people, although they sent
me one like they did others. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for
North Durham (Mr. Jones) must not be ridiculous. He must assume that we
all act in good faith unless he has reason to believe otherwise, rather
than make gratuitous and potentially offensive comments that have no
base.</div><a name="06062340000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand
it, the helpline is a confederation of companies that set up, as it
were, a collective access point for their service. It acts as many
other companies do; if a person phones a solicitor&#146;s office,
instead of getting through to a solicitor first time, they will
normally speak to a non-qualified person, after which they might get
through to a legal assistant. In the bigger firms, it might take a long
time to get through to a solicitor. They will have someone with some
legal expertise giving initial advice who then passes people on to a
solicitor. That seems to be a perfectly valid way for solicitors to
work together as a co-operative or
collective.</div><a name="06062340000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
liability, my understanding is that although a person who answers the
phone and gives the initial advice is technically employed either by
the company in question or one of the solicitor&#146;s firms, they
will be governed by the liability of the solicitor&#146;s firm. The
helpline is saying that it wants to be governed by the claims
management service. It never said that it does not; it said that the
sector should be regulated. It is perfectly happy to be within the
system, but is seeking to ensure that everybody doing the same job is
equally regulated by claims management service
systems.</div><a name="06062340000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000425"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I totally disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I see
no purpose for such organisations. He said that if a person goes to a
solicitor they do not talk to one directly, and that it correct, but at
least the advice that they give is covered by Law Society
rules.</div> <a name="06062340000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those other
people are frankly just middlemen. That is the important thing. I wish
that the hon. Gentleman would listen to some of the horrendous cases
that I and other Members have had to deal with. Claims handling
companies, including the one that we have been discussing, are not
making it clear that they are not solicitors. That is the important
point and the reason why they need to be regulated. Is he advocating
the company only on the basis of a brief that he has been sent? He
should do more research before fiercely defending an organisation about
which he clearly knows
little.</div><a name="06062340000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000426"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I want to make it clear that I am not an advocate
for that organisation at all.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 81</div><a name="06062340000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000427"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> You are doing a good job of
it.</div><a name="06062340000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000428"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am seeking to ensure that we have a debate on
the facts. Other organisations such as Citizens Advice, the Association
of Personal Injury Lawyers and others have written to me about the
Bill. The company that we have been discussing has no more influence
over me than anybody else. I form my own views, and I hope that the
hon. Gentleman does
too.</div><a name="06062340000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
argument is as follows. Of course the Law Society regulates lawyers and
those who work for solicitors&#146; companies. In the past, that has
not been a happy and successful operation. The number of complaints
against solicitors has been legion, the handling of the complaints has
been lousy and until recently people often got a bad deal. For many
years I had many reasons to complain about solicitors on behalf of
constituents.</div>
<a name="06062340000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mercifully, there is to be an
independent regulator of solicitors, as there should have been a long
time ago&#151;especially for those who use public money. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will also consider the evidence showing that over
the years solicitors have not had a good track record in doing their
job properly all the time, giving good advice or being regulated. The
Legal Services Bill, introduced by the Minister the other day, seeks to
put that right, because the Government have at last been persuaded that
in-house self-regulation has not done the job
properly.</div><a name="06062340000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000429"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for
Bassetlaw that for the past two years in a row a record number of
complaints have been made to the Law Society about
solicitors.</div><a name="06062340000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000430"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is right. We agree about that. The Minister
and the Government have moved down that road.</div>
<a name="06062340000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to be clear, let me say
that the organisation made no suggestion that it wanted to be outwith
the system; it wants to be inside the system. My understanding is that
it is making the simple, general point that all those who act as
intermediaries should be within, not outside, the system.</div>
<a name="06062340000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are organisations with
very good reputations, such as Citizens Advice. The bureaux are made up
not only of lawyers; I regularly use mine and refer constituents to it
in respect of all sorts of matters. Some who work there are lawyers;
some are not. Some are experts in giving people advice, including about
personal injuries, benefits and immigration. One does not have to be a
lawyer to be an expert, and one certainly does not have to be a lawyer
to judge where it is appropriate to pass a case. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will be fair to such organisations, which are not made up
only of lawyers or those employed by
them.</div><a name="06062340000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000431"></a>Mr.
Clapham:</b> The point that we are seeking to make, of which
the hon. Gentleman would have been well aware if he represented a
mining community, is that since the COPD and vibration white finger
schemes came into being, there has been a great proliferation of such
claims firms, which in many circumstances levy very high fees on the
person who seeks advice. They 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 82</div>then merely put the case to a solicitor. A person seeking advice on how
to pursue a claim for damages can go immediately to a solicitor; there
is no need at all for the
intermediary.</div><a name="06062340000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000432"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point and
I know about his exact complaint. Companies have taken money off people
and given them no service, no good service or no competent
service.</div> <a name="06062340000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
the Home Office list, I deal with the second highest number of
immigration cases of any MP; my neighbour, the Minister of State,
Department for Constitutional Affairs, the right hon. and learned
Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), has the highest. For
many years, I have regularly asked people at my advice surgeries
whether they were seeing a lawyer. When they say yes, I say that they
should not. People normally get bad advice; the lawyers ask for money
up front. Incompetent people who are not lawyers sometimes work at
lawyers&#146; firms, and although the system is regulated, a lot are
rogues and vagabonds who ought not to be doing the
job.</div><a name="06062340000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000433"></a>Mr.
Clapham:</b> That could be the London
experience.</div><a name="06062340000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000434"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> It is absolutely the London experience. So I am
entirely sympathetic, because in the days when there were docks in
Bermondsey, and many dock workers, there was a comparable experience.
Huge numbers of my constituents were members of the Transport and
General Workers Union and worked in the docks. Generally, if people
were wise, they would take their causes to the union. Sometimes that
union not be the TGWU, but it would represent their interests perfectly
properly, as one would expect. We should be careful that people do not
fall into the wrong
hands.</div><a name="06062340000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The logic of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, which he might wish to make clear
to the Committee, is that only lawyers should deal with claims of the
type envisaged by the Bill. If that were the case, he would argue that
nobody should be allowed to do any processing of claims other than
registered lawyers. That argument can be made, but I do not understand
it to be the intention of the Bill or of the Government. The
Government&#146;s suggestion is that there are people other than
lawyers who will be allowed to process claims, and I think that
provided those people are regulated, accountable and liable, so that
they can be taken to the cleaners if they do not do a decent job, we
should not be directing all the work to
lawyers.</div><a name="06062340000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000435"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I hope that the outcome of this regulation is that
we see the end of claims management companies, and I think that a lot
of them will close once the regulations come into force because of the
sharp practices of which my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West
and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) is well aware. The hon. Gentleman says,
&#147;process a claim,&#148; and it needs to be exactly that. If it
is about filling in a form and passing the matter to a solicitor, that
needs to be clear. One of the terrible things that I and my hon.
Friends who represent coal mining constituencies have come across is
that those involved pass themselves off as having some type of
quasi-legal position, when clearly they do
not.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 83</div><a name="06062340000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000436"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand that point too. Over the years it has
been a little battle of mine to make sure that when people turn up at
court to represent someone, they do not get away with giving the
impression that they are lawyers, when they are not. They are clerks,
not lawyers. One can go into a solicitor&#146;s office and receive
advice, and often it is not a lawyer that gives the
advice&#151;sometimes it is a clerk or someone who is in the legal
assistants&#146; profession. I am always careful to check when people
write to me from a law firm whether the name at the bottom of the
letter is the name of one of the solicitors at the top or that of
somebody
else.</div><a name="06062340000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am absolutely against people passing themselves off as one thing or
another. I do not think I share the view that there should be nobody in
England who does this work other than lawyers, but the hon. Gentleman
will argue his case. When the Minister responds, I should be interested
to hear whether the Government expect that after enactment, when the
regulator has been set up, it will be not just the really dubious
characters that go, but all claims management companies, and whether
that is Government policy. I do not understand that to be what the
Government expect and want, but let us hear the
answer.</div><a name="06062340000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Gentleman&#151;I think that we are all going generally in the same
direction and I suspect that that is why we are all here&#151;I hope
that the Bill will get rid of the cowboys who are out to get a quick
buck and then disappear. It was the same with the legislation on
minicabs, which was pressed by my then hon. Friend the Member for
Richmond Park&#151;now Baroness Tonge&#151;among other hon.
Members. Minicabs were not properly regulated. Now that they are
regulated, people&#151;women in particular&#151;feel much safer and
the regime is tighter, as it should be. The measure has not got rid of
minicabs, however; they still exist, but they are licensed and
regulated, but the liability is much
greater.</div><a name="06062340000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000437"></a>John
Mann:</b> I seek your advice, Mr. Atkinson, on whether at this
stage make general comments of the type made by the hon. Gentleman, or
speak about the clause standing part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06062340000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000438"></a>The
Chairman:</b> As we are on the first group of amendments to
quite a large section of the Bill, it makes more sense for the
Committee to proceed as we have been doing, so if the hon. Gentleman
continued I am sure that that would be to the advantage of the
Committee.</div><a name="06062340000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000439"></a>John
Mann:</b> Thank you, Mr Atkinson.</div>
<a name="06062340000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to put some questions to
the Minister that I shall illustrate with a specific claims management
company called Vendside Ltd. Hon. Members may be familiar with that
company. Opposition Members may be particularly familiar, because I
understand that the company has written to them this week making
various allegations against a collusion of Labour MPs, myself included.
If any hon. Members have such a letter, I would be keen to be given a
copy. It demonstrates the nature of some claims
handlers.</div>
<a name="06062340000340"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="06062340000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to be
absolutely certain that the legislation will ensure that collusion
between a claims handler and a solicitor is fully covered. There are
two forms of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 84</div>collusion. In one form, there is an integral relationship, whether
formalised or informal, whereby the claims handler gives cases to a
specific solicitor or a small group of solicitors&#151;as we have
seen not only with Vendside but with other claims handlers dealing with
claims in the mining industry. In other words, the solicitor has a
vested interest in defending the reputation of the claims handler and
its attempts to raise finance, because the claims handler is giving
them lots of business. That is well documented among a range of claims
handlers, of which Vendside is only one. It is essential that we do not
allow consumer complaints to fall between the two stools.</div>
<a name="06062340000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second aspect is
particularly relevant to Vendside Ltd. As well as having a range of
solicitors whom it works through&#151;a panel of six different
solicitors over the past six years&#151;it employs its own solicitor
to advocate on its behalf. At the moment, that is Brooke North in
Leeds. If one does a press search, one sees that a Mr. Stopdale, a
solicitor from Brooke North, has been quoted repeatedly on various
issues over the past few weeks&#151;in essence, it would be
reasonable to say, advocating the case of Vendside Ltd.
</div><a name="06062340000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case of Vendside
Ltd. throws up another complication. I understand from correspondence
and my research that it is a fully owned subsidiary of the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers. That raises all sorts of complications, because
a trade union is not able to levy VAT, but a limited liability company
is able to do so. It is unclear, at times, who is actually who in the
UDM and Vendside, because they have the same solicitor. A year ago they
had different solicitors, and made a point of that. Now they have just
one solicitor. The letter that has been sent to certain Opposition
Members is headed &#147;UDM Nottingham section/Vendside Ltd.&#148;.
It is written on Vendside headed paper, but the person who signed the
letter is a president. Vendside does not have a president; the person
who signed the letter is the president of the UDM. The president of the
UDM is signing letters as the president of the UDM on the headed paper
of that limited liability company.</div>
<a name="06062340000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">That confusion could be used to
negate consumer rights. The consumer is bound to be confused about whom
they are dealing with. There may be legal technicalities, too. The law
in relation to a trade union, any kind of friendly society or akin
organisation is somewhat different. It is governed in statute as
opposed to the law relating to a limited liability company. Therefore,
the question of whether things will fall between the two is rather
important.</div> <a name="06062340000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, who will carry out the claims management regulation? Is there
an equivalent in terms of the reality&#151;the sanctions and the
powers? Otherwise, organisations would set up in one form or another,
or transfer matters in one form or another, purely to ensure that
consumer rights are minimised. That would be a particularly unhealthy
arrangement. I shall give an illustration.</div>
<a name="06062340000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider hearing loss
claims in both the textile and the mining industries. A claims handler,
Vendside Ltd., acquired the claim. It was passed to a solicitor who
passed it to another solicitor. That solicitor has used a medical
company that was owned partly by the first solicitor. Some of the
people working for Vendside Ltd. have been doing what was described as
marketing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 85</div>work and, between them, different fees have been passing backwards and
forwards. I referred to a set of minutes on Second Reading that
outlined how some of those finances worked. As for detailed
consideration today, how do we ensure a system that does not
allow&#151;this is beyond triangulation&#151;a position in which
four or five different parties are
involved?</div><a name="06062340000149"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000440"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I follow what the hon. Gentleman is saying; I
agree. Does he agree with me that the danger is that, if we leave a
loophole, those sort of people will move into it? Different
arrangements have been alighted on; he has mentioned some of them. He
will be aware of the scandal of the National Union of Mineworkers
accepting the proceeds of misrepresentations made by solicitors
seemingly on its behalf and then taking a kick-back out of the
miners&#146; compensation. Whatever loopholes there are will be
exploited, because a lot of money is involved. Should not everybody be
covered?</div><a name="06062340000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000441"></a>John
Mann:</b> I have taken many cases that relate to claims that
originated through the NUM, but one is successful because the
solicitors concerned have had through the Law Society a series of
adjudications made against them. Last week, Raleys solicitors were
instructed by the Law Society to pay back the money that was deducted
because it failed to give proper cost advice to the individual. It has
been asked to pay an additional &#163;400 compensation. There are
many individual consumer complaints, some of which are with the Law
Society, and many more will be following. There the consumer has found
that there is
redress.</div><a name="06062340000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, what
is unique about Vendside Ltd. is that the redress is there for those
who go through solicitors. Adjudications have been made against firms
such as Moss and Beresfords. Probably 85 per cent. are going that way.
For reasons that have not been explained, which are not the
Minister&#146;s responsibility because they are that of a different
Department and predate her ministerial elevation&#151;and highly
appropriate that was&#151;the Government chose to have an agreement
with the claims handler. In fact, there are three: one for hearing
loss, one for COPD and one for vibration white
finger.</div><a name="06062340000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consumer
redress when claims are handled by the claims handler without the
solicitor is purely through the civil courts. The dilemma in going to
the civil courts is that one can throw large amounts of money at the
matter through appeals. Therefore, the individuals&#151;in my case,
my constituent&#151;are not those who readily go to court; they tend
to regard courts as places to avoid. Their perception of a court is in
respect of arrest on a criminal charge. I have carried out a survey on
the matter; people do not readily go to court. The idea that they would
have proper consumer redress by going through the civil courts is
nonsense. There is a loophole whereby, if one goes via a solicitor, one
has the potential of redress. In my view, that is beginning to work
well. It needed some campaigning to get the Law Society to act
responsibly in respect of regulation, but after much pressure it is
doing so now. However, if one goes solely through a claims handler, and
in an agreement made by the Government one has no redress, where does
one go? That is absolutely fundamental to how this matter is
handled.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 86</div><a name="06062340000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The situation is even worse,
however. Not only does one have no redress, but I have had to request
on behalf of constituents some of the basics that would be available if
one went through a solicitor, such as the client file. One would want
that because, as I have found in a series of cases&#151;I shall not
go into the detail because that is not relevant&#151;the service is
part of the compensation claim, and there could be serious money
resting on it, so one needs to see whether that has been put in. My
argument against a solicitor when it has not been put in is that the
solicitor might well be liable. Solicitors have paid out some
significant sums for negligence because they have failed to put that
part of the compensation claim in. One can check that only if one
examines the full file. Slowly but surely, through the Law Society, I
am getting hold of the files, going through them and assessing them. I
am not a solicitor, but my judgment as to whether such matters should
be further investigated is reasonable, so I can give sound advice to my
constituents.</div>
<a name="06062340000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Vendside Ltd., and its
solicitors, Brooke North, refused to release the files. If one took
that route, one would not even be able to see one&#146;s own file.
Consumer rights are about not just complaint but ownership of
one&#146;s file. At the moment, one has no redress whatever in that
respect.</div>
<a name="06062340000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000442"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> It would be interesting to know whether the hon.
Gentleman believes that only lawyers should be able to do that work. I
think that I am right in saying that, as of today, if he has a file on
a case of his with a law firm, he does not have the right to see that
file either. He will have that right only when he has settled all his
bills and terminated his contract, and even then it will be limited. I
am not sure, but I think that that is the
position.</div>
<a name="06062340000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000443"></a>John
Mann:</b> Again, I shall not go into the detail of the battles
that I have been fighting on that matter. Suffice it to say, we are
winning the cases in getting access to the files. It took a bit of a
public campaign to get that moving, but that is now happening and the
files are coming through. The Law Society has been very clear in that
respect&#151;if a file is complete, one can get hold of it and see
whether there is a negligence issue. If one suspects that there is, one
has the opportunity to do something about it. The point about Vendside
Ltd. as a claims handler, and the three absurd agreements that the
Government signed, is that one does not even have that basic
right.</div>
<a name="06062340000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000444"></a>Mr.
Clapham:</b> My hon. Friend will have come across cases in
which, in addition to those from the claims handler, charges have been
levied by solicitors. Most such solicitors have no contact with trade
unions, but he might have found that they have levied as much as
&#163;1,000 per claim. One such firm, Beresfords in Doncaster, has
agreed as a result of pressure from MPs to refund claimants. It is not
just the claims handlers; in the mining cases we have found solicitors,
too, who have levied additional fees.</div>
<a name="06062340000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000445"></a>John
Mann:</b> They certainly have; I have uncovered many of them.
The Leeds solicitor, Irwin Mitchell, was charging 25 per cent. The
company with the most money, Thompson&#146;s, was charging
constituents such as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 87</div>my Mr. Allen directly. A range of solicitors charge levies or success
fees&#151;few of the leading ones do not&#151;but that is a
separate issue, because there is a remedy there. I do not think that
the powers of the Law Society are strong enough to enforce
adjudications without all the palaver that we have had with Raleys,
such as appeals and solicitors&#146; disciplinary tribunals. In my
view, the Law Society should strike off solicitors who refuse to abide
by the club rules. It is straightforward. If that is not happening, we
should legislate so that it does and so that such people are not
entitled to be solicitors any more.</div>
<a name="06062340000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to claims handlers. The
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey asked who should be
allowed to proceed with cases. That is a vexed question. In relation to
the mining and hearing loss claims, I see no basis for the Government
to sign an agreement with a claims handler. From the evidence, the
Government should cancel that arrangement forthwith, because consumer
rights are not built into it.
</div><a name="06062340000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only way that I
would be prepared to countenance the idea that a claims handler should
proceed with cases is if the consumer rights were equivalent to going
through a solicitor. There may well be arguments&#151;my hon. Friend
the Member for North Durham will doubtless put them at some
stage&#151;that claims handlers should not be allowed to do so
anyway. Even if that were the case, it could be considered only on the
basis of equivalence of
rights.</div><a name="06062341000018"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="06062341000001"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
other aspects. One relates to Vendside and the hearing loss claims. It
is not just the mining industry; the textile industry is involved as
well. One of the perplexities that I am still struggling to
understand&#151;I am still asking questions&#151;is that I found
women who worked together who appeared to have equivalent industrial
deafness, some of whose claims have proceeded while others have not.
There seems to be an interesting unwillingness to take claims to court,
and that decision appears to be made by the insurers&#146;
solicitors. Someone goes to a claims handler, and the claims handler
gives the case to a solicitor, who perhaps passes it to a second
solicitor. A third solicitor then judges that there is no claim, and
that is the insurers&#146;
solicitor.</div><a name="06062341000002"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something
in that does not add up. If that is right, proper and within the law,
the law is wrong. If a woman with deafness takes a claim for industrial
deafness, whether the employer is liable is arguable, but if the claim
has proceeded through a claims handler, a solicitor and perhaps another
solicitor and is then stopped by the insurers&#146; solicitor, that
is rather dubious.
</div><a name="06062341000003"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fundamental
question is how that fits into the draft legislation, particularly when
there is a financial relationship, with fees being paid, and greater
triangulation among the parties. I could see how there might be an
unduly close financial relationship between the claims handler and
perhaps even the insurer or the insurer&#146;s broker. The remit and
role of the Financial Services Authority and the Association of British
Insurers in that context must be examined. Otherwise, the sort of ruses
that took place with hearing loss claims, which appear to have been
legal, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 88</div>will recur. In 2000, a hearing loss claim settled in a couple of months
at costs of around &#163;600 or &#163;700 to the claimant&#146;s
solicitor suddenly became a five-year process in which &#163;3,000 to
&#163;4,000 went in all directions for what appears to be wholly
unnecessary insurance, third parties in medical investigations,
repayments to the first set of solicitors, claims handlers and their
marketing companies. If all that unnecessary expense is legal, we must
ensure that the law is tightened so that it does not
happen.</div><a name="06062341000004"></a><div class="hs_Para">Vendside is
not alone, but it is the biggest offender in my area in terms of volume
and the most litigious in trying to ensure that what it does is not
challenged. I faced three spurious and unsuccessful complaints to the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, all of which were dismissed.
Letters are now being sent to Opposition Members. I hope that they do
not file them appropriately too quickly; I hope that they will let
colleagues involved know that they have received
letters.</div>
<a name="06062341000005"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="06062341000019"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I feel rather left out. I have not had one of those
letters. Can the hon. Gentleman let me have a
copy?</div><a name="06062341000006"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062341000020"></a>John
Mann:</b> I shall put the hon. Gentleman on the mailing list.
Numerous Opposition Members have been happy to let me know that they
have had letters and have then been perfectly happy to let me see a
copy of the letter in which I was named. Other colleagues are not
named, but there is collusion between some of us, and I suspect that
some in this room may be involved in the
collusion.</div><a name="06062341000007"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062341000021"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> May I reassure the hon. Gentleman that I have
received no such letter? I suspect that the authors would have found me
unsympathetic to their
activities.</div><a name="06062341000008"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062341000022"></a>John
Mann:</b> That perhaps shows how some claims handlers are as
effective at targeting Members of Parliament as they are at handling
some of their claimant cases.</div>
<a name="06062341000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">The irony is that Vendside is
not the worst. There are worse companies&#151;P and R Associates, for
example. The amount of money that is deducted from my constituents is
sometimes more than &#163;3,000. IDC is another example; again,
solicitors have deducted thousands of pounds. I suppose that the worst
of all in terms of what it has done is Union and General Services. The
name sounds good: an ex-union official, a Mr. Revill of Thorne in
Doncaster, set it up with, I guess, some of his associates or friends.
That company charged a fee for passing cases on to solicitors and then
went into voluntary liquidation. It may have done that because it
suddenly found that its outgoings were greater than its incomings, but
there could be another reason why a claims handler would go into
voluntary liquidation. How could one pursue it through the civil
courts? The ability of a small claims handler without the resources
that an organisation such as Vendside has to keep using appeals through
the courts to try to reverse decisions that it could lose if my
constituents or others were successful could be negated if it went into
voluntary liquidation as a limited liability company 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 89</div>and disappeared. How will we deal with a consumer complaint against a
claims handler that goes into liquidation? There needs to be at least
equivalence with the powers to deal with
solicitors.</div><a name="06062341000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does my
hon. Friend the Minister not feel that it is appropriate for us to
build into the Bill a requirement for Vendside Ltd, with its unique
agreement with the Government, to repay the money to the claimants? The
Government, using their employer responsibility, have paid the costs
and have done so very generously, so there has been double charging. Is
it not incumbent on the Government, as it is a Government agreement,
and on Parliament to ensure that the consumer gets proper redress by
legislating to ensure that the money is
repaid?</div><a name="06062341000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062341000023"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I welcome regulation of claims handlers, but I hope
that they are put out of business by it, because I see no purpose
whatever to those organisations. I congratulate my hon. Friend the
Minister on her approach to the issue. She has stated the important
fact that the consumer&#146;s interest and rights should come first.
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw, I believe that that is
the important
point.</div><a name="06062341000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concerns
about the phrasing of the clause are somewhat similar to those of my
hon. Friend, and I would like answers. I am concerned about cases that
will fall between the two stools. I accept that the draft Legal
Services Bill is coming, which will tackle the woeful way in which the
Law Society has dealt with some cases. I agree with the hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey that the Law Society does not merit any
great accolades in this respect. It is clear that the claims handling
scandal in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease scheme could not
have gone on without the collusion of solicitors&#151;solicitors
working closely
together.</div><a name="06062341000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
two examples to illustrate my concern about what will happen even with
the new regulation. The first, to which my hon. Friend the Member for
Bassetlaw has referred, concerns Freeclaim IDC, which was
started in the 1990s in Ashington in Northumberland under the name
Industrial Disease Compensation. It has operated two scams.</div>
<a name="06062341000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first involved the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease scheme, when IDC said that it would
indemnify people&#146;s claims even though it knew there was no cost
involved. One case referred to me involved a man named Mr. Jobes. His
only redress to recover the &#163;3,600 that the company
stole&#151;I do not use the word lightly&#151;from his compensation
was for me to take the case to the Law Society. Credit is due to the
Law Society case officer, who was tenacious in pressing the matter. The
claim was passed on by IDC to a Liverpool-based company called
Silverbeck Rymer, and the Law Society found that, as in the cases taken
up by my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw, the company was
negligent in the cost advice that it gave to the client. The decision
went to appeal and resulted in Silverbeck Rymer having to pay the
&#163;3,600 back to Mr. Jobes. It was a successful case, but
my concern is that Silverbeck Rymer clearly had a number of cases with
IDC. I intend to take the matter up with the Law Society to find out in
how many other cases IDC has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 90</div>done the same thing. Unless people complain they will not get justice.
That is the important point.</div>
<a name="06062341000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the regulation, if IDC
were ever to get regulated&#151;I would argue strongly that it should
not&#151;would there be a mechanism for the Secretary of State or the
regulator to examine a number of problems in relation to a company? It
is clear thatMr. Jobes is not the only person to have been
scammed in such a way. The Law Society can investigate only if there is
a complaint. We need a mechanism whereby if a complaint is made in one
case, other cases can also be
examined.</div><a name="06062341000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where is the
dividing line between a solicitor and a claims management company? In
its literature, IDC calls itself a &#147;panel of solicitors,&#148;
giving the impression that it is some type of legal organisation when
clearly the people in question have no legal qualifications. It says
that its &#147;panel of solicitors&#148; is made up of
&#147;experts in their field&#148;. They are not. Often, they are
solicitors&#146; firms that are down on their luck and want cases to
put through their books because of the hard times upon which some high
street solicitors have
fallen.</div><a name="06062341000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also
clarify the matter of advertising and the farming of claims, which
relates to another case that demonstrates IDC&#146;s second scam.
Once the Jobes scam was exposed, IDC changed the system to charge
people not on a percentage basis but through an administration fee for
getting the claim and passing it on to a solicitor. It said that it was
charging a &#147;modest&#148; fee of &#163;100 plus VAT, which
people might say is fine until they find out that the solicitors
actually collect the administration fee at the end of a case and pass
it on to IDC. My constituent Mr. Barker cannot understand why he has to
pay that fee, given that all IDC did was pass his case on. The
&#147;panel of solicitors&#148; that IDC used in his case were a
company called Mincoffs in Newcastle, whose submission in relation to
the Law Society complaint that I have already put in is very
enlightening. It appears that Mincoffs is paying for the cases to be
passed on. More disturbingly&#151;this is very worrying&#151;I have
it in writing that Mincoffs is paying for what it calls
&#147;sponsorship advice sessions&#148; and other materials in
local working men&#146;s
clubs.</div>
<a name="06062340000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="06062340000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where do we
draw the line drawn between the claims handling firm and the solicitor,
because in this case they are on a panel and IDC is badging it, and
Mincoffs were clearly paying for the advice session or promotional
material? It is important that this Bill and the draft legal services
Bill do not create a loophole or chasm that people can fall through
between the regulation of claims handlers and the regulation of
solicitors. I know the Minister does not want such a situation to
arise.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000454"></a>John
Mann:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. In the
context of what he is saying, how does he consider the case of Vendside
and Indiclaim? Vendside is a claims handler, and that is generally
accepted. Indiclaim is the marketing arm of the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers. Nobody had heard of Indiclaim until it was discovered that
certain solicitors, as well assisting in getting the Vendside fee, were
paying up to &#163;500 per claim, in the case of one solicitor, to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 91</div>Indiclaim, a company that was owned by one of the members of Vendside.
Until then, the operation was totally secret. Would Indiclaim be a
claims handler, or could it be a ruse out to get out of complying with
legislation?</div><a name="06062340000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000455"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. That is why it
is important to raise these things now and get clarification. The hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire said that such people are ingenious
and will create scams and new organisations. They develop what they
call &#147;their product&#148; as it goes along. The important
thing is that if a claims handling company then sets up marketing
companies, as my hon. Friend suggests, or a solicitor does it, they
need to fall within this regulation. This must be dealt with in terms
of ownership or some direct connection, otherwise I foresee that these
people will just reinvent themselves.</div>
<a name="06062340000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend touched on my
final point: claims handling companies going bust or being put into
liquidation. I know of numerous cases, as does my hon. Friend the
Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone, in which various claims
handling companies were set up off the shelf for, as I call it, raping
the COPD scheme. They got in plenty of claims, sold them to
solicitors&#151;or had some relationship with solicitors&#151;and
as soon as the scheme finished, they wound up it completely.</div>
<a name="06062340000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">People might ask whether that
matters, because the claims were passed over to solicitors who could
deal with them, but it does, because the COPD scheme and some other
legal actions have time limits and deadlines. In a number of cases,
people have been phoned up and door-knocked by these companies, and
have filled in forms thinking that they were registering a claim only
to find that the company, or various companies, had gone into
liquidation without registering the claims with solicitors. What
recourse do such people have? Some would say that it is under civil
law, but that is not really so because the company has gone bust and
the directors have disappeared. It is interesting to consider the
backgrounds of some of the directors who have been involved in
everything from double glazing to timeshare
scams.</div>
<a name="06062340000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000456"></a>Mr.
Hamilton:</b> I shall give a breather to the double act that
is taking place. I, too, have a concern about the number of solicitors
and claim partners who deal with clients in Scotland only to find that
Scottish law is different from English statute. When they discover
that, they back off, leaving people high and dry in
Scotland.</div><a name="06062340000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have had
to deal with numerous cases in Scotland involving English claims
handlers, who are governed by the Law Society of England and Wales, not
by the Law Society of Scotland. We are beginning to get a number of
claims by people who have missed the boat simply because they thought
that they had made the claim only to find that they were time-barred
because they dealt with claims handlers at that point. In dealing with
the compensation legislation, I hope that the Minister will examine
that problem. Although the Bill covers England and Wales, I hope she
will act accordingly to ensure that Scotland is incorporated into
it.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 92</div><a name="06062340000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000457"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point, and it takes us
back to the fundamental point raised by my hon. Friends the Members for
Sherwood (Paddy Tipping), for Bassetlaw and for Barnsley, West and
Penistone. The people we are dealing with&#151;the
consumers&#151;are not used to dealing with solicitors. When they are
phoned up or doorstepped, they think that by filling in a form with a
claims handling company, they are registering a claim. We cannot blame
them for thinking that because some of the forms are in legalese and
look like legal documents to the layman. When people are left high and
dry by these companies, they have no legal redress at all. I am
interested to know what redress those individuals will have under the
provisions. If a solicitor makes a mistake by not registering a claim,
they have recourse to the Law Society, but claims handling companies
are not covered.</div>
<a name="06062340000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be situations in
which people set up companies simply for the purpose of registering a
number of claims and then sell what they can. Perhaps they will stick
the more difficult ones in a drawer and forget about them. People have
no legal redress in such situations, and it is important that we get
clarification on that important
point.</div><a name="06062340000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000458"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> What interests me about what the hon.
Gentleman says is the impression that some companies give that by
simply filling in the form, people can somehow get redress for their
grievance. Does he accept that that is because the claims culture, in
the context in which he is discussing it, is driven by the profit
motive? One does not condemn the companies for that, but it underlines
the importance of properly regulating them.</div>
<a name="06062340000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000459"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> It does, and that it is an important point. These
companies are in it for the money. They are not interested in anything
else, and in some cases they do not even give any legal advice. They do
not really care about that; all they care about is getting a number of
forms filled in that they can sell on. The collusion of certain
solicitors&#146; firms with these claim handlers has made the
situation more difficult recently by giving people the impression that
there are claims to be made.
</div><a name="06062340000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point was also made in the Select Committee report
and by the regulator&#151;that the claims culture myth is being built
up by such people. They do not do what a lot of solicitors do and what
I certainly used to do as a trade union legal officer. When certain
people came to see me, I said, &#147;Sorry, you don&#146;t have a
claim,&#148; but it is not in the interests of these firms to say
that because they want the money. That is what concerns me.</div>
<a name="06062340000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">No one should use a claim
handling firm in any circumstance: they should go directly to a
solicitor to get advice, and they will tell somebody if they do not
have a claim. The cases I dealt with concerned asbestos, whereby chest
X-rays were taken for individuals. One gentleman came forward, and when
I said there was no case because he was not suffering from pleural
plaques, he asked, &#147;Why can&#146;t I get any money?&#148; I
told him, &#147;Because you&#146;re not ill. You&#146;re not
going to die from a lethal disease.&#148; If that case were dealt
with by a claims handling company, no doubt it would have sold him
insurance and taken him through the entire system. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 93</div>That would mean two things: first, giving bad advice and building up
people&#146;s hopes when there was not a claim, and, secondly, a
creating a culture, as referred to by the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire, where claims are made when they should not
be.</div> <a name="06062340000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulation of
claims forms is long overdue. I welcome the provisions and the
Minister&#146;s customer-focus. I hope that she addresses the points
that my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw and I raised. We must not
allow loopholes or chasms between this legislation and the legal
services legislation that lead to people not getting the consumer
rights they deserve.</div>
<a name="06062340000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000460"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> This has been a helpful and comprehensive
debate. I absolutely and completely agree with my hon. Friend. The
whole point of the provisions is that consumer rights come first. That
underlines this element of the Bill.</div>
<a name="06062340000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000461"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> The Minister said that she completely agreed
with the hon. Member for Bassetlaw, who said, if I remember correctly,
that he hoped that the introduction of the Bill would lead to the end
of the claims handling industry. Does she see that as the objective of
the
legislation?</div><a name="06062340000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000462"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I wish the hon. Gentleman would not look
unnecessarily for negativity. I said&#151;I shall repeat it, because
I feel passionately about it&#151;that I agree with my hon. Friend
the Member for North Durham that the purpose of the clause is to put
consumer rights at the heart of the Bill. That is part of the reason
why we introduced this element of the Bill, and I do not resile from it
at all.</div><a name="06062340000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me briefly
set out exactly what clause 3 is about. I shall then try to respond not
only to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire, but to some of the other issues raised. Clause 3 defines
&#147;claims management services&#148; and prohibits individuals
from providing regulated claims management services without
authorisation from the regulator or an exemption by order of the
Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="06062340000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Individuals acting in a
voluntary capacity are specifically excluded from the scope of the
regulation for good reason. We do not want to impose unnecessary
burdens on individuals who might offer advice to friends or on those
who offer their services on a voluntary basis for not-for-profit
organisations. A volunteer in the citizens advice bureau will not be
caught by the clause. In this context, an authorised person will be an
individual, company or organisation authorised by the regulator. That
single authorisation will cover the employees of that company or
organisation.</div> <a name="06062340000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do
not want to over-regulate, so we are very conscious of what the Better
Regulation Task Force says on the issues. That is why we have
structured the Bill to allow for flexibility and proportionate
regulation. We do not want to impose any unnecessary burdens in
seriously protecting consumers who might have been disadvantaged by the
activities of some claims companies. I have provided Committee members
with a draft copy of the order underclause 3(2)(e), and I hope
that it has assisted the consideration of this part of the
Bill.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 94</div><a name="06062340000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I deal with the
amendments, let me try to deal with some of the issues that have been
raised. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire wanted to know how
the clause on exemptions would fit in. Those who provide regulated
claims management services will be those specified in clause 3(2)(e).
Those considered not to need authorisation could therefore be exempted.
That would include solicitors, barristers, the not-for-profit sector
and trade unions, which we shall come to
later.</div><a name="06062340000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for North Southwark and Bermondsey joined the hon. Member for
North-East Hertfordshire in asking about the use of the word
&#147;regulated&#148;. The point of taking a wide definition of
claims management services is to ensure that all kinds of service,
wherever provided, can be captured. Equally, however, we do not want to
regulate areas that do not need it.</div>
<a name="06062340000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey asked for an example of something that would
be unregulated. The one that comes to mind is that of a surveyor where
a motorway is being constructed. There is evidence of surveyors
speaking to people in the vicinity about whether they need to make a
claim for blight. There is not a serious problem at the moment, but the
clause would allow us to bring such things into regulation should that
be necessary later. That is the point of doing so much through the
secondary legislation route. I hope that that ensures that the
regulations targeted only at those who need to be regulated. We
followed the approach used by the Financial Services Authority in
regulating its remit. Our approach also has the benefit of legal
certainty, rather than leaving the matter to the
courts.</div><a name="06062340000344"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="06062340000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
debate about the National Accident Helpline. To clarify, as there
seemed to be confusion throughout the Committee about the
helpline&#146;s purpose and how it is funded, it is a claims
management company. It captures claims and refers them to solicitors.
It is involved in claims handling activities and it has a network of
solicitors but it is not regulated by the Law Society. It also sells
after-the-event insurance and can arrange loans for claimants to pay
their insurance premium. Those are the things that some of my hon.
Friends have serious concerns about.
</div><a name="06062340000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The helpline is
funded by referral fees from solicitors and by the commission that it
gets from the insurance and the loans. It would be regulated under the
scheme. I am perfectly prepared to accept what the hon. Member for
Kettering said&#151;the helpline has been willing to work with us on
the issue and it would have no worries about being regulated under the
scheme, as it believes that it is providing a high-quality service and
therefore does not think that it would be removed from the system on
the grounds that it was undermining it. It is a good example of the
sort of organisation that would be regulated under the
clause.</div><a name="06062340000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
anyone who is regulated under the clause and does not meet the
standards that the regulator sets can be removed from the scheme and
other penalties may be attached to them, including up to two
years&#146; imprisonment. We are not thinking of the issue as light
regulation, as heavy burdens are placed on companies to ensure that
they raise their game and their standards. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 95</div></div><a name="06062340000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000463"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I am grateful for that clarification. The helpline
is a claims handler like any of the other cowboys in the industry. Does
the Minister agree that it is important that organisations such as the
National Accident Helpline make it clear to clients that they are not
solicitors but middlemen and that they also sell insurance? It is
important that the consumer knows that, so that he or she has the
choice to go directly to a solicitor rather than going through that
middleman.</div>
<a name="06062340000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000464"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point and one
that was raised before. He mentioned it in his contribution. An
important feature of the authorisation criteria is that the claims
management company will have to provide details about the information
that it provides to claimants. That information will be useful to the
regulator if complaints are received about fees charged. We do not
intend that the regulator should be prescriptive about the level of
fees, but it should be transparent and clear, in particular about any
free services and whether charges are met under another scheme. Any
complaints from a claims company that does not comply with that
requirement would be in breach of the terms and conditions of the
authorisation and would therefore face disciplinary
action.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000465"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I have a point about the notion of free legal
advice. Will the Minister agree that if a claims handling company is
giving free legal advice, it should be exactly that&#151;it must be
given by a qualified individual who is on a par with someone regulated
by the Law Society and not just by a law graduate who has no
experience? It is clear that I, and others, could set up a claims
handling company with people who had a law degree but had not practised
for many years, and give free legal advice, which would be of no use in
helping that individual.</div>
<a name="06062340000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000466"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. The
information given to the client must make it absolutely clear what the
client will receive from the company. In his speech, he also talked
about the investigation of allegations and the regulator will be able
not only to investigate complaints but to take the initiative himself
and carry out audits and investigate allegations from individual
claimants, MPs, or anyone else. That will include the powers to seize
information and documents and to obtain a warrant to enter and search
premises, and there are strong controls over what will be done. Of
course, the regulator will be able to enforce clear and effective
sanctions.</div> <a name="06062340000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bassetlaw wanted to raise the issue of the
confusion between Vendside and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers.
Again, I agree that there has to be clarity for the consumer about who
is dealing with their claim and whether that person is regulated. Under
the proposals in this part of the Bill, Vendside would require
authorisation and would have to comply with the regulators&#146;
rules. The model rules that we have already published state that
authorised businesses must ensure that all information given to the
client is clear, transparent and not misleading. If Vendside is not
capable of doing that, it would not get
authorisation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 96</div><a name="06062340000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000467"></a>John
Mann:</b> Would Indiclaim, described as the marketing arm of
the UDM, be similarly regulated as a claims
handler?</div><a name="06062340000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000468"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I want to come to the issue of marketing
companies. Companies will not be able to evade regulation by setting
themselves up as marketing companies. Authorised companies will be
required to declare to the regulator any links that they have with
parent or subsidiary companies and any previous companies that the
directors have worked for.</div>
<a name="06062340000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bassetlaw raised the issue of a company putting itself into voluntary
liquidation in order to avoid anything. Effective enforcement is
essential to prevent any company evading regulation. There will be
compliance checks and audits that can flush out any early concerns
about a business that might be failing. The regulator does not have to
wait for an audit to take place but can take action to suspend or
cancel authorisation if he feels it is appropriate to do so.</div>
<a name="06062340000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">In dealing with complaints, it
should also be said that authorised persons will have to set up an
internal complaints procedure. Where the consumer feels that their
complaint has not been handled appropriately or to their satisfaction
under the internal procedure, they can refer the matter directly to the
regulator. Again, if the investigation of that complaint uncovers a
breach of the rules, that could result in disciplinary action,
including suspension or cancellation of authorisation.</div>
<a name="06062340000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend also talked
about the collusion between solicitors and claims handlers. There is
nothing to stop solicitors and claims handlers from working together,
but if they are providing regulated claims management services,
solicitors will be regulated by the Law Society and the claims handlers
by the regulator. We will ensure that all regulators work in a
joined-up fashion so that they address all the abuses, if there are
any, and safeguard consumer rights. The provision is an interim measure
because, as the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has
mentioned, once the Legal Services Bill becomes law that regulation
will come under the auspices of the legal services
board.</div><a name="06062340000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000469"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I should have waited for the Minister to finish
what she was planning to say. I have been thinking of the one case that
she gave as an argument for keeping in the word
&#147;regulate&#148; and resisting the amendment, which was that of
a surveyor.</div> <a name="06062340000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surveyors
would be governed by their professional code of conduct and their
organisation. They would have to be members of their professional body
and therefore would have been covered. If a local authority officer
comes and gives advice to someone who is also talking about the
prospect of a claim if a building gets put up or if a road comes past
them, would they fall outside the regulatory processes? Would there be
no way in which things said by people employed with public money to do
a public job would be covered by this legislation? I have not yet heard
a very persuasive argument for resisting the amendment, only one little
example that I think is covered in other areas
anyway.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 97</div><a name="06062340000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000470"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> In the case of surveyors, there is a suggestion
that some are going out and looking for individuals and giving them
advice. However, the hon. Gentleman is right that they should be
covered by their own professional organisation. What I am saying is
that if they started to act as claims handlers, we would need to look
at whether or not they would be brought into legislation. As far as
local authorities are concerned, if a local authority was giving bad
advice, there are other ways that people can deal with them through the
local authority ombudsman. That would be the best way to look at that.
However, if I may, I will return to
that.</div><a name="06062340000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I will
turn to my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton). We are
in discussions with the Scottish Executive about the way that we deal
with things in Scotland. I have to say that, luckily for Scotland,
there does not seem to be the same problem with unregulated claims that
we have in England. However, it would be possible for the Scottish
Executive to follow similar lines to the ones that we are using here,
if they felt that that would become an issue. Claims management
companies operate much less extensively in Scotland and Northern
Ireland than they do in England and Wales. In Scotland, that is partly
because of a different legal
system.</div><a name="06062340000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000471"></a>Mr.
Hamilton:</b> To clarify, there is a specific problem in
Scotland about ex-coal miners. In my own area, I do not have the same
problems as have been exhibited by my colleagues. However, there are
many cases in Ayrshire, Lanarkshire and Fife in which people have been
stripped of money to which they feel entitled. It does happen. However,
Scotland has a population of 5 million against
England&#146;s 50 million; that is why it is
less.</div><a name="06062340000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000472"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I take what my hon. Friend says. I have just
found what I needed to know about surveyors. There is limited evidence
that there are surveyors who have been effectively acting as claims
handlers. They liaise with the Highways Agency to seek compensation for
people whose homes might be blighted or who are near newly constructed
motorways. The compensation is supposed to reflect the loss of value
suffered by the properties.</div>
<a name="06062340000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair, we are not aware of
any consumer being disadvantaged by that activity. If it came to light
that consumers were being disadvantaged, we have the order-making power
that would bring that under the regulatory
net.</div><a name="06062340000345"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="06062340000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000473"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Why would that not be covered by the hon.
Lady&#146;s definitions section, which mentions giving advice in
relation to the making of a claim? Why does she need the extra, bolt-on
bit about regulating and having an order-making power? Why not just
cover everybody in the claims handling business? Then, if she wants to
exempt those to whom other regulatory regimes apply,
fine.</div><a name="06062340000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000474"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The reason not to target everybody is that we
want targeting to be proportionate. That is why we deliberately picked
out the five areas where we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 98</div>think that there are problems at the moment. The potential for the
regulatory net is very wide. However, this way we have flexibility to
ensure that we can act quickly to impose regulation in areas where
there is an immediate problem, and to avoid overregulation where there
is not a problem.</div><a name="06062340000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have consulted extensively with stakeholders, including APIL, the
Association of British Insurers and the Criminal Injuries Compensation
Authority, and with our own legal services consumer panel, which
involves Citizens Advice, the National Consumer Council, the Office of
Fair Trading, and <i class="I">Which?</i>, all of which have welcomed what we are
doing&#151;as has everyone who has advised us. That is why we want to
make it a matter of
targeting.</div><a name="06062340000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000475"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am just working out that the Minister is now
saying that she wants to include the word &#147;regulated&#148;
because the Government have five initial groups in mind: personal
injury, surveying, employment, criminal injuries compensation, and
compensation for the mis-selling of financial products. Will she tell
us whether she is aware of any other claims management activities in
existence, in relation to which she does not believe there to be abuse,
so that they would fall outside the system? I am also intrigued as to
why Scotland and Northern Ireland do not have the same issue. A note
later would be
helpful.</div><a name="06062340000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000476"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> On the second point, part of the reason why
Scotland does not have the problem is because of the different Scottish
legal system. Our advice from Scotland is that there is not the
plethora of claims management companies in Scotland that there is in
England.</div><a name="06062340000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000477"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Perhaps they just have not got that far
yet.</div>
<a name="06062340000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000478"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Maybe, and no doubt when they do, we shall have
the opportunity and the flexibility to regulate appropriately. One
reason why I cannot yet cite examples is that, to be honest, we do not
really know what is out there, which is why we need flexibility. We do
not want to overregulate, but if a problem arises we shall have the
flexibility to regulate in secondary
legislation.</div>
<a name="06062340000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000479"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I know that my hon. Friend has tried to cover all
the points that were mentioned. One point that I mentioned related to
claims handlers who register claims but do not pass them on to a law
firm, so that the claim goes out of time. How would claimants who
suffer as a result of that be redressed? It is a detailed point, but
perhaps if she cannot give an answer now she will reflect on it and
respond in writing. It is an issue of concern to me and many other
Members who have dealt with claims handling companies. Claims fall out
of time either because companies go bust or because there is simple
neglect in passing on claims that are time-limited in
law.</div><a name="06062340000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000480"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I understand what my hon. Friend is saying. I
need to reflect and come back to him on it, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 99</div>but I suspect that it is something that we should examine in terms of
the regulation.</div><a name="06062340000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
details of the amendments, I agree with the hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire and the principle behind his amendment: all claims
companies providing claims management should be captured. However, I
hope that the definition in clause 3, in its entirety, covers his
concerns.</div><a name="06062340000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the purpose of amendment No. 18 is to ensure that representation
that is not strictly legal, such as the mis-selling of endowment
policies&#151;that is the most obvious example&#151;is covered.
Again, I think that the wide definition in clause 3 does what is
intended and applies the description &#147;claims management
services&#148; to any advice or service in relation to the making of
the claim. So the definition includes all the aspects of making a
claim.</div><a name="06062340000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
avoidance of any doubt, however, the clause also specifies that the
provision of services could include</div>
<a name="06062340000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provision of services by way
of or in relation to legal
representation&#148;.</div><a name="06062340000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
does not mean that other representation is excluded. I would argue the
contrary. The words &#147;in particular&#148; indicate that the
list in subsection (3)(a) is not exhaustive so it is unnecessary to
mention activities that would obviously fall within &#147;the
provision of services&#148;. That includes representation that is not
necessarily
legal.</div><a name="06062340000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
19 is also unnecessary, again because I think that the definition in
clause 3 covers the concerns and has been constructed carefully to
cover organisations whether or not they are to receive payments. That
therefore would apply to companies acting as a call centre that simply
take details about claims from consumers and pass them on to a
solicitor for a fee. As I have said extensively, the definition in
clause 3 is wide to ensure that all related activities are covered. I
ask the hon. Gentleman therefore not to press the amendment.</div>
<a name="06062340000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly, the hon. Gentleman
mentioned the activities of rehabilitation farmers. There is still some
dispute in the industry as to whether there is as yet such a thing as a
rehab farmer, but if credit rehabilitation farmers act in the context
of making a claim or giving advice, those services would fall within
the regulatory ambit of the Bill. Those providing such services would
be caught and would have to seek
authorisation.</div><a name="06062340000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate has been extensive and has shown the need for clause 3. There
are unscrupulous people out there undermining consumer confidence. I
think that the way in which we have constructed the clause provides the
wide definition needed to ensure that claims farmers are caught and
regulated when necessary. Equally, if people are not involved in any of
the activities where we feel that there are problems, they will not be
overregulated. That is in accordance with the Better Regulation
Commission principles. So I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment and I ask the Committee to accept the
clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000483"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I have just one question on that. I can see the
argument, but how will one know that they are operating from Fuengirola
or the Cayman Islands? The public find it difficult enough to find out
whether their lawyers are legally qualified. The chances of their
discovering whether they come from Tenerife or Timbuktu are even more
remote.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000484"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I understand the intention behind the amendment,
and it is perfectly reasonable. All that I would say to the hon. Member
for North-East Hertfordshire is that while there is nothing to prevent
a company from basing itself outside the jurisdiction and continuing to
offer regulated claims management services, it still has to be
authorised to do that; otherwise it is committing an offence and is
liable to prosecution. We could get into a debate about extradition,
but I do not wish us to do that here, and my hon. Friend the Member for
Worcester (Mr. Foster) would have a horrible look on his face if I went
down that road. However, I can say that they would have to be
regulated. We would also have the power to ask other providers to
co-operate in not dealing with unauthorised providers. It would not be
in the Law Society&#146;s interests, for example, for lawyers to deal
with unauthorised providers.</div>
<a name="06062340000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000485"></a>John
Mann:</b> There have been examples of offshore insurance
companies&#151;from the Isle of Man, for example&#151;in recent

to declare to their regulators whether they have offshore accounts? If
not, why not?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000486"></a>Bridget

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000487"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I think that the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 specifically extended the jurisdiction out to the Isle of Man and

intriguing possibility of having what amounts to an alternative
business structure combining insurance, claims 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 101</div>handling and solicitors&#146; activities based in the Isle of Man.
What would be the Minister&#146;s response to that? I do not trust

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000489"></a>Mr.

amendment No. 25, in clause 4, page 2, line 40, leave out &#145;a
person' and insert &#145;the Financial Services
Authority'.</div><a name="06062340000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000494"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> These two amendments touch on an issue that would
have been covered had I moved amendment No. 16. That is the need to get
on with this, and to introduce some robust arrangements that will act
relatively quickly in this area. Amendment No. 25 says that the FSA
should be the regulator. I tabled this slightly probing amendment
because the FSA is the most appropriate body to regulate the claims
management industry. It may be difficult to persuade the FSA to take it
on, but I wonder whether that is the end of the matter. Baroness Ashton
of Upholland said in the other place that the FSA does not wish to take
it on, but is that the end of
it?</div><a name="06062340000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that my
point is a bit more fundamental. Who tells the regulator what it should
and should not do? I hate to say it, because I am sure that the
Minister does not look at the matter entirely in this way, but it seems
as though the FSA has been allowed to say, &#147;Sorry, chum. Okay,
we do the insurance industry and a lot of this work is, in effect, in
the insurance sector&#151;after-event insurance&#151;but we are not
prepared to take it on.&#148; Who governs the country? Is it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 102</div>Ministers or Parliament who say what happens or is the FSA entitled to
pick and choose? If Ministers genuinely do not feel that it is
appropriate for the FSA to do this it would be a different matter, but
if it is just that it has rather a lot on and it would be inconvenient
to take up such institutions, I wonder whether we should accept that
and let it get away with
that.</div><a name="06062340000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 20
would impose a duty to appoint a regulator, rather than making it a
permissive power. Ministers have searched the regulation world high and
low looking for a regulator to take this function on. It seems that, in
the interim, we will be left with the Lord Chancellor, plus a trading
standards organisation. Is the Minister able to give us any more idea
than previously about what the final position will be? From what I have
read in the draft Legal Services Bill, the Legal Services Commission is
not to be the front-line regulator; it has a more supervisory role,
overseeing the activities of organisations like the Bar
Council and the Law Society. Its role is, in a sense, to give those
organisations a licence or supervise them, not to do the job. What is
the Minister really proposing as the long-term solution? Does he
envisage a separate front-line regulator in this area? Clearly, it
cannot be the Claims Standards Council, because that does not seem to
be a robust or effective
body.</div><a name="06062340000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">These two
amendments are trying to clarify why the FSA, which deals with
insurance, is not the regulator, why the Minister will only have
discretion to appoint a regulator and what the final outcome is
supposed to
be.</div><a name="06062340000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000495"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> On amendment No. 20, I assume that the Minister
will say that this is the normal drafting for such things. However, I
agree with the purport behind it, which is that we need to get
on.</div><a name="06062340000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
25, the Minister knows that our view is that the FSA, although a
prospective candidate, would not be the logical
regulator&#151;whether it has said that it wanted to do so is a
separate question&#151;and that the logical regulator is the
regulator in the wings, coming through in the draft Legal Services
Bill. I accept that it is better to have an interim arrangement and
then hand it over to that regulatory body, because there is a closer
affinity between the services that lawyers purport to offer and these
sorts of services, rather than those currently regulated by the FSA and
these
services.</div><a name="06062340000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000496"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I fully take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that
that structure may be robust, but within it the Legal Services
Commission sits at the top, overseeing the regulatory activities of the
Bar Council, the Law Society, the Institute of Legal Executives and
various other bodies in the legal world. At the moment there is no
front-line regulator for claims handlers and, although the structure
will be in place, that is still a live issue, is it
not?</div><a name="06062340000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000497"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I accept that. My fairly spontaneous response is
that there will be a fourth satellite to deal with the industry, coming
under the general umbrella of the new legal services board but not
dealing with the other three distinct professional
groups.</div><a name="06062340000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000498"></a>John
Mann:</b> Will ongoing consumer complaints be immediately
admissible to the regulator, and will the regulator be given guidance
on relevant Law Society policy decisions made over the past year or two
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 103</div>could provide good guidance on how the regulator should deal with
complaints against claims
handlers?</div><a name="06062340000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000499"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:</b> The question of who is the regulator must be
followed by the question of who pays for the regulator. The clause
allows the Secretary of State to pay grants to the regulator, and in
another place Baroness Ashton has stated that she envisages an initial
grant of &#163;750,000 to launch it. The regulator will have the
power under paragraph 7 of the schedule to
charge</div><a name="06062340000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fees in
connection with applications for, or the grant of,
authorisation&#148;</div><a name="06062340000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div><a name="06062340000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;periodic
fees for authorised
persons&#148;.</div><a name="06062340000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
considerable powers, and I would welcome further assurances from the
Minister about the level of fees
envisaged.</div><a name="06062340000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter
of funding should be about having a level playing field for the fees
involved and ensuring that all those covered by the regulations pay for
the regulator rather than just some of the participants. We need
further to explore how to set the level of fees, as it is likely that
there will be different levels depending on a number of factors, such
as turnover, type of activity and so on. In another place Baroness
Ashton stated that she believes the number of players in the market
will drop dramatically once a system of regulation is introduced. I am
sure that all members of the Committee would welcome that, even if we
approach the matter from different perspectives. It means that there
can be no certainty about the level of fees or whether the system can
be
self-funding.</div><a name="06062340000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000500"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I appreciate the concerns that the hon.
Gentleman has expressed about who should regulate. I said on Second
Reading, and repeat now, that we have decided that the DCA should be
the regulator for a couple of good reasons. First, as the hon. Member
for North Southwark and Bermondsey said today and made clear on Second
Reading, it is an interim solution pending the wider reform of legal
services. In the longer term it would be ideal to have an organisation
independent of Government to regulate the service, but we need to act
quickly and effectively to tackle the abuses that consumers are
experiencing. That is why the Secretary of State being regulator fits
the bill.</div><a name="06062340000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
considered a number of existing regulators, but none proved suitable.
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire mentioned the Claims
Standards Council as one example. Irrespective of the desire of some
existing organisations to take on the role, we did not believe that the
Financial Services Authority, with its existing responsibilities, was a
particularly suitable candidate, and the same might be said for the
Office of Fair Trading. Both have tightly defined remits and it would
not be appropriate to distract either organisation from its core
regulatory work.</div><a name="06062340000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said on Second Reading
and reiterated today that the industry should be regulated by what he
referred to as a member of the family of regulating legal services.
Like him, I believe that claims 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 104</div>management services are much more akin to legal services than to
financial ones. Yes, sometimes claims management companies carry out
insurance and so on after the event and, in that case, they would be
regulated by the FSA. However, as for claims management, they should be
regulated by the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman was right. When
companies undertake that type of service after the event, they should
be regulated by the FSA, but it only gives authorisation in respect of
the insurance activity, not the claims management activity. In claims
management, profits are made from the fees that would come from
solicitors, so it seems more appropriate that such matters are
regulated under the
system.</div><a name="06062340000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Baroness
Ashton of Upholland had discussions with the Economic Secretary to the
Treasury when the Bill was discussed in the other place. They agreed
that the FSA should concentrate on doing what it is good at, which is
regulating financial services. We have invited expressions of interest
from trading standards departments to run the monitoring and compliance
of the function and I hope, if I can, to give members of the Committee
more details about the regulatory regime before the Bill leaves the
House and, indeed, give them details about the appointment of the
appropriate senior individual in the DCA to lead the
implementation.</div><a name="06062340000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000501"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Does the hon. Lady accept that, when the legal
services board is set up, it should be completely independent of the
Government? It should not have any conflicts of interest. If the
Secretary of State is to be one of the regulators underneath the legal
services board, which he has appointed, does she agree that there would
be a problem of independence, conflicts of interest and the like? Is it
not the case that there must be an ultimate solution that has some
independent regulator under the legal services
board?</div>
<a name="06062340000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000502"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Yes, I agree absolutely. Of course, the legal
services board will be able to regulate directly if it chose to do so.
We will be looking carefully at that matter to reach a suitable
long-term
solution.</div><a name="06062340000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
impact of the regulation of the market becomes clear and the wider
reforms of the legal services are further advanced, we might be able to
make a much better decision about the longer-term solution for delivery
regulation within the framework. On that basis, I ask the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw amendment No.
20.</div><a name="06062340000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 25
suggests that the Secretary of State could designate only the FSA as
regulator. I have already covered the reasons why that would not be
appropriate. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw that
clause 8 will allow for transitional provisions and that will, for
example, give the regulator discretion to investigate complaints in
respect of conduct that had started before the Bill becomes
law.</div> <a name="06062340000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
hon. Member for Kettering that we will be consulting on the formula for
setting the level of fees. We envisage that it is likely to include a
one-off application fee and an annual fee based on turnover. Obviously,
that will be proportionate. We have the funds in place to ensure that
the regime can be set up properly and that the consumer can benefit
immediately from the Bill when it is
enacted.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000503"></a>John
Mann:</b> The Minister did not quite answer my point about
whether direction will be given to the regulator to take into
consideration the Law Society&#146;s policy decisions made over the
past couple of years that have implications for claims
handlers.</div><a name="06062340000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000504"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I will certainly consider that. One of the
problems regarding the extent of an investigation in the transition
period is that there might not be appropriate records of any action
taken by the claims management company, but I shall certainly consider
the Law Society&#146;s role and whether we need to make anything
clearer so that the aspect that my hon. Friend rightly raises can be
covered in the
transition.</div><a name="06062340000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000505"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Having considered the Minister&#146;s response, I
think that it is right to reflect further on the matter, so I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="06062340000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06062340000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000506"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in clause 4, page
3, line 11, and end insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;, and
ensuring maximum clarity and simplicity of all relevant
documents,'.</div><a name="06062340000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a very simple amendment to try to ensure that the regulator, if we
are to have one, does the most important job of all, which is to ensure
that anybody providing information provides it as clearly as possible.
We all spend our lives complaining that anything that is or could be
legal or results in a right, an entitlement, a claim, an action or
damages is often governed by small print. That is the bugbear of
insurance policies: people claim insurance and are suddenly told,
&#147;I&#146;m sorry, you&#146;re excluded,&#148; because of
the small print.</div> <a name="06062340000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to ensure that we say as clearly as possible that the documents
that issue from the industry should have the maximum clarity and
simplicity. It is a sort of plain English request, and the amendment
would ensure that it happens. There is a terrible danger when we get
into the bureaucracy that a regulator concerned about regulating the
things that matter behind the scenes will not be concerned about
creating simple processes.</div>
<a name="06062340000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">If bright and rich people are
caught by people trying to flog claims, they will survive relatively
untrammelled: the financial consequences will be less serious for them,
and they will be able to cope. If they are very bright, it is on their
own head. The people whom we need to protect are the vulnerable: those
who are not so bright, and certainly not rich, who discover that they
have been caught out.</div>
<a name="06062340000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister,
whether or not she accepts the exact wording, will accept the burden of
the case behind the amendment and will consider putting similar wording
into the Bill. I am not one of those who seeks to make Bills longer
rather than shorter, but it must be a clear duty. We are concerned that
the industry should tell people what it means so that they can
understand it and there is no
confusion.</div><a name="06062340000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000507"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I have some sympathy with the amendment. It is
obviously a good idea that there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 106</div>should be as much clarity as possible, and simplicity is always a good
thing. I am put in mind of the new Coroners Bill, the draft of which
has been published with a plain English explanation next to the legal
provisions. We should try to encourage things to be written in a way
that people can understand.</div>
<a name="06062340000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">If claims handlers have a role,
part of that role is access to justice: explaining to people who might
not realise it that they have a claim. There have been plenty of
examples of that not being done in a straightforward way, and I am one
of the first to say that the area should be properly regulated, but if
claims handlers are talking to, communicating with or giving documents
to people, it is a good idea for those documents to be simple and
straightforward and to have the clarity suggested by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06062340000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000508"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I have every sympathy with the amendment. I
totally agree with the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
on the principle behind his amendment. I do not think, though, that it
is necessary to put it into the
Bill.</div><a name="06062340000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulator is
required under clause 4(2)(c) to promote the interests of persons using
regulated claims management services. The provision implicitly includes
advice and guidance for those wishing to pursue a compensation claim in
the regulated areas. It is right that consumers have clear and relevant
information on the claims process and what they can expect from
authorised persons.</div>
<a name="06062340000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will produce a leaflet aimed
at those using claims management services. It will be written in plain
and unambiguous terms, clearly setting out the obligations of those
working in the regulated areas to provide details of the standard of
services that they will provide. The leaflet will also include
information on charges, cooling-off periods and consumers&#146;
routes of redress if they have any cause for complaint. We also intend
that the authorised persons should provide information and documents
that are clear and easy to understand. The model rules that we
published in March state that all information given to the client
should be clear, transparent, fair and not
misleading.</div><a name="06062340000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey raised the issue of plain
English, and I totally endorse it. We all support the example that the
hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire gave of a plain English
explanatory note to the Coroners Bill, and that is what we want in all
our communication with the public, so that the legal system and legal
services are more accessible to them.</div>
<a name="06062340000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that hon. Members agree
that the draft regulations already sent to them are a good example of
plain English. Having said that, I have made the regulations a hostage
to fortune, and someone will find some gobbledegook in the middle of
them and come back to me about it. I endorse the principle behind the
amendment, but the Bill does not need it and I ask the hon. Gentleman
to withdraw it.</div>
<a name="06062340000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000509"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> In a moment when I have nothing better to do, I
shall look at the rules to see if I can find anything, and if I do, I
shall bring it to the Minister&#146;s attention. I accept her
statement that absolute clarity is dealt with in the rules. Without
troubling her to rise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 107</div>again, when the regulator is set up, which might be in the Department at
first, will she be kind enough to write to them pointing out that the
issue was raised and that she, on behalf of the Government, supported
the view that there should be clarity? With that additional authority
on behalf of the Committee and the Government, I am very happy to beg
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000511"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Again, I very much accept the principle that the
hon. Gentleman advocates in the amendment. The regulator should have
some independence from the industry that is being regulated, and that
would apply if the power to designate an existing body as a regulator
was used. The existing provision, subsection (2)(b), is an adequate
safeguard. We must retain the flexibility to designate a regulator, and
in the longer term, there might be a body that is suitable for that
designation. As we said during an earlier debate, once the legal
services board is set up and the power to designate a regulator is
transferred to it, there might be an opportunity to designate a
regulator. I support the hon. Gentleman on that point.
</div><a name="06062340000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could not agree
more that commercial interests should not influence the regulator, but
the existing requirement to avoid conflicts of interest will ensure
that and provide clear consumer protection. On that basis, I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="06062340000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000512"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I welcome that assurance, and it is good that the
Minister has put it on the record. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000513"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I have one question to put to the Minister. I am
conscious that we are coming to the end of our enthralled attention to
the matter for the day. It is a question that I might have asked under
the previous clause but can equally well ask under this one. I am happy
for the Minister to reply
later.</div><a name="06062340000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
identified the five areas that the regulator will be asked to regulate
on. I listed them earlier. Will she ensure that they use the same
definitions as solicitors have to use when they advertise their
business? Nowadays solicitors can advertise. They do so by category of
subject: welfare law, housing law, employment law and so on. Can we
ensure that there is consistency of definition, so that if there is a
claims regulation business to do with, for example, employment or
criminal injuries compensation, it uses the same list of services that
one can find among the list of services that solicitors offer? That may
need negotiation with the Law Society. I am not sure whether the
society is governed by regulation on how legal services are advertised.
It seems to me that there is logic in having consistency between the
two.</div>
<a name="06062340000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062340000514"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Responding to that question gives me
the opportunity to introduce my friend Mrs. McGlumshie. Officials will
have heard me speak of her. She does not exist and is a figment of my
imagination but becomes very alive when officials use language that I
do not think she would appreciate. In response to what the hon.
Gentleman said, if we can get consistency between what is in the Bill
and what is put on advertising services, we will work towards that. I
will ask the Law Society to discuss with us how we can do
that.</div> <a name="06062340000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">This has been
an important debate. It is an important part of the Bill. It sets up a
system that will give consumers the confidence and the redress that
they need where claims management goes wrong. I am sure that every
Member on the Committee will endorse the fact that we are moving in the
right direction in putting the consumer at the heart of the redress
system.</div> <a name="06062340000323"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
