							<b class="B">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien</b> (Eddisbury) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Conway. I thank the Minister for his two letters that we
have received this morning, one on the cost of the new commission and
one on complaints handling, which relate to an undertaking given in our
proceedings. However, I was a bit disappointed that, while the second
letter on complaints identified my question about the backlog of
complaints&#151;column 123 of the <i class="I">Official Report&#151;</i>it
did not contain the figures. It stated merely that the backlog has now
reduced significantly and the Healthcare Commission is now meeting the
service level agreement target agreed with the Department of Health to
close 95 per cent. of cases within 12 months. I should be grateful to
receive the figures in respect of the backlog. Given that we may be
debating schedule 5, depending on progress, either today or Tuesday, I
should appreciate the Minister providing us with those figures during
this morning&#146;s sitting. I ask him, through you, Mr.
Conway, whether that might be
possible.</div>

due

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000297"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The amendments build on the themes that were
discussed in the debate on clause 16 to ensure effective combating of
health care associated infections and clarity in reporting that to
Parliament. The Health Act 2006 makes provision for the Secretary of
State to issue a code of practice relating to the prevention and
control of HCAIs. It was updated most recently on 11 January 2007. As
the explanatory notes say, the new code will replace that code and
extend it to all regulated activities, not only NHS
bodies.</div>
					<a name="08011784000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 17 queries why the drafting stands at &#147;may&#148; not
&#147;shall&#148;, given the Government&#146;s apparent
commitment to the code of practice. That is such an easy one that I am
hoping the Minister will get us off to a flying start this morning and
accept it, without any cavil. Amendment No. 18 would include in the
code action particularly on screening, bed occupancy and the frequency
and extent of cleaning in health care
premises.</div>
					<a name="08011784000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
oral evidence sessions, Anna Walker from the Healthcare Commission
noted that the extra powers given to the commission would not have
prevented the outbreaks of infection at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells
NHS Trust, a point that will be important to the discussions on future
clauses. However, she noted that the key was
to</div>
					<a name="08011784000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;get proper infection
control processes in
place.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011784000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">She also
said:</div>
					<a name="08011784000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if we find a trust
which is cavalier about putting the right processes in, then the
penalties will be
helpful&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011784000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that the
reality is</div>
					<a name="08011784000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;usually more
fundamental than that&#151;the team does not understand the processes
it needs in place to solve that
problem.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and Social
Care Public Bill Committee, </i>8 January 2008; c.
24.]</div>
					<a name="08011784000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hence, it is crucial that
the code of practice gets matters right and that the Committee supports
the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011784000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is reported on page 16 of the current code that it makes provision for
screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The policy
should make provision for admission screening, which should include
screening of all elective admissions by March 2009, and for screening
of emergency admissions at presentation as soon as it is practical.
However, as we know, the Secretary of State has axed the Prime
Minister&#146;s promise of screening for clostridium difficile. The
Committee may recall that on 6 January on &#147;The Andrew Marr
Show&#148; the Prime Minister said:</div>
					<a name="08011784000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If you go into hospital
you will get screened by next year for MRSA or C.
difficile&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011784000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was
later reported on the BBC under the headline, &#147;Brown pledges
superbug screening: All patients entering NHS hospitals in England will
be screened for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>MRSA and clostridium difficile&#148;. No one from the Government
sought to correct that story, but two days later on 8 January 2008, in
the document &#147;Clean, Safe Care: Reducing Infections and Saving
Lives&#148;, the Secretary of State&#146;s infection control
strategy reports on clostridium difficile
that</div>
					<a name="08011784000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Screening
for colonised patients is inappropriate (most potential cases would not
be identified, and it requires a stool sample), and colonisation
without symptoms is not considered to increase risk of
transmission&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011784000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State is obviously admitting that the Prime Minister was
wrong. The code makes no provisions for bed occupancy other than saying
that on the movement of
patients:</div>
					<a name="08011784000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
should be evidence of joint working between the ICT and the bed
managers in planning patient admissions, transfers, discharges and
movements between departments and other healthcare facilities. Where
necessary, ambulance trusts may need to be involved in such
planning.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011784000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sounds
like a handbook for shepherding patients. We have all heard anecdotal
stories of patients being kept in ambulances to control hospital
admissions and targets. In April 2001 in response to the Select
Committee on Public Accounts the Government
said:</div>
					<a name="08011784000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Health
Authorities should plan bed numbers in order to achieve a bed occupancy
rate of no more than 82 per cent, in
2003-04.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011784000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">After that, the
bed occupancy rate went up. It is still at 84.5 per cent. and in many
parts of hospitals it is way above that. In the past year, the
Government have reduced the number of acute and general beds in the
national health service by the largest proportion since 1982. We have
seen a reduction of 6,000 acute and general beds, which has taken us
down to a figure of 127,000. However, the NHS plan said that there
would be an increase of 2,000 beds to take the figure  up to
135,000.</div>
					<a name="08011784000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year,
<i class="I">The Independent</i> said that the Department had conducted a review
suggesting that reducing bed occupancy to a maximum of 85 per cent.
would save 1,000 cases of MRSA a year. Just last week we heard that the
Worcestershire royal hospital is running so close to capacity that it
has had to cancel operations, send some patients home, send others to
the downgraded Kidderminster hospital and enter into punitive
negotiations with the independent sector treatment centre there. The
hospital in Worcester runs with an occupancy rate that is consistently
above 90 per cent.</div>
					<a name="08011784000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third factor that I have outlined should also be considered: the
frequency and extent of cleaning in health care premises. As I have
discussed on a number of occasions during the Committee&#146;s
proceedings, the Prime Minister&#146;s commitment to deep clean
appears to be something of a whitewash. Not only have fewer than 50
hospitals actually had the deep clean, but it is being paid for from
primary care trust lodgements&#151;the top-slicing that the
Government imposed on local health economies to solve their own central
financial crisis. The deep clean is important, but it is the
maintenance of a clean environment through ongoing cleaning,
particularly the search and destroy approach to HCAIs, which we have
committed to, that would really bring down MRSA rates.</div>
					<a name="08011784000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current code of practice
imposes processes and managerial structures on cleaning, rather than
focusing on the nature of cleaning itself and the outcomes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>required. Given that it is often the refrain of those who make rather
obtuse points on the matter, I wish to state that the cleaning services
at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust were not outsourced; they
were absolutely
in-house.</div>
					<a name="08011784000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 21 will formally give Parliament sight of the draft code, which
hon. Members from all parties will want the Government to get right. As
the points I have outlined show and as we discussed on Tuesday, that is
an area where the Government are failing. Parliamentary debate will
introduce a more effective strategy and a clear priority focus for
parliamentarians and the legislature on one of the key problems in our
constituencies at the present time.</div>
					<a name="08011784000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 19 is
self-explanatory. If the Secretary of State revises the code, it must
be published. Amendment No. 20 is similarly self-explanatory and would
give hon. Members an early warning of health care associated infection
issues in hospitals across the country and in our
constituencies.</div>
					<a name="08011784000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Committee will be aware&#151;it was widely reported on the news
last night and this morning&#151;Leslie Ash yesterday settled for
&#163;5 million, although there were some reports that it was just
&#163;500,000, with the Chelsea and Westminster hospital over her
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus suffering. Yesterday,
<i class="I">The Times </i>reported that legal arguments had begun in the Court
of Session in Edinburgh. Judges are to decide whether the case brought
by 71-year-old Elizabeth Miller, a great grandmother who contracted the
MRSA superbug in hospital, should proceed to a full hearing. She is
suing NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for &#163;30,000, which could
pave the way for hundreds of other sufferers to claim millions of
pounds in damages.</div>
					<a name="08011784000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, the key issue is
whether, by virtue of these amendments, we would be able to give the
necessary priority, focus and parliamentary scrutiny to the revised
code of practice, which is required to be published by the Government.
The Government themselves proclaim that they are focused on dealing
with the matter. We would demand that of any Government given the
desperate situations that arise as a result of hospital associated
infections.</div>
					<a name="08011784000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
looking at this group of amendments, I hope that the Minister will
agree that screening, bed occupancy, and the frequency and extent of
the cleaning in health care premises, in particular a search and
destroy strategy, are key to effective control of health care
associated infections. I hope that he will agree with Anna Walker that
the problem is more often to do with teams that do not understand the
processes that are needed to combat health care associated infections
than a cavalier attitude towards putting in the right
processes.</div>
					<a name="08011784000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,
why has the Secretary of State reneged on the Prime Minister&#146;s
commitment to screen for C. difficile? Why are bed occupancy rates
still so high under this Government and why is no mention made of those
rates under the current code of practice? Why should right hon. and
hon. Members not be formally alerted when the regulations under
paragraph 16(5) of the code are breached? How regularly would the
Minister expect such breaches and, we would argue, reports to happen? I
have high expectations that the Minister will be persuaded by those
arguments and accept our
amendments.</div>

							<b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I understand the motivation behind
these well-intentioned amendments. I want to query a few points on
amendment No. 18 because it attempts to detail what should go into the
Bill. I have some concerns about the list, not because of what is in it
but because of what is not. I do not believe that the list is
comprehensive. For example, new paragraph (c) refers to the frequency
and extent of cleaning in health care premises, but there is no mention
of personal hygiene standards or the responsibility of the individual
health care workers or even the antibiotic policy which, if we are
talking about C. difficile, is just as important, if not more so, as
cleanliness. At the moment, I feel that if those aspects are in the
Bill, undue emphasis could be placed on the procedures and processes
outlined in new paragraph (c), and we might not be able to tackle the
overall picture. With the emerging nature of resistant infections,
situations may arise which require a change in practice. We need to
retain some flexibility so that we can face existing and future
challenges.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I accept the hon. Lady&#146;s fair
question. In principle, I think that she is very sympathetic to what we
are trying to achieve here. It is clear that a Bill that does not
contain anything of this nature would look rather weak because it
leaves everything for others to decide. It would be far better not to
seek to be comprehensive, because things will move on and change. At
this stage it is absolutely clear that the three things cited are
fundamental and unlikely to change, and therefore, rather than have a
comprehensive list, it is important to identify a focus of activity to
allow for prioritisation. At the moment, in terms not only of the Bill
but of the way in which the Government are dealing with the matter in
general, this issue is not sufficiently high on the agenda, and this an
attempt to raise it. I accept that the amendment could have been more
comprehensive, but the danger of that is that one then ends up trying
to include everything, rather than prioritising.</div>

Lady pointed out, scientific advances and knowledge change continually;
we are constantly developing new ways of tackling the challenges,
including health care acquired infections. We all hope that some way
down the track, if we continue the welcome, significant and sustained
fall in health care acquired infections that the Government have
achieved in recent years, we will not be worrying so much about this
issue, but there may be something else that poses challenges to the
health service.</div>

problem that I have with the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman is
the same as that expressed by the hon. Lady. The terms of the amendment

could be unhelpful. I expect that it was tabled as a means for having a
run-around on some of the Opposition&#146;s old chestnuts about
health care acquired infections.</div>

give
way?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000303"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I will give way to the hon. Lady in a second; I
just want to put one or two things on the record to correct errors made
by the hon. Gentleman. The figure on the deep clean is 80 per cent. of
hospitals, and it is already well under way. The &#163;57 million sum
for the deep clean is new money for hospitals, out of the &#163;270
million of new money announced in the comprehensive spending review.
One example of the unhelpful straitjackets that the amendments would
create for the health service concerns bed occupancy rates. As I am
sure the hon. Gentleman is aware, the latest research on bed occupancy
shows that, although up until 2003-04 there may have been a correlation
between high bed occupancy rates and MRSA, since then bed occupancy is
&#147;statistically insignificant.&#148; That is a good example of
how changes in practices and experience show that putting ourselves in
a straitjacket, as the Conservatives are asking us to, could be quite
unhelpful. That is true of the guidance and the issues discussed on
Tuesday, such as the requirement for the Secretary of State, rather
than the independent Healthcare Commission, to report to Parliament
about every single little thing that is going on. As the hon. Member
for Romsey rightly says, such an approach would mean putting oneself in
a rigid system of being required to do things that are no longer
important.</div>

							<a name="08011784000304"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> I am somewhat shocked to hear the Minister use
the expression &#147;old chestnut&#148; in respect of
hospital-acquired infections. I am a member of the Public Accounts
Committee. On two separate occasions, his permanent secretary appeared
before it and if he had used that expression to it, he would certainly
have been put in his place. The permanent secretary will return to the
Committee within the next year on this very subject. It is far too
serious a subject for the Minister to describe as an &#147;old
chestnut.&#148; He has the option of bringing the contents of the
amendment back on Report, redrafted by his officials. If he feels that
this issue will disappear in a few years&#146; time&#151;I hope
that he is right&#151;something approaching a sunset clause would be
appropriate. In other words, let us put it in the Bill because it is
important, not an &#147;old chestnut&#148;, and if in five or 10
years it is no longer regarded as necessary, the wording of a sunset
clause would mean that it would die a natural death as the need for it
disappeared. This issue is serious, and I hope that the Minister will
talk to his permanent secretary about his experience before the Public
Accounts Committee. I doubt that he thought that it was an &#147;old
chestnut&#148;.</div>

							<a name="08011784000305"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The hon. Lady, inadvertently I am sure,
misunderstands my point. I was not saying that the issue of health care
acquired infections is an old chestnut&#151;it is an extremely
serious issue and that is why it is in the Bill, and why the Government
have a &#163;270 million programme to tackle it. It is why I welcome
the significant and sustained falls in health care acquired infections
that we have achieved in recent years, and I hope that that continues.
However, it would be wrong to issue guidelines that are so specific
that they are inflexible with regard to the new, independent Care
Quality Commission, which we are setting up to help us continue to
drive down infection rates.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>
					<a name="08011784000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#147;old chestnuts&#148; that I referred to are some of the issues
that are regularly raised by the Opposition, based, I believe, on a
misunderstanding or an out-of-date understanding of our progress on
health care acquired infections. I gave the example of bed occupancy. I
am not suggesting for a moment that it is not a serious issue; it is.
The Government are tackling it, and we are making welcome progress.
There has been a 10 per cent. reduction in MRSA in the last year, a 7
per cent. reduction in C. difficile, and a 32 per cent. reduction in
health care acquired infections overall since the base year of 2003-04.
I want that progress to continue, but it will not be helped by putting
the new independent body into the straitjacket provided by these
amendments.</div>

Milton</b> (Guildford) (Con): I welcome the Minister&#146;s
reference to the science, and I would be grateful if he gave us the
source of the information about bed-occupancy rates. One of the
problems with the treatment of health care acquired infections is that
precious little science is used. It will be interesting to see what
happens next year&#151;when there will not be &#163;270 million,
and when PCTs and trusts will have to make their own decisions on where
they spend their money&#151;and whether it is felt that the deep
clean was worth it and should be
prioritised.</div>

							<a name="08011784000307"></a>Mr.

						</b> The research that I referred to is a public
document published in December&#151;the McCormick report. However,
the hon. Lady is absolutely right. I do not want to detain the
Committee by going through the entire list of things that have been
happening and are happening to help us make this progress, but it is
important that we have sustained investment. That is why we welcomed
the comprehensive spending review settlement, which is very good as far
as our Department is concerned and constitutes a 4 per cent. real
increase in spending in the health service for each of the next three
years. I am not sure whether the Conservative party is still committed
to meeting that spending.</div>
					<a name="08011784000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the substance of
the amendments, I do not think that they would be helpful. I understand
why they were tabled&#151;to give the Opposition a chance to repeat
the inaccuracies that were presented to us on Tuesday&#151;but they
would be unhelpful in our efforts to continue the sustained
progress.</div>

						</b> I suspect that the rest of the Committee, if they
would wipe the smiles of their smug faces, would be equally disturbed
and appalled by the Minister&#146;s performance. We could do without
smug party points. We are dealing with the deaths of 270 people at
Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells that could have been avoided with better
procedures. That was a disgraceful performance by the Minister, and I
am shocked.</div>

							<b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): Is the hon. Gentleman
seriously suggesting that it is disgraceful to try to promote part of
what is being done to deal with this very serious issue? Every member
of the Committee agrees that is a very serious issue; is it really
disgraceful to point out where we have made, and are committed to
continuing, improvements, and to put that on the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000310"></a>Mr.

						</b> We all wish to see the best measures to tackle
this. What we do not like is the smug approach taken by a Government
who know that they have an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>inbuilt majority, and who therefore think that the
entire procedure of scrutinising the Bill is a waste of time and rather
wish that they were not here. Far from it. We are absolutely committed
and very sincere about the amendments and we shall be voting on them.
This is not a game to get some happy little comments on the record. It
is a serious question of trying to get the best performance and
prioritisation for dealing with this issue in parliamentary terms. This
has become serious because of the tone and attitude of the Minister in
responding to a matter of this seriousness. We should recognise, on the
record, that that should be repelled.</div>

						</b> Ah&#151;so the hon. Gentleman thinks that the

he wishes to press it to a Division. If the amendment is defective, he
should withdraw it; if it is not, he should press it to a Division.
Which is
it?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000314"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman was listening
when I responded to the hon. Lady. I said that the purpose of the
amendment was not to be comprehensive, but to highlight and prioritise
matters on which Parliament must focus.</div>
					<a name="08011784000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, the amendment would
give flexibility. We have the Report stage and the Bill will be
scrutinised in another place, so the Government could recognise that
they can tweak it. If they do not tweak it, and if they choose simply
to resist and to make the measures generic and unspecific, that raises
questions about the prioritisation of, and focus on, the requirement
for accountability to Parliament. There should at least be a tie-in
with the Public Accounts Committee, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Tiverton and Honiton so ably pointed out, so that there is annual
scrutiny, not least in the person of the permanent secretary. We need
to tie-in the prioritisation of parliamentary accountability rather
than relying, as we will under the Bill, on an Executive who seem not
to take the measure with the seriousness that it deserves. They seem to
think that the intention behind the amendments is partisan point
scoring, which it quite patently is not. I rest my
case.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000315"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman would be best
advised to rethink the matter on Report. I am concerned about
unintended consequences. For example, if we are too prescriptive about
bed occupancy regulations, we could create a conflict. When a person is
in an emergency situation, will a hospital official say, &#147;We
cannot accept you because we would be in breach of the bed occupancy
regulations&#148;? That person could die not because of MRSA, but
because they had to be moved to another hospital. Whatever capacity any
Government build into the health system, those situations will arise.
The hon. Gentleman must think through all the consequences of the
amendment. It is well intentioned, but we need to ensure that the
situation I described does not arise.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000316"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but the amendment
states:</div>
					<a name="08011784000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
code of practice must make reference
to&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011784000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the measure would
not be exclusive; rather, the intention is to draw attention to
prioritisation. Furthermore, if the science says that bed occupancy
rates are indeed leading to MRSA, she cannot surely be suggesting that
a hospital should accept a person if that would lead to their getting
MRSA. On the contrary, the whole point of the science is that it should
be a matter of judgment if someone who should otherwise obviously be
accepted into a hospital is almost certain to contract
MRSA.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b> New clause 2 seeks to establish a service user
panel, and amendment No. 76 is consequent on that, making sure that the
CQC consults such a panel in formulating guidance under clause 19.
Naturally, that builds on the discussions that the Committee has
already had on service user involvement under clause 2 and amendments
Nos. 2 and 134. The Committee can refer back to the points that were
made in column 146 and following, rather than me restating them into
the record. I hope that that is a helpful reference. I highlight again
that, in response to the consultation preceding this Bill, the
Department stated
that</div>
					<a name="08011784000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many responses
supported the greater input from patients and users of services
proposed in the consultation document... The Care Quality
Commission will be a user focused
organisation&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08011784000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
I
emphasise&#151;</div>
					<a name="08011784000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;recognising
that it can only do this effectively by involving
them.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011784000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Which?
notes in its submission:</div>
					<a name="08011784000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is a startling
omission that the new body charged with overseeing the quality of
health and social care will not have a duty to take patients&#146;
views into account in the course of their
work.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011784000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I would
encourage the Minister to heed the Conservative party&#146;s
commitment to Healthwatch, a national consumer voice for patients and
service users.</div>
					<a name="08011784000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The service
user panel can provide a high-level mechanism by which the commission
can receive advice from service users. Plans, processes and
methodologies that are relevant to the quality of care, the experience
of service users and the successful engagement of service users
generally can be developed in co-operation with an expert group on such
matters. Patients and service users will be reassured that there is a
voice for their interests at a high level. Moreover, the panel can seek
wider views as required, which will further build confidence in the
regulator.</div>
					<a name="08011784000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofcom has a
consumer panel that plays a similar role, and it convenes a regular
consumer forum of interested parties such as consumer and disability
organisations. The Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator, under
clauses 101 and 102, and the Council for Healthcare Regulatory
Excellence, under clause 108(4), are both given duties to consult the
public, including bodies that seem to them to represent the views of
patients; there is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>no such duty for the commission. The service user panel can at least act
as a proxy for such wider
consultation.</div>
					<a name="08011784000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister made clear in an earlier debate that the Department expects
the CQC to establish, under schedule 1, paragraph 6, a panel similar to
that proposed in the amendment. That will give the commission the duty
to establish at least one advisory panel. No doubt, that commitment
will be used to call the CQC and the Minister to account when the CQC
begins operating.</div>
					<a name="08011784000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister noted that he was still reflecting on the issue, and he
undertook to come back to the Committee with clearer thinking on the
subject. We hope that he will include Local Involvement Networks in the
Bill&#151;I am sure that the Committee remembers that
discussion&#151;and consultation with patients and service
users.</div>
					<a name="08011784000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Minister agree that the voice of patients and service users is key to
generating effective guidance on compliance with requirements? Does he
agree that the new clause and amendment No. 76 would give him the
precise vehicle that he seeks, and that he will therefore be minded to
accept them?</div>
					<a name="08011784000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000341"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> As I have indicated in previous sittings, I am
still reflecting on the question of public and patient involvement. In
respect of the Opposition&#146;s affection for the new national body
Healthwatch, there is nothing to stop LINks forming a national network
if they wish, but we are trying to move away from the top-down approach
from Whitehall to a more bottom-up approach. We would certainly welcome
that development. It is very much up to LINks, as autonomous bodies, to
decide if that is what they would like to do.</div>
					<a name="08011784000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have indicated, part 1
requires the commission to have regard for the people who use the
services in everything that it does. As the hon. Gentleman
acknowledges, the Bill already requires the commission to establish an
advisory committee under schedule 1, and it also provides for the
commission to establish further committees or sub-committees, such as
one that comprises solely service users. They might have specific
functions or a more general function, allowing the commission to decide
how best to seek input from different representative groups.</div>
					<a name="08011784000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem with the new clause
is that it proposes that the commission should determine the functions
of the panel, while specifying a number of functions that must be
included. Again, there is a debate to be had between flexibility and
inflexibility. The new clause seems to be giving the commission the
flexibility to decide how it uses the panel, but we believe that the
commission can use a group to look at specific matters. It is important
that a representative group should have the freedom to express its
views in relation to any of the commission&#146;s functions, rather
than being restricted to functions specified in the clause, and any
other matters that the commission determines. That is reflected in
schedule 1.</div>
					<a name="08011784000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 43
requires the commission to publish a document on the frequency of
reviews, and clause 75 requires it to publish its programme of special
reviews and investigations. As with all the commission&#146;s
functions, it must have regard to the views of the public when
preparing those documents. On the basis of those reassurances, I invite
the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08011784000342"></a>Mr.
O&#146;Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for
restating that he continues to reflect on these matters. It would
therefore be premature to press the amendment at this stage. I think
that we can with some confidence look forward to something being
produced on Report, given what he said. However, I caution the Minister
against being a little too ready to be contemptuous of the concept of
Healthwatch. It may well be instructive that he wants to give that
rather more thought when he is reflecting on these matters. He will
recall that the establishment and coming together of LINks was
something that was won in another place on another Bill, on which my
noble Friend Earl Howe led. Therefore, the Minister needs to be a bit
careful about assuming that he has found the magic recipe for the
bottom-up approach, rather than the Whitehall, top-down approach.
Healthwatch is intended to be part of an organic, bottom-up approach.
Having offered those cautions, but in the positive context in which the
Minister is reflecting on these matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000344"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> As with a similar amendment proposed to clause
18, I appreciate the Opposition&#146;s concern with parliamentary
scrutiny of these issues. Again, however, I am not wholly convinced
that this proposal would represent the best use of parliamentary time.
Standards for better health, against which the Healthcare Commission
judges NHS bodies, are not currently laid before Parliament; nor are
the national minimum standards that both the Healthcare Commission and
the Commission for Social Care Inspection use to determine whether
those health and adult social care providers that they register are fit
to remain
registered.</div>
					<a name="08011784000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
includes specific provision requiring the new commission to consult on
the guidance, or on any substantial revisions to it. The hon. Member
for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) commented on Second Reading that
there is a point at which one has to trust on such matters and the
Secretary of State should be relied on to carry out an open and genuine
consultation. I argue that we should be equally satisfied that we can
rely on the commission to consult such people as are appropriate when
developing guidance under the clause. The guidance will then be
published. It will be a public document available for anyone with an
interest to read. That is a reasonable arrangement. For that reason, I
invite the hon. Member for Eddisbury to withdraw the

cover.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011784000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Writ large across

definitely or probably the main cause of death...C. difficile
definitely contributed to the deaths of approximately 145 out of 345
people, and probably or definitely to approximately 270 out of 345
people.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011784000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the Health
and Safety Executive and Kent police investigated whether they could
bring charges against senior managers. I think that I am right in
saying&#151;I am more than happy to stand corrected if it is not the
case&#151;that neither the HSE nor Kent police have yet drawn any
conclusions, or brought the matter to a conclusion. That is relevant
because the force of this clause may be to limit what the commission
can and cannot do.</div>
					<a name="08011784000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee will also be
aware that the chief executive, Rose Gibb, was told that she would get
a pay-off of at least &#163;250,000 when she quit. Although the
Secretary of State stepped in to block that payment, the Department has
not yet confirmed whether he was successful. <i class="I">The Sunday
Express</i>,<i class="I"> </i>on  30 December 2007, reported the
following:</div>
					<a name="08011784000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sources at the
Department of Health conceded it is &#145;likely&#146; that she
will eventually receive at least some of the money when legal arguments
are finished.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011784000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
health care assistants have been sacked from the trust. One staff nurse
and another health care assistant have been disciplined, but will
remain. In light of that and similar cases, should not the Committee
leave the door open for failure to observe the provisions of the code
of practice on health care associated infections to be justiciable or
triable in court? Does it not say something about the lack of
seriousness with which the Government are
approaching the issue, and their lack of faith in their own code and in
our NHS, that they may be unwilling to do so?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>
					<a name="08011784000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">If amended, this clause would
enable an individual to sue for negligence on the basis of illness or
injuries arising from the failure to observe the code of practice on
HCAIs. This issue is crucial to understanding the import of the
question whether the clause should stand as it is, thereby removing the
teeth of any form of civil or criminal legal sanctions. For example,
has the Secretary of State been successful in blocking Rose
Gibb&#146;s &#163;250,000 pay-off? I am sure that each and every
one of us would regard it as a scandal if she received a penny piece,
in the light of what took place. Where are the police investigations up
to, and why should such failings not end up in court? If they are not
to end up in court, why should we engage the police&#146;s time at
all? Surely, the whole point would be to have internal inquiries or a
commission inquiry.</div>
					<a name="08011784000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the commission has no teeth,
what will be the sanctions? As we all know, it is very rare that one
needs to refer to legal sanctions, if they exist, because everyone
knows whom they are dealing with&#151;the commission or the
police&#151;and where the case may end up. That, in itself, has an
extraordinarily powerful effect, without ending up in either civil or
criminal proceedings. If those sanctions are not available, I can well
imagine that people will be able to run rings round this provision. I
hope, therefore, that the Minister realises that our amendment would
give to the commission, which the Government are putting into statute,
the teeth that it currently lacks, in order to ensure that it is
effective. Rejecting the amendment will create problems over time. It
would be genuinely instructive to keep in mind the events at Maidstone
and Tunbridge Wells and, in particular, Rose Gibb and what might have
happened as a result of the failures that she unfortunately allowed to
happen.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000347"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> This clause and the amendments do not relate to
employment contracts or redundancy arrangements, so I shall not comment
on them.</div>
					<a name="08011784000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support for the new enforcement powers and
I share his desire for them to have teeth. However, the amendment is
perhaps based on a misunderstanding of, or a blurring of the
distinction between, guidance and regulation. The amendment would give
statutory force to the guidance, but it is the regulations that will
have statutory force. The guidance will inform the regulations, which
we will consult on, as I have indicated on a number of occasions. The
problem with giving statutory force to guidance is that it is not
scrutinised by this House, which is why subsection (2) of the clause
clarifies that, as is common, guidance can be used in court as evidence
of what could reasonably be expected to constitute compliance with the
legislative requirements. Those are what have the legal force, because
they are scrutinised by Parliament. That is in the interests of
fairness and justice to the
accused.</div>
					<a name="08011784000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made
it clear that I do not think the amendment appropriate. The Bill and
regulations made under it will set out all the legal requirements that
the services must meet. Clause 31 makes it an offence to contravene or
fail to comply with those requirements. It would be inappropriate,
therefore, to make it a criminal offence not to comply with the
guidance, when it will be an offence not to do so with the regulations,
which will be informed by the guidance.</div>

							<a name="08011784000348"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> We are genuinely struggling with this point,
although I am grateful to the Minister for seeking to address it. Often
the easiest way for the Opposition to scrutinise a Bill is simply to
ask why something has been drafted in a certain way. However, we really
are wrestling with this piece of drafting. Interestingly, during
consideration of previous clauses, I did not ask why the Government
have used in the Bill the words, &#147;health care associated
infections&#148;. The word &#147;associated&#148; seems to have
become a substitute for &#147;acquired&#148;, which is more
commonly used; indeed, the Minister used it earlier. When one sees a
word moved like that, one must question what is meant by it. It could
not have happened by accident, because those who draft these Bills are
highly expert wordsmiths and lawyers. It is right, therefore, that we
question this.</div>
					<a name="08011784000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
very interested in the Minister&#146;s answer. He spoke about how
removing clause 21(3) would give guidance statutory force, when it
should be, in effect, best-practice advice&#151;I think that that is
what he suggested&#151;and about the resulting inflexibility. I can
understand that in relation to clause 19; however, clause 17 refers to
a code of practice. The Minister, therefore, seems to be saying that
the code of practice is no more than guidance. This point has been
central to our discussions this morning: are we really saying that,
because this is such a framework portmanteau Bill&#151;drafted in
generic terms and hugely dependent upon the publication, scrutiny and
acceptance of the regulations in order to bring into play the true
force of law&#151;the code is to be no more than guidance? In that
case, why is there a distinction between &#147;code&#148; in clause
17 and &#147;guidance&#148; in clause 19? If there is no
difference, should we not just call them one thing?</div>
					<a name="08011784000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively, should we not
recognise that the code is likely to need some statutory underpinning,
so that breaches of its provisions are justiciable? That would give the
commission enforcement powers that would carry the credibility that we
all want. We discussed whether the list was sufficiently comprehensive
and flexible under previous amendments, the essence of which was to put
parliamentary prioritisation in the minds of all of us who are
concerned about the matter. Here, the amendment would give legal
earnest to the operation of the commission, using its code. There is
differentiation between the words &#147;code&#148; and
&#147;guidance&#148; in the two clauses, and if the Minister is
going to resist the amendment because he believes that a breach of
guidance should be subject to statutory legal proceedings, my point
about that difference remains valid. I am not satisfied on the point,
and I think that it will be appropriate to press the
amendment.</div>

						</b> First, the words &#147;code&#148; and
&#147;guidance&#148; are equivalent in this case. We are using the
word &#147;code&#148; in one instance for consistency and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>continuity with the existing health care associated
infection code of practice. The hon. Gentleman asked why we have
changed the wording from &#147;health care acquired&#148; to
&#147;health care associated&#148;. It is partly to broaden the
definition, because there have been cases, for example, of visitors to
hospitals acquiring infections, which is nothing to do with their own
health care. The infection is not acquired through their health care
but associated with health care in general. I hope that that helps the
hon.
Gentleman.</div>

record that &#147;code&#148; and &#147;guidance&#148; are
indeed the same thing in this case, and that they are not intended to
be justiciable either civilly or criminally, I do not need to press the
amendment to a Division. The issue is left standing and perhaps needs
to be thought through, in the absence of knowing the remit of the
regulations that will be the statutory underpinning giving rise to
legal proceedings. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

scope of the clause. However, I hope that the Committee accepts that it
would be sensible to flag up our thinking the clause. I believe that we
will have the opportunity to debate the matter later, but I want to
signpost that warning notices would also be triggered by
recommendations arising from complaints. At the moment, we have not
seen that, and I hope that we can return to that issue later in the
Bill. We thought it relevant to this clause, but we were unable to
frame a suitable amendment to force debate, so we will leave it to
another time. I hope that that is a useful signpost for the
Minister.</div>

							<a name="08011784000354"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> There is some discussion to be had on this
clause, because it concerns urgent cancellation, which is done on
application to a justice of the peace. We will have a longer discussion
on the role of justices of the peace when we debate part 3 of the Bill,
and my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford will lead for us on
that.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>
					<a name="08011784000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume that
the clause is the legislative framework for the much trailed 24-hour
closure of hospitals. The Committee should know that by agreeing to the
clause it will be supporting that power. The Department briefed on this
on 23 October, before the Bill was published. On 24 October, there was
a written ministerial statement, which <i class="I">The Times </i>and<i class="I"> The
Daily Telegraph</i> both reported. They reported that the Secretary of
State was angry that the Healthcare Commission did not step in to try
to protect patients or alert the Government to the scale of the problem
when it first made its
report.</div>
					<a name="08011784000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">A draft of the
Healthcare Commission report into the problems at Maidstone and
Tunbridge Wells arrived at the Department on 3 May 2007, but no action
was taken by the Department at that point. This is a useful opportunity
for the Minister to explain why. <i class="I">The Times</i> further
reported:</div>
					<a name="08011784000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Health Secretary is also expected to reveal in a Commons statement that
the new inspectorate will have powers to sack doctors and trust chief
executives
immediately&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011784000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State already has the power to suspend board members, but
the previous Secretary of State did not use that power when she
received the Healthcare Commission report in May. Furthermore, there
was no mention of the Care Quality Commission having that power in the
ministerial statement of 24 October, by which time we had a new
Secretary of State. I cannot see a reference to the power in the Bill.
No doubt the Minister will point it out to us if I have missed
it.</div>
					<a name="08011784000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
should also note Anna Walker&#146;s response to the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Northfield when she gave evidence to the Committee. She
said that the new powers to close wards &#147;are not

hon. Gentleman will remember that exchange, and I hope that he will
tell the Committee what insight he gained from that line of
questioning, which we thought interesting.</div>
					<a name="08011784000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the same sitting, Ian
Kennedy said
that</div>
					<a name="08011784000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;anybody

					<a name="08011784000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his statement to the
press on the day of the Committee hearing, he said
that</div>
					<a name="08011784000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it would be
cavalier to close an element of a major public service without offering
patients any
alternative.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011784000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
highlighted those issues, I hope that the Minister will confirm to the
Committee whether that is the current arrangement and whether it
provides sufficient checks and balances.</div>
					<a name="08011784000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">With half an eye to the next
clause, will the Minister also tell us how the Human Rights Act 1998
would be applied in circumstances in which urgent cancellation might
breach aspects of that Act? For example, the cancellation of a nursing
care home&#146;s registration might lead to the quick eviction of its
residents. One 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>can imagine such a scenario, and it is our job to work out how the
rights of patients in such circumstances would interleave with the
protection that must be afforded if something has gone sufficiently
wrong that a notice withdrawing registration has been received. I
appreciate that this point may be a touch legalistic, as I am not sure
that if I had a relative in a home that had had its registration
removed, I would be very keen for that relative to stay there a minute
longer, because I expect that there would be good reason for such a
move. However, if the relative were very frail, the speed of eviction
might have to be balanced, so the issue of rights would be
relevant.</div>
					<a name="08011784000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
ensure that people&#146;s choices in those circumstances are not
limited by the absence of alternatives. There may be practical
considerations for people who live in remote areas where there is only
one care home for many miles, but equally often people do not have
caring relatives or friends who can look out for them when such
difficult urgent decisions need to be made.</div>
					<a name="08011784000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
be able to deal with the question of how the power will help the CQC to
deal with superbugs in hospitals, given the remarks made on behalf of
the Healthcare Commission in oral evidence. Is the power to be granted
on the basis of exigency rather than need? I hope that the Government
are not trying to sound tough in the light of recent events. We saw
that the Department had briefed <i class="I">The Times</i> to the effect that the
CQC will have the power to sack doctors and trust chief executives
immediately; but at the moment we struggle to see where that power is
set
out.</div>

							<b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
also consider that there may be an issue relating to appeals? If an
order for the closure of, for example, the type of residential facility
that he has described is made with immediate effect, so that residents
are moved out almost immediately, and an appeal is won 28 days later,
there may be a difficulty for those who own and run the
facility.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000356"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend&#151;I had not
thought about that. It is an important point, because the purpose of
the 28-day appeal period is to give people an opportunity for fairness
and justice; yet such a situation would not arise unless matters were
judged to be so serious that most people would say that it was time to
get out. It is a matter not only of fairness and justice for the
providers or owners of the care setting, but of the rights of, and
fairness and justice for, the patients. They are often so frail and
vulnerable that the prospect of a move from surroundings that have
become familiar&#151;this may be particularly important for people
with dementia, who hold on to the physical aspects of their
surroundings more than other things&#151;can be sufficiently
dislocating to cause their condition to decline. We would all want such
effects to be avoided. My hon. Friend&#146;s point is extremely
interesting and important, and I expect that the Minister will respond
to
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000357"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I imagine that we shall shortly come to a more
general discussion of the powers, so I shall not dwell on that subject
now but speak instead directly to the clause, which gives the Care
Quality Commission 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>power to apply to a justice of the peace for an order urgently to cancel
the registration of a service provider or manager. It sets out the
tests that must be met, and requires the commission to notify a number
of bodies when it applies for such an order. We all recognise that
there may be exceptional occasions when such action may be necessary.
The condition for taking such a drastic course of action would be that
there was serious risk to a person&#146;s life, health or
well-being.</div>
					<a name="08011784000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to deal with concerns about notifying the relevant bodies
quickly when such an application is made, because, as the hon. Member
for Rugby and Kenilworth has pointed out, arrangements will need to be
made to look after any patients or clients who may be affected. That is
why the provisions require the commission to notify, where appropriate,
the relevant local authority, primary care trust or strategic health
authority monitor. I do not want to engage in a debate about the powers
now, because we shall come on to that in a moment, but I remind Members
of the evidence given to the Committee by Dame Denise Platt. She
recognised, as we all do, that some of the new powers in the Bill may
not, as the hon. Member for Eddisbury said, be appropriate for acute or
accident and emergency wards. However, CSCI welcomes the new and
broader range of powers because at present it is faced with the stark
choice of nothing or closure.</div>
					<a name="08011784000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are permissive powers,
but that does not mean that the Care Quality Commission will use them.
As Anna Walker indicated, it may not need to use them, although they
may be useful as a deterrent and she would not want not to have them.
Dame Denise appealed to us not to change the powers or weaken them in
any way, because they would be useful in the social care context, and
that was what was important to her.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b> The amendments would empower the CQC to seek
stronger sanctions against providers who commit offences. Amendments
Nos. 201 and 202 would amend clauses 30 and 31 respectively. They arise
from Anna Walker&#146;s comments when giving oral evidence. She said
that</div>
					<a name="08011784000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at the end of a
process like that, there is often considerable public anger and concern
about what has gone on and I wonder whether some of the penalty issues
need to be recognised in that context. The maximum fine allowed under
the new legislation would be &#163;50,000. There is an issue about
public concern which that measure does not
meet&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and Social
Care Public Bill Committee, </i>8 January 2008; c. 25, Q36.]</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>
					<a name="08011784000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point was also made that not only is a
wider spectrum of sanctions needed; it will be important to have
sanctions suitable for the body in question, given the range of
providers that the CQC will register&#151;from small care homes to
giant hospitals. The Minister alluded to that point in his response to
the last clause stand part debate. There is a world of a difference
between what might need to be done in relation to an accident and
emergency hospital facility, compared with a small care home.</div>
					<a name="08011784000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would ensure
that there is potential for more serious offences to be tried in the
Crown court, rather than receiving a maximum fine of &#163;50,000
from magistrates. I therefore ask the Minister, why is the Crown court
not available in the pursuit of sanctions? Does he agree with Anna
Walker that stronger sanctions need to be available to the CQC? How
will these sanctions compare with the current
sanctions?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011784000363"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> With your indulgence, Mr. Conway, I
will respond briefly to a question that was asked earlier by the hon.
Gentleman, to save time and to avoid the danger that I may forget to do
so. In fact, he asked two specific questions: first, why this
particular tribunal? The Care Standards Tribunal currently hears cases
under the Care Standards Act 2000, so we are using that for continuity
purposes. Secondly, he asked for the specific figures on outstanding
complaints with the Healthcare Commission. In July 2006, the number of
open cases was 5,180. In July 2007 it had gone down to 2,298, and I
understand that the commission is now meeting its service level
agreement targets on complaints. I hope that is helpful to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="08011784000272"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div>
					<a name="08011784000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">On sanctions, I
was slightly puzzled by that bit of Anna Walker&#146;s evidence. On
the one hand, she seemed to imply that the new enforcement powers were
not needed; then, in the quotation given by the hon. Gentleman, there
was also an implication that the fines were not heavy enough. I am not
clear on the matter, but I hope to discuss it informally with her,
which might enable me to reach a better understanding.</div>
					<a name="08011784000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#163;50,000 figure is a ten-fold increase on the status quo, and it
is for a single offence, so there is the potential for multiples of
&#163;50,000. It is not that the maximum fine that could be levied
against a hospital is &#163;50,000&#151;if there is more than one
breach of the regulations, that figure could multiply. As was
acknowledged earlier, the Healthcare Commission is not the only
organisation that has a locus in monitoring patient safety; there is
also the Health and Safety Executive and the criminal law. The hon.
Gentleman was right to remind us that criminal investigations are still
going on in relation to the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells incident.
That does not mean that hospitals or managers will never be liable for
much more serious offences. However, we think that we have come up with
a tougher but proportionate suite of penalties and sanctions that suit
the role of the Healthcare Commission, that are flexible and that the
commission is not forced to use. That should also act as a useful
deterrent, because of the damage to reputation that would be incurred
by one of those fines or penalties. In light of those assurances, I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

informal discussions that the Minister may have with her. I ask that if
those informal discussions result in any proposals, the Minister
discuss them with us first, before consideration on Report, so that we
can see whether we can find a common view. The sanctions, coupled with
the enforcement powers, will be vital to ensuring that we can provide
the teeth that we all wish to see bear down on bad practice, and to
encouraging best practice. With that proviso, I beg to ask leave to

						</b> In what circumstances might the register not be
made public? Which parts of the register might be hidden through
regulations under subsection (3)? I note that the memorandum on
delegated powers gives the example of a list of children&#146;s
homes. As I am sure we are all aware, the regulations here are under
negative procedure, but it would be helpful if the Minister clarified
what those circumstances are and gave examples, particularly those that
might not be made public under subsection
(3).</div>

charge if anybody wants any information from the register. However, in
these days of the internet, should not the registers, in the greater
public interest, be more publicly available, so that people can access
the information when they want to? Doing that would remove a level of
bureaucracy. Will the Minister give some thought to
that?</div>

be provided in the regulations. That will give us a chance to explore
the matter in a little more

my desperate attempt to ensure that we kill the left-hand column of the

amendment No. 27 would include LINks in the list of bodies to be

subsection (1)(d), it would be useful for it to be included in the
Bill. I remind the Committee of the debate on LINks, but I will
explicitly mention now CSCI, which in its submission at paragraph 43
stated:</div>

							<b class="B">Greg
Mulholland</b> (Leeds, North-West) (LD): We have already
expressed our concern at the lack of public involvement enshrined in
the Bill. Although local involvement networks may or may not be the
best way to achieve that, at the moment they are pretty much the only
show in town, so we support the intention behind the Bill. I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div>

both aware of the fact that circumstances change over time. Although I
may have some sympathy with looking at local involvement, I would not
want to prescribe which group is to be involved, in case it ceases to
exist during the lifetime of the
Bill.</div>

Bradshaw:
						</b> They have only just been born, so give them a
chance! As I said, I have sympathy with the motivation behind the
amendment. However, I go back to the point that we have made on a
number of occasions throughout our deliberations about how prescriptive
we are regarding the actions of the new regulator. Although 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>I have stated that LINks will have a valid interest in the work that is
done, I fully expect the Care Quality Commission to work closely with
LINks&#151;not for exactly the same reasons that Members have been
mentioned, but for some of
them.</div>
					<a name="08011784000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
necessarily a good idea to prescribe in the Bill that a particular
organisation should be involved in and pre-warned of all the actions
that the commission is taking, particularly early on in proceedings
before fault or guilt has been found. As I indicated in response to
discussion on another clause, there certain issues that may have to be
handled sensitively, in respect of which it would not be appropriate to
inform LINks or anyone else of the commission&#146;s
activities.</div>
					<a name="08011784000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
sympathise with the spirit of the amendment, the Bill as it stands
strikes the right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>balance between keeping the public and LINks informed, while allowing
the commission to carry out its work fairly and
appropriately.</div>
