<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): 
On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Given the warm 
weather, will it be in order for gentlemen to remove 
their jackets?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have strong views about such matters 
but, if hon. Members wish to look like dealers, they can 
remove their jackets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke </B>(Coatbridge and Chryston): On a 
point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. As you will be aware, a 
very important debate on welfare is to take place in the 
Chamber this afternoon. Some of us wish to listen to that 
debate and take part in it. I hope therefore that you will 
not take it as a discourtesy if some members of the 
Committee are in the Chamber instead of being here this 
afternoon.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Well, Mr. Clarke, that is not really a 
point of order for me. It is an old-fashioned idea that 
Members of Parliament must listen to the arguments 
before deciding how to vote. However, that is a welcome 
development and one that I shall not dissuade hon. 
Members from following. We shall see how we get on.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 2 agreed to.

<H4><center>Non-discrimination notices</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Margaret Hodge):</B> I 
beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 2, line 36, leave 
out from `Commission' to end of line 20 on page 3 and 
insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`is satisfied that a person has committed or is committing an 
unlawful act, it may serve on him a notice (referred to in this Act 
as a non-discrimination notice) which 
<P>
(a) gives details of the unlawful act which the Commission has 
found that he has committed or is committing; and
<P>
(b) requires him not to commit any further unlawful acts of the 
same kind (and, if the finding is that he is committing an 
unlawful act, to cease doing so).
<P>
(2) The notice may include recommendations to the person 
concerned as to action which the Commission considers he could 
reasonably be expected to take with a view to complying with the 
requirement mentioned in subsection (1)(b).
<P>
(3) The notice may require the person concerned 
<P>
(a) to propose and finalise an adequate action plan (subject to 
and in accordance with Part IIA of Schedule 3) with a view 
to securing compliance with the requirement mentioned in 
subsection (1)(b); and
<P>
(b) once that action plan is finalised, to take any action which 
<P>
(i) is specified in the plan; and
<P>
(ii) he has not already taken,

<P>
(4) For the purposes of subsection (3) 
<P>
(a) an action plan is a document drawn up by the person 
concerned specifying action (including action he has 
already taken) intended to change anything in his practices, 
policies, procedures or other arrangements which

(i) caused or contributed to the commission of the 
unlawful act concerned; or
<P>
(ii) is liable to cause or contribute to a failure to comply 
with the
<P>
 requirement mentioned in subsection (1)(b); and
<P>
(b) an action plan is adequate if the action specified in it would 
be sufficient to ensure, within a reasonable time, that he is 
not prevented from complying with that requirement by 
anything in his practices, policies, procedures or other 
arrangements;
<P>
and the action specified in an action plan may include ceasing an 
activity or taking continuing action over a period.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
the following: Amendment No. 14, in page 2, line 37 after 
`person', insert `or corporate body'.
<P>
Amendment No. 15, in page 2, line 41, after `person', 
insert `or corporate body'.
<P>
Amendment No. 4, in page 3, line 3, leave out from 
beginning to `provisions' in line 6 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) The Commission may include in a non-discrimination notice'.
<P>
Amendment No. 5, in page 3, line 18, leave out
<P>
`The regulations may provide for a non-discrimination notice to' 
and insert `A non-discrimination notice may'.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 21, 27 to 30, 33 to 37, 
39 to 45 and 26.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am sorry that there are so many 
amendments, but I hope to take the Committee logically 
through them. They fulfil a commitment that we gave in 
the other place to consider further amendments tabled by 
Baroness Blatch and Lord Ashley and I am pleased to 
have tabled them.
<P>
Clause 4 on non-discrimination notices currently 
contains a regulation-making power to allow the Secretary 
of State to define the scope of non-discrimination notices. 
Baroness Blatch and Lord Ashley were keen to ensure 
that the scope of non-discrimination notices was defined 
in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 demonstrate the 
Opposition's desire to pursue that issue.
<P>
Having considered the matter further and taken account 
of the strong views about it in another place, our 
amendments will define the scope of non-discrimination 
notices. The relevant amendments are Nos. 20 and 21. 
Amendment No. 26 to clause 12 and amendment Nos. 27 
to 30, 33 to 37, 40 to 42, 44 and 45 to schedule 3 are 
consequential to the amendments to clause 4. Amendment 
No. 39 to schedule 3 sets out the detailed procedure 
applicable to action plans.
<P>
It may be helpful if I outline the key elements of our 
proposals, as they make fundamental changes to the 
process of issuing and enforcing the requirements in a 
non-discrimination notice. We developed our proposals 
with a view to addressing the shortcomings that the Equal 
Opportunities Commission and the Commission for 
Racial Equality have identified in the existing process. In 
short, they found that although, under the existing process, 
one has to stop discrimination, nothing is said about what 
one can do to deal with it. In the amendments, we are 
attempting to pinpoint what is wrong and how it can be 
put right. That will require an action plan, which will need 
to be vetted. If the action plan is not agreed to, or is not 
implemented or adhered to, the matter should then be 
taken through the courts. We are suggesting an alternative 
and more effective way of putting it right than that 
suggested by the EOC and the CRE. I shall expand on 
that if the Committee wishes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke </B>(Coatbridge and Chryston): I accept 
immediately my hon. Friend's offer to expand on her 
proposals. The EOC and the CRE have tremendous 
experience. What advice have those commissions given 
her?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Their advice was that we should strengthen 
the process for dealing with non-discrimination notices. 
We should not simply say that discrimination must cease; 
we should lay out a procedure for the organisation to 
follow that will ensure that it does cease. There is a slight 
difference between what we propose and what the CRE 
and EOC said in their representations and submissions, 
and I shall deal with that when we come to it.



<P>
We have differed a little from the EOC and the CRE in 
that we have taken on board the concerns expressed by 
the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of 
Directors. The CRE and the EOC wanted us to give the 
Disability Rights Commission the power to prescribe, in 
detail, the plan of action that an organisation would need 
to pursue in order to deal with the discrimination of which 
it had been found guilty. It is our view that the plan of 
action should be devised by that organisation, so that it 
owns it. However, I shall describe the processes by which 
the commission can vet the plan and ensure that it tackles 
the discrimination.
<P>
I turn to the key elements of our proposals. The 
amendments would give the commission the power to 
identify in a non-discrimination notice the policies, 
practices, procedures and other arrangements that it 
believes have led to or contributed to unlawful acts being 
committed, and to recommend what changes need to be 
made to address those unlawful acts. It will also be able 
to set the time scale for making the changes, which is 
important. The commission will also be able to require an 
organisation to produce an action plan within a prescribed 
time. That action plan will need to address the unlawful 
acts that have been or are being committed again, within 
a reasonable time. There are time limits throughout the 
process. The action plan would be legally binding once 
final and the commission would be able to enforce its 
implementation through the courts.
<P>
I now come to the matter raised by my right hon. Friend 
the Member for Coatbridge and Chryston (Mr. Clarke). It 
will be up to the organisation to produce the action plan, 
although it will have to take account of the commission's 
recommendations. We believe that that is the right 
approach. If an organisation has to change the way in which 
it operates, and to start acting in a non-discriminatory 
manner, we believe that it must have ownership of the 
action plan. However, we believe that we have built 
sufficient opportunities into the process for the commission 
to comment on a daft action plan and to make further 
recommendations if the commission thought it appropriate. 
Ultimately, the commission would be able to challenge 
whether an action plan would adequately address the 
unlawful acts identified in the non-discrimination notice 
through the courts.
<P>
As I said, I believe that the amendments strike the 
appropriate balance between giving an organisation 
ownership of its plans, and strengthening the 
commission's powers as requested in comments by the 
EOC and the CRE, and in some amendments discussed in 
another place to ensure that effective changes are made 
by an organisation.
<P>
I shall assist the Committee by quickly giving details 
of the amendments. Under proposed paragraph 12B(2) of 
schedule 3, if an organisation fails to produce an action 
plan required under a non-discrimination notice, the 
commission will be able to apply to a county court or 
sheriff for an order directing the organisation to do so.



<P>
Under proposed paragraph 12D(1) of schedule 3, if an 
organisation produces an action plan that the commission 
considers inadequate, and if the commission fails in its 
negotiation attempts to make the plan adequate, it will be 
able to apply to a county court or sheriff for an order 
requiring the organisation to revise its plan.
<P>
In both cases, the commission will be able under 
paragraph 15 of schedule 3 to enforce any orders issued 
to produce or revise an action plan through the courts. An 
organisation that fails to comply will be liable to a fine. 
The Commission will be able to apply for repeated orders 
to enforce compliance if the organisation continues to fail 
to comply. Each order could be followed by a fine.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Angela Browning (Tiverton and Honiton):</B> What 
does the Minister mean by "organisation"	? At the 
beginning of her remarks, she spoke about the CBI, which 
I tend to think of in terms of companies and employers. 
Does "organisation"	 cover the whole spectrum of 
voluntary organisations and free associations? Is its scope 
across the range?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I asked the same question when I briefed 
myself for the Committee, and I am assured that the term 
"organisation"	 is one that we appropriately use in 
legislative processes to cover the entire range of 
individuals, companies and incorporated or unincorporated 
organisations that we want to bring under the coverage of 
disability discrimination legislation.
<P>
We believe that we have given the commission 
sufficient powers to deal with organisations that are 
especially recalcitrant in taking action to deal with 
unlawful acts that they have committed. We do not 
believe that that will lead to many cases ending up in 
court. In the majority of cases, we expect the commission 
and the organisation concerned to agree the contents of 
an action plan without the need to resort to court action. 
The process that we have provided will allow the 
commission to make recommendations about what might 
be included in an action plan. It will also allow the 
commission to comment on the action plan in draft and 
allow an organisation to respond to that with a revised 
action plan. Those provisions are set out in proposed 
paragraph 12C of schedule 3, and I believe that they give 
appropriate opportunities to ensure that satisfactory action 
plans are produced and that the minimum number of cases 
end up in court.
<P>
Our amendments provide that the commission will be 
able to monitor the implementation of action plans for up 
to five years after they have become final. If the 
commission considers during that time that an 
organisation has failed to comply with action specified in 
the plan, it can apply to a county court or sheriff for an 
order requiring compliance. Proposed paragraph 12H of 
schedule 3 will allow the commission to obtain 
information so that it can verify whether an organisation 
has taken the action specified in the plan.
<P>
We recognise that it is important to specify reasonable 
time limits applying to the stages of the production and 
finalisation of an action plan. I feel particularly strongly 
abut that issue. Those who know about the process for 
dealing with racial discrimination in the armed forces will 
know that it took about seven years for an agreement to 
be reached between the armed forces and the CRE on 
discrimination. Similarly, the CRE has been investigating 
discrimination in the London borough of Hackney for 
many, many years; because the time limits have not been 
properly set, it is difficult to reach a conclusion. That is 
why we have made provision for the regulations to specify 
time limits. Regulations are the best way of dealing with 
the issue, enabling us to have appropriate consultation 
beforehand.



<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Hon. Members may ask why we have included so much 
detail in the Bill. The requirement set down in our 
amendments to produce an action plan is completely new; 
it is the first time that enforceable action plans have been 
set down in British legislation. It is therefore important to 
set out clearly in the Bill a solid framework of how the 
process is intended to work. We must also recognise that, 
in the light of the practical experience of operating the 
novel mechanism, lessons are bound to be learned and the 
arrangements may need to be modified. That is why we 
provide regulation-making powers in schedule 3(18) that 
would allow such changes to be made.
<P>
I ask the Committee to accept our amendments. 
Opposition amendments have aims that are similar but, in 
simply defining the scope of non-discrimination notices, 
are too narrow as are the examples in the clause of what 
may be authorised in regulation, which do not offer a 
coherent, clear process. That is why I hope that 
Opposition Members will withdraw their amendments.
<P>
The hon. Members for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and for 
Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) seek in 
amendments Nos. 14 and 15 to specify that the 
commission could issue a non-discrimination notice to a 
corporate body, but that is unnecessary. Schedule 1 of the 
Interpretation Act 1978 provides that "person"	 includes a 
body of persons, corporated or unincorporated and section 
5 of that Act provides for the definition to apply to any 
Act, unless otherwise stated. The Bill does not state 
otherwise, so the term applies.
<P>
If the amendments were accepted, they would prevent 
a non-discrimination notice from being issued to 
unincorporated bodies, such as associations a category 
that covers partnerships, such as firms of solicitors or 
doctors and some friendly societies, which could include 
big insurance providers such as Manchester Unity and 
charities. I must, therefore, ask that the amendments be 
withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May (Maidenhead):</B> I shall first respond 
briefly to the Minister's points on amendments Nos. 14 
and 15 and then move to the bulk of the amendments, 
which deal with other matters.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are probing to ascertain 
the definition of "person"	 and to ensure that it is not 
limited to an individual. We are particularly concerned to 
ensure that where a non-discrimination notice is issued to 
an organisation such as a company, it is not issued to a 
named person in that company, but to the body as a 
whole. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and 
Honiton asked about the meaning of "organisation"	. It 
was interesting that, in her remarks about the action plan, 
the Minister referred to "organisation"	, a term that is 
perhaps more helpful to the layman as it has a rather wider 
coverage than the term "person"	 as used in a legal context. 
The Minister has put on record that the meaning of 
"person"	 in the Bill covers a wide range of organisations, 
individuals, corporate bodies and unincorporated bodies, 
and we shall therefore not press amendments Nos. 14 
and 15.
<P>
I turn now to amendments Nos. 4 and 5 and the raft of 
Government amendments that the Minister has just 
introduced. I welcome the fact that the Government have 
responded to the genuine anxieties that my noble Friend 
Baroness Blatch and Lord Ashley of Stoke expressed in 
the debate on the matter in another place. The Bill as 
originally drafted merely provided for the Secretary of 
State to make regulations in which he could specify what 
could be included in the non-discrimination notice. It is 
important to make it clear in the Bill what can be included 
in the non-discrimination notice, and that it can include 
requirements on the body to which it is issued to take 
certain action in a prescribed timetable.



<P>
The Minister suggested that amendments Nos. 4 and 5 
did not go far enough and were rather more simple than 
the Government's amendments. However, I thought that 
the beauty of them was their simplicity. Not having the 
advantage of a raft of legal advisers and others to advise 
on the matter, we were bound to devise a simple approach 
that would provide that a non-discrimination notice could 
specify certain matters relating to action to be taken by 
the body in receipt of such a notice. However, the 
Minister's set of complicated amendments goes much 
further. It is important to specify a process for the action 
plan, and it should be clear to everyone involved what the 
action plan may include and what action may be taken if 
it is not acted on. The timetabling is also important. It is 
not a question simply of telling a body what it must do, 
but of ensuring that it is done in a reasonable time frame 
to ensure that the identified discrimination comes to an 
end.
<P>
I should like to make one detailed comment about the 
action plans, to which I hope the Minister will respond. 
I tried to follow her explanation of the process involved, 
and, as I understand it, the commission will require the 
body involved to provide an action plan on how to solve 
the problem and on the procedures required to stop the 
discriminatory practices. I agree that it is important for 
the body to be involved in that process, working in 
partnership. The briefing notes that the CBI provided for 
members of the Committee conclude:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A partnership approach between the Disability Rights 
Commission and business will help to ensure that disabled people 
and disability are integral to good management and not perceived 
as, or become, a burden on competitiveness."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is one of the thrusts that we all hope will pervade 
the operations of the Disability Rights Commission. We 
want it to work in partnership with business to ensure that 
discrimination practices stop and that good thinking about 
how to provide for disabled people will become an 
integral part of good business management. Business 
involvement is important.
<P>
The body involved will devise the action plan and 
propose it to the commission, which, I understand, may 
propose revisions to it. However, what will happen if the 
business does not return with a revised action plan 
following the commission's comments? Proposed new 
paragraph 12C(4) of schedule 3, in Government 
amendment No. 39, provides that if the person involved
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"does not serve a revised action plan in response to a noticethe 
action plan previously served on the Commission shall become final 
at the end of the prescribed period".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Provision is subsequently made for the commission to 
take action against the body involved for not having 
proposed a revised action plan. However, if something 
slips through the net, the action plan to which the body 
will work will be that initially served on and declared 
inadequate by the commission.
<P>
Have I misread the Government amendment? Or is it 
expected that such circumstances will never arise because 
the commission can always take action against the body 
for not having proposed a revised action plan? However, 
should something slip through the net, that may result in 
an inadequate action plan being placed on the books. Will 
the Minister respond to that?
<P>
I am grateful to the Government for accepting the 
concerns expressed by disability organisations and by those 
participating in the debate in another place. The 
Government amendments are a response to those concerns. 
Therefore, although my hon. Friend the Member for 
Tiverton and Honiton and I have tabled amendments that 
have a welcome simplicity, I shall withdraw those 
amendments when it is appropriate to do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tom Clarke:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister 
explained with great clarity precisely what the 
Government are trying to achieve in the Bill and the 
Government amendments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead referred to 
Government amendment No. 39 which, in many ways, 
goes to the heart of the Government's approach. The 
commission will not be there to bully people, but to 
persuade them. The commission itself would regard 
having to go to court as a failure, if, indeed, that 
eventuality arose.
<P>
The exercise in partnership is a substantial part of the 
Government's disability policy and has the support of the 
Employers Forum on Disability. I would love to say that 
that exercise is new. However, as the Minister knows, it 
is based on what has been happening for many years in 
the United States, where few cases ever result in the 
undesirable outcome of going to court. Nevertheless, the 
Government are right to stand by their amendment's 
provision to deter recalcitrant, unco-operative employers. 
Government amendment No. 39 is a deterrent, but I do 
not envisage that it will be put to great use.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I shall deal with the matters that have 
been raised.
<P>
I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed by my 
right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and 
Chryston and the hon. Member for Maidenhead. The DRC 
should not be seen as a confrontational body working 
against businesses, suppliers of goods and services and 
organisations advising employers. We will achieve 
effective civil rights for disabled people only if we work 
in partnership with those groups. Otherwise, the 
temptation will be for them to stick to the letter, not the 
spirit, of the law. The spirit is important if we are to 
challenge and change the culture; it underpins everything 
that we do.
<P>
I would say to my right hon. Friend that, in undertaking 
such action, we have learned something from the 
American disability discrimination legislation, the 
Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal 
Opportunities Commission.



<P>
I would love things to be simple; it is always better 
if they are. However, sometimes simple things may lack 
completeness, and that may cause problems. We are 
therefore introducing a structured provision that 
establishes with clarity how we intend to proceed with 
non-discrimination notices. When we attempt to achieve 
completeness, inevitably we get complexity.
<P>
On the specific issue raised by the hon. Member for 
Maidenhead, if an organisation does not submit a revised 
action plan following comments from the commission, the 
latter has a choice. It can accept the original action plan, 
which may, by and large, deal with most of the unlawful 
acts identified in the notice, or, if it considers that there 
are more serious gaps in the action plan, it can go back 
to the court for an order to determine whether the action 
is necessary. If the court declares the plan inadequate, it 
can direct a company to make changes. Setting that out
will, I hope, deal with the circumstance that the hon. Lady 
identified. I stress once more that the reason that we have 
taken a regulation-making power in the amendments is 
that if, in practice, events do not work out as we hope, we 
shall be able to return to these matters.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth </B>(Belfast, South): I appreciate the 
Minister's response. Will she say whether regulations will 
be drafted in the spirit of the BiIl and provide guidance 
for employers? I have in mind an incident in a health 
service department. A person with a disability told his 
superior about it because he had been advised that he 
should not be placed in the line of a draught, but his 
superior actually placed him in such a position. In 
education, for example, I wonder whether guidance could 
be given on the provision of adequate information 
technology so that a student in mainstream education who 
has problems with writing, or even posture when sitting, 
could be helped. Education providers might be advised to 
take note of a particular need and provide the necessary 
help.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> That is the difficult balance that we tried 
to achieve when drafting the proposals. I remind the hon. 
Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) that 
education is not at present covered by the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995, so his education example was 
not appropriate, although the health service example 
might be.
<P>
We have said that the commission will issue a notice 
that will tell an organisation what changes it must make 
in its policies and procedures to prevent unlawful acts, but 
we have stopped short of saying that guidance will be 
available. We have also said in the procedure that there 
could be negotiation between the commission and an 
organisation prior to the submitting of the plan, and that 
comments could be added to the organisation's plan. In 
practice, that negotiation will, I believe, take place. We 
also stopped short of saying precisely what steps an 
organisation should take to deal with discrimination. The 
reason that I stress this again is that the Government 
believe that the best way of ensuring that discrimination 
does not recur is for an organisation to formulate policies 
and procedures over which it feels it has ownership. That 
was the advice submitted by businesses, the CBI and the 
IOD which we accepted. May I also point out that there 
are perhaps many more ways of dealing with disability 
discrimination than there are of dealing with racial or sex 
discrimination. The commission's imposition of a 
particular way of dealing with it might not be in the best 
interests of the person who has suffered discrimination. 
With that explanation, I hope that members of the 
Committee will accept our amendments.



<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> I accept the Minister's 
explanation. However, mention of a gap suggests that 
there is a problem that will have to be addressed sooner 
or later. I was brought up under the old school of thought 
that said, "Nearly never did anything."	 It is important to 
bear that in mind.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 23 to 25.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Again, these amendments deal with written 
agreements. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23, taken together, 
will allow the Disability Rights Commission and an 
organisation to enter into a written agreement earlier than 
originally provided for. They clarify the revocation, 
termination or varying of agreements, and define the 
scope of written agreements in the Bill.
<P>
I am proud that our proposals represent another 
innovation in British legislation; it is the first time that 
enforceable written agreements will be part of a Bill. 
I strongly support that process because a written 
agreement between an organisation and the commission 
will be far less confrontational than enforcing 
non-discrimination notices. It will be much more effective 
in encouraging employers and service providers to tackle 
discrimination positively. It will enable us to move much 
more swiftly towards eliminating the discrimination that 
is bound to exist in an organisation. I also hope that it will 
limit the need to conduct lengthy and expensive formal 
investigations. We have learned that lesson from the CRE 
and the EOC.
<P>
The proposal will provide employers and service 
providers who accept that an unlawful act has been 
committed with an opportunity to agree with the 
commission the steps that need to be taken to put matters 
right. Given those provisos, the commission will be able 
to enforce the written agreements. It is important that the 
arrangements are seen as a better option for those who 
discriminate, not as a soft option.
<P>
I apologise to members of the Committee that the 
amendments have been tabled rather late. Therefore, I 
shall deal with them in detail. Under amendment No. 22, 
we shall set out the conditions under which the 
commission can enter into a written agreement in place 
of a formal investigation. To be consistent with clause 
3(2) on formal investigations the amendment specifies 
that, if the investigation had been ordered by the Secretary 
of State, he or she must give permission for such an 
agreement to be entered into.
<P>
Amendment No. 22 deals with the stages at which it 
will be possible for the commission to enter into a written 
agreement with an organisation. Under clause 5(1), as 
drafted, the commission will have the power to enter into 
a written agreement only after a decision has been taken 
to embark on a formal investigation. However, in practice 
we know that discussions take place between employers 
and service providers before any decision is taken to begin 
a formal investigation. That is the experience of the 
other commissions.
<P>
If the organisation facing an investigation is willing to 
enter into a binding written agreement at an early stage, 
it will enable the commission to proceed more quickly to 
a solution, and to provide benefits for those affected by 
active discrimination.


<P>
It would be artificial to require the Disability Rights 
Commission to decide to start a formal investigation 
before entering a written agreement, only to stop it 
immediately afterwards.
<P>
New subsections (1) to (4) will make it possible for the 
DRC to enter a written agreement, not only at a 
preliminary stage before deciding whether to mount a 
formal investigation, but at any stage up to the point at 
which the DRC issues a non-discrimination notice. That 
is both practical and desirable; it will give the commission 
and the organisation full opportunity to take advantage of 
the clear benefits of a written agreement.
<P>
Opposition amendments Nos. 6 and 7 would enable the 
DRC to enter into a written agreement before deciding or 
being directed to conduct a formal investigation. I hope 
that hon. Gentlemen agree that the Government 
amendment meets their purpose, so will not press their 
amendments.
<P>
Subsection (5) deals with the scope of written 
agreements, which will be enforceable; we should 
therefore be clear about their scope. In practice, they will 
be the same as the non-discrimination notice and the 
action plan. The agreement will apply to unlawful acts, 
which the DRC has reason to believe have been or are 
being committed, and changes to any practices, policies, 
procedures or other arrangements that have caused or 
contributed to the commission of unlawful acts or are 
liable to do so. Subsection (5)(a) makes it explicit that a 
written agreement may include terms providing for the 
termination of the agreement. That means that the DRC 
or the organisation can agree a range of alternatives, 
including starting or resuming a formal investigation if a 
written agreement breaks down.
<P>
The White Paper, which was subject to consultation 
before the Bill was introduced, proposed that written 
agreements should comprise two elements: compliance, 
which would be enforceable through the courts, and good 
practice, which would not. The regulation-making power 
in subsection (5)(b) will give the Secretary of State the 
power to provide for the good practice elements which 
will not be enforceable under subsection (6).
<P>
Finally, amendments Nos. 24 and 25 are technical 
amendments making the appropriate cross-references to 
changes to schedule 3.
<P>
Before leaving the topic, I want to clarify a matter that 
arose on Second Reading. The hon. Member for 
Winchester (Mr. Oaten), who is not present this morning, 
asked my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State if 
written agreements would be made public. My right hon. 
Friend replied that he expected them to be. I make it clear 
that there will be no requirement in statute for a public 
register of written agreements in the same way that there 
will be a public register of non-discrimination notices. 
That said, there is no requirement that such agreements 
should be private. However, in keeping with the nature of 
any agreement, it is sensible and practical for the parties 
themselves to decide whether all of an agreement, or any 
part of it, should be made public. One of the incentives to 
organisations to enter into written agreements on 
discrimination will be that they may do so privately and 
not in the public arena. If our interest is to ensure that 
there is no discrimination within organisations, and to 
ensure that more organisations enter into written 
agreements than go through the formal investigative 
process, we should put in place systems that encourage 
organisation to enter into written agreements.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> As with the previous amendments, the 
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for 
Tiverton and Honiton and I would achieve the same 
objective as the Government's amendments, although in 
a simpler, less complex form. Having said that, I am 
grateful to the Government for having listened to the 
debate in another place. The matter has concerned many 
disability organisations, but by building on the experience 
of the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal 
Opportunities Commission, it should be possible to enter 
into written agreements at an early stage. That is entirely 
sensible and meets the requirement that the disability 
rights commission should be a body of co-operation, not 
confrontation. It is important for it to be able to talk to 
individuals, representatives of corporate or unincorporated 
bodies, or whomever, as early as possible. Early 
discussions and agreements would be in the interests of 
ensuring that discrimination stops as quickly as possible.



<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I heard what the Minister said about whether the written 
agreements should be made public, and I am grateful for 
the clarification. Although I did not intervene at the time, 
I was a little concerned about the Secretary of State's 
assumption on Second Reading that all the written 
agreements would, by definition, be made public. It is 
important for the matter to be discussed between the 
parties, but we need to be careful about the definition of 
"publicly available"	 for published written agreements. 
One can imagine a company that has entered into an 
agreement to change certain practices having to 
promulgate that among its staff by notices placed on 
boards or sent to staff. In a sense, it is a public agreement, 
but it has to be published to ensure that everyone involved 
in the process is informed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke:</B> I am following the hon. Lady's 
arguments and agree with them. Will she consider the 
example of an agreement that is reached between two 
parties, including the employer, of course, which both 
parties consider best practice? If it is agreed by both sides, 
it will be to nobody's disadvantage for it to be published. 
Does she agree that such a voluntary agreement is very 
different from the naming and shaming approach? It is 
not the same thing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Indeed, That is why I recognised the 
Minister's argument that when a written agreement is 
entered into between the commission and another party, 
whoever that party may be, they can decide during the 
process of discussions whether it should be made public. 
The agreement may be about best practice, so it might be 
beneficial to other similar organisations if the agreement 
and the action to be taken is made public. Other 
organisations that see such good practice might take a 
lesson from it and consider their own practice as a result. 
However, it is important that a requirement for an 
agreement to be made public is not written into the Bill. 
We are talking about discussion, co-operation and 
partnership between the bodies involved, so whether to 
make the agreement public would be a part of that 
partnership and co-operative discussion.
<P>
In the light of the Minister's comments, I shall not press 
my amendments.

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Commission shall, in the case of notices which impose 
a requirement to propose and finalise an action plan, note on the

<P>

shall ensure that where action required in a non-discrimination 
notice has been taken the reference to that notice shall be removed 
from the register.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The amendment fulfils another 
commitment that we made in the other place to give 
further consideration to an amendment tabled by Baroness 
Blatch. We agreed to consider arranging for the removal 
of a non-discrimination notice from the public register 
when the action required had been complied with. I see 
that Opposition Members have tabled an amendment that 
would achieve that. As Lord Hunt said, we were 
sympathetic to the idea behind the amendment that was 
tabled by Baroness Blatch, but it raised a number of 
practical difficulties and other issues.
<P>
Our amendment will require the commission to put a 
permanent note on the register when the requirement in a 
non-discrimination notice to produce and finalise an 
action plan has been met. I shall explain our reasons 
behind the amendment. First, we believe that it is 
important to maintain the historical accuracy of the 
record, so we do not favour removing names from the 
register. Secondly, it is virtually impossible to note when 
the primary requirement in a non-discrimination notice 
the requirement not to commit unlawful acts has been 
complied with; it is an on-going requirement.
<P>
I shall use the example given by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) on Second 
Reading. A non-discrimination notice may include a 
finding that a company has committed an unlawful act by 
not making a reasonable adjustment to provide a disabled 
toilet for a customer. The company would be required to 
stop committing that act. The action plan may state that 
the company should provide a disabled toilet by a certain 
date. A disabled toilet may be provided, but it may 
become disused or filled with furniture, as in the case 
referred to by my hon. Friend, and therefore be unusable. 
A disabled person may find that the toilet cannot be used. 
That would constitute an unlawful act of the same sort as 
that stated in the original non-discrimination notice, and 
the organisation would therefore be in contravention of it.
<P>
We believe that to try to note compliance with the 
prime requirement not to commit unlawful acts could lead 
to huge arguments, even litigation, about whether the 
register should be amended, because of the subjective 
nature of the decision. We propose a simpler and more 
objective test. I therefore ask the committee to agree to 
amendment No. 38.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> As the Minister said, the Government 
amendment and our amendment No. 9 both reflect the 
debate held in another place, and our concern, from the 
first draft of the Bill, about the public register of 
non-discrimination notices. The Government amendment 
is different from our amendment because, as the Minister 
pointed out, the Government did not feel able to move as 
far as proposed in the amendments tabled in the other 
place.
<P>
I shall set out the concern that underlies amendment 
No. 9 and put some questions to the Minister. The public 
register will note those companies that have conducted 
discriminatory practices; by definition, if they have not 
conducted discriminatory practices, they will not have 
non-discrimination notices issued against them. It will be 
a register of companies, bodies or organisations that have 
discriminated against disabled people, and against whom 
the commission has found it necessary to take action. The 
Minister has said that, even if those organisations do what 
is required by the commission, it will be permanently and 
publicly recorded that, at some stage, they indulged in 
discriminatory practices.



<P>
I heard what the Minister said about the difficulties of 
noting compliance it is an on-going issue. However, we 
want to ensure that, when the necessary changes have 
been made and it is clear that the organisation is not now 
indulging in discriminatory practices there should be some 
means of removing that permanent stain against the 
organisation's name.
<P>
The question that I want to put to the Minister is about 
possible mistakes in the public register for example, in 
the name of a company. Amendment No. 9 would require 
the commission to review the register regularly. We all 
know that errors can be made, for example in companies' 
personal credit records; a name or address may be entered 
wrongly. That can cause problems, because someone who 
consults the record may believe that a credit problem 
relates to someone to whom it does not relate. I believe 
that it is possible for mistakes of that sort to be made in 
placing the name of a company or organisation on the 
public record. We all know that some companies have 
similar names. A genuine error may be made and it might 
appear that a company has had a non-discrimination 
notice issued against it when that is not the case. The 
public record would then relate to the wrong company. Is 
a procedure intended that would allow a company to 
appeal when the fact that its name is incorrectly on the 
register is brought to its attention? Is the commission 
intended to review the register on a regular basis, perhaps 
annually, to ensure that entries list accurate information 
against an organisation's name?
<P>
It would be in the best interests of what we talked about 
in terms of co-operation, partnership and getting the right 
attitudes and environment in which the commission can 
operate, if the commission is not seen as indulging in what 
some might consider unfair practices. It must be seen to 
give credit where credit is due in the sense of marking 
where a company has taken action required of it and 
ensuring that there is a process through which mistakes 
can be rectified.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Anne Begg </B>(Aberdeen, South): As I was 
mentioned by the Minister, I thought that I could add 
some other examples from my life that would illustrate 
her point. I would love to think that human nature is such 
that once a company or organisation is found to be 
discriminatory, it will automatically put everything right, 
not only by the letter of the law but by its spirit. 
Unfortunately, I am cynical as a result of my experience. 
I have found too many disabled toilets down three steps 
or locked because young couples use them to canoodle in.



<P>
I shall give an example from last night that illustrates 
the point. I was invited to a reception at the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office to meet the American ambassador. 
Arrangements had been made so that I could gain access 
and a door was opened especially for me. Often disabled 
people have to go through back doors and as I travelled 
through the gunnels a Scottish word or under-passages 
of the FCO, I noticed a machine for carrying wheelchairs 
up and down steps and thought, "Wonderful! Anyone in 
a wheelchair will be able to gain access."	 I duly arrived 
to discover that the reception are was down eight steps, 
but I thought that there was no problem because of the 
machine. Unfortunately, the two people trained to us it 
had gone home and no one else would use it because the 
insurance would not cover that. Although the will and 
desire was there and although the FCO would have 
fulfilled the letter of the order, I was discriminated against 
and denied access.
<P>
The existence of disabled toilets or non-discriminatory 
mechanisms does not necessarily mean that discrimination 
will not happen. For that reason, it is important that once 
a company's name is on the register, it should remain 
there so that not only the letter of the law is complied 
with but the spirit.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we go any further, I hope that 
the hon. Lady will forgive me if I say that she could be a 
little less discriminatory in her use of lovely words such 
as "gunnels"	, so that the record of our proceedings is 
easier to take.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The debate has thrown up an issue 
that the Minister might expand on. It seems that there is 
a question mark about simply issuing a notice. Some take 
note of it and put in place action that can be relied on, 
while others take a more cavalier attitude, do what they 
are asked and then disregard its spirit. I wonder how the 
Minister views such cases.
<P>
As the Bill gives statutory powers to the commission, 
the commission will surely have the opportunity to 
exercise them. One assumes that in subsequent cases 
presumably in cases where there is a cavalier attitude 
there will be subsequent cases track record will be part 
of the submission by which companies and organisations 
will be judged.
<P>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead 
spoke to amendment No. 9, she made a good point about 
companies that, in the first instance, comply with not only 
practical requirements of the order but its whole spirit. It 
is a great shame that the Bill does not distinguish between 
those who take on board what they are required to do and 
carry it through, and cases such as that referred to by the 
hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, in which one would 
expect the commission to come down on the body and 
exercise its statutory power quite severely. Will not that 
power deal with companies that continue to flout the law 
and is that not reason enough for their names to appear 
several times on the public record?



<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I sympathise with the hon. Member for 
Aberdeen, South. I attended the reception last night. In a 
way, the hon. Lady may have benefited from what 
happened in that everyone was so embarrassed that she 
held court at the top of the steps. All the senior officials 
from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the 
American embassy paid her far more attention than I and 
other mere Back Benchers received all evening. We 
hardly saw any Americans because she was monopolising 
them. Last night was a case in point. I am sure that the 
installation of that non-operational wheelchair access lift 
was not the result of a non-discrimination order, but more 
a case of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wanting 
to be seen as being disabled-person friendly.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead said, 
there would be no incentive for a company that had 
received the black spot of a discrimination notice, to 
continue good practice. It might comply with merely the 
bare minimum required under the non-discrimination 
notice, because it knew that its name would always be on 
the blacklist.
<P>
Let us suppose that a person commits a traffic offence 
and gets points on his driving licence. Those points are 
expunged after three years without the person having to 
prove that he is a better driver or more roadworthy than 
he was when he committed the offence. If the stain against 
driving offenders can be removed, it is unfair that an 
organisation that, perhaps by default, was served a 
non-discrimination notice and took immediate measures 
to rectify the problem will have no incentive to be a better 
provider for disabled people.

<P>

<B>Miss Begg:</B> I accept that the points are expunged from 
the individual's driving licence, but the offence will 
always remain on the official record. We cannot change 
history. There is a difference between the official record 
and the driving licence, which can be presented without 
showing any points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I take that point, but the fact that I 
committed a traffic offence a few years ago would not be 
known from the document that is publicly available to 
anyone my driving licence.
<P>
I want a merit system to be in place for companies 
that have complied with the terms of a non-discrimination 
order, but which have also gone beyond that to advertise, 
their clean licence and work practices. Can the Minister 
envisage a system under which a company can redeem 
itself and show that it is an even better employer and has 
learnt its lesson, although it may not have meant to 
commit the offence in the first place? Otherwise, once the 
black spot is against an organisation, it may think, "What 
the hell; we are tainted for life. As long as we comply 
with the minimum requirements, why go any further?"	



<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): We may be in danger of 
doing what we do all too often in welfare reform 
legislation, which is to concentrate on one clause in 
isolation. I know that that is one of the functions of a 
Committee, but we need to bear in mind other clauses, in 
particular those that deal with the role of the DRC as a 
proponent of good practice. From my experience of 
working with people with hearing and visual impairments 
and of having written two books on good practice in that 
area for local authorities, I know that there is a great 
difference between good intentions and investment in 
workable systems induction loops, for example and 
the implementation of good practice.
<P>
All too often people with hearing aids turn up at a 
theatre knowing that it has an induction loop system, only 
to find that it has not been switched on. It is good practice 
to switch it on but now would not want to go through 
the process of issuing a non-discrimination notice simply 
because someone has not flicked a switch. On Second 
Reading, I gave the example of a loop system fitted in a 
room with low-energy light bulbs, which meant that, 
when the light bulbs were on, the system would not work 
because the technologies are incompatible. Again, it is a 
question of good practice; the organisation is aware of 
and has recognised a need but does not implement good 
practice simply because of ignorance or lack of practice 
or technological know-how.
<P>
In response to the points made by the hon. Member for 
East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton), we have 
schemes such as the two ticks scheme, the "positive about 
disability"	 imprimatur which can be given to organisations 
that demonstrate positive methods of responding to the 
needs of disabled people. There should be a way of 
disseminating good practice that is positive and 
user-friendly and of recognising good practice, even if only 
through public acknowledgement. Such measures are more 
significant and helpful than using a sledgehammer to crack 
a small nut by issuing a non-discrimination notice in a 
minor case in which the intention is good but the practice is 
wrong. I hope that the commission will use a light touch and 
will exercise the powers at its disposal only against 
organisations that are deliberately intransigent.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I have to admit that one of the first duties I 
performed as Minister with responsibility for disability 
issues was to go to the Foreign Office and award it the two 
ticks. I can therefore have conversations with my right hon. 
and hon. Friends at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
on the matter. In addition, I do not think as someone who 
occasionally gets points on her licence, because I seem to 
pass the cameras at the wrong time that the driving 
licence analogy is a good one. The only advantage of 
having points expunged is that one does not lose one's 
licence, but the points do not go off the record.
<P>
Throughout the Bill, there are enormous incentives to 
which my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak 
(Mr. Levitt) alluded not to get a non-discrimination 
notice. We hope that if all else works certainly the 
written agreements that we discussed under the last group 
of amendments very few non-discrimination notices will 
be issued. The fact that there is an incentive for a 
company not to appear on the register is precisely why 
we have focused on the agreements.
<P>
If a non-discrimination notice is issued, the end of the 
road has been reached and the discussions that would have 
taken place over a considerable period between the 
organisation and the commission on whether 
discrimination has occurred and whether the organisation 
is willing to change its policies, practices and procedures 
would have come to nothing. Therefore, it is appropriate 
to record non-discrimination notices on the register, both 
for the historical record and to ensure that discrimination 
does not recur in that organisation.
<P>
I had hoped that in the amendment we had met part of 
the concerns that were expressed in the other place by 
ensuring that the fact that a plan of action has been agreed 
will also be noted. That is, to some extent, an 
acknowledgement of the fact that the organisation has 
taken action to deal with the discrimination that took 
place.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead raised the issue of 
mistakes, which are a very different matter. I assume that 
the commission will have an informal mechanism by 
which it can constantly review its registers to ensure their 
accuracy. I have no doubt that if an organisation discovers 
that it has wrongly been put on the register, it will swiftly 
initiate judicial review proceedings. That will be an 
incentive for the commission to ensure the accuracy of 
the register.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The Minister refers to one mechanism by 
which a company could appeal against an erroneous entry 
in the register. However, the judicial review process is a 
heavy-handed mechanism to use in those circumstances. 
Will the Minister reconsider that matter, perhaps returning 
to it on Report, and include in the Bill the ability to use 
a lighter-touch appeal process, not the judicial review 
mechanism?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am always happy to consider matters 
again. To be honest, I think it would be terribly 
heavy-handed to include in the Bill something that I 
assume would be a common-sense practice for the 
commission. I shall consider the provision again if the 
hon. Lady wants me to, but in all honesty, I think her 
suggestion would be an over-the-top response to the 
problem. I would expect a proper organisation to ensure 
the accuracy of the records that it keeps.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for saying that 
she will consider my suggestion. We may want to return 
to the matter on Report, but I have taken on board the 
Minister's comments.

<P>
(a) a non-discrimination notice served on a person,
<P>
(b) a finding by a court or tribunal in proceedings under section

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a 
Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to 
discuss new clause 3 Application for restraining order 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. (1) If during the period of five years beginning on the date 
on which the following became final in the case of any person 
namely 
<P>
(a) a non-discrimination notice served on him;
<P>
(b) a finding by a court or tribunal under the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995
<P>
it appears to the Commission that unless restrained he is likely to 
do one or more acts contravening sections 4, 6 or 19 of the 1995 Act, 
the Commission may apply to the County Court for an injunction or 
to the sheriff court for an order, restraining him from doing so; and 
the court if satisfied that the application is well founded may grant 
the injunction or order on the terms applied or in more limited terms.
<P>
(2) In proceedings under this section the Commission shall not 
allege that the person to whom the proceedings relate has done an 
act which is within the jurisdiction of an industrial tribunal unless a 
finding by an industrial tribunal that he did that act has become 
final.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> New clause 1 deals with persistent 
discrimination. Its intention is to give the Commission 
power to take direct action when an organisation 
persistently discriminates. The hon. Member for Tiverton 
and Honiton alluded to that in the previous debate.
<P>
The provision will apply if an organisation has a 
non-discrimination notice served on it or has a tribunal or 
court judgment against it. When that is so, the commission 
can seek an injunction against the organisation if it 
believes that, without the injunction, the organisation will 
commit further unlawful acts.
<P>
The court or tribunal judgments that I have just 
mentioned relate to unlawful acts under parts I and II of 
the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The clause 
includes a regulation-making power to extend the scope 
of unlawful acts beyond that. That is consistent with other 
provisions in the Bill that provide for the range of 
unlawful acts to be extended.
<P>
We are not breaking new ground, as such powers 
already exist for the EOC and the CRE. Those bodies 
rarely use those powers, but find them helpful. The 
existence of similar powers in the new clause provides a 
powerful lever to ensure that organisations comply with 
non-discrimination notices.
<P>
The provision is aimed at persistent discriminators, who 
have already been through a fair and thorough legal 
process and have been judged to be in default of the law. 
The power to seek an injunction to prevent further 
unlawful acts therefore brings matters to the court's 
attention more quickly and is deemed appropriate in 
such circumstances.
<P>
The hon. Members for Maidenhead and for Tiverton 
and Honiton have tabled a new clause that is intended to 
cover the same ground. I hope that they will accept that 
new clause 1 goes further than their new clause 3. New 
clause 1 takes account of other provisions in the Bill that 
provide for the range of unlawful acts to be extended. 
Under such circumstances, I hope that the hon. Ladies 
will not press their new clause, and I ask the Committee 
to accept new clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> New clause 3 carries the heading, 
`Application for restraining order'. However, it is 
intended to deal with persistent discrimination, as the 
Minister said. New clause 1 also relates to that matter, 
which, along with the Minister's comments, shows that 
the Government have accepted the argument for a clause 
dealing with persistent discrimination. As the Minister 
said, one hopes that such a provision will not have to be 
used in many cases. Nevertheless, it is important that the 
commission should have such a power, in care 
circumstances arise in which its use is necessary. 
Therefore, I shall not pursue new clause 3 further.
<P>

<H4><center>New clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Complaint on behalf of a `person aggrieved'</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>. (1) The Commission may, in circumstances provided for in 
subsection (2), apply to an Employment Tribunal for leave to present 
a complaint on behalf of a "person aggrieved"	 that another person 
has done an unlawful act under Part II of the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995 within the jurisdiction of an employment 
tribunal.
<P>
(2) The Employment Tribunal may grant leave to proceed under 
subsection (1) where, because of 
<P>
(a) the special circumstances of the case; or
<P>
(b) the likely adverse effect of proceedings on the person 
aggrieved taking into account that person's disability
<P>
it appears to the Tribunal that it is in the interests of justice for the 
Commission to proceed on behalf of the person.
<P>
Provided that leave shall only be granted and the Commission 
may only continue with the proceedings with the consent of the 
person aggrieved and that consent may be withdrawn at any stage 
of the proceedings.
<P>
(3) If the Tribunal considers that the complaint is well founded 
they shall make a finding to that effect and if they think it just and 
equitable to do so may (as if the complaint had been presented by 
the person) make an order such as is referred to in section 8(2) of 
that Act and all references to the complainant for the purpose of that 
section shall mean the "person aggrieved"	.
<P>
(4) For the purpose of this section a "person aggrieved"	 is a 
person who alleges that he has been discriminated against within the 
terms of Part II of the 1995 Act.'. [Mrs. May.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a 
Second time.
<P>
New clause 2 aims to give the commission the power 
in certain limited circumstances to take action on behalf 
of an aggrieved person so that he does not have to take 
action himself. A rather broader amendment along those 
lines prompted considerable debate in another place. The 
new clause is designed to take account of that discussion 
and is the result of anxieties expressed by several 
disability organisations, notably RNID and MENCAP.
<P>
The aim of the new clause is to provide for 
circumstances in which someone who has experienced 
discrimination in employment it relates only to 
employment finds it especially difficult to be identified 
and to bring the case against his employer, perhaps 
because doing so would cause him difficulties in 
continuing that job or finding another job in that field. 
The fact that he does not feel able to be identified would 
otherwise deter him from taking action, so the 
discrimination would continue. In such circumstances, the 
commission should be able to take action on behalf of that 
aggrieved person.
<P>
The new clause is also designed to provide for 
circumstances in which a disabled person, such as 
someone who has learning disabilities, would find it 
difficult to proceed with the case himself. Although a 
guardian, advocate or friend could be appointed to act on 
his behalf, that might be inappropriate or difficult in 
certain, limited circumstances. It is designed to enable the 
commission to take action on behalf of an individual in 
those circumstances, too.



<P>
I would expect the powers to be used only in very 
limited circumstances. In dealing with discrimination 
against disabled people in employment, the commission 
should be able to step in and proceed with a case on behalf 
of someone who has experienced discrimination and for 
whom it would be especially difficult to proceed and be 
identified, or in the event of particular considerations 
relating to the nature of the person's disability. That 
power would work to the advantage of disabled people 
in such circumstances. I understand that the problem of 
identification has arisen, especially in sex discrimination 
cases, when people do not want to proceed, despite 
harassment and discrimination. We are all losers, because 
the company or employing body against which the person 
does not proceed with a case continues to discriminate, 
because nothing has been done to stop it.
<P>
I ask the Government seriously to consider providing 
that power so that in limited circumstances, in which a 
company or organisation would otherwise continue to 
discriminate because someone did not feel able to proceed 
with a case against it, the commission can step in and act 
on behalf of that person to ensure that the discriminatory 
practice is identified and stopped.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I have much sympathy with the motives 
that lie behind the new clause. We all recognise that 
disabled people are among the most vulnerable in our 
society, and should be protected from the full weight of 
legal proceedings when possible. The examples that the 
hon. Lady gave of the difficulties that someone with a 
learning disability or with mental health problems would 
face in pursuing their rights, or even in understanding 
them, are the sort of examples that I have in mind, and 
rightly reflect the Committee's anxieties.
<P>
The hon. Lady also referred to the existing procedures 
and we should not underplay them. The procedures help 
those who are most severely disabled, allowing them to 
have a guardian ad litem to look after their affairs, rather 
than personally taking part in a case. Again, I recognise 
that that does not cover every eventuality.
<P>
The new clause would create difficulties, which I shall 
explain to the Committee. It would not give vulnerable 
people the protection that we want them to have. It would 
not prevent a vulnerable person from having to appear in 
court as a witness, which is especially difficult for anyone 
taking an employer to court under disability discrimination 
legislation. Although the motives of the new clause may be 
right, it would not have the desired impact.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
There are several practical difficulties such as who has 
ownership or control of the case? Is it the commission? If 
the person involved does not actually take part, who 
decides to settle, and in whose interests is that decision 
taken? What would be the position if the commission 
wanted to abandon the action and the individual wanted 
to take new action in his or her own name? Would that 
be a case of double jeopardy for the party against whom 
action was taken? Those are not insurmountable 
problems, but they would need to be considered in detail.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I want to draw attention specifically 
to the category of people defined as having learning 
disabilities. When the task force, which we supported, was 
set up, my hon. Friends and I made strong representations 
to the then Minister that a person with learning disabilities 
should be a full member of the task force. The noble 
Lord Rix made a very strong case for that suggestion in 
another place. It is a typical example of the difficult issues 
that the commission will have to deal with.
<P>
The Minister, rightly, said earlier that it is difficult for 
the people involved in such cases to be self-advocates. 
How does she envisage the commission representing those 
people, because there will be many cases? The Minister 
may not accept out new clause, but in practice how else 
will people gain access to the commission's support, 
which they should rightly be able to call upon?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I accept the issues raised by the hon. 
Member for Tiverton and Honiton. Indeed, I spoke to the 
noble Lord Rix yesterday to ensure that the interests of 
those whom he represents through MENCAP will be 
properly dealt with. The short answer to the hon. Lady is 
the one that I gave earlier: that someone with learning 
disabilities could ensure that their rights were properly 
protected by the appointment of a guardian ad litem. 
I consistently make the point that once the DRC is up 
and running, there will be commissioners and a staff of 
about 150. That will be a much better basis on which to 
represent the broad spectrum of disabilities than the task 
force. I expect much better representation of the interests 
of disabled people through the commission members and 
the staff if we are successful in getting the Bill through 
Parliament.
<P>
Finally, on the detail of the new clause, the interests 
of justice would not be served if, as suggested by the 
hon. Member for Maidenhead, an individual retained his 
anonymity in a case of discrimination brought against a 
company or organisation. If an individual has suffered 
discrimination, he must, of course, give evidence 
personally of the source of that discrimination.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead mentioned sex and 
race discrimination. There are examples in legislation on 
both sex and race where a person would find it difficult 
to pursue individual rights, or where women who felt that 
they had been sexually harassed may think that the 
harassment would continue if they took action. With race 
discrimination, there may even be a language problem, 
and a person who wants to take action may feel that it 
would be better to be represented by an organisation. So, 
although I realise that Opposition Members have tried to 
limit the provision to disability, I remind them that there 
are implications for race and gender. The amendment 
must be considered in the context of further work on the 
issue of representative action, because if the Disability 
Rights Commission acted on a person's behalf, that would 
constitute representative action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): The 
Minister is setting out the practical difficulties, but she 
has the Committee's wide support in that we recognise 
that this is a serious problem. Can she undertake to ask 
the commission, soon after its establishment, to think 
about the issue and perhaps publish a report on its 
thinking, because the Committee is united in its view that 
the matter must be resolved?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the Minister replies, may I say 
that we are getting rather intimate? One of the hazards 
for female Members of Parliament, which is not always 
obvious, is that their usual moderation and charm mean 
that their voice becomes softer. May I encourage everyone 
to remember that this is a difficult Room and that a little 
more voice might help?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Hon. Friends who know me well will be 
amazed. I shall raise my voice. Lady Members are used 
to doing that. We often have to outshout the men.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I would not know about that.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I shall give the hon. Gentleman a further 
assurance. My noble right hon. and learned Friend the 
Lord Chancellor is looking into representative action as 
part of the next tranche of civil justice reforms, and I am 
advised that the ability of the DRC or any other body to 
undertake cases will form part of his considerations. 
Indeed, my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone wrote to 
the Lord Chancellor about the issues raised on this subject 
when the Bill was being debated in the other place.
<P>
Unfortunately, however, we are unable to take the 
matter forward unilaterally today. That is not to say that 
it will not come about: I hope that it, or something like it, 
will. Although I cannot support the new clause, I ask the 
hon. Lady to bear in mind the work that is being 
undertaken, and to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke:</B> I do not wish to spread alarm in the 
direction of my hon. Friend the Minister: of course I will 
support the Government. But the hon. Member for 
Tiverton and Honiton made a first-class point and I should 
like to push the boat out a little further in the same 
direction. The Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation 
and Representation) Act 1986 had at its very heart the 
right of people whose rights it embraced to be able to 
contribute. During my hon. Friend's discussions with 
Lord Rix, he must have made the point that Mencap itself, 
at the head of its decision-taking process, has for many 
years rightly allowed people with learning difficulties to 
be party to decision making and implementation, and to 
what are considered executive and administrative 
decisions. So it is not the first time that the issue has 
been raised.
<P>
I should tell my hon. Friend the Minister that the hon. 
Lady speaks for a large number of people. I know that my 
hon. Friend is confined to her brief and by the direction in 
which the Bill is expected to go, but for a long time in 
the United States there have been organisations, such as 
People First which the hon. Lady will know of, which 
consist mainly of people with learning difficulties who are 
perfectly capable of stating their strong views.
<P>
I accept that my hon. Friend cannot go further today 
and I support her in that, but the issue will not go away. 
People with learning difficulties represent a large 
proportion of the 8.5 million disabled people in Britain. 
They have already demonstrated that they are capable of 
discussing complex issues and reaching conclusions. 
I know that the Government want to introduce an 
inclusive society, and I am sure that my hon. Friend will 
have heard what Lord Rix said and what has been said 
this morning. I want to give my hon. Friend as much 
support as I can, but she knows that that issue will not go 
away nor should it.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I shall respond quickly. I take the issue 
seriously. Indeed, we must address it. There are two 
separate issues. First, new clause 2, on representative 
actions, is premature. I believe that we should await the 
outcome of the Lord Chancellor's deliberations on the 
matter.
<P>
Secondly, a related issue emerged during the debate 
the right of people with learning disabilities to represent 
themselves. My strong view is that the establishment of 
the DRC will strengthen their ability to do so a fact that 
was not covered in the proceedings of the task force. For 
example, the commission will have the power to arrange 
advocacy or support for anyone with a learning disability 
to ensure that that person can represent themselves in 
proceedings. That is one instance of what we hope will 
result from the establishment of the DRC. It will give 
further civil rights to a particular group of disabled 
people: those with learning disabilities.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I have listened carefully to the debate. 
Contributions from both sides of the Committee have 
made it clear that new clause 2 raises a matter that goes 
further than the terms of the new clause access to justice 
for disabled people.
<P>
I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the fact, 
but the Institute of Employment Studies at the university 
of Sussex did a survey of cases under the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995 during its first 19 months. It was 
found that one reason why so many cases were withdrawn 
was that disabled people found it difficult to gain access 
to justice because of the stress and difficulty of pursuing 
cases through the courts.
<P>
The Minister referred to the work being done by the 
Lord Chancellor on class actions. I am not sure that we 
are sanguine about the Lord Chancellor's approach to that 
matter for disabled people, because his proposals on legal 
aid will mean many disabled people having less access to 
legal aid than in the past.
<P>
New clause 2 addresses the wider issue of access to 
justice. I mentioned in my opening remarks, particularly 
with regard to employment tribunals, that because of the 
nature of their case or the nature of their disability, some 
disabled people would benefit from the commission 
taking their cases forward on their behalf, so that they did 
not suffer the stress of having to do it themselves. I accept 
the point about guardians ad litem I referred to it 
myself or advocates who can be appointed for people 
with learning disabilities or mental health problems, but 
in some circumstances that alone may not resolve the 
problems. It is important that the commission be given 
the power in new clause 2, limited though it is, in relation 
to actions and employment. I therefore wish to press the 
new clause to a vote.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a 
Second time.
<P>
New clause 4 deals with circumstances in which a 
discriminatory practice is taking place although no person 
is being discriminated against at a given time, and action 
can be brought under disability discrimination legislation. 
It would give the commission power to bring an action 
against an organisation that contravened the Bill, when 
enacted, however contravention occurred. A company 
might, for example, operate a blanket policy of not 
employing certain groups of disabled people perhaps 
those with hearing impairment or with a history of mental 
illness but at the time the practice came to light no 
individual had just been refused employment on account 
of that policy. No named individual would be taking the 
action, but it would have come to light that the company 
operated that discriminatory practice.
<P>
The new clause would enable the commission to bring 
proceedings against an organisation or person operating 
such practices. It is a supplement to the remedies available 
in the Bill, and I understand that such a measure is 
available to the Equal Opportunities Commission and the 
Commission for Racial Equality. It would put a useful 
power on the statute book, and, given that it is within the 
remit of those organisations, it seems appropriate to add 
it to the remit of the Disability Rights Commission 
because there might be circumstances in which it would 
benefit disabled people even if no individual wished to 
take action.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I urge members of the Committee not to 
support new clause 4. Indeed, I hope that the hon. 
Member for Maidenhead will withdraw it. The proposal is 
unnecessary, because the formal investigation procedures 
cover the ground to which the hon. Lady referred. 
Practices that have contributed to unlawful discriminatory 
acts are one aspect of the formal investigation that can be 
dealt with through non-discrimination notices and action 
plans. In fairness to Opposition Members, I accept that 
they did not have the benefit of knowing precisely how 
the procedures on non-discrimination notices would work. 
However, given our discussions this morning, I would be 
surprised if they continued to press for the new clause.
<P>
The formal investigation procedures that we discussed 
under earlier amendments would strengthen the provisions 
that apply to the other equality commissions. The 
Disability Rights Commission will be able to investigate 
an organisation if it believes that it has committed or is 
committing an unlawful act. That could lead either to a 
written agreement or to a non-discrimination notice and 
an action plan. If an organisation that is subject to those 
arrangements refuses to deal with the practice that led to 
the unlawful act, statutory provisions under the Bill allow 
the commission to take out a court order, if necessary, to 
force the organisation to comply.



<P>
The hon. Lady argued that the other equality 
commissions have statutory provisions to allow them 
to issue a non-discrimination notice in respect of 
discriminatory practices and that there should be parity 
between the commissions. I am advised that the 
amendment would not achieve that parity. What is needed 
is a provision to cover circumstances in which there is no 
individual unlawful act under the DDA and the practice 
at issue may never lead to an individual unlawful act. That 
raises complex issues.
<P>
To begin with, the concept of unlawful discriminatory 
practices as I have described, which exist in sex and race 
discrimination legislation, do not exist under the 
Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The sex and race 
legislation makes unlawful a practice that indirectly 
discriminates so that no individual is ever directly 
discriminated against. The matter is more complicated in 
the context of disability. How does one know whether the 
practice is discriminatory without having an individual 
who has been discriminated against?
<P>
The concept of indirect discrimination works with sex 
and race because it is possible to identify practices that 
are, of themselves, detrimental either to men or women as 
a homogenous group for example, a height requirement 
for a job. Disabled people are not a homogenous group, 
so the concept of indirect discrimination does not work in 
the same way for disabled people. It is on those grounds 
that I think the new clause would be inappropriate.
<P>
The DDA is intended to allow employers and service 
providers to make individual reasonable adjustments to 
overcome barriers that disabled people face. Different 
employers and service providers might take entirely 
different approaches to how they tackle those barriers 
when faced with similar circumstances. All those 
approaches could be equally and perfectly acceptable. It 
is extremely hard to pin down the many practices that 
could legitimately be described as discriminatory without 
someone having suffered discrimination.
<P>
Moreover, simply because disabled people are not a 
homogenous group, their needs are varied. It is unlikely 
that an employer or service provider could adopt practices 
that cover every conceivable disability at all times. 
Having said that, of course we want to encourage 
employers and service providers to take a broader view 
than simply addressing disability issues when they arise. 
From October this year, and from 2004, we are bringing 
in the later rights under part III of the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995. We want service providers to 
think carefully about access, not just on the day that it 
becomes an issue, but to anticipate it reasonably in 
advance. That does not mean that we can expect every 
employer or supplier of goods and services to deal with 
any circumstance before it arises. We have to be practical 
about that.



<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> I follow and accept the 
Under-Secretary's argument, but when she speaks about 
access, is it still persistent practice for architects and 
builders not to provide access for disabled people? The 
1995 Act, which has been around for a long time, should 
be implemented. People should not be allowed to make 
excuses that the topography, or whatever, is not suitable.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I agree entirely with the sentiments 
expressed by the hon. Member for Belfast, South. I draw 
his attention to two points. First, we have revised part M 
of the building regulations as from October last year, 
which will ensure that all new buildings will be accessible 
to people with disabilities. That is a huge step in the right 
direction, and will benefit up to 10 million people.
<P>
Secondly, we are implementing part III of the DDA, 
which refers to the supply of goods and services. 
Although we have to give people time to make the 
necessary adjustments to their premises by 2004, when 
that final part comes into force, I hope that disabled 
people will see a massive improvement in their access to 
goods and services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Oaten </B>(Winchester): On that point, the 
Minister will be aware that some builders have been 
submitting planning applications in advance to avoid 
complying with the revised regulations. That raises an 
interesting point. They may not have attacked a disabled 
person directly, but their intention is clearly anti the 
disabled. They are trying to avoid legislation that will be 
enforceable in the future. How will they fall under the 
commission's powers?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The hon. Member for Winchester will 
know that the people who would do that are incredibly 
short sighted, because they will have to comply with the 
provisions of the legislation referring to access of goods 
and services by 2004. By devious means, they may avoid 
the spirit of the part M building regulations, but only in 
the short term.
<P>
I have discussed these matters with my hon. Friends 
in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the 
Regions and we are planning a review of the part M 
building regulations probably in 2001 to see whether 
they need to be strengthened. We need to know what 
further steps should be taken to ensure that disabled 
people have proper access to new buildings and to 
existing buildings that are being converted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> It may be helpful to my hon. Friend the 
Minister if I were to explain why what the hon. 
Member for Winchester described would not happen. 
Before the part M building regulations were revised in 
October, they applied to access for disabled people to 
new public buildings, so protection already existed. Last 
October, we extended the provision, principally to 
residential accommodation, but we also did some fine 
tuning in places where part M of the regulations was 
missing out.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am aware of the time, Mrs. Dunwoody, 
so I shall conclude my remarks. I hope that I have 
demonstrated the difficulty in this area. The Government 
recognise that there are issues to be addressed, and I 
assure the Committee that the disability rights task force 
is considering them. I would genuinely welcome any ideas 
that hon. Members might have to tackle these difficult 
issues.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the Committee that we 
have provided elsewhere in the Bill the mechanisms to 
deal with practices, policies, procedures and other 
arrangements that contribute to or result in discrimination. 
On that basis, I believe that the new clause is unnecessary. 
However, if Opposition Members are seeking to define a 
new category of discrimination, their new clause, as 
framed, is unworkable. I hope that they will agree to 
withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Without having the panoply of advice at 
the Minister's disposal. I cannot claim to come up with 
especially legalistically correct amendments and new 
clauses, although I make every effort to do so when 
drafting them. I accept that there may be flaws in how the 
new clause is drafted.
<P>
I have listened to the Minister carefully, and find some 
difficulty with some of her arguments about the 
difficulties of identifying cases. I am not sure that she 
dealt with my example or with the anxiety about a 
company or organisation that operates a discriminatory 
practice which results in no particular individual at any 
point in time experiencing discrimination but a general 
discriminatory effect, as in the example that the hon. 
Member for Winchester gave.
<P>
On the basis of the Minister's arguments, I shall 
consider the new clause, which we shall not press to a 
vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a 
Second time.
<P>
The new clause relates to a matter which has long been 
debated in any discussion of the responsibilities of the 
Disability Rights Commission and which was aired in 
an amendment tabled in another place: the DRC's 
relationship with and responsibilities under the Human 
Rights Act 1998. The new clause would provide that the 
DRC monitors the Human Rights Act in so far as it 
pertains to disabled people, and makes proposals and 
gives advice to Ministers about the operation of that Act.
<P>
The new clause is partly a probing amendment. It is 
important that the Government again be asked to describe 
their perception of the relationship of the DRC to the 
operation of the Human Rights Act. It has long been an 
anxiety of mine, which I have aired in several debates on 
such matters, that the Government have not fully 
confronted the implications of the application of the 
Human Rights Act for disabled people. We could all cite 
cases of people being denied access to drugs that would 
help them. Such cases may be covered by the Human 
Rights Act. I am not entirely convinced that the 
Government have considered such cases and the full 
implications of that Act. I have tabled the new clause 
partly to probe the Government to ensure that they are 
clear about where the DRC's responsibilities will lie in 
relation to the operation of the Human Rights Act. I shall 
listen to the Minister's response carefully.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> As the hon. Lady said, I have talked to 
many disabled people over the past year and understand 
the importance that they attach to the Human Rights Act 
in pursuing their civil rights. I hope that I can convince 
her to withdraw the motion.
<P>
It is not necessary to include the provision in the Bill. 
It would restrict the DRC's flexibility in determining its 
own priority. The Bill has been drafted to give 
the commission wide-ranging powers: to advise the 
Government on any aspect of the law for any purpose 
in connection with its other functions which, naturally, 
includes the Human Rights Act.
<P>
We have previously placed on record but I am happy 
to do so again that, in principle, we do not oppose the 
DRC advising the Government on the Human Rights Act 
when it sees fit to do so. However, it is not right to make 
provision in the Bill for the DRC to have a specific duty 
to monitor that Act. That would place an emphasis on the 
Human Rights Act above all other legislation, which may 
in future be of equal or greater importance to disabled 
people. A duty to monitor all the rights in the Act would 
distract the DRC from its other primary functions.
<P>
As our debate has shown, the range of legislation on 
which the DRC might want to advise the Government is 
huge. Internationally, it might consider the treaty of 
Amsterdam and European directives. It will certainly want 
to consider building regulations. It might consider health 
and safety, access to justice and mental health legislation. 
Indeed, almost all legislation affects disabled people.
<P>
It would be inappropriate to require the commission to 
monitor all such legislation. We will give the commission 
powers to do that, but I firmly believe that its duty to keep 
legislation under review should be confined to the Bill 
and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. If we were 
to accept the new clause, we should be determining the 
commission's priorities and restricting its freedom to do 
so.
<P>
Before Christmas, the President of the Council and 
Leader of the House of Commons, my right hon. Friend 
the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), announced 
that a joint parliamentary committee on human rights 
would be set up with a range of functions relating to 
human rights. It is envisaged that those functions will 
include conducting an inquiry into whether a human rights 
commission is needed to monitor the workings of the 
Human Rights Act 1998. That committee will start its 
work later this year. It would be wrong to pre-empt the 
outcome of its deliberations and commit the commission 
to a specific duty that may be inappropriate given the 
workings of that committee.
<P>
As I have said, I understand the significance to disabled 
people of the Human Rights Act 1998. The commission 
will be independent. We shall give it significant powers 
in relation to all legislation, including the 1998 Act. The 
new clause would restrict the commission's ability to 
choose its priorities, but add nothing to its powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Yesterday, expert Treasury lawyers 
told the Joint Committee on the Financial Services and 
Markets Bill about the workings of the European 
convention. They said that the convention was constantly 
evolving because of case law and that any judgment made 
under it might not be watertight. Therefore, how can she 
put her imprint on the front of the Bill, stating that it is 
compatible with the convention rights, while specifically 
denying the commission the ability to advise on whether it 
is out of line with the latest interpretation of the European 
convention on human rights?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am sorry if there is some confusion. I am 
not denying the commission the power to ensure that any 
part of Government or any organisation does not 
contravene the Human Rights Act 1998. The commission 
will have such a power. We are debating whether that 
power should be converted into a duty.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> I have opposed the Bill in the 
sense that it will not extend to Northern Ireland. I believe 
that the people of Northern Ireland deserve the same 
rights as those of Great Britain. Having said that, I remind 
the Minister that I understand, from an answer given to 
me earlier, that Northern Ireland will have a broadly based 
commission covering human rights, equal opportunities, 
disability and religious and sex discrimination. Therefore, 
there is at least a case for bringing all that together in 
Great Britain and allowing the Disability Rights 
Commission to consider the human rights of people with 
disabilities.
<P>
The Minister has said that the commission will cover 
all the partners and have a monitoring role, but she forgot 
to mention unless I misheard her I have a hearing 
impediment that it would not cover education. 
Therefore, we have still a long way to go to grant full 
rights to people with disabilities. I believe that in many 
ways we must educate society as a whole. That will be 
one of the commission's roles.
<P>
We had a fascinating discussion about enacting 
legislation. I thought when reference was made to 
the Foreign Office that we were referring to the Italian 
dimension passing laws but not necessarily 
implementing them.
<P>
You will understand, Mrs. Dunwoody, that, as the son 
of a plumber, whenever I see the title "disabled toilets"	 
I wonder whether they are any use. Changing the title 
would at least be an admission that people with 
disabilities have the same needs as the rest of us and 
they certainly do not need disabled toilets. Throughout 
our debates, we have highlighted the fact that the human 
rights of people with disabilities are as important as the 
human rights of people without disabilities. By the way, 
Mrs. Dunwoody, If you can find a person without a 
disability, let me know.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be asking 
too much.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I listened carefully to what the Minister 
said in response to my opening speech. When Ministers 
say that the reason for not doing something is that 
it would restrict the commission's flexibility in 
determining its priorities, it sounds like the Government 
scraping the barrel to find a reason for being against 
new clause 5. Taking that statement to its logical 
conclusion, if nothing could be done that restricted the 
flexibility of the commission in determining its 
priorities, the Bill would simply set up a Disability 
Rights Commission that could do what it liked. We are 
not doing that. We are saying what we believe the 
commission should do and setting parameters and a 
framework within which it will operate.
<P>
The Minister referred to arrangements being made to 
allow Parliament to consider the operation of the Human 
Rights Act 1998. I remain of the view that, when the 
Government introduced the Human Rights Act, they did 
not fully consider the implications of that Act. 
Nevertheless, I understood the Minister to say in response 
to an intervention that the commission would have 
responsibility for aiding individuals in achieving their 
rights under the Human Rights Act. That issue has been 
raised in a number of debates on the responsibilities of 
the commission. I hope that putting it on record will be 
useful to those who were worried about that aspect of the 
commission's rights, duties and responsibilities. I beg to 
ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the 
Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I want briefly to thank you, 
Mrs. Dunwoody, for so ably chairing our Committee, and 
for keeping us on our toes and in voice. You tried to 
ensure that we did not stray too far from the matter at 
hand, even if it meant cutting short those hon. Members 
who wanted to express their delight at serving under your 
chairmanship. Conscious of your views, Mrs. Dunwoody, 
I shall be brief, but I know that you will not begrudge me 
a little time to thank all those involved in our proceedings.
<P>
I thank the Clerk. I thank the Hansard writers. I thank 
the police and other officials of the House. I thank all my 
right hon. and hon. Friends and all Opposition Members 
who have spoken in our debates. It has been a proud 
occasion for many of us, especially for my right hon. 
Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Chryston and my 
hon. Friends the Members for North-East Derbyshire 
(Mr. Barnes), for High Peak and for Aberdeen, South. 
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for 
Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) for performing so 
eloquently on his birthday and particularly for getting it 
on record. I am also grateful to Opposition Members, who 
have so graciously supported the aims of the Bill and who 
probed our intentions with their amendments, some of 
which have enabled us to reflect further.
<P>
I thank the hon. Members for Maidenhead, for Tiverton 
and Honiton, for Winchester and for Belfast, South. 
I assure them that, at the end of my first Committee in 
charge of a Bill, I feel well and truly probed.
<P>
Finally, I place on record my grateful thanks to the 
officials in my Department, who have been 
long-suffering, for the good work that they have 
undertaken to ensure that we can take a good Bill back to 
the House. I also thank my long-suffering private 
secretary. I look forward to debating the Bill on Report.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I, too, am grateful for the opportunity to 
thank all those, officials and others, who have supported 
us in Committee. It has been a constructive Committee. 
I am pleased that it has been placed on record that I 
probed the Minister, and I am sure that that will be taken 
in the spirit in which I believe it was intended.
<P>
The Bill is important. I hope that, in our detailed 
consideration, we have done the Bill justice and properly 
investigated the Government's position. I am grateful to 
all my hon. Friends. I hope that it was not a matter of 
sexual discrimination that certain of my hon. Friends were 
noticeably not referred to by the Minister; I am sure that 
they are considering taking their cases to the Equal 
Opportunities Commission as I speak.
<P>
It has been a constructive Committee stage, and we 
have certainly tried to approach the Bill in a spirit of 
constructive opposition to ensure that the Bill is right. It 
is important for disabled people that the Bill is passed. 
We have made every effort to ensure that it works in the 
interests of disabled people.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> All Members of Parliament fulfil their 
tasks to the best of their ability when they inspect 
legislation carefully, but do so especially when they 
examine it in a spirit of inquiry and consensus, when 
that is genuinely possible. It seems to me that the 
Committee has been extremely well behaved. I do not 
expect to see your like again. I am grateful to you all.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
