<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following: Government amendment No. 66.

<P>
Amendment (a), in line 3, leave out from ``the'' to end and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`care home is of a quality specified in the regulations and meets the standards specified in the regulations'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Amendment No. 14, in page 13, line 33, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) make provision requiring the person who carries on, or manages, an independent hospital or independent clinic to ensure procedures, agreed with the medical practitioners working in that establishment, are in place to implement clinical governance in respect of that establishment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall attempt to be brief because the Committee is anxious to discuss clause 22.

<P>
Amendment No. 193 would ensure that the clause specifically refers to a framework of proper clinical governance and audit. I am certain that the Minister intends the regulations to include those concepts, but I want to receive that clear assurance in the Committee. I shall not detain our proceedings by explaining why a framework of clinical governance and audit is necessary.

<P>
Government amendment No. 66 allows regulations to require arrangements to be made that secure appropriate quality and the meeting of appropriate standards in nursing care. It is broadly unexceptional. Amendment (a) attempts to tie down the expression
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>appropriate quality and  appropriate standards<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so that specific measures of quality and standards are laid out in regulations. We want the Government to reassure us that the regulations will refer to specific standards. We do not want the terms to be undefined. Regulations should be explicit about what is required of the people to whom they apply.

<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I am delighted to support amendment No. 193. It reflects the Liberal Democrat amendment No. 14. I congratulate the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) on his ingenuity in finding an earlier line in the clause on which to raise this matter. We, too, have pushed for such an assurance.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Gisela Stuart) Welcome back after lunch, Mr. Illsley.</B><P>

<P>
Although in broad terms we support the sentiments behind amendment No. 193 and amendment (a), we are not certain that we can support them. We all want independent health care providers to have systems in place to ensure quality of care. That is the Government's aim. The clause requires independent health care providers to have arrangements in place to secure the quality of treatment and services that they provide. The Opposition's amendments would not be a useful extension. I cannot accept that they are necessary.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I thought that amendments Nos. 14 and 193 were in line with the Government's response to the Health Committee's report that dealt with the problem. The Government at the time said that there ought to be clinical governance within private hospitals and medical accountability either through a medical director or, in a smaller establishment, through the chief executive. The amendments have not been plucked out of the air, nor are they unreasonable. They follow the Government's own thinking. It would be reasonable when we are discussing regulations, rather than the Bill, for the Government to acknowledge that.

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> It might be helpful to return to the use of the term ``clinical governance'', which in essence is not our biggest problem. ``Clinical governance'' is not defined in the Health Act 1999. It is defined in the subsequent clinical guidance as a framework through which the NHS organisations are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of care through the creation of an environment in which excellence and clinical care can flourish. That was the supporting definition of the term that was used in ``A First Class Service: Quality in the New NHS'', but it was not used in the Health Act itself. The problem lies in now using the term, as it might lead to semantic argument. We feel that the essence of the amendment is encapsulated in clause 21(6)(k).

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Is the Minister really suggesting that we must restrict the language that we use because a particular phrase has not been used in a preceding Bill? That would reduce us to returning to mediaeval times. ``Clinical governance'' is a well-understood term. If the Minister prefers, the phrase ``clinical accountability'' could be used. The concept of accountability is important. I would have hoped that the Government would be prepared to think about the issue.

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> We certainly agree with the need for the processes and framework to be in place. We are certain that clause 21(6)(k) provides that. It allows regulations to be made to ensure that arrangements are in place in independent hospitals, clinics and medical agencies to secure treatment and services that are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of appropriate quality and meet appropriate standards.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause will be the basis for the regulations.

<P>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the regulations will be far more specific. The Government's problem at the moment is that we do not feel that the term ``clinical governance'' adds anything to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister's argument that the term adds nothing to the Bill is slightly disingenuous and revisits the ground that we went over this morning. Nothing on pages 12 or 13 adds anything to the power under subsection (1), which gives the Minister unlimited regulation-making scope. The purpose of the amendment was to invite the Minister to make it clear to the Committee that the Government intend to use subsection (6)(k) to introduce clinical governance and clinical audit standards. If the Minister does so, I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> It might be useful to refer to the scoping paper ``Developing the Way Forward'', in which we made it clear that we envisage that independent health care providers will have to implement systems to account for the quality of clinical care that they provide. We envisage that this will include arrangements for the audit and review of clinical practice, for the identification of clinical risk, and for the keeping of clinical records. Perhaps those are the types of arrangements that the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) had in mind when they referred to clinical governance frameworks. However, to use the term on the face of the Bill is unnecessary. We fear that it would lead to esoteric arguments about what ``clinical governance'' as a term actually encompasses in this context. It is preferable to fall back on the broader provisions in the Bill and develop a regulatory framework from them. That will provide us with the safety that everybody is concerned about. For that reason, we oppose the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am slightly disappointed that the Under-Secretary has not taken the opportunity to give a clear assurance that the Government intend that the same sort of clinical governance arrangements will be put in place-for example, a requirement fully to investigate unexpected negative outcomes. Everything that we have heard today suggests that she intends to use the regulation-making powers in that way. Having created an opportunity for her to say so, I am a little miffed that she should choose not to. I note what she says, however, although we may want to probe the matter further at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 66, in page 13, line 33, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) make provision requiring arrangements to be made by the person who carries on, or manages, a care home for securing that any nursing provided by the home is of appropriate quality and meets appropriate standards.'.-[Ms Stuart.]<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 194, in page 13, line 33, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) make provision in the case of an establishment providing cosmetic surgery as to-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the nature of statements that may be made with regard to the services provided; and

<P>
(b) the titles that may be used to describe persons carrying on, managing or employed at such an establishment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment seeks to write into the parameters for making regulations a specific reference to the making of provisions in the case of establishments providing cosmetic surgery to limit the nature of statements made about the services provided and the titles that may be used to describe those who carry on, manage or are employed at such establishments.

<P>
The Health Committee, in its report on the regulation of the private sector, and the Government in their response, found that advertising and marketing techniques for cosmetic surgery allowed claims to be made that did not conform to acceptable standards and that might mislead patients. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that it happens. When it does, it damages reputable cosmetic surgeons and cosmetic surgery clinics. Anecdotal evidence suggests also that terms such as ``consultant'' may be used misleadingly. Many people speak to a consultant, imagining that he is a medical consultant, when in fact he is a sales consultant.

<P>
I hope that the Minister recognises that this is a genuine attempt to elicit confirmation that it is the Government's intention to deal by regulation with activities on the fringe of conventional medical practice, and to ensure that unacceptable practices are no longer permitted.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Stuart:</B> The amendment addresses issues that are of concern to the Government. Accurate information about services is vital. We are taking steps to address some of the concerns about cosmetic surgery by publishing an information leaflet for women considering having breast implants. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that people who are contemplating cosmetic surgery should be assured that the information that they receive about the proposed treatment and services is clear and accurate. Those people should also be given a clear assurance about the status of those with whom they are dealing with in the establishment where the cosmetic surgery is to take place. For instance, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, it is completely inappropriate for a salesman to describe himself as a consultant, as a derivation of sales consultant, if it gives prospective patients the impression that he is a medical practitioner.

<P>
I appreciate the sentiments behind the amendment, but I may have to disappoint the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge again, because it is not the best way to deal with the problem. Clause 21 already enables regulations to be made to require independent health care providers to ensure that patients and prospective patients receive clear and accurate information about the treatment and services being delivered or proposed. We fully intend to use that regulatory power and, in the standards that we wish to develop, to address the need for appropriate information to be given to patients.

<P>
The provisions will supplement the powers to control advertising in the Control of Misleading Advertisement Regulations 1988. The Bill will provide protection for patients in addition to the responsibility of the Advertising Standards Authority and the trading standards departments of local authorities to check the accuracy of advertisements.

<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The provision already contained in clause 21(6) is sufficiently wide to enable requirements to be placed on providers about the provision of information in a wide context. It would, for example, extend to requiring providers to ensure that the information provided to patients clarifies the status of the people within the establishment with whom the patient has contact. We would certainly wish to ensure that patients are aware of when they are talking to a salesman and when they are talking to a medical practitioner. The proposed amendment follows the same line of thinking. However, there is an obvious danger in the amendment, in that in referring to cosmetic surgery in such precise terms, it might have the effect of narrowing the powers in clause 21, especially subsection (6), and prevent similar provisions from being made in respect of other kinds of establishments and agencies. I am sure that that is not what hon. Members want.

<P>
We recognise the need for clear and accurate information, not only for those patients in premises where cosmetic surgery takes place-important though that is-but for all residents and patients covered by the establishments and agencies to be regulated under the Bill. The amendment would detract from that message and, although I acknowledge the intention behind it, would not make the provisions already contained in clause 21 more effective. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Of course I recognise that the amendment is technically unnecessary because of the wide scope of the powers under subsection (1), but if the list in subsections (2) to (7) is a statement of the Government's intentions, I would have preferred the list to include a reference to the cosmetic surgery problem. However, the Minister has made the Government's intention clear, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 195, in page 13, line 34, leave out ``may'' and insert ``shall''.

<P>
This is a small amendment that would require the Minister to make regulations under this subsection relating to the provision and use of accommodation for the purpose of restricting the liberty of children in children's homes. The subsection refers to the requirement to obtain the permission of any local authority that has legal parental responsibility for that child. It seems perfectly reasonable that a local authority that has legal parental responsibility might expect its approval to be sought in connection with matters laid down in the subsection. However, because the provision relates to the deprivation or restriction of liberty, it seems appropriate to clarify that the Minister will make regulations, rather than merely to state that he has the power to do so. If the Minister is not tempted to accept the amendment, perhaps he would make it clear that the subject will be covered by regulations and that the Bill does not just provide for a reserve power to be used at some time in the future.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for long. I appreciate the thinking behind the amendment, but I would like the Minister to say whether the provision relates to an establishment specifically set up to contain children against their will or whether a statutory request would have to be made to obtain approval every time a child needs to be detained against his or her will in an emergency. In my constituency, proper provision is often unavailable out of hours and it has happened that the only place of safety for a 12-year-old boy was a police station. That is clearly unacceptable, but it would create a difficult situation if a children's home could accept a child but had to get a Minister out of bed to make exceptional provision for an emergency placement.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton) I very much hope that that can be avoided.</B><P>

<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight who is becoming one of the Government's best friends in the House. In addition, he is now concerned about my sleeping arrangements, but perhaps we should not explore that any further.

<P>
I know it is a familiar refrain, but the amendment is unnecessary. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would replace ``may'' with ``shall''. However, the regulations are already in place because they were used in relation to powers under the Children Act 1989, and they will remain in force as a result of section 17 of the Interpretation Act 1987. Therefore, there is no need for new regulations to be introduced. That situation arises because the powers are repeated from the Children Act. The same wording will be used, which guarantees that the regulations can continue to operate. The hon. Gentleman wants to ensure that we will make regulations, but we have already done so, and we are not convinced that there is any need to change the existing regulations. Regulations for secure accommodation must be in place. Children's homes cannot be expected to provide an important range of services for especially difficult children without effective regulations, but regulatory arrangements already exist.

<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight expressed concern about what constitutes secure accommodation. That is a statutory term, which is defined in regulations as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>accommodation provided for the purposes of restricting the liberty of children.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Secure units comprise a specific component within the broader spectrum of residential provision for children. Therefore, it is unlikely that I will have to be roused from my bed to allow a prison cell to be used for such purposes because it would not constitute secure accommodation, would not be caught by the regulations and is not relevant to the wider issue of the need for regulations raised by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. We are probably at one about the need for regulation, but the hon. Gentleman can rest easy at night knowing that the regulations have already been enacted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The manager-[
Interruption.] I am in a groove.

<P>
The Minister said casually that the amendment is, of course, unnecessary because of the Interpretation Act, and his face did not flicker. I am afraid that I did not know about section 17 of the Interpretation Act. We will never know whether the Minister would have known about that had it not been mentioned in his notes. However, I am grateful to him for clarifying that point, which does allay my concern. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 196, in page 13, line 45, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Regulations may make provision in cases where an establishment or agency is subject to registration or inspection both by a registration authority, the Commission for Health Improvement and the Mental Health Act Commission, for any of those bodies to carry out the functions of all of them in relation to that establishment or agency.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment refers to the situation in which an establishment might be subject to regulation, registration or inspection by a registration authority, the Commission for Health Improvement and the Mental Health Act Commission. Its purpose is to probe the Government's thinking about how they envisage that the situation will evolve. We have in mind privately operated, medium secure mental health accommodation that receives NHS patients. A large percentage of NHS medium-secure patients are looked after in the private sector. As I understand matters, under the Bill, establishments providing accommodation for those patients would be inspected by the commission, by the Commission for Health Improvement-because of the NHS patients in them-and by the Mental Health Act Commission. I have raised this theme before, but where multiple inspections and registrations might arise it might be beneficial to streamline the process. Under amendment No. 196 regulations might enable one of the bodies to take the lead.

<P>
A further extension of what I have described is possible. The review process with respect to the Mental Health Act 1983 will have to consider, among other things, informal detention and whether there is a need to formalise the structures that relate to it. That would widen the sphere of involvement of the Mental Health Act Commission and extend the problem of coming under three inspection and registration regimes from a relatively small, though important, part of independent provision into a broader area.

<P>
I think that the idea for which I am arguing is common sense. I do not suppose that the amendment covers all the technicalities, but I wonder whether the Government are persuaded by the idea that where multiple inspection is provided for it would be sensible for a lead body to conduct it on behalf of the others.

<P>

<B>Ms Stuart:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be delighted to hear that we do not consider the amendment unnecessary, although we think it inappropriate, for two reasons. First, we have now introduced new clause 23, which will, I hope, enable us to co-ordinate the activities of the National Care Standards Commission and the Commission for Health Improvement and minimise the potential for overlap. Secondly, and more fundamentally, the function of the Mental Health Act Commission is distinct from that of the other two bodies. Its visiting role is entirely patient-focused and involves meeting privately with patients to deal with individual problems and complaints and to take up immediate issues on their behalf. The Mental Health Act Commission is also charged with examining statutory documentation with a view to giving patients access to their individual statutory rights. It does not examine issues that the other commissions will deal with, such as physical environments. Therefore, there is no duplication of role. Any diminution of the visiting access of the Mental Health Act Commission would inevitably erode existing safeguards for patients.

<P>
At the moment, the Commission for Health Improvement is intended to visit on a three to four-year cycle, the National Care Standards Commission will visit annually and the current arrangements for the Mental Health Act Commission are for three visits in a two-year period, but more frequently if requested by a detained patient. That flexibility is important.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is reassured that we do not want unnecessary duplication of functions, and that new clause 23 will deal with that matter. We are keen to develop co-ordination. We should expect the two other bodies to liaise with the Mental Health Act Commission and collaborate effectively to minimise any disruption to the timetable of inspections or to the providers. That should be dealt with in planning the working arrangements of each body, rather than through the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened to the Under-Secretary, having brought to her attention an issue that was raised by concerned bodies, which have now had an opportunity to hear her response. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mrs Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I beg to move amendment No. 197, in page 13, line 46, leave out subsection (8).

<P>
There is no need to detain the Committee for long on this amendment, as there is probably a simple explanation that I have overlooked. I have a straight question for the Minister: why should voluntary agencies be excluded from the regulations? Surely, one of the Government's aims is to create a level playing field between private and public adoption agencies. If the Government intend to exclude voluntary agencies, why was that not made clear in clause 1(4), which lists the other exclusions? As I said, there is probably a simple explanation, which I look forward to hearing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> There is a simple explanation, which I hope that I shall be able to make clear to the hon. Lady. She appears to be concerned about whether we will have powers to regulate voluntary adoption agencies, as we have excluded them from clause 21(7). We still have powers to regulate such agencies, which are retained under section 9 of the Adoption Act 1976, where the regulatory-making power for voluntary adoption agencies currently resides. The Bill does not change that provision.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> That is the sort of answer for which I was hoping, although we realise that there is probably legislation in the offing to reform the 1976 Act. The previous Government certainly planned to introduce such legislation.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Does the hon. Lady agree that it would be helpful if a note setting out the difference between the regulatory powers set out in the 1976 Act and those for which the Bill provides were produced for Committee members?

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> Perhaps the Minister will reply to that question. I am not familiar with section 9 of the 1976 Act, which I do not currently have at my disposal. Will the Minister reassure us that the powers contained in the Act provide sufficient cover? As voluntary adoption agencies are to be completely excluded from the regulations dealt with in the Bill, we must be sure that there are no gaps. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that there are no aspects of the regulations that should be applied to voluntary adoption agencies but which those agencies will escape because of an assumption that section 9 of the 1976 Act will do the job for us? The Minister has referred previously to various legal loopholes that are closed by the Bill. I should like to be sure that this sweeping exclusion does not leave any more such loopholes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall certainly ensure that the Committee receives the information for which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight asked.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> If the Minister is providing the information, we will examine it retrospectively but, for now, in the interests of making progress, we will take his word for it. I hope that he will provide us with a copy of the letter that he sends to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68, That the clause stand part of the Bill:-

<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>
Clause 21, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>National minimum standards</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 199, in page 14, line 1, leave out from ``(1)'' to ``national'' in line 2 and insert ``Regulations may set out''.

<P>
Clauses 21 and 22 lie at the heart of the Bill. Clause 21 deals with regulations to be laid by the Minister and subjected to the usual routines of parliamentary scrutiny with which all hon. Members are familiar. Clause 22 enables the Minister to publish statements of minimum standards without the need for parliamentary scrutiny.

<P>
The Government agreed to insert subsection (3) during the passage of the Bill in the other place at the insistence of our noble Friends. The subsection at least provides a statutory basis for consultation with appropriate people and bodies outside Parliament. However, there is still no provision for proper parliamentary scrutiny of statements made under the clause. Amendment No. 199 would require minimum standards to be set out as regulations that would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. That of course would mean less flexibility because regulations, by definition, are less flexible than statements. They would not just be taken into account as subsection (4)(d) allows.

<P>
Regulations surely must be used to prescribe minimum standards. We are considering not a range of standards but minimum standards-the bare acceptable level below which nobody will be permitted to operate. The Minister has already made it clear that regulations under clause 21 will capture the statement of national minimum standards; a regulation would make reference to them.

<P>
The Minister said that he would give the Committee more explicit information about the Government's thinking on the national minimum standards when we reached this stage. It might be helpful for the Committee if we considered the history of the matter, which has been at the heart of the public debate on the Bill. The Government commissioned the Centre for Policy on Ageing to produce a study of appropriate standards for care homes for older people. I do not want to fall into the trap of speaking as if the clause applied only to the standards for such care homes, but the Minister will readily acknowledge that most of the public interest and concern regarding the Bill has focused on that exercise.

<P>
The centre produced 260 recommendations for draft standards. The Government put the recommendations out as a consultation document, which created confusion, concern in the industry and real difficulty in the marketplace for providers of services and capital. People wishing to sell their businesses and move on or to improve their care homes have found that difficult and sometimes impossible to do.

<P>
To be fair to the Minister, he has spent much of his time in the past year seeking to dissociate himself from the idea that the standards are likely to be implemented in their entirety. However, the balloon had already gone up. It is too late to put the genie back in the bottle. Without an explicit statement from the Government on the scope of the minimum standards-what they will and will not include and their level-uncertainty, doubt and concern, and the blight that follows, have been a feature of the industry in the past few months.

<P>
<B>Mrs Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that most care providers, certainly most of those to whom I speak, welcome many of the suggestions put forward by the Centre for Policy on Ageing because they are already following them? Those providers are already implementing the many examples of good practice in the suggestions or would like to have them as part of national standards. Although its concerns are limited, it wants to be able to offer the best possible standards to vulnerable people in the community.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I agree with the hon. Lady that a narrow band of issues has given rise to a disproportionate concern. However, when we debate what she is saying to care home owners in her area and her position on the minimum standards, perhaps she will tell us whether she is pressing those concerns on the Minister.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has asked my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs Humble) to make her position clear. She has persistently lobbied and campaigned for care home owners in her constituency. She might be reluctant to say that, but I am not.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is interesting to hear. The Minister is giving us a glimpse of what goes on behind closed doors. Opposition Members look forward to hearing what the hon. Lady has to say as the debate progresses.

<P>
I have a press release, dated 22 January 1999, from the Centre for Policy on Ageing in which it is stated that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>CPA is confident that the clarity and realistic approach adopted in setting the National Required Standards will overcome much of the present inconsistency in the way standards are  applied.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
People who are worried about the effects of the exercise contend that the lack of a realistic approach to what is achievable has fatally flawed the document. It is also stated in the press release that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The standards themselves are specific, robust and measurable leading to outcomes which focus on all aspects of residents' well-being.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, it is a matter of contention whether specific, robust and measurable standards necessarily have a good outcome.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I am listening closely to the hon. Gentleman's concerns, many of which have been expressed outside the Committee. However, I am unclear about his point. Is he arguing that the consultation process on the standards was wrong or that the standards themselves are wrong? Is it that both are wrong? It would help if he could be specific.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It is a bit of both, as the hon. Gentleman will discover in the next few minutes. There are two separate issues. The first is the problems that have been created in the marketplace by the process itself. The second is the specific standards, on which I hope the Minister will give us some detailed information because we are working in the dark.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> In the next few minutes, the hon. Gentleman will no doubt explain what different process the Conservatives would introduce to produce a different outcome. It would be informative to know what proposals he has for the process.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall address that point in several ways, not least by exploring whether an input-focused series of tick-the-box measures is the best way to achieve quality care outcomes. I shall be interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman has to say on that score.

<P>
Let me return to the theme, which is becoming more familiar than I should like. In the Minister's defence, the CPA's press release quotes his response to its document, which his Government commissioned. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have made clear our determination to raise standards of care for elderly people, and this report marks a significant stage in the development of new national standards,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is about as tepid as he could politely be. Unfortunately, the director of the CPA is quoted as saying,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am delighted that the Minister has confirmed the Government's clear commitment to our work.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At that very early stage, 18 months ago, it was clear that the CPA was putting a spin on the Government's response. The Minister's words do not justify that spin, and he has sought progressively over the past six months to limit the damage, which suggests that it was totally unjustified. The problem is that once the word was out in the marketplace, lenders and some providers panicked. That resulted in the problems with which many members of the Committee will be familiar from talking to care home owners in their constituencies. Indeed, I know that some of them will want to talk about those specific points later.

<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
To respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, the Government stand accused of failing to act swiftly and decisively to kill the concerns in the care home sector. They should have made clear the intended scope of the standards and their intended impact on the sector. It is not for me to say how the Government should have done that. For example, they might have made it clear-notwithstanding aspirations for anything better, which we might all have, but for reasons of practicality-that standards would be set at a level no higher than the 95th percentile of existing provision, or the 90th or 85th percentile or whatever the Government thought appropriate, to give some reassurance to the sector and the capital providers that stand behind it that great swathes of the sector would not be wiped out by the introduction of inappropriate standards.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): This morning, we had a line from the hon. Gentleman that he wanted to probe the question of regulations, which went on for so long that it sounded as if he did not want any regulation of the sector. Now we have a line from him that veers towards a point where it seems that he does not want to improve standards. We are dealing with fundamentally important issues and, in a democratic society, there is a need for public debate to allow people to be open and clear about their aspirations and to discuss these issues at length.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The history of that incident has highlighted the danger of that approach. I urge a little caution. We are discussing the damage that has been done in reaching the point where we are now. The Government have made some clear statements during the past couple of months that significantly limit the scope for the national minimum standards and draw a line under some of the concerns that have been expressed. In doing that, the Minister has clearly recognised the problem with the more aspirational draft standards, because of the impact that they would have had on the sector. We live in the real world. If aspirations are expressed in a Government consultation document-an official publication-it is inevitable that some people will interpret that as being the Government's current thinking and that they will act accordingly. We have seen the impact that that has had on the care home sector.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> The converse of what the hon. Gentleman is saying is that the Government should have gone for the lowest common denominator and given the most important people in the process-the users of the service; those who live in residential care in nursing homes-no hope whatever that standards will improve and no commitment that the Government will develop and improve them. Is that what he is saying?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry to say this to the hon. Gentleman, but he seems to live in a world slightly distant from reality. Standards are not improved simply by saying, ``I'll introduce a law that says standards are higher''. The issue is one of resourcing, of practicality. We have buildings to alter, and money to be spent and borrowed. The Government understand perfectly well that aspirations alone are not helpful; we must have aspirations that can be translated into deliverable improvements. It is a matter of striking the right balance.

<P>
The way in which the process has been handled over the past 18 months has damaged the sector and its future prospects. In some cases, it has made the standard of what has been delivered worse. I will give the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre a specific example. If he owned a care home that had 11 m bedrooms and had proposed in January 1999 to install en-suite WC facilities taking up 2 m or 2.5 m of each room, he would have done nothing for the past 18 months because he would not have wanted to spend his money only to find that he had inadvertently reduced the size of residents' rooms to below the national minimum standards that the Government had in mind. That is a specific example of damage to users' interests owing to the uncertainty that has surrounded the process over the past 18 months.

<P>
Inevitably, much of the debate will be about standards, and we shall of course join in that debate, but I want to put down a marker. We are not entirely convinced that measuring inputs is the way to go about ensuring the optimum care experience. There seems to be a check-the-box mentality: measure the easily measurable and then be satisfied.

<P>
The Minister can, and probably will, say that such measuring should be only the starting point and that, of course, wider and more subjective measures of quality and outcome also need to be taken into account. However, I hope that he will recognise the inevitable temptation in any hard-pressed, resource-constrained system in which people are trying to do more jobs than they have time for-that is true of most of the public sector-to tick the box and sign off the task. I draw the Committee's attention to the dangers inherent in an input-measuring system of standards.

<P>
The hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood said that the great majority of care home owners were either completely or reasonably comfortable with the great majority of the proposed standards. I do not disagree with that. Perhaps it is worth mentioning now that the category of care home owners includes many local authorities, which will experience significant hit by the proposals in the document.

<P>
The two groups of proposals that have caused the greatest concern are those on the built environment in which care is delivered and those on staffing-both ratios of staffing and the training and qualifications of staff. I question the wisdom of allowing circulation of some of the-perhaps undeliverable-ideas in the draft document. The Minister would probably acknowledge that prescriptive staff ratios, the exclusion of en-suite WCs in the measurement of rooms and speculation about the room size have had an impact on the sector.

<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I notice that the hon. Gentleman has been extremely selective in listing aspects of the standards that cause him concern. Presumably he does not think that factors in the physical environment such as the state of decoration or repair of the building and whether there is access to outdoor space should be considered. I wonder how, in his resource-constrained environment, it is possible to strike the balance that he seeks unless we are prepared openly to discuss and consult people on a range of options in the draft. If we are to discuss only those matters with which he feels there is no difficulty, does not that exclude care home owners from discussion of other more difficult issues from the start?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman has partially answered his own question in that many of the examples that he gave have not generated huge angst in the outside world.

<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> They are part of the physical environment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Of course they are part of the physical environment, which, if the hon. Gentleman wishes, I can break down. We all know what we are talking about. We are referring to room sizes, the inclusion or exclusion of en-suite facilities, shared room versus single-room requirements, and so on. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman if I am not being explicit enough. Every member of this Committee knows which areas have caused, and are causing, difficulty. I readily acknowledge that, in many parts of the draft standards, there is no great concern-or such concerns are of a minor or technical nature which the Government can easily address.

<P>
There is also concern about the lack of clarity on time scale, which could be disastrous for people who borrow money and, by logical extension, for those who lend it, as well as for the implementation of new standards that involve alterations to buildings. Buildings may even become redundant as not all of them can be altered. Lenders and borrowers alike need clear time horizons. With the benefit of hindsight, such matters should have been made clear much earlier.

<P>
The Department of Health produced estimates of the impact of the standards as drafted and circulated them for consultation. Those estimates suggested that 20 to 23 per cent. of independent sector residential homes, 12 per cent. of nursing homes and 55 per cent. of local authority residential homes would not meet the space and amenity standards. They also suggested that between 53 and 56 per cent. of nursing homes would not meet the suggested staffing ratios. The proposals on shared rooms would require 8 per cent. of nursing home bed capacity and about 4 per cent. of residential home bed capacity to be decommissioned in order to meet the targets.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman because I sense that he has come to an important point. He is quoting the regulatory impact assessment that accompanied ``Fit for the Future?'' I am sure that he would not want to give the Committee the impression that the figures that he has quoted are absolute, as he is pretending. We of course made two very important qualifications to those estimates in the impact assessment. It had to be assumed first that there would be no further improvement in provision before their introduction and, secondly, that they would not be accompanied by any transitional period. We have made it very clear that there will be a transitional period; the hon. Gentleman will be aware of the scale of improvement already.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister is right to make that point. I was about to make another point that drags in the opposite direction.

<P>
The Department of Health took no account of the economic effect of decommissioning a bedroom or two in a small nursing home. A desk-top study may show that decommissioning one, two or three beds in a small nursing home would provide the ratio of single rooms required by the standards. However, if the impact of that is, as it often will be, to render that nursing home economically inviable, the impact in loss of provision will be significantly greater. I acknowledge what the Minister said; the points that he raised will press downwards on the percentage figures of potential loss. The point that I made, however, pulls in the opposite direction, exerting an upward influence on those figures.
 
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
My argument is not dependent on precise figures. It is that, against a backdrop of a tightly squeezed economic situation for independent sector care home providers, local authority fees have mostly been rising at rates well below 2.5 per cent. a year, but cost pressures have increased dramatically. As property values in some parts of the United Kingdom rose sharply, creating a higher opportunity cost for the use of property as a care home, it should have been predictable that, with such uncertainty, the figures, however adjusted or manipulated, would lead to a considerable problem in the care home sector.

<P>
The Department of Health should have been able to predict that, unless it moved swiftly clearly to delimit the extent and scope of its ambitions for national minimum standards, it would blight the market and make buying or selling care homes, borrowing and thus improvements or even basic maintenance difficult. It would make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. All those things are needed in a healthy, functioning marketplace to ensure that the lifeblood is flowing.

<P>
I have pages of quotations of the concerns of care home owners and representative bodies about their real and direct plight. I shall not take up the time of the Committee by reading them out; I suspect that most members of the Committee have been circulated with the examples. I also suspect that some of my hon. Friends will want to give examples of their own.

<P>
Time and again, the theme that emerges from the submissions is that the people who are closest to the delivery of care feel that mechanistic standards ignore the issue of quality of care and its cost implications, as well as sometimes the basic facts of architectural constraints. I refer the Minister to a specific case. How many care homes were visited by the Centre for Policy on Ageing team before it produced the original document that was submitted to him, which has caused so much trouble subsequently?

<P>
All that, in a sense, is history; now we need to move on. Members of the Committee must try collectively to draw a line under the confusion and the problems that are experienced in the care home sector. We need the Minister to announce today in specific terms, in relation to the most sensitive areas of the proposed standards, what the Government intend. We have been asking for that since Second Reading in the other place in December 1999. We need clarity in order to lift the blight. Only the Minister can do that by a clear, unambiguous statement.

<P>
What does ``usable'' mean in relation to room size? Does it include en-suite bathrooms or the area of the door sweep as it opens into the room? We need to know. If local authorities are to have the right-as I believe they will and should have-to insist in their contracting arrangements on higher standards than the national minimum standards that the Government propose to set, while accepting such standards for the provision that they make, will the Minister assure us that there will be a requirement for uniformity of treatment and that they will not be allowed to impose such higher standards on private sector providers?

<P>
Will the Minister confirm that he will reject the notion of fixed ratios of single to shared rooms in care homes? That notion is a nonsense. If care homes want to target specific sectors of the market, that is entirely appropriate; what matters is that individuals can choose to be in a shared or a single room. If necessary, that can be appropriately dealt with by local authorities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am finding it difficult to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. When he travels around the United Kingdom and talks to care home owners, does he detect a big demand for the shared accommodation that the proposed national minimum required standards might impede? In my discussions with care home owners, they tell me that the trend is in the opposite direction.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My point was that although it may be right to seek more single accommodation in the mix, does the Minister appreciate that different kinds of homes might have different targets? To give an extreme example, a home might be set up to target married couples. It would be ludicrous if a home that was marketing itself as a home for married couples was not allowed more than 20 per cent. shared accommodation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made a fair point, and I take it on board. I am a little confused, because the amendment would make it impossible for us to exercise that discretion. The hon. Gentleman would insert standards and regulations which would presumably limit dramatically the scope for the discretion he wants.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I will make a suggestion. We could remove the concept of ratios and enshrine the principle of choice. There would then be a burden on the purchasing authority to procure single accommodation when a person indicated that that was what he or she wanted. I do not see any practical difficulty in achieving that within regulations.

<P>
On staffing ratios, the Minister has already made it clear that he favours a flexible approach. I take that to mean what I described earlier as a multi-tiered system, identifying multiple levels of need, but there are serious questions about how that would work in practice. I hope that the Minister will clarify his current thinking on how assessment would be carried out, and assured to be objective and uniform, on a basis that was accepted by both private sectors providers and those carrying out the assessment.

<P>
Will the Minister confirm that any staffing ratio standards will be established in the light of the current situation, which varies in different parts of Britain in relation to the availability of trained nursing staff? More than anyone, the Minister is acutely aware of the NHS crisis in recruiting and retaining nursing staff. Higher ratios of qualified nurses in the care home sector will exacerbate the crisis, and the standards that are set must reflect local or regional differences in the labour market.

<P>
The independent sector is acutely worried about the cost of training. People who are trained and qualified expect, quite rightly, to be paid more money. Ultimately, the Minister holds the purse strings. Can he assure us that he will not impose the burdens of training and qualification levels?

<P>
Can the Minister say something about lifts? Is he prepared to say that the Government will abandon any insistence on lifts in all buildings of two or more storeys where the accommodation is arranged in a way that does not make lifts strictly necessary? Most importantly, can he be specific about the time scale for the transition to meet all of the above? It is outwith the scope of the Bill but can he tell the Committee whether, in his wider ministerial capacity, he has plans to impose upon NHS long-stay beds the same minimum standards that are imposed on local authority and private sector providers under section 22? If not, why not? Why should patients who are looked after in the NHS suffer lower standards?

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood will speak in this debate. She comes from an area where there has historically been some difficulty in that accommodation sizes have been lower than the 80 sq ft standard that applies in Blackpool and Lancashire. I know that she has told home owners in her area that she will fight their corner.

<P>
A recent survey suggested that 91 per cent. of accommodation in Blackpool would be non-compliant with a 10 sq m standard. I am sure that the hon. Lady has been assiduously lobbying the Minister behind the scenes, but I think that now is the time for her to say whatever she has to say on the record in this Committee so that the care home owners in her constitutency can see precisely where she stands.

<P>
We need to take the opportunity to lift the blight and the uncertainty that surrounds the industry and to reassure providers and the lenders who service them. We need a flexible system. Ideally, it would measure the quality of care by outcome. However, if the Government insist on using inputs as a proxy, we must have a system flexible enough to recognise trade-offs. There may be smaller bedrooms in one establishment but it might have much larger or better communal facilities or better staffing ratios. I hope that the Minister can espouse that principle today. We must not allow good quality care to be excluded from the system because of technical non-compliance.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will also espouse the principle that minimum standards must mean just that. There must be a base line below which no-one should fall. However, better-than-minimum standards must be rewarded where they are delivered. In other words, it is appropriate to use carrots as well as sticks. That is the way to raise real standards, and the only standard that really matters is the quality of the care experience.

<P>
We all agree that minimum standards are necessary, but we must also be realistic, and those standards must be realistic. The coat must be cut to fit the cloth. In this case, the cloth is Government-issued material and the design must take account of what will be made available by way of public funding through fees in order to meet the cost of raising standards in the way that the Government, I hope, properly expect to do, rather than simply expressing aspirations.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am with the hon. Gentleman so far on the need for some clarity and for some support for the people currently engaged in providing long-term care. Is he really suggesting that we should set the standards at such a low minimum that they can be afforded no matter what?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Yes he is.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The answer really is to set the minimum standards and then push for affordability.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre does not mind, I will answer for myself. I am suggesting that the Government are ultimately the main source of revenue to providers in the care home sector. It is in the Government's power to set whatever standards they want to achieve. However, those standards will have to be paid for. I am suggesting that minimum standards should be just that: a standard that is the bare minimum acceptable in any single category. That might mean a bare minimum bedroom size, staffing ratio, or communal facilities. However, it should be possible to recognise through the contracting system-through the payments that local authorities make-that a care home meeting all those bare minimums but exceeding some of them, provides a better level of care as a result. It should be possible to reward homes for delivering better outcomes. We must share the concern that there is a danger when minimum standards are set in a competitive marketplace. Unless there are premium payments for better-than-minimum standards, the minimum will become the norm and all supply will be driven down to the minimum through the competitive operation of the market.

<P>
I do not think that that is what the Government intend. I do not think that that is what the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre would want. All I am suggesting, with respect to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, is that, above and beyond the minimum standards, we should expect the Government to seek to ensure that providers are encouraged to offer better than the minimum standards, and they should be properly rewarded for doing so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw (Chatham and Aylesford) rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Caroline Flint (Don Valley) rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) as he rose first.

<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for arranging for us to have a look at the room size that has been put forward in the consultation document. We were struck by the fact that it was not, by any stretch of the imagination, an enormous size for someone's only personal space. What is the hon. Gentleman's benchmark? What does he say? Should it be 80 square feet? Should it be 70 square feet? What does he say is the right amount of space that someone should have?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I think that we had better wait to see what the Minister is going to say. Whatever the Minister says is going to be a minimum below which no provision may be offered to the marketplace. That is right. That is what a minimum standard is all about. The argument that I have sought to develop is that we need a mechanism to encourage people to make better provision. Otherwise, a person building a new care home will compare the minimum standard with the cost of building and build to the minimum standard.

<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument. Is it not important that the minimum standard is a standard with which we would all feel comfortable if we were to be in long-term care, or if we were to put a relative into such care? The hon. Gentleman seems to portray such base minimum standards that better quality would be needed. I see it as the difference between having a colour television or having a digital television, and, perhaps, internet connection. The minimum standard must be such that we would be happy for one of our family members to live with it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is an interesting point. I see what is happening. The hon. Members are interpreting my reference to a base minimum standard as suggesting that I am seeking to press down what the Minister is about to propose. [
Interruption.] I do not know what the Minister is about to propose. I would be surprised, however, if I have a problem with what the Minister is going to propose as a minimum standard. I am arguing for the necessity for some form of incentive system to encourage provision over and above the minimum standard.

<P>
The hon. Lady made another important point. She said that the sizes must be such that we would feel comfortable with them. Then she corrected herself and said it should be comfortable enough to put a relative in. We must not sit here and extrapolate from our own lifestyles the situation of older people in care homes. I will give the hon. Lady an example. There is a requirement to put showers in bathrooms in care homes. To all of us a shower seems like an everyday necessary requirement. How many old ladies does the hon. Lady know who like to take showers? That is not what people of a certain age do. They customarily take baths. It is a trivial example but we have to be careful not to extrapolate from our own experience and our own thoughts to impose upon others something that is not appropriate to them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will excuse me I am not going to take any more interventions because I have been on my feet far too long. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will wish to speak and I would not like to detract from the time available to do that. We can all agree that the way in which this situation has developed over the past 18 months has not been of benefit to the industry. It has caused considerable damage, not only to care home providers, some of whom have feared being driven out of business and have been blighted for some time. Their residents also have had to fear for the security of their homes and futures during that period. I look forward to hearing what the Minister and other hon. Members have to say.

<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is appropriate to point out to the Committee that the debate on the amendment has been wide-ranging and lengthy. It has now lasted 45 minutes and we have strayed into amendments that will be discussed later. I suggest that we include national minimum standards in the debate now rather than have a clause stand part debate later, if the Committee agrees.

<P>
<B>Mrs Humble:</B> I am glad of that ruling, Mr. Illsley. I intended to ask for leave to respond to some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge during his wide-ranging contribution on a fairly limited amendment.

<P>
I am not sure whether I should be hurt or surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not looked at my previous speeches on the issue. I have consistently argued the same policy and I shall repeat it today. National minimum standards are central to our consideration of the Bill and it is important that we get them right. When the National Care Standards Commission implements them, they must be capable of delivering the highest quality of service to vulnerable people in our community while taking into account the needs of providers whether of day care, domiciliary care or residential care.

<P>
Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I welcome the widespread consultation that has taken place on this. It has given many different organisations an opportunity to contribute to the debate and has allowed organisations representing older people and those with disabilities to make their views known, as well as the providers. When my hon. Friend, the Minister looks at the national minimum standards he will be taking into account all the comments that have been made. The comments come from those who want the highest possible standards because they are or will be service users or from providers who also want high standards, but want them to be practicable and deliverable.

<P>
I read with interest the comments made by my local authority on the ``Fit for the Future?'' document. Like virtually everybody else, that authority welcomed the overwhelming majority of the standards on which it was being consulted. Its comments focused on one or two issues that were also highlighted by the Lancashire care home providers and the Lancashire Care Association when it approached me. It is important to make it clear from the outset that Lancashire Care Association and private providers outside that association have constantly emphasised that they fully support the Government in the resolution to push up standards. They want to provide the best possible services and do not want to be seen as holding back progress and saying ``No, we don't want to improve.''.

<P>
They want to improve because it is the right thing to do. They ought to be in the business because they care about the people for whom they provide a service. Also, they are competitive and want to provide high quality care in order to attract customers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that there should not be a minimum standard because that would discourage further improvement. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is the same argument Tory Members used against the minimum wage?

<P>
<B>Mrs Humble:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge can answer for himself, but I agree that we need to deliver national minimum standards at the highest level to those in need of the service. I have not met anyone who disagrees with that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady's flow. For the record and to make it clear to the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford, I did not say that there should be no national minimum standard.

<P>
<B>Mrs Humble:</B> I shall continue with my theme and, specifically, the matter of room size. When considering physical standards in residential care we must bear in mind that the needs of residents have changed over recent years. Twenty years ago, many people going into residential care were reasonably fit and active. They could go out bowling and take up activities in the community. I went on trips with some groups of elderly people. Now, when I visit residential care establishments, I am struck by the fact that the residents are much more frail. They need a higher level of care and the physical standards of the accommodation must take into account that an increasing number of people need wheelchairs, some when they arrive and others after a few years. We also have to provide for the needs of the staff who care for the elderly. There needs to be enough room to lift people in and out of bed if necessary and to help them with dressing, bathing and other personal services.

<P>
We cannot ignore physical standards. When writing to my hon. Friend the Minister on this issue, I have, on more than one occasion, highlighted the problems for areas such as Blackpool and Lancashire where there are many care homes that were converted from old buildings. It is now difficult to convert them further to provide larger rooms. The choice may not be between higher or lower standards, but between a standard that is acceptable or no home at all. That is a serious problem. I have statistics about the percentage of care homes in my constituency that would not meet the room requirements and they are quite frightening. However, that does not mean that all those homes would close if these standards were introduced. Some of them could alter.

<P>
I have asked my hon. Friend the Minister how long homes will be allowed to continue to operate should minimum standards be introduced that many of them cannot satisfy because of the new room requirements. The lead-in time will be very important. For example, in Lancashire I know of some care homes that are listed buildings and cannot be altered. I am not sure whether the Minister will be able to consider limited exceptions to a general rule, but in making decisions about national standards, he will have to take into account the issues that are at stake in an area such as mine, which has many care homes. I repeat that those establishments want to offer the highest possible standard of care, but some have doubts about whether they can meet the room-size requirement. I would welcome comments from the Minister on time scales and flexibility.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady's argument. She put her case reasonably and persuasively, but I did not hear her refer to a figure. In the light of the problems of the care home sector in Blackpool and in Lancashire as a whole, what figure is she pressing her hon. Friend the Minister to adopt as the minimum room size?

<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mrs Humble:</B> It is rather cheeky of the hon. Gentleman to ask me a question that he would not answer himself. I said that I was discussing the issue with Lancashire care home owners. As he has expressed interest in the star rating scheme that Blackpool is so successfully running, I should point out that Lancashire Care Association is engaged in discussions about whether the scheme could deal also with new accommodation standards with which it does not currently deal.

<P>
I have suggested to my hon. Friend the Minister that the way forward might be to consider both care and accommodation standards and to decide whether different levels might apply. People who are choosing care homes must know what accommodation they can properly expect as a minimum and be able to consider the enhancements offered by some homes. My only reservation is that we should be absolutely clear about minimum acceptable standards, which should not take into account only room size. We seem to think that all rooms are square or rectangular, but they are not. Some rooms are long and thin and some are L-shaped. Some may cover the square meterage or footage that is being suggested, but be such a strange shape that nobody, including myself, would want to live inside one of them. We must consider other aspects of what rooms have to offer. After all, a room will be the home of the person who occupies it and his or her personal space. Although people in care homes can also access lounge areas, dining rooms and other facilities, if they want to go somewhere of their own, they will go to their bedrooms. We must be aware that the personal space has to be sufficient for people to spend time in if they want to do so.

<P>
I do not envy my hon. Friend the task of considering all the comments that have been made on national minimum standards. Some decisions will be easy, but others will be more difficult. He should ensure that the highest possible standards are introduced, but I urge him to take into account the practicality of those standards in areas such as mine, where room size requirements will cause problems.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want briefly to express some concerns, some of which have already been mentioned, and to reflect on some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about whether a policy is emerging or whether it is locked in the box. The hon. Gentleman has spoken about that box regularly; it is the one that contains nothing. I am not certain whether the Conservatives have a clear policy on what they would do to advance a standards regime. He said several times that he wanted to look to the future, but what puzzled me was that we were still bogged down in the debate on what was fit for the future. The clause is important and does establish standards, but only one set of them. I should like to comment on some of the other standards that will be established and to ask one or two questions about the process and timetable that are relevant to those standards. I want to deal not just with the residential sector, important though it is.

<P>
Like many of my hon. Friends and other Members I have received letters from constituents who run care homes and representations from national and regional organisations that represent those interests forcefully and pursuasively. What comes across in the representations is that their concerns focus on a couple of narrow points within the context of a detailed set of standards laid out in ``Fit for the Future?'' My concern is that in a debate such as this, and in other debates in other places, the baby is thrown out with the bathwater when it comes to standards.

<P>
I agreed with the hon. Gentleman's statement about the over-emphasis on input measures and tick boxing.-[Laughter.] I mean ticking boxes. I have invented a new sport, tick boxing. I was puzzled when he said that because in earlier contributions he advocated the development of a standardised assessment tool for community care. That would presumably entail the same ticking of boxes that he now quite rightly decries in the context of setting the standards in which that care is to be provided. I counsel him to read his previous statements and ensure that they square with his latest.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I will give way at this point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is very gracious. I do not see the inconsistency in my argument. We have assessment procedures, although they may not be perfect. It would be better for them to be standardised than not. The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point: the great majority of standards are not controversial. Will he acknowledge, however, that the defining characteristic of the controversial aspect of the standards is that they have financial implications-that they will cost money to implement? The Government have given no indication that they recognise that and will resource local authorities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there will be some price tags. I recognise that, as do many outsiders observing the process-not only those involved in the direct provision of care, but those who look at the market. Laing and Bruson worked on the regulatory impact assessment that is ``Fit for the Future?'' There was more to that research than was included in the impact assessment. Some of Laing and Bruson's work shows that there will be real costs if the Government manage the transition in the way that the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood identified. Given the physical constraints in existing premises and the listing of a number of the premises in which care homes are based, the transition will have to be managed.

<P>
Another factor is that the market at present is not attractive, partly because there is a surplus of places across the country-albeit a short to medium-term one-and partly because of fee scales. The market does not offer the same returns as it did in the past. Some have rightly pointed out that the high returns in the past led to an explosion in the market, which grew too big at one stage, to the detriment of care at home and community care. That is a legitimate concern.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was right to express concern about the process. Will the Minister tell the Committee a little more about events between the Centre for Policy on Ageing publishing the draft standards, after about a year of work, and the Government re-publishing them many months later with a new cover, but almost no changes? The Minister may be abe to identify some punctuation marks and other minor changes, but my understanding is that there was no material change between publication by the Centre for Policy on Ageing and the Government publication for consultation. The Government might always have intended to do that. However, the long period that elapsed before the Government put the standards out for consultation fuelled concerns and allowed the debate to reach its present point.

<P>
I hope that the gap between the Government receiving professional advice from those that it commissioned to draw up standards and their publication of that advice for consultation will be shorter when future standards concerning matters such as processing and time scales for domiciliary care and day services are considered. If the period is to be long, however, I hope that the Government will have amended the standards received from the commissioned body before they publish them for consultation.

<P>
By the time that the Government issued the draft proposals of the Centre for Policy on Ageing, they should have known that there were concerns about room sizes. The representatives of the National Care Homes Association who took part in the centre's work had resigned, at least in part because they were concerned about the centre's proposals. Concerns existed at the outset-before the Government went to consultation-but got lost. It would be interesting and useful if the Minister could say something about that situation, to help us to understand and to learn from the experience. There would clearly have been scope for providing at that time the qualifications that Ministers in the other place have now given. The industry and many others have welcomed those Ministers' assurances.

<P>
I said that price tags were attached to aspects of the standards in terms of dealing with the physical constraints of existing premises and with the retention and training of staff, yet the way in which providers are to be resourced to enable them to meet the required standards on training and qualifications is still not sufficiently clear. The way in which they will be able to provide the remuneration and other conditions sufficient to attract and retain qualified staff is also insufficiently clear. Such matters form a central part of securing the standards that care home owners fall over backwards to say that they want to see improved. It is essential that that point is clear.

<P>
I wanted to mention domiciliary care because we could dwell too much on ``Fit for the Future?'' and consider nothing else. I suspect that several hon. Members have received a letter that draws attention to a person's experience of domiciliary care services during the past 15 months. The letter is marked confidential so I will not name its author. It itemises a litany of service failures in the provision of services to a disabled young adult. the carer provided by the agency fell asleep on duty in the day time and did not understand the drug chart. We discussed medication this morning. The young person was left alone and there was an adequate supply of basic food in the flat.

<P>
The list includes a range of basic requirements that must urgently be provided for in standards. Increasing emphasis is rightly being placed on providing care at home through domiciliary agencies. Many local authorities are using brokerage to provide that service through private agencies. Some, but not all, of the agencies provide a good service. We are exposing vulnerable people to experiences such as those to which the letter refers. When does the Minister expect to publish the consultation for domiciliary care standards? What will the timetable be for consultation? Will it be of the same order as that for ``Fit for the Future?'', or will the consultation be shorter and more focused? What will the standards include? Will they deal with issues of quality? There is an overlap between issues of quality covered by ``Fit for the Future?'' and those that domiciliary agencies must consider. I hope that the Minister will be able to say one or two things on that subject.

<P>
I wish to conclude on the subject of managing transition. Some homes will undoubtedly not be viable in the next five to 10 years, becoming unable to meet the care standards that the Government have set out in ``Fit for the Future?'' and which many care purchasers will expect. It is important that the industry has some idea of the time scale to which the Government are working.

<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
If we are to have minimum standards, we must be clear about how to achieve the best standards. The star rating scheme is one mechanism for achieving higher standards than the minimum. The role of the social services departments of local authorities, as purchasers of care, will be important. Until now, the emphasis has not been on how they can buy quality but on how they can get the best possible price; they rely on the inspection and registration regime to guarantee quality. If the role of the local authority is that of purchaser-and, therefore, an advocate for the customer, the user of the service-clear standards and guidelines are needed by local authorities to develop the inspection and registration role that we are creating under the National Care Standards Commission.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman then agree with the point that I was labouring to make that, as well as minimum standards, we need to give providers a clear incentive to deliver above the minimum standards-a carrot as well as a stick?

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Absolutely. The emphasis has to be on the quality of service; quality measures are therefore central to what we are doing. In that sense, our concerns about inputs are right, but much that is good in ``Fit for the Future?'' is missed.

<P>
I end with a note of caution. The Government will not implement ``Fit for the Future?'' until the National Care Standards Commission is in place. As a result, for at least the next two years-in some cases, for far longer-many people living in care homes today will continue to suffer poor-quality service. I am not talking about room sizes, but things that go to the heart of their personal experience and their quality of life, such as whether they suffer bed sores, whether they can have a drink at the proper time and whether they can engage in social activities that keep them alert and active. Those things are central to a quality service, but all too often they are squeezed out as a result of low fees. We must put them in place for the future. I hope that the Minister will speak about the time scale for domiciliary care and set out his views on ``Fit for the Future?''.

<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I shall be brief, Mr. Illsley. I want to focus on two issues. First, I recognise that some care home owners are anxious about what has been happening. I have considerable sympathy for good care home owners, and I hope that they will be offered the reassurance that they seek.

<P>
Secondly, I am distressed that much of our debate has focused on such a narrow element. ``Fit for the Future?'' has 11 chapters on standards. I am surprised that they should be referred to as input, tick-box measures. I doubt whether those who read them would come to that conclusion. The rights of individual residents are not input, tick-box measures. Questions about the written policy, procedures and protocols of the establishment do not amount to that; there are clear questions about professionalism. The competence of the manager is not a tick-box issue. I would not reduce the daily activities and the social life of residents to a tick-box exercise. The standards are important. I am rather concerned that we should focus on so few of them.

<P>
The physical environmental element, on which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge concentrated, has 45 proposals, but he spoke only about three. We are debating the Care Standards Bill; it is about trying to raise standards. If we are going to focus only on the narrow elements that some people think could be a problem or may be inconvenient, driving standards up will be a struggle.

<P>
I was surprised by the logic that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge employed in his remarks about consultation. The Government could have been criticised if they had not consulted care home owners on the standards and such criticism would have been far in excess of anything that we have suffered. It would have been outrageous for the Government to have contemplated introducing the standards without consulting care home owners. Such an approach may have been acceptable in the past, but I do not think that it would be acceptable to the current Government. What would the market reaction have been if the consultation document had been sanitised and news had leaked that although the Government had published a paper containing one set of standards, the Centre for Policy on Ageing had applied another? I think that that would have been much more damaging to the market.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I do not think more damage would have been caused if the Government had conducted a damage-assessment exercise and had published the document with the clear statement that they were minded to set standards at level X in just one or two areas where market disruption was likely to be caused. Such an approach would not have caused problems.

<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is clearer than me about the market. He seems able to predict the matters that would have caused market disturbance, but as we are discussing a document that contains about 500 proposals, I do not know how he can speak with such certainty. I am making the point that it would have been just as damaging to the market if we had published a sanitised document and word had then leaked that there was another version. That would have been of no benefit to anybody.

<P>
We should concentrate on the wording of clause 22(4), which is the element of the Bill that should reassure us all, as it lists comprehensive circumstances in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The standards shall be taken into account.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the Bill was discussed in another place, the Minister there made it clear that that wording meant that there should be an element of discretion. Were the Government to accept the amendment, that element of discretion would be removed. I cannot see how any care home owner would think that such an action was in his or her interests.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon Gentleman raises an important issue and I intervene in the hope that the Minister may pick up on it. As I understand it, the Minister made it clear during the debate on clause 21 that regulations on the national minimum standards would also be made under that clause. Those regulations will take effect under that clause and the flexibility that is sought by the hon. Gentleman will not apply to them. If I have misunderstood that provision, I hope that the Minister will clarify it.

<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> It is not for me to anticipate my hon. Friend's response, but await it with interest.

<P>
Anybody who is listening to this debate could end up with the false impression that a massive number of costly standards are about to be introduced. That is not the case. We have all received evidence from organisations and individual care home owners throughout the country because they acknowledge that the vast majority of the standards are not costly. I think that it was Methodist Homes for the Aged which said that the vast majority of the standards would have little or no financial effect. It is important to recognise that it is possible to implement many of the standards without massive cost implications.

<P>
In the areas where there will be cost implications, I hope-as does my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood-that the Minister will look at the range of options available. We should not concentrate solely on a measure such as room size. It would be wrong to pass a room because it was of the specified size that was otherwise dark and dingy. We should not be too rigid in that respect.

<P>
We were offered an interesting notion by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who talked about incentives. I would like to see some form of financial incentive for improvements and a reasonable timetable for their introduction. It should be possible to have financial incentives for those who meet the standards and a differential rate for those who cannot achieve all of them, but are still providing a relatively good home. It does not automatically follow that differential rates cannot be established. One way to do that would be to have a slightly higher rate for those who attempt to achieve all the standards and a lower rate for those homes for whom that is not possible.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Amess </B>(Southend, West): This is an important issue for my constituency. I apologise that I have not been present throughout the debate. I might have to return somewhere else, as I am anxious that the debate on volunteering should benefit from my pearls of wisdom regarding the activities of Southend's Women's Institute.

<P>
As far as amendment No. 199 is concerned, I support my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. He is right in saying that Parliament should scrutinise the minimum standards through regulations. My constituency contains many residential and nursing homes. That fact in itself should be scrutinised. Few nursing homes exist nowadays. For financial reasons, they have become mainly residential homes, which look after our elderly people.

<P>
I recognise that life styles have changed dramatically. The way we care for our elderly people has also changed. In the past, in the east end of London, where I come from, gran and granddad, regardless of their situation, would end their days in the family home. Nowadays, we live our lives differently. More often than not, whether the elderly have children to look after them or not, we look to others to care for them. The Government make much of the fact that we have an ageing population and applaud that.

<P>
I listened carefully to the earlier remarks directed to my hon. Friends on minimum standards. The whole issue has been handled badly. I make no criticism of the Minister himself because he is genuine in his concerns. The health Bills of this Parliament contain an idea, but the details are not well worked out. The number of amendments tabled to Bills shows that. While all that is happening, people's lives are being affected. Much as we want minimum standards for the care homes where our ageing population live, it is the actual care that they receive that is paramount. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the care issue.

<P>
I have a sister who works in a care home in Derbyshire and next door to me we have a care home. I am not impressed when I enter a building to see chintzy curtains and wonderful beds; what matters is the staff who look after the residents. That is what I would consider if I wanted my mother to go into care.

<P>
My constituency has many residential and nursing homes that look after many people who are on their own. Those people are there not because they have been dumped by their relatives or neighbours, but because they are of such an advanced age that no one is left who knows them. A huge number of people in my constituency are over 100. Their home is the proprietor's home. I can think of many homes that look a little run-down. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge spoke of shared rooms and flock wallpaper and washbasins that could be better than they are. However, the care and love that the residents receive from the proprietors is first-class. My hon. Friend is right to say that we have been elected to represent our constituents' interests. It is not good enough to leave minimum standards up to others. We should have the opportunity to scrutinise them through regulation.

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I shall briefly share with the Minister one or two details on which I ask him to reflect. A number of changes may be necessary to homes. The space necessary to enable a home to compensate for under-sized rooms or communal facilities could be made available in one of two ways-through alterations to internal arrangements or by extending the home. The Government must apply common sense. Building work is disruptive. Three homes in the road in which I live are having alterations done at present. Indeed, the work might make it impossible for the residents to remain while it is carried out.

<P>
More significant in the longer term, the loss of capacity will inevitably place business viability at risk. As a consequence, alterations would not be an option for many homes. Labour Members had one or two digs at my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge when he was making his arguments. I hate using the word ``business'' in connection with such matters. However, we are discussing homes that need to make enough income not only to be viable but to make a little profit. I do not know how many Committee members have been engaged in business activities, but business is tough. Just as every member of the Committee is changing all the time either in mood or physically, so it is with residential home owners. When Labour Members meet residential home owners, I am sure that they express concern. In Committee, where we can improve a Bill before Report, Labour Members' role is robustly to defend the Government's actions. However, nobody should be afraid to speak out on behalf of their constituents about the details of the Bill.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if other members of the Committee do not support the amendment, they are telling their constituents, who have expressed concern, that they are entirely happy with the Government making the standards-and
any future amendments to them-without any parliamentary scrutiny? That is what they are saying in effect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Amess:</B> My hon. Friend makes a point, which if seized on would enflame Labour Members. What he says has some truth.

<P>
A home owner might seek to extend a building to recover decommissioned bed spaces and thus restore the original capacity, albeit without increasing revenue. However, he might find lenders unwilling to advance more capital on the grounds that their risk to exposure has been increased beyond tolerable limits. Many home owners in my constituency are highly concerned by that.

<P>
The Minister is right to argue that the process is emerging and that it is not possible to be specific, but I do not understand why it has taken quite so long, or why it is in the Government's interest, to leave home owners in an uncertain state of mind. The real issue is who is going to look after our elderly people. Some 56 beds are blocked in Southend. I do not intend to stray out of order-we all understand the arguments about bed blocking-but those people need to go somewhere. Southend council closed three of its six residential homes for various reasons. Essex county council is now tendering a number of homes. We parliamentarians are looking to the independent sector to care for our elderly people. We are asking it to take a huge risk. Therefore, we need to scrutinise the regulations.

<P>
The Government appear to take comfort in a belief that turnover in the home care market will be sufficient to take up the slack that is caused by the decommissioning of bed spaces. That analysis is wanting on two scores. First, the figures on which they have relied are historical and take no account of the recent market instability that has been prompted by ``Fit for the Future?'' Secondly, and more significantly, they do not provide a suitable basis on which to project behaviour.

<P>
Turnover can be defined in that context to reflect three factors: business transfers, home closures and new homes. The change of ownership involved in business transfers will have no impact on overall capacity. In a market that is dominated by local authority purchasing, there must be serious doubt about the willingness of entrepreneurs to invest in new homes. Unless new entrants compensate for the capacity lost as non-compliant homes close-and they must do so within the same broad time scale-community care will be in crisis.

<P>
I end with these thoughts. The national minimum standards in ``Fit for the Future?'' are having a destabilising effect on the care home market. There is definite evidence of that. Homes are closing. In the absence of a decision on the final shape of the standards, Ministers could argue that that is a perception and not a reality, but the fact remains that some operators are jumping before they are pushed while others are peering over the edge as they calculate the odds. Some of the second group are able to contemplate their future with equanimity. Those whose homes are situated on high-value sites know the development potential of their properties. The property boom has allowed homes in some areas to be sold for development at prices greater than their value as a going concern.

<P>
Every parliamentarian should be interested in people. The issue is all about people and how they are being looked after in care homes. Much as we may talk about bathrooms, showers and en-suites in the rules and regulations, there is often a huge gulf between what the inspector says to the home owners and the leeway for discretion.

<P>
I ask the Minister to reflect carefully on the minimum standards. Conservative Members do not want to support profiteers who expect elderly people to live in dirty, shabby homes. Nor do we not want people to have nice rooms in which wheelchairs can be pushed around, but the duties and unrealistic issues that care home owners are being made to consider are damaging. I hope that on Report the Minister will find a way to meet our concerns.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked what I would do if I were a care home owner faced with ``Fit for the Future?'' The answer is simple: I would do exactly what members of the Lancashire Care Association and the association of Lunesdale's registered homes have done. I would engage positively in the process and I would talk to my local MP about the issue and share with him not only my concern about aspects of the document but my commitment to the highest standards of good quality care. I would fully engage my MP in the process and introduce him to residents and their carers, and would talk about the way in which care operates in some of the excellent private residential homes in the constituency.

<P>
I was sorry to hear the words directed towards my esteemed neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, who has had tremendous concern for the well-being of older people, especially in residential care, before and since she arrived in the House. She has worked effectively in partnership with the private sector to achieve goals and to develop quality. Partnership does not imply, despite what the Opposition have suggested, that one lies down and is tickled by the private sector. It implies a good, solid relationship that is honest but sometimes critical. My hon. Friend has been assiduous in promoting good quality care and in ensuring that private home providers in her constituency and in mine have had good access to MPs and to Ministers.

<P>
The proof of the pudding is that the private sector in my constituency has used the opportunity and contact with my hon. Friend the Minister and others to promote pioneering ideas, such as the use of nursing homes for convalescent care, that indicate a tremendous future for that sector.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman told the Committee that he would engage fully with his Member of Parliament if he were a care home owner in Lancashire. Does that mean that he would support the recommendations and arguments in the briefing note for Lancashire MPs on ``Fit for the Future?'' circulated by the Lancashire Care Association?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I have not got that document in front of me so I cannot quote it. I would be happy to speak privately with the hon. Gentleman later if he wants to show it to me. The message that I have heard from care home providers accords with my experience of managing residential care in the public sector. Although physical standards are important, the home's overall care extends much further, into relationships, training, qualification and the ability of the staff to provide an all-round good programme of quality care. High quality care need not be dependent on physical standards, although they help. The issue is complex.

<P>
The message from the Opposition has been extremely negative-a recipe for inertia and a strategy for hopelessness. We had a recommendation that we should not aspire to good standards and should not try to improve standards for fear of what that might bring about; and further, that we should not recognise the good and developing market for good quality care. The private sector has a tremendous future. It will have a developing role, and the Government and the National Care Standards Commission will help in that process.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Frankly, from the way in which the consultation process has been handled-the Minister has been listening and talking to all sorts of people-we clearly have a Government who are willing to take on board arguments from all sides. I am confident that they will do their best for people living in residential care in nursing homes, and that will be good for the industry.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) expressed surprise that most of the comments on ``Fit for the Future?'' were about a few mainly physical, bricks-and-mortar issues. That is understandable. Some of the best submissions that I have received have been from areas that have a vigorous, assertive and aspirational inspection and registration unit. I share that with the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, and we are all grateful for her sending us the details of the star scheme. It shows that standards have improved in her part of the world, as they have in the rest of Lancashire.

<P>
Those improvements are the result of hard work; people have been persuaded, cajoled and at times bullied into improving their standards. A number of homes in my constituency have been shut by the registration unit; they were rightly driven out of business because they provided a poor service in poor buildings. People who have been working hard, perhaps for 10 years and more, who have invested to try to improve their standards and who have worked in conjunction and partnership with the registration unit and the purchasing arm of the local authority, feel extraordinarily anxious when the imposition of an extra tier is suggested-not of regulation but of standards that may seem arbitrary.

<P>
It is right that some standards should be statutory. It has been quite difficult for registration units to keep their registration functions separate from their training and advisory functions, Because they are all wrapped up in the same department, it would be quite useful to have a regional registration unit dealing at arm's length with the statutory standards that we all support. That would not do away with the need for flexible purchasing. Will the Minister accept a solution that would make the registration standards statutory? The standards would therefore be laid before Parliament, as suggested in amendment No. 199. The Government could issue guidelines to purchasing and commissioning authorities and to members of the general public who wanted to buy care on their own behalf or on behalf of a relative, but allow a degree of discretion in that.

<P>
I recently visited an excellent home in my constituency in which the most prized room is the garden room. It is only 8.5 sq m, but the room overlooks the garden, and there is a waiting list for it. I hope that those people will be waiting for a great deal longer, because I have been looking after the old lady who lives there for many years. I would hate that lady to be moved out because of Government regulation. A degree of flexibility is needed. We have heard about transfer arrangements, and so on. I urge the Minister to adopt a system of rigorously enforced regulations for quality standards, but to allow a degree of discretion of individual purchasing authorities, care managers and carers-and, indeed, for patients and residents.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> This has been a long debate, but an important one. The amendment goes to the heart of the Bill. To all intents and purposes, it would do away with the concept of national minimum standards, which would become regulations. I shall say whether I think that that is advisable. However, I first congratulate my hon. Friends who have made important contributions to the debate. We also witnessed the first Back-Bench contribution from the Opposition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We can make it take longer if that is what the Minister wants.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman can decide to do that if he wants to.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) said something with which I absolutely agree; this debate is about people. National minimum standards will serve the public interest, and it is imperative that the Committee appreciates that. Judging from some of the tortuous arguments that we heard from the Opposition, especially some Conservative Members, I doubt whether they appreciate that.

<P>
I did not quite see the point of the speech made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. He asked several questions, to which I want to respond, but I am none the wiser about the Liberal Democrat position on these matters, as I am none the wiser about the Conservative position. Many of my hon. Friends were left in some confusion about whether Conservative Members support the principle of national minimum standards for care homes. That is an important issue, which the debate has usefully served to highlight. We believe that there is a role for national minimum standards and regulations in the area, and I shall say how we intend to deliver that.

<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked about the transitional period before the regulations take effect. We have always tried to make it clear that a realistic time scale will be set for implementing those standards. Care home owners will have several years in which to make any adjustments that might be necessary as a result of adoption of the new standards, but I am not in a position to make an announcement about the details of those standards. The hon. member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked to to state the minimum room size and to say what other standards might be, but I cannot do that today because that work has not been completed. I made it clear earlier that we are keen for the standards to be realistic and affordable, so a transitional time scale is necessary. I also made it clear that the reason why we are not in a position to give those details is that they are still being discussed with the various interested parties.

<P>
I hear a sharp intake of breath from the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge but, given that the issue is central to the regulatory arrangements, it is important that we should try to build a consensus. That consensus is worth constructing, so I am not apologising to the hon. Gentleman or to the hon. Member for Southend, West, who told me to get on with it. We need to get this right. Many of my hon. Friends made the fair point that probably 90 per cent. of the ``Fit for the Future?'' standards raised little concern in the care home sector. Most concerns focus on those standards that have an impact on the physical layout of a care home. We should not make the mistake that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made in saying that the entire ``Fit for the Future?'' exercise had plunged the industry into chaos. That is a gross exaggeration. We shall check the Official Report to see what he said.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> No, I said it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Oh, he said it. Well, that is not right because the responses to the consultation document confirmed strong support for the vast majority of ``Fit for the Future?'' proposals and the national minimum standards. The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the concerns that many people have expressed about physical standards, to which the hon. Member for Southend, West also referred. In fact, I think that he read out most of the Hampshire Care Association's briefing during his speech. I am sure that that will go down very well with his constituents. He has certainly moved on from Basildon.

<P>
On the issue of room standards, size and layout, I hope that hon. Members found the demonstration over in the park helpful in considering the various options. We wrote to Committee members earlier in the week setting out some of the issues that had arisen during the consultation exercise, as well as some of the options suggested by the consultees for resolving certain issues. We are actively considering all those options. Although I would be first to accept that that is difficult to achieve, we want a system that affords us the benefits of a consistent set of standards, but with a flexible system of regulation and enforcement that will avoid some of the pitfalls to which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and many of my hon. Friends have drawn attention. We want a set of minimum standards, but we do not want an inflexible straitjacket. That is the best way to describe what we are trying to do.

<P>
We have tried to strike that balance in clause 22. We need the benefits of clear, consistent national requirements, but we need a flexible system of enforcement. That is the balance achieved between clauses 21 and 22, which provide for a regulation-making power buttressed by national minimum standards. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked me to ensure that the House would have the opportunity to consider the national minimum standards. We will ensure that, when the House discusses the regulations, it will be able to examine the set of national minimum standards. That will certainly be so for the ``Fit for the Future?'' national standards, which we hope to publish later this summer. Of course, the House will have an opportunity to discuss the regulations several months later.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that point. I was reassured when he said this morning that the standards would be published at the same time or earlier than the draft regulations. My concern is whether discussion of the substance of the standards will be in order in a Delegated Legislation Standing Committee debate. Will the Minister do whatever he can to facilitate discussion of the substance of the standards, as well as the regulations, in that Committee?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is a tempting invitation, but I do not want to find myself suggesting to the Chairman of the Committee what I think is in order; that is for the Chairman to decide. It should be clear from what I have said-I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands this from his reading of the Bill-that the regulations will give effect to the standards. I strongly believe that the national minimum standards should be discussed in that context. The regulations do not exist in a vacuum. They are connected almost umbilically to the national minimum standard and that would be the place and time to have a debate about them in terms of parliamentary scrutiny over the whole process.

<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friends for their strongly endorsing the principle underlying the concept of national minimum standards and the benefits that those standards will bring to the public and-we should not overlook this-good care home owners, who have nothing to fear from the national minimum standards that we are developing. The standards will be designed to support the current trends that are apparent to everyone who has studied the care home sector and what has been happening in the industry over the past few years.
<P>
 
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
 The standards will support consumer preference and consumer choice, which are already being
clearly exercised, especially for single-bedded accommodation. We are not trying to take the industry in some radical new direction in which customers, contractors and providers are not already heading. This is a supportive exercise. It is not an exercise to take the industry into some cul-de-sac where the loser is the public. This whole exercise has been driven by the public interest and is not contrary to it.

<P>
I hope that I have reassured the industry about its genuine concerns. I have emphasised repeatedly the importance of consensus in reaching an agreement, especially on physical standards. I am an optimist. I think that we will be able to reach that consensus, although it might not be broad enough to include the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. His remarks might have led him and his party into a place where they will find themselves with very few friends in this debate. It is very important that we support good care home owners, good care home providers and the public.

<P>
The general position of the Government is to provide a set of affordable, realistic standards that can command a broad measure of consensus and support. The hon. Gentleman asked me a number of questions specifically about the consultation exercise, as did the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southend, West chastised us for the delay in coming to a decision about the standards. It might be worth reminding the hon. Gentleman, who sadly is not here although I understand why he cannot be, that we extended the consultation period, partly as a result of some difficulties in distributing the documents-I will not pretend that we did not have problems; we did-and partly because of the unprecedented demand for them. We produced 10,000 copies of the document. With the exception of the national plan, it proved to be one of the largest public consultations that we have ever attempted in the Department. It was a very extensive operation. We had more than 1,000 specific responses, and in addition we had nearly 40,000 hits on the website that we set up specifically to facilitate the consultation process.

<P>
We extended the consultation period because of those concerns and because of what care home owners were saying to us about the need for more time for it. We now have to plough our way through 1,200 or so responses, 200 of which are from the regulatory bodies and many, many hundreds from care home owners. We have a responsibility to get this right, and we are trying to do so as quickly as possible. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that we need to end the uncertainty, and that is what the Government will do very shortly in this and in other areas involving the national minimum standards.

<P>
When we debated the Bill on Second Reading, I said that all my hon. Friends could vote for it in the knowledge that they were voting in the public interest and in the interests of their constituents. I hope that they have been reassured and are convinced that that remains the case-that we are putting the public interest first and foremost. I think we can proceed secure in the knowledge that we can build a proper consensus about what those standards will be.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred repeatedly to the 10 sq m standard that was proposed in ``Fit for the Future?''. His amendment would have the consequence of making sure that we had very little discretion about how some of those standards could be developed. His amendment would move all the standards directly into the regulations
and the opportunity for flexibility over their implementation could be compromised. I will put it higher than that. I am not saying that it would be absolutely compromised, because of course it would depend on how the regulations were drafted. However, I think it would be much harder to get the flexibility that I certainly want about the implementation of a room size standard if we were to take his advice and put all of that into the regulations. I think that there is a way of constructing a solution that will protect the public and advance the public interest without imposing a set of unrealistic and unreasonable financial consequences. The best way of achieving that is to maintain the distinction between regulations and the national minimum standards.

<P>
The 10 sq m standard has not popped up out of thin air. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of its background. The standard for residential care homes has been with us for nearly 30 years, so there should be no surprise that it has been floated as a possible physical standard in the future.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> While the Minister is on the subject of the minimum room size, will he take the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the definition of ``usable'' space? It has become less clear to me as a result of seeing the plans that were on the wall during our visit to the Department of Health at lunchtime.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am happy to do that and will come to that point. The 10 sq m standard, which was floated as a possible room size standard in ``Fit for the Future?'', has been out and about in the industry for 30 years, but it has never been enforced as a national standard. We have to come to terms with that.

<P>
On the calculation of the 10 sq m standard and the definition of usable floor space, the hon. Gentleman said that it came as a surprise to him to see some references to them at the exhibition today. He might like to go back and have a look at ``Fit for the Future?''. In appendix A, the Centre for Policy on Ageing provided a definition of what usable floor space should constitute and how it should be calculated. The definition attracted very little comment in the consultation process. I might be able to write to him about that if there are any specific concerns as I do not want to mislead him or the Committee. However, I emphasise that the Government have not come to a decision about that definition, which was floated as a possible definition of how usable floor space could be calculated. We will need to do that when we clarify the physical standard in relation to room sizes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have just looked at the definition in appendix A. The problem is that the drawings that were on display today showed the area swept by a door-both the door to an en-suite bathroom and the door to the room-as being excluded from the usable space. It is not clear from the definition in appendix A that that was so. I think that people in the industry who have been looking at the possible figure-this will have an impact whether the figure is 10, 9 or 11 sq m-were not aware that it was intended to exclude the swept area of door space from the usable space.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not in a position to say whether the care home industry was aware of that possible problem. The definition in appendix A makes it explicit that it could include that. The definition refers to space in a resident's room that is accessible to the resident for sitting, sleeping and arranging furniture in addition to chairs and bed. It excludes space that is rendered inaccessible by, for example, the positioning of doors. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I do not think that there is any confusion about the scope of the definition. I accept that it may not have been picked up as an issue, but we can explore that. Let me make it clear, however, that we are not going to have a definition that is impractical or silly. We will look very carefully at all those issues because they have implications for the standard itself.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The Minister just said that this is an issue that we can explore. In ``we'', does he include Parliament? This would help me a great deal to know that the amendment be pressed to a Division. If we receive an undertaking from the Government that such detail will be open to debate on the regulations, we clearly do not need the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I certainly was not using the royal ``we''. There will be an opportunity to involve hon. Members in that discussion. I have already spoken about where and how that could take place. I absolutely deny that we are developing the standards in a manner that amounts effectively to holding up two fingers to Members of Parliament. In trying to be open and inclusive we have held a huge consultation exercise and we have no intention at this late stage of excluding Members of Parliament from that process.

<P>
This has been a long debate. I am sorry that I am not in a position to answer some of the specific questions put to me by hon. Members about the exact range and scope of the national minimum standards. I hope that I have left my hon. Friends in no doubt that we should not accept the amendment, but they can be confident that we shall continue to take their concerns into account, with the public interest clearly in mind.

<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I shall be brief in summarising the debate. The Minister started by saying that the amendment would do away with national minimum standards altogether because I required them to be enshrined in regulations. He later argued that the standards will be put into effect by regulations. There is a tension there. We have not fully explored this, but amendment No. 204 will provide an opportunity to clarify the relationship between sections 21 and 22. I will leave that argument until then.

<P>
Nothing that I said should be read as suggesting that we oppose the principle of minimum standards. I said nothing to that effect. I do not accept the Minister's assertion that I have moved myself into a place where I shall not want to be. We accept the need for minimum standards, and that they must be realistic. Somebody must pay for them, however, and they must be accompanied by proper incentives to exceed the minimum standards.

<P>
The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre described my position as a recipe for inertia. I do not recognise the world in which he lives. What is creating inertia around residential care and nursing home sectors at the moment is the wait for an announcement from the Government. The Minister told us earlier that he hoped to be able to make an announcement when we reached this part of the Bill. I understand that he is not able to do so, and I agree with him that consensus is worth striving for, but he has failed today to lift the blight that hangs over the industry. Having missed the opportunity provided by clause 22, we shall have to wait until the commission is up and running and the regulations laid before we hear what are the key standards. We need a clear and unambiguous announcement as soon as the Minister can make it. That will be of great use and importance to everybody in the industry.

<P>
I am concerned about the confusion that seems to have arisen over the definition of usable space. It may or may not be the case that those responding to consultation have interpreted the definition in the appendix differently. My understanding is that people did not take it to exclude the swept area of door space. From a cursory glance it is not clear to me that the floor layout models that the Minister showed us today were based on the exclusion of that area. I should be grateful if he could look into that and let me know.

<P>
The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre said that the Government have taken on board comments from all sides. That may be true, but we will not know it until the Minister gives us his final decision. The Minister himself said that good care home owners have nothing to fear, but we only have his word for that. Until he finally announces the standards, all that the industry will have to work on is what is contained in ``Fit for the Future?''

<P>
In his closing remarks the Minister did not respond in any way to the criticisms that have been levelled at the process itself, as opposed to the standards and the end product. I do not expect him to reply today because we are getting towards the end of the time available, but has the Minister learned anything from this process that will lead him to approach it differently when considering other standards? I understand that standards are currently being developed in relation to younger people with disabilities and that they will also involve physical room-size recommendations. Will he choose to go about the process differently in relation to those and other standards to avoid creating the sort of uncertainties that we have been discussing today among providers in the market and, indeed, among residents?

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I too can do arithmetic, so I am conscious that the tide is against me, but the issue is of great importance to us and many others. The thought that minimum standards affecting people's livelihood and future will be determined without the opportunity for proper further parliamentary scrutiny gives me no choice but to divide the Committee.
