Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): Good morning,
Mr. Martlew, and welcome back to the
Chair.</div><a name="10012112000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
enjoyed the Minister&#146;s explanatory remarks, which weaved through
the issue of urban, suburban or otherwise with regard to SUDS. I did
not find his clarification entirely convincing. Amendments 149, 150 and
18, and new clause 12 are extremely important. We submitted the
proposal on the Scottish definition for the purposes of debate and it
was not as convincing as the
others.</div><a name="10012112000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have received a number of submissions from across the industry. The
consensus is that we have to get the definition right in clause 32 and
schedule 3. A number of water companies, the water industry and the
Consumer Council for Water are convinced that we need a proper
definition. The terms &#147;sustainable drainage systems&#148; and
&#147;sustainable urban drainage systems&#148; are interchangeable.
As I mentioned at the outset, they were called SUDS originally because
they tended to be in urban
areas.</div><a name="10012112000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to say to the Minister that we need to understand that it
is particularly drainage systems that might pass into the sewerage
system that are of concern with regard to later clauses and amendments,
so that we can be sure that we fulfil Pitt&#146;s recommendation of
ending the automatic right to connect. We will therefore press the
Minister on amendments 149 and 150 and new clause 12. We have had a
good rehearsal of the remarks. He might be minded to accept the
proposals. I do not know whether there has been a change in his
position after two days of reflection, but that would be most welcome.
If not, we will press the proposals to the
vote.</div><a name="10012112000027"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000314"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am glad to move this little group of
amendments relating to private drains and sewers. Is the Minister
minded to share with the Committee his letter to me dated 30 December
2009 in which he responded to a constituency case about the transfer of
private sewers? I want to refer to certain parts of that letter, the
particulars of which will be of interest to the
Committee.</div><a name="10012112000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the letter the Minister confirmed that on 15 December 2008 the
Government announced that the transfer of all private sewers and
lateral drains linked to the public sewerage system would take place
from 2011. He also said that the transfer was the only comprehensive
solution to the range of problems presented by private sewers. We know
from the floods in 2007 and previously, that owners are often not made
aware of their liability when buying a property, and think it unfair
when they end up being held responsible for pipework outside their
property boundaries, often in neighbours&#146; gardens or under
highways.</div><a name="10012112000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Private
sewer and lateral drain owners are well in the majority of sewerage
bill payers. The Minister stated in his letter that the Government have
always been mindful of the fact that transfer will lead to an increase
in customers&#146; sewerage bills, but that customer research has
indicated firm support for the transfer. I want to place on the record
our support for the
transfer.</div><a name="10012112000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that about 180,000 km of private sewers and lateral
drains connected to the public network benefit from no effective
operational regime. He said that the transfer will provide a better
planned and more integrated management of the wider sewerage network.
What work have the Government undertaken, and what stage has it
reached, to enable them to state definitively where the kilometres of
private sewers and lateral drains are, and whether they have identified
ownership? In the context of the schedule, and particularly this small
group of amendments, such information is extremely important,
especially since the floods of 2007. I know from the many visits that
both I and other hon. Members made what a huge problem this is. The
Government have now had sufficient time to be able to tell us
definitively where the private sewers and lateral drains are, how many
there are, who owns them and who has been maintaining
them.</div><a name="10012112000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister also states in his letter that the Government&#146;s ongoing
work resulted in a further consultation in July 2007, which
followed an announcement in February of that year that the Government
were proceeding with the transfer. The summary response was published
in July 2008. The Minister also states that subject to approval by
Parliament of regulations to effect transfer, which will determine the
full extent of what is covered, the proposed transfer will apply to all
private sewers and lateral drains that drain into the public network,
including pumping stations and associated rising mains.</div>
<a name="10012112000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">When will the
guidance be published? If the transfer is to take place next year, the
guidance must be published this year. It would be immensely helpful if
the Minister could give us a definitive month rather than just loosely
saying spring, summer or
autumn.</div><a name="10012112000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again
let me underscore the fact that we and the local authorities estimate
that the Government&#146;s figures are completely wrong in relation
to other parts of the Bill. For example, the Minister believes that the
local government resources will be funded by the sale of the drains. If
the Minister has done the work that the Government said that they would
do, he must accept that most of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>ownership lies outwith the ownership of local authorities. That is a
very serious point and goes to the heart of the resource and funding of
other significant parts of the Bill. For that purpose, amendment 30
leaves out &#147;consult&#148; and insists that we proceed to
instigate and publish the review of independent persons to establish
the costs incurred by local authorities in maintaining private sewers
before the schedule is commenced. That will require the Minister to put
together an independent panel to review the current costs to local
authorities of maintaining private sewers, and have regard to their
findings before the clause commences. The reason why that is so
important is that the vast majority of such sewers do not fall within
the ownership of local authorities, which means that the
Government&#146;s sums are plainly wrong, and go to the core of the
fact that local government authorities will not have the money from
their existing budgets to implement core parts of the
Bill.</div><a name="10012112000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Local Government Association rejects the assumptions on the cost of
private sewers and supports this amendment, which requires the Minister
to review the current expenditure by local authorities on the
maintenance of private sewers before the schedule is brought into
action.</div> <a name="10012112000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has stated that
local authorities adopting the maintenance of SUDS will be funded in
part through this transfer of private sewers to water sewerage
companies, thereby alleviating local authorities of the responsibility
for investigating and dealing with potential problems. I should like to
put it on the record that the Local Government Association rejects the
assumption on the costs of private sewers. In its view, the assumptions
used by the Department are based on data that is seven years out of
date and is garnered from only 12 per cent. of local authorities.
Therefore, it does not bear out that the local authorities will have
anything like the resources that they need to implement other parts of
the
Bill.</div><a name="10012112000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
in its assumptions, the Department is creating fundamental weaknesses
in the impact assessments and we press the Government urgently to
review them.</div>
<a name="10012112000245"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="10012112000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
31 requires the Minister to consult persons affected by schedule 3 and
publish a report setting out how the adoption and maintenance of
drainage systems is to be funded in the long term before the schedule
is commenced. The reason for the amendment is that the LGA believes,
again, that the model for charging for sustainable urban drainage
systems is unfair. DEFRA has stated that the model is time limited and
will, in any event, need to be revisited in eight years&#146; time.
Therefore, it is important that the issue is addressed now, not in
eight years&#146; time.</div>
<a name="10012112000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further, the
Bill will create an unfair system for charging for SUDS, which will
mean that people connected on SUDS will not pay the drainage charges.
That clearly does not follow the &#147;polluter pays&#148;
principle to which we are wedded and, I believe, the Government are
also firmly attached, and will mean that some residents in the area
will be paying drainage while others will not. That must be dealt with.
Local government authorities  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div>believe that all properties should pay a drainage charge, including
those that are drained into sustainable urban drains. That would not be
a new burden on property owners because those connected on mains
drainage already pay a charge as part of their water
bill.</div><a name="10012112000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are seeking to ensure that sustainable funding for sustainable urban
drainage systems is in place from the commencement of schedule 3 coming
in effect. Without the amendment, the Government run the risk of
undermining the implementation of SUDS across the country, because
local authorities will legitimately be concerned about simply not
having the income stream necessary to maintain these urban drainage
systems in the future. The LGA is working with experts on alternative
systems and will be happy to meet and work with the Department to
create a sustainable funding
model.</div><a name="10012112000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 11 relates to the fact that it would be pertinent at this time
for the Environment Agency to establish a pilot scheme with the aim of
auditing all private drains and sewers, assessing their condition,
estimating the likely cost of adopting all private drains and sewers in
2009 and estimating the likely cost on customers&#146; bills. I hope
that the Minister will have some regard to the concerns of many of
those points and that he will look favourably on my remarks. As I said
at the outset, without these amendments, it is simply impossible for us
to make good the recommendations contained in the Pitt
report.</div><a name="10012112000087"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000315"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I shall speak briefly to the amendments.
Amendment 30 reflects a genuine concern of the LGA and others. Benefits
that are likely to accrue from a transfer of responsibilities have not
been adequately calculated. As the hon. Member for Vale of York rightly
pointed out, that has huge implications for whether the other
responsibilities given to lead local authorities with responsibility
for flood risk management in other parts of the Bill are financial
sustainable. An important issue has been raised and we are happy to
support amendment
30.</div><a name="10012112000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
31 addresses the important issue of how to support the adoption of
sustainable drainage systems. I am rather less keen on that measure,
because it seems to introduce the possibility of challenge to that
adoption on grounds of inadequate consultation. I suspect that rather
than speeding up the introduction of sustainable drainage systems,
which I think we all want, the amendment might end up sinking them into
the mud, so I am rather less keen on
it.</div><a name="10012112000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 11 goes much too far. It suggests pilot schemes for something
that has already been assessed and for which there is already an impact
assessment. The answer is that it will add up to &#163;12 per
household bill per annum to the cost of water bills, as I have
mentioned in the House several times. We could go over that matter
again, but I am not sure that dealing with it is the
Government&#146;s job either. That is Ofwat&#146;s job, because it
is responsible for the business plans of the water companies and the
pricing regime that follows from them. I am not always a huge fan of
Ofwat, but on this occasion we should let it get on with its
job.</div><a name="10012112000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012112000316"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): Briefly, following
on from the comments of the hon. Member for Cheltenham and the
proposals made by my hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>Friend the Member for Vale of York, I think it is important that we
address the issue of whether we assess the cost or the condition. They
could be two different things, but I certainly think that conditions
need to be
assessed.</div><a name="10012112000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know from experience about the troubles that were caused in Tewkesbury
because of inadequate drains and sewers, whether public or private. The
realisation does not come to anyone until there is heavy rainfall,
because drains and sewers can often cope with ordinary rainfall and
usage, but when we get excessive rainfall the problems literally start
to
surface.</div><a name="10012112000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
keep hearing how the rainfall in 2007 was a 1-in-100 years, 1-in-500
years or 1-in-1,000 years event and so on, but I had calls from my
constituency just yesterday about flooding taking place&#151;the
rivers are coming up and the roads are being flooded. That will not
make the national news because it happens
frequently.</div><a name="10012112000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether
new clause 11 is perfectly worded or not, I think that we have to have
some system for assessing the condition of drains and sewers. It was
one of Pitt&#146;s biggest concerns that we not only assess who owns
and is responsible for such waterways but that something is done about
them, for the reasons that I
gave.</div><a name="10012112000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I also ask the Minister a question? The work of internal drainage
boards is important, as we have heard, but often their remit is limited
through geography. In my constituency, they can work west but not east
of the Severn, yet many villages east of the Severn in my constituency
are subject to flooding and need work carried out. The IDB might well
want to carry out the work itself but is not permitted to do so because
of what might be considered artificial boundaries. Has the Minister
given any consideration to flexibility in that
respect?</div><a name="10012112000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000317"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I forgot to mention earlier that it is
very good to serve under your stewardship, Mr. Martlew, as
we head for the final hurdles of the Committee. I am content that the
hon. Member for Vale of York has put on the record the letter in
respect of her constituent&#151;it refers to our consistent position
on the transfer of sewers&#151;and her clear support for the
transfer.</div><a name="10012112000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
crux of the amendments is funding, plus some other aspects. Let me turn
directly to the amendments. The hon. Members for Vale of York and for
Upminster tabled amendment 30, which would change paragraph
5(4) of schedule 3 and require the Minister to</div>
<a name="10012112000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;instigate,
publish and have regard to a review undertaken by a panel of
independent persons pertaining to the costs currently incurred by local
authorities in maintaining private
sewers&#148;</div><a name="10012112000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">before
the sustainable drainage proposals in the schedule are
commenced.</div><a name="10012112000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Members also tabled amendment 31, which proposes that the Minister
must consult those persons who are likely to be affected by the
arrangements for sustainable drainage set out in the schedule,
and</div>
<a name="10012112000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;publish a
report detailing how the adoption and maintenance of drainage systems
is to be funded before the Schedule is
commenced.&#148;</div><a name="10012112000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Funding
matters relating to schedule 3 have already been discussed at length
during scrutiny of the Bill. For a record of those detailed
discussions, I refer members of the Committee to columns 3, 172 to 176,
and 179 to 181 of the <i class="I">Hansard</i> record of the Committee&#146;s
sittings. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>As a result, I do not intend to take the Committee&#146;s time to
reiterate the debate in full. However, I will bring hon. Members up to
date.</div><a name="10012112000232"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I
am pleased to report that my officials have had discussions with the
LGA since our earlier sittings&#151;in the past week&#151;to
explore how a formal arrangement between us might work. It could
include, for example, commissioning joint evidence-gathering, keeping
under review the resource implications of the Bill, and overseeing and
advising on training and capacity issues more generally. We have no
agreement as yet, but the LGA seems to be open to the proposal, and I
shall be writing to Councillor Porter at the LGA shortly to set out
what I hope will be a sensible
approach.</div><a name="10012112000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have already made clear, the duty to adopt SuDS will be funded in
full one way or another. We undertake to publish a clear way forward
that takes account of circumstances faced by local authorities and
developers in time for implementation of the Bill&#146;s provisions
so that measures are in place to enable local authorities to implement
SuDS in full, and in full certainty that there will be no gap in
funding.</div>
<a name="10012112000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having made
the commitment to ensure that SuDS maintenance is funded, the
Government will consult appropriately if legislation is required to
deliver a funding mechanism. The Government have also made it clear
that we will keep the costs and assumptions implied by the Bill and by
the transfer of private sewers under review.</div>
<a name="10012112000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
problem with amendment 30. I am sure that it is unintentional, but the
amendment would remove the requirement for the Minister to consult
before publishing national standards for sustainable drainage systems.
The national standards will set out how SuDS must be designed,
constructed, operated and maintained. I am sure that the hon. Members
for Vale of York and for Upminster would agree that the national
standards document will be key to achieving the delivery and effective
operation of SuDS, so consultation before they are published, whether
on commencement or when they are revised in future, is critical. We do
not wish to lose that important provision.</div>
<a name="10012112000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012112000318"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): Will the national
standards document explain clearly how disputes over responsibility and
ownership will be settled, because that is crucial to how the whole
operation will go
forward?</div><a name="10012112000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000319"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> My hon. Friend raises a good point, which
I will turn to in a moment after I finish my
comments.</div><a name="10012112000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 11 would place the Environment Agency under a duty to establish
a pilot scheme to ascertain the extent and condition of the existing
private sewers and drains. The Government have previously considered
whether to establish pilot schemes for the proposed transfer of private
sewers and lateral drains. DEFRA&#146;s July 2007 consultation paper
on implementation options for the transfer of private sewers sought
views on the advantages of running pilot schemes, in the light of the
challenge of finding areas that would be usefully representative,
either of individual water and sewerage companies&#146; areas or
nationally.</div>
<a name="10012112000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofwat also
considered that in order to yield meaningful results a pilot would need
to run for a significant length of time&#151;approximately three
years. Respondents to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>consultation did not feel that pilots would be of benefit, and the
stakeholder steering group assisting DEFRA&#146;s review of private
sewers agreed. The Environment Agency has no direct responsibility for
private sewers, so estimating the cost of transfer would fall to the
water and sewerage companies and the independent economic regulator,
Ofwat. The latest estimate from UK Water Industry Research indicates
that the cost of a full mapping and surveying exercise to ascertain the
extent and condition of private sewers would be in excess of &#163;1
billion. Even undertaking pilot schemes would be proportionately
extremely expensive, so I do not accept that the pilots are likely to
yield sufficiently useful information to warrant the cost, and they
would lead to a delay in bringing the benefits of transfer to
householders, which we all want to see.</div>
<a name="10012112000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 11
would duplicate work that has already been carried out. Costs and
benefits have been extensively considered by the companies and reviewed
by Ofwat, the relevant and competent authority. As the hon. Member for
Cheltenham said, the cost estimates were set out in the impact
assessment that accompanied the Government&#146;s announcement on 15
December 2008 of our decision to proceed with transfer: more than
&#163;1 billion in one-off capital costs and an average annual
expenditure of &#163;133 million on operating
costs.</div>
<a name="10012112000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
assessment also stated Ofwat&#146;s latest estimate for the impact on
customers&#146; bills: in the range of &#163;4 to
&#163;12 a year. However, as we all know, we are faced
with constituents who unexpectedly have bills of several thousand
pounds landing on their doorsteps when crumbling old systems collapse.
An updated impact assessment will accompany our consultation on the
regulation for transfer when they are published.</div>
<a name="10012112000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will turn
to the additional points raised on where the private sewers are. All
sewers not declared as public are private sewers by default, according
to the current mapping. As I mentioned, the locating and mapping of
those would cost about &#163;1 billion, which we do not consider
would be cost-effective. It would also delay the transfer, which we
need to get on with.</div>
<a name="10012112000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
when the transfer will take place. The transfer of private sewers will
happen by regulation, as we have said, rather than through the Bill.
The exact date of transfer will be specified in the regulation, which
will be by affirmative resolution, so we must first consult on them and
bring them before Parliament for approval. The date will be stipulated
in the regulations.</div>
<a name="10012112000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">A transfer
will not take place before 2011. We have to allow the water industry as
a whole to make preparations for the changes that will arise. For
example, water and sewerage companies need to make contractual
arrangements to meet the increased work load demands and drainage
contractors will need to adjust business plans in light of the changes
that the transfer will bring. DEFRA is currently preparing
consultations on the regulation for publication in the next couple of
months.</div><a name="10012112000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are addressing the funding needs for SuDS now, as I said in the public
evidence session. In respect of the options for long-term funding of
SuDS maintenance, there are some obvious candidates, but none of them
is so straightforward that we can decide right now,
straight  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>away, without proper further consideration. For example, there could be
commuted sums on developers or direct charges on householders
benefiting from the SuDS, who can expect as a result of those to pay a
reduced water bill depending on any connection to the sewer. Charges
could be collected either by the local authority or as part of water
bills or we could leave it with taxpayers in general to fund, through
specific grants to local authorities. But we will make the position
clear before the legislation commences, rather than just grabbing
something now and bolting it on to the
Bill.</div><a name="10012112000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stroud asked whether the national standards
for SuDS would take into account ways of managing disputes. If there is
a dispute over an authority&#146;s refusal to approve a SuDS that is
needed to allow construction work to begin on a development, there are
appeal mechanisms in the Bill for such a situation. I can assure him
that that is so. There are also appeal mechanisms for decisions to
adopt
SuDS.</div><a name="10012112000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those assurances, I ask the hon. Member for Vale of York to consider
asking leave to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="10012112000246"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="10012112000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000320"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am amazed that the Minister thinks that those
were assurances. I welcome the return to the Committee of the hon.
Member for Stroud; I found his point interesting and the Minister
addressed it in some measure, although his remarks otherwise were short
of what we were hoping for. I thought they were vague in the extreme on
how the charges will be imposed: that is what Committee members are
hearing in constituency correspondence throughout the
country.</div><a name="10012112000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury does his constituency down.
Tewkesbury and York were again the national news today owing to their
being at risk of flooding because of the thaw: they are never far from
our
thoughts.</div><a name="10012112000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has not given us any reassurance on how SuDS maintenance will
be charged. That is unacceptable one year before the new arrangements
are to come into place. In respect of when the guidance will be

vague and
amorphous.</div><a name="10012112000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
contradict the Minister&#146;s statement that we do not wish to
consult. The point is that we have no confidence in the ministerial
Department doing the consultation. He failed to respond on where it is
with the audit at present and how many qualities there are. We wish to
see an independent panel take up the cudgels for that purpose. So I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000339"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I hope that the amendment is clear and
understandable, and that it will attract support from the Minister and
the Committee. It relates to earlier discussions we have
had.</div><a name="10012112000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of Drainage Authorities is concerned by the definitions in
the Bill. I declare an interest as the vice-president of the ADA. The
ADA does not believe that the Minister intends the sustainable drainage
provisions to include extensive hydrological systems, such as internal
drainage systems. This is a technical, helpful amendment that is
intended to assist the Committee in considering whether the exemption
should apply to all watercourses, natural or not, and whether a more
refined definition should be sought that utilises the terminology of
&#147;heavily modified&#148; and &#147;artificial&#148; water
bodies used in the water framework directive. The wording in the
amendment
is:</div><a name="10012112000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Internal
Drainage Boards, if the approving body thinks that the drainage system
may directly or indirectly involve the discharge of water into an
Internal Drainage
District.&#148;</div><a name="10012112000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would fulfil the
purpose.</div><a name="10012112000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
1(1) of schedule 3 defines a drainage system as
any</div><a name="10012112000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;structure

rainwater&#148;</div><a name="10012112000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">except
for &#147;a public sewer&#148; or &#147;a natural
watercourse&#148;. Although natural watercourse is defined as
&#147;a river or stream&#148;, it is still governed by the word
&#147;natural&#148;. The difficulty is that many watercourses in
lowland areas of England and Wales are not natural, but engineered
channels created by man. Under the water framework directive, those are
defined as either &#147;heavily modified&#148; or
&#147;artificial&#148; water bodies. As currently defined, most
internal drainage board systems, certainly in the fens, would be
considered to be SuDS, where approval is needed from the approving body
before a discharge is permitted. The purpose of the amendment is to
tidy up the provision for the sake of
clarity.</div><a name="10012112000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000340"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> I do not know whether the hon. Lady has seen the
interesting paper from the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, which makes the
parallel between SuDS and wetlands. We should note the fact that
wetlands are partly natural, but partly man-made. We use them as an
extension of SuDS because it would be stupid not to. I am sure she
would agree with that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000341"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I entirely endorse the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point. I went to see such a wetland in an area adjacent to my
constituency on a particularly wet day. A peat bog was being created
for the purpose he described. We enthusiastically endorse wetlands. We
accept that previous Governments&#151;mostly Conservative
Governments&#151;had capital programmes to create engineered
channels, such as those that are referred to in the amendment. I think
that there is a meeting of minds on this point and I invite the
Committee to support the
amendment.</div><a name="10012112000233"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><a name="10012112000342"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I shall
speak to amendment 165, which is in my name. It, too, is
straightforward. Paragraph 11 of schedule 3 deals with the
determination of applications for approval. It is rather odd that no
time scales for determination are set. Similarly, there is no provision
to deal with a failure to comply with time scales, should they be set.
I would be grateful if the Minister considered whether it was possible
to make regulations about timing and procedure for the determination of
applications for approval and regulations specifying the consequences
of failure to comply with time scales so that the process is not
open-ended.</div><a name="10012112000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000343"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Amendments 148 and 165 are both very
helpful in probing the Government. Amendment 148 was dealt with first
and refers to internal drainage boards. As we all recognise, IDBs
oversee the regulation of ordinary watercourses and works powers in
respect of areas of special drainage need, and they have a critical
role to play in the future of flood risk and water level management
arrangements. I agree with hon. Members that it seems sensible that
IDBs should be consulted by the SuDS-approving body where
appropriate.</div>
<a name="10012112000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will,
indeed, consider that matter further and think carefully about what the
most appropriate drafting would be. The amendment gives a wide
definition, on a district-wide level, and that does not align with the
conditions for consulting the other statutory consultees. However, the
amendment is helpful and we would be happy to take the issue away and
bring something back once we have considered the
drafting.</div><a name="10012112000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to take this opportunity to clarify an issue relating to
IDBs that I touched on during the evening of 19 January. I suggest that
it will not be necessary for IDBs to seek consent from the
SuDS-approving body, but that some developments may require planning
permission and might be very large. For example, where the IDB is
constructing large drainage infrastructure, it may be necessary to seek
approval from the SuDS-approving body. In such circumstances, the
development would be in line with the local strategy agreed between all
the relevant bodies, including the SAB if required, so there should be
no obstacle. Furthermore, as I mentioned yesterday, the Bill also
contains provision, under paragraph 7(4)(a), (b) and (c) of schedule 3,
to specify by order what would require approval and any exemptions. So
after consultation and discussion with the internal drainage boards, we
will set out what IDB works would require approval of the SAB. I hope
that clarification is
helpful.</div><a name="10012112000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham tabled amendment 165. As she
stated, the amendment is designed to enable the Minister to make
regulations about the timing and the procedure for the determination of
applications by the SuDS-approving body, and about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>the consequences of not complying with them. My hon. Friend makes a good
point about an area in which there may, indeed, be a gap. The amendment
would provide assurance for developers and others that the
SuDS-approving body must make a timely decision on the approval of
drainage plans, and therefore not hold up the development process. That
makes good sense, so we will consider the matter further alongside the
earlier amendment, and will return to it on Report. In light of that,
before we come to my amendments, perhaps the hon. Member for Vale of
York and my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham would be prepared
to withdraw the amendments, and we will consider whether we can bring
something
forward.</div><a name="10012112000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000344"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We are only dealing with amendment 148 at the
moment. Miss McIntosh will have the right to reply at the end of the
debate.</div><a name="10012112000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000345"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Thank you, Mr. Martlew.
Amendments 158 and 159 will allow the Government to issue guidance to
the SuDS-approving body on the amount that may be specified as a
non-performance bond, which is provided for in paragraphs 11(2)(b) and
12 of schedule 3, and on the process for approving surface water
drainage application. The SAB will be required to have regard to any
guidance that has been issued.</div>
<a name="10012112000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bond is
used by the SAB to pay for any work that is necessary to complete the
drainage system to the approved plan, or to put the system right,
should the developer be unable to do so. The bond provides protection
for property owners, particularly those buying off-plan, and ensure
that the SuDS draining their property are built and operate as
designed. The bond is also for the SAB that must maintain the SuDS.
Under the existing clauses, if any money is left over, or if it is not
necessary to call on the bond, the SAB must pay it back to the
applicant. The amendment will provide clarity for property developers
about the level of bond required.</div>
<a name="10012112000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guidance on
the approval process will enable the SuDS-approving body, and property
developers who apply to it, to have clarity and consistency about
aspects of the approval process. For example, if required, the guidance
suggests a format for applications to the SAB to provide the developer
with a consistent approach for seeking approval, regardless of where
the development is located. If needed, the guidance could also set a
framework for other aspects of the process, such as the way in which
the SuDS-approving body works with its statutory consultees or performs
some of its other duties. Guidance can be issued or amended in the
light of experience of implementation of SuDS. I am pleased to commend
amendments 158 and
159.</div><a name="10012112000247"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

moved this amendment for debating purposes. Paragraph 13 (3) of
schedule 3
states:</div><a name="10012112000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
making regulations the Minister must have regard to the desirability of
ensuring that fee income does not significantly exceed the costs
(direct and indirect) that approving bodies incur in connection with
approval.&#148;</div><a name="10012112000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
poses the question: why should there be any discrepancy? Why, in times
of hardship and rising inflation, given all the pressures that
approving bodies will be under, should there be any excess, over and
above the costs? Surely the purpose of the fee is to cover the pure
cost of the work. What else would the money be used
for?</div><a name="10012112000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000351"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I concur with the hon. Lady&#146;s
concluding comments. The costs should represent a fair and appropriate
charge, and not place an undue burden on the developer. I sympathise
with her intention, which is to guarantee a fair deal for property
developers by ensuring that the fee charge for the approval of
applications does not exceed the costs incurred when processing that
application. That is our intention. That is why, under paragraph 13(1)
of schedule 3, the Minister will have the power to set regulations for
fees. The intention of the regulations will be to ensure that the fees
charged by the SuDS-approving bodies are appropriate in light of the
direct and indirect costs incurred. I therefore believe that the Bill
already reflects the intent of the hon. Members who tabled the
amendment.</div><a name="10012112000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
removing the word &#147;significantly&#148;, as suggested in the
amendment, might overly constrain the regulation-making power, and
might mean that there had to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>provision for local authorities to calculate the precise costs of a
drainage application. Given the wide variation in sites and types of
applications and, therefore, the scrutiny involved in assessing them,
calculating such fees exactly for each application would be overly
burdensome, and I know that the hon. Member for Vale of York wants to
avoid placing undue burdens on local authorities. Additionally, the
cost of calculating the exact amount might end up being charged to the
applicant as part of the processing fee, so the applicant could
actually be worse off as a result of the
amendment.</div><a name="10012112000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we are on the subject of fees, I would like to take this opportunity to
clarify that the approving body can charge a fee to assess the drainage
application and to inspect the construction. The SAB can collect the
fee directly from the applicant, or the planning authority can collect
it on the SuDS-approving body&#146;s behalf in cases where the
developer lodges an application for SuDS approval and planning
permission at the same
time.</div><a name="10012112000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the amendment, I assure the hon. Lady that her intent is provided
for in the ability to specify in regulations how the fees will be
calculated, and I assure the Committee that the intention in the
original regulation-making power is to have a fair fee scheme, but not
to put a disproportionate burden on the authority. Given that, I ask
the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10012112000172"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000355"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I hope that the purpose of the amendment is
self-explanatory. We believe that the Minister should, by order,
provide for the enforcement of a requirement for approval and the duty
to maintain. Amendment 151 was tabled because the Bill does not address
those issues clearly enough. The ownership of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>SUDS that ultimately connect to the public sewer system should reside
with water companies, thereby allowing them to have control over their
assets. This is a precursor

not go far enough. We would like to see a specific duty because, as was
said earlier, Pitt wants not just to allow for maintenance but for the
public to see that maintenance is being done. Amendment 155 would place
a specific duty to maintain which currently is not in the Bill, and it
would strengthen the
Bill.</div><a name="10012112000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">New

Secretary of State may make provision for the transfer of Sustainable
Urban Drainage Systems to water and sewerage
companies.&#146;.</div><a name="10012112000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
realise that this is a controversial area, and that, in tabling the
amendments, we are breaking new ground. However, we do not know for
sure where sustainable urban drainage systems are, particularly SUDS
that relate to major new housing developments, which may connect to the
public sewer. I have had a helpful note from my own regional
Environment Agency, which has headquarters in the Vale of York at
Clifton Moor, giving me details of a number of SUDS of this nature in
or near York and my own region, with the invitation to go out and see
them, so that I can see, touch and feel a SUDS, and walk and paddle
about in it, so I will know with even more authority what we are
talking
about.</div><a name="10012112000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we assume there are three potential owners of the SUDS at the moment,
one is the housing development and the residents, who are probably
blissfully unaware that that is the case. If the developer creates the
SUDS, it is probable that they are not being maintained, because
everyone is ignorant, including the present owners. So that is one
possibility for the owners of the houses
nearby.</div><a name="10012112000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second possibility, which the Government currently accept, is that
planning permission is given, and the planning authority then retains
ownership and responsibility for the SUDS. The Bill is confusing,
because planning permission is given by the lower-tier
authority&#151;the district council. Again, it is not clear in the
Bill whether that is the case. Rather confusingly, the Bill states that
the upper-tier authority will give planning permission for SUDS. But we
know that the upper-tier authority, the county council, is currently
only responsible for giving planning permission for the highways SUDS,
the SUDS that alleviate flooding, potentially retaining surface water,
rainwater or any potential flooding from the highway. In all
probability, those SUDS do not connect to the sewerage
system.</div><a name="10012112000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to outline a third scenario. In doing so, I am answering a
potential question. If the SUDS relating to a housing development
flood, and the flood damages the waste water going to the sewerage
system for which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>water and sewerage companies are responsible, who picks up the bill and
who is affected by those potential floods? The answer is the water and
sewerage companies and their customers. It is controversial, but we
believe that this little group of amendments is necessary. Not every
water and sewerage company accepts it, but the majority do. They are
best placed, after the approving body has given planning permission and
after the development has been completed, to adopt ownership and
responsibility for the maintenance of those SUDS that specifically
relate to major housing developments with the potential to flood,
overflow and cause a spill from the connection to the main sewerage
system. That is my understanding of what Pitt was asking for the Bill
to achieve&#151;to give legislative authority to ending the automatic
right to connect. As the Bill is currently drafted we would not achieve
that. There would be no automatic end to
connection.</div><a name="10012112000248"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="10012112000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
group of amendments is controversial, but we believe that they plug the
gap and give legislative authority to Pitt, thus ending the automatic
right to connect. They would show once and for all that the water and
sewerage companies have responsibility. To take it one stage further,
we have later amendments that relate to the fact that Ofwat probably
does not allow the water and sewerage companies to raise money. I hope
that the Minister will approve of the amendments, and recognise that
they would improve the
Bill.</div><a name="10012112000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000356"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I want to speak briefly on the amendment, which
addresses an important issue. A frequent and common complaint in the
aftermath of the 2007 floods was that maintenance of a variety of
drainage assets, such as watercourses and culverts, had been neglected
over the years. Examples in Haverley, Whaddon and Charlton Kings in my
constituency spring to mind. Custom and practice was often that local
authorities had stepped in and maintained them, but sometimes that
custom and practice had fallen into disuse and maintenance had ceased.
It was not entirely clear after the floods, when people started to
point fingers and blame one another for lack of maintenance, who had
legal responsibility. It often emerged that legal responsibility
attached to the riparian owners, which was ludicrous in some cases.
Riparian ownership of a culvert in Whaddon in a poor part of my
constituency seemed in law to be with the people who owned houses
metres above the culvert and who were probably not even aware of its
existence. Dozens of people would have been
involved.</div><a name="10012112000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
major housing developments, such legal tangles are not acceptable. Pitt
addressed that, and the amendment picks up the fact that sustainable
drainage systems in major housing developments may add a whole new
dimension to the tangle of responsibilities, so it is welcome in
addressing that and seeking to put responsibility for maintenance of
such assets beyond
doubt.</div><a name="10012112000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012112000357"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): My hon.
Friend is making an important point. A problem that I occasionally deal
with in my constituency is the right of highways authorities to
discharge water off a highway on to private land. Sometimes that may be
into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>a culvert running under a private house. The cost of difficult
maintenance of such an asset may be beyond the financial ability of
many constituents. The amendment may address
that.</div><a name="10012112000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000358"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> My hon. Friend is right. In practice, local
authorities and other water and flood management bodies often stepped
in on a grace and favour basis without a robust basis in law. The issue
must be addressed. I share the disquiet of the hon. Member for Vale of
York that the Bill does not quite establish those responsibilities
clearly, and I am happy to support the
amendment.</div><a name="10012112000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000359"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> I want to speak briefly in support of the
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of
York.</div>
<a name="10012112000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
essential to determine who will maintain what, for reasons that have
been given many times. We face extra building in areas that flood,
although developers deny that, but many of us have seen flooding on
fields that developers propose to build on. Developers rely on
sustainable drainage systems being built to overcome the problem but,
as the hon. Member for Cheltenham rightly said, far from helping, that
could make the problem worse if it is not determined who is responsible
for maintaining those systems. The Environment Agency is certainly
concerned about that. The chairman of the Environment Agency told that
me that on Monday evening. It is a concern.</div>
<a name="10012112000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to
get this provision into the Bill as things stand, especially if areas
are going to suffer from extra building&#151;I hope they are
not&#151;perhaps as a result of the regional spatial strategy, or
whatever, because the developers are hanging everything on the ability
of the new drainage systems to cope with the floodwater or run-off
water or whatever, wherever the water comes from. If that is so and
that fall-back position is to be given any credence in planning
guidance or decisions, we must at least ensure that those systems are
properly
maintained.</div><a name="10012112000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000360"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
once again, Mr. Martlew. May I start where the hon. Member
for Tewkesbury, my neighbour, left off? The fundamental weakness of the
whole of the drainage provision is that the Environment Agency is not
necessarily brought into the planning system. Too often planning
authorities are able to make their own judgments and&#151;this used
to be so but is no longer the case&#151;ignore the advice of the
Environment Agency, although that is difficult for them to do. But it
is still possible for the planning authority not to seek the advice of
the Environment Agency. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister for clarity
on what that process
is.</div><a name="10012112000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
danger does not necessarily lie in what happens formally in terms of
what may come before a planning authority committee, but in deals that
are made between planning officers and developers, whereby developers
make all manner of wonderful offers and say that they can sort out the
difficulties that may result from consequential developments&#151;not
necessarily in the place they are developing, but in respect of where
the water is likely to go. I have seen it too many times in my
constituency: a developer employs someone with a specialist 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>who comes up with wonderful ideas and shows that the water will not be
problem, but then, lo and behold, two or three years later somewhere
that has not flooded for generations starts flooding. By then it is all
too late, because it is difficult to prove that something happened as a
result of a particular development, and even if that is proved, there
is no likelihood that the developer will make good the damage that they
have
caused.</div><a name="10012112000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to hear my hon. Friend the Minister say what the Environment
Agency&#146;s role is with regard to the process, because we
underrate, underestimate and under-use its skills. This is an appeal
for resources. I want to know that planning authorities use the
expertise of the Environment Agency throughout the process, rather than
occasionally, as we know is the case now, with the agency being brought
in for bigger or controversial developments, although those are not the
ones that slip through the system. It is the other developments that I
worry about. Too often the planning authorities arrogate the
responsibility, which they have, although they do not have not the
knowledge. I want to make sure that they use that responsibility much
more
wisely.</div><a name="10012112000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012112000361"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Grogan</b> (Selby) (Lab): I am tempted to offer to join
my neighbour, the hon. Member for Vale of York, on what should be a
fascinating tour of North Yorkshire
SuDS.</div><a name="10012112000234"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Will
the Minister address the merits of the Scottish system, in which, as I
understand it, the highways SUDS&#151;those related in some way to
the highways system&#151;are maintained by the local authorities and
the SUDS that have an impact on the public drainage system are
maintained by the water authority? That seems reasonably clear and
seems to have some merit. I hope that he will address that
point.</div><a name="10012112000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000362"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Paragraph 6 of schedule 3 sets out clearly
that the responsibility and duties of a SuDS-approving body lie with
unitary or county local authorities. It allows the Minister to appoint
by order an alternative body to approve drainage systems in a specified
area. The SuDS-approving body will have responsibility for the
approval, the adoption and the maintenance of SuDS to the new national
standards for sustainable drainage. I hope that members of the
Committee have received correspondence from me in the past few days
expanding on what is set out in the Bill, as it might be
helpful.</div><a name="10012112000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make it clear that the adoption duty under paragraph 16 of the
schedule and the maintenance duty under paragraph 21 will apply only to
SuDS that serve more than one property. The SuDS-approving body can
also voluntarily adopt all or part of the SuDS when the duty to adopt
does not apply under paragraph 20. As I am sure the Committee accepts,
adoption does not need to confer ownership, as the new clause would
imply. The maintenance duty for adopted SuDS will ensure that they
continue to provide effective drainage for the properties that they
serve.</div><a name="10012112000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
3 is designed on the basis that the SuDS-approving body will be the
enforcement body. However, amendment 151 would mean that if, for some
reason, the SuDS-approving body failed to undertake its maintenance
role, some other public body would have to take enforcement action
against the SuDS-approving body. That would be complicated. It would be
unusual, and it would be unnecessary. It is directly in the approving 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>body&#146;s interest to maintain the SuDS to national standards,
thereby reducing local flood risk and helping them to carry out one of
their other new roles under the Bill. There is a deliberate fit with
the wider responsibility of flood risk
management.</div><a name="10012112000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
because we expect many SuDS to be located in public spaces, such as
roads and parks, the SuDS-approving body will already be maintaining
those spaces. In any case, water and sewerage companies and the EA
would be likely to identify areas where maintenance was not being
carried out, where it has a knock-on effect on sewers or watercourses.
However, should the SuDS-approving body fail to discharge its duties
under the Bill, it could be held accountable through the usual
democratic channels and ultimately be subject to judicial
review.</div><a name="10012112000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would not extend enforcement provisions to the maintenance of
SuDS serving single properties. As I said, the SuDS-approving body is
not under a duty to maintain such SuDS on individual properties. SuDS
on private property will be designated under schedule 1 as a flood risk
feature, which means that they cannot be replaced, altered or removed
without consent from the SuDS-approving body, an issue that we have
debated before. That will mean that they will continue to provide
effective drainage for the property. Should a private SuDS not be
maintained, and it causes health or other nuisance, the SuDS-approving
body can take action under the Building Act 1984, as provided under
paragraph 25. We consider that to be good
protection.</div><a name="10012112000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
155 tabled by the hon. Members for Vale of York and for Upminster would
require a slight change to the wording of SuDS maintenance. I can
reassure the hon. Ladies that the current wording of the Bill will have
exactly the same effect as the amendment. They have also tabled new
clause 21, which would make provision for the transfer of sustainable
urban drainage systems to water and sewerage companies. It is important
that both the approval and the adoption functions are undertaken by a
single organisation, so that considerations of future maintenance and
operation are made alongside decisions on the design and the
construction of SuDS, especially when SuDS are located in public
spaces.</div><a name="10012112000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
responsibility for adopting and maintaining SuDS fits well with the
local authorities&#146; wider lead local flood authority role, as set
out in clause 9, and their existing responsibilities for highways
maintenance, surface water management planning and public space
maintenance. Many SuDS, such as those in or beside roads, in football
pitches to which we might return later, and public parks will serve a
dual role by both tackling surface water run-off and providing a public
space.</div><a name="10012112000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure hon. Members will be pleased to hear that the Bill does not
prevent local authorities, in their role as SuDS-approving bodies, from
transferring their adoption functions to water and sewerage companies
by agreement. However, the local authority SuDS-approving body would
retain responsibility and liability for SuDS. That keeps true to our
aim to have a single body responsible for SuDS approval and
adoption.</div><a name="10012112000249"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="10012112000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012112000363"></a><b class="B">Nia
Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): I am concerned about the amount
of surface water that goes into some of our sewers, particularly where
it causes a lot of sewage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>overspill into areas such as the Burry inlet, which has as many letters
after its name as one could possibly imagine because of its huge
variety of habitats and
wildlife.</div><a name="10012112000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that we need to keep our highways free from excess water
that could otherwise flood people&#146;s properties. However, will
the Minister say how water companies will be able to raise the alarm
with local authorities and say, &#147;We simply cannot just take
whatever you throw at us&#148;? It has come to light in my area that
the water that is causing the problems seems to be coming more from the
highways than from people&#146;s properties. It seems to be coming
from areas of land, whether they be car parks, highways or whatever,
that are the responsibility of local authorities. We seem to have a
situation whereby the authorities just expect water companies such as
Welsh Water to cope with endless amounts of water. Will the Minister
explain how we will ensure that we do not overload the water
companies?</div><a name="10012112000210"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000364"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her comments. I
recognise that water companies and others have genuine concerns about
how the proposals will work in practice. However, I think we have got
the lines of responsibility, accountability and liability right. Water
companies are statutory consultees to the SAB process, so it will not
be one-way
traffic.</div><a name="10012112000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can give my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Vale of York, who has
also raised this point, a further assurance that has come out of the
good discussions I have had with representatives of the water companies
over the past couple of days. I gave the undertaking, which I am happy
to give before the Committee today, that I will meet with
representatives of the water companies to discuss the issue with them
further, particularly with regard to how we can clarify through
regulations exactly how we expect the authorities to deal with water
companies and others to ensure that they are part of the
process.</div><a name="10012112000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000365"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The hon. Member for Llanelli has hit absolutely
the right spot. Water companies are consulted on planning commissions,
but I wish to go further and give them the same statutory
responsibility as the Environment Agency has to set conditions. If
water companies think that the infrastructure simply does not have the
capacity for a major new development, be it a SuDS or a major
development that is not a SuDS and connects through the foul water,
they should be able to put conditions on the planning permission. I
understand that that is not the current position, but that is what we
want to
see.</div><a name="10012112000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000366"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I give the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend
the Member for Llanelli the further assurance that the discussions that
I intend to have with the water companies will reflect the concerns
over how the regulations and guidance can accurately reflect the
importance of the companies&#146; input into the process. However, it
is essential that we retain the clarity in the Bill that the SAB
becomes the adopter and maintainer, in line with its wider
roles.</div><a name="10012112000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady makes the important point that we must minimise the
possibility&#151;although we cannot rule it out&#151;that water
companies will be left out of the process by omission. They cannot be
because they are part and parcel of the process. They are consultees 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>under the Bill and I am happy to flesh that out in further discussions
with representatives of the water industry over the next few
days.</div><a name="10012112000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000367"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> May I clarify that there are effectively three-way
discussions between the planning authorities, the back-stop of the
Environment Agency and the water companies? When we get a larger
development, presumably they will sit down before they go to the
developer to look at some of the objective reasons as to whether the
development is sensible, and then they will approach the developer.
That is the way
forward.</div><a name="10012112000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000368"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes, that is exactly what we need to flesh
out in both the guidance and the regulations, to make sure that this
works in practice. That is why I think that we can go further than
current planning guidance to make explicit how we expect this kind of
triangulation of views to work
out.</div><a name="10012112000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000369"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> The Minister knows that this is a matter
of great concern to a number of us on the Committee and to our local
water companies. Can he clarify how he will report back to the
Committee or to the House on the outcome of his
discussions?</div><a name="10012112000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000370"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am happy to report back, either in
writing if the discussions take place in the next couple of days, diary
permitting, or on Report, so that everyone will know exactly what has
happened.</div><a name="10012112000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000371"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> We need to go further than that. It is all very
well the Minister having talks behind closed doors. I want his
assurance that he will introduce Government amendments to address the
issues.</div><a name="10012112000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000372"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am afraid that I cannot give the hon.
Lady that assurance, and she will have to decide whether she wants to
press the amendment to a vote on that basis. The assurance that I can
give is that we can and will clarify the matter through regulations and
guidance, but if she does not feel that that is appropriate, that
judgment is for her. I can tell her that we have had discussions with
water companies in the past couple of days, and they are open to the
idea of sitting down and discussing the issues to find a way
forward.</div><a name="10012112000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000373"></a>Martin

way?</div><a name="10012112000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000374"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes, but I may return to some of the
points that have been
raised.</div><a name="10012112000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000375"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I accept that, but I am sure that no water
company would turn down the opportunity for discussions. In its recent
memorandum to members of the Committee, Dwr Cymru stated
that</div><a name="10012112000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Bill allows SUDS to drain into public sewers, without giving sewerage
undertakers adequate control over the quantity (or quality) of the
flows. This will inevitably cause more sewage flooding and/or more
frequent spills from overloaded sewerage...For example paragraph
11(3)(a) of Schedule 3 requires the SUDS Approving Body (SAB) only to
&#145;consult&#146; the relevant sewerage undertaker...In
contrast, under paragraph 15, the sewerage undertaker must allow
approved SUDS schemes to connect to its sewers, whether or not the
sewers have the capacity to
cope.&#148;</div><a name="10012112000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
are matters of detail on the face of the Bill, and they do require an
amendment to the Bill, not just further consultation,
surely.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div><a name="10012112000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012112000376"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am not sure that I agree. Let me make it
clear once again that the SAB has to consult the Environment Agency,
and construction cannot start until the full drainage system is
approved. Also, we fully acknowledge that water and sewerage companies
are well placed to feed in local knowledge about the capacity of
sewers, plans for future provision, and hot spots, as has been referred
to by my hon. Friends the Members for Stroud and for Llanelli.
Therefore, we have made them statutory consultees for the process, and
that role will give them the opportunity to consider drainage
applications and the impact on the wider sewerage network, and to feed
back their advice to the SuDS-approving body. That is set out as a
statutory requirement in paragraph 11(3)(a) of the schedule, which
states
that</div><a name="10012112000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
approving body must consult...any sewerage undertaker with whose
public sewer the drainage
system&#148;</div><a name="10012112000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
related. If it failed to consult, it would be in breach of the
provisions.</div><a name="10012112000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to go around in circles. As I have said, it is my firm view
that we can set out the requirement in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>regulations and subsequent guidance to make sure that the scheme works.
I understand that there is a difference of opinion, and that some
believe that it must be included in the
Bill.</div><a name="10012112000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also must be emphasised that water and sewerage companies are under a
general duty to provide, maintain and extend the public sewerage system
in their area. There is a reciprocal arrangement: in complying with
their duty, they should take into account proposals for new development
in development plan documents and elsewhere, and the SAB can set
conditions on approval. They can work with the water companies as
statutory
consultees.</div><a name="10012112000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
other points were raised. Is the approval authority that gives approval
to a SuDS going to be responsible for adopting SuDS?
Yes.</div><a name="10012112000250"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
