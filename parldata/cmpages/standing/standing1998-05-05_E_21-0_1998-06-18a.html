<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Before lunch, Labour Members were discussing the debt level that the Government have decided to run up in the period to 2003-04. The amendment would incorporate into the legislation a definition of the golden rule that the level of debt should not exceed the amount of investment undertaken by the Government. The Government claim that during the next four or five years they will reduce the level of debt as a proportion of gross domestic product. This is the only Government who would simultaneously increase debt while claiming to be reducing it. On page 43 of the document, "Stability and Investment for the Long Term", it is clear that in real cash terms, after adjustment for inflation, the public service net cash requirement the new jargon for the public sector borrowing requirement will increase. It will be £4 billion in 1998-99, then £2 billion, then £4 billion, then £5 billion, then £5 billion, then £4 billion in 2003-04. In all common understanding of the language, that is an increase in debt in real terms, but the Government are claiming that they are reducing it because they are reducing it as a proportion of GDP. That is a recipe for profligate and continued public spending. The raison d'\ketre of the document is to allow the Government to continue to increase public spending while claiming, falsely in my view, that they are being prudent and sensible with public spending.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Can the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee when the previous Conservative Government reduced net public debt in real terms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman and Labour Members must distinguish between the propaganda that the Labour party wields to win elections, and the economic reality necessary to make economic decisions. The average level of debt during the 18 years of the previous Conservative Government was lower at 39 per cent. than all the figures in the document. That is a fact. The reality is that the Government are using accounting techniques to disguise large increases in public spending, and that will come home to roost when the economy takes a downturn.
<P>
I have tried in vain to extract from the Government a definition of capital spending because on that definition will depend how effectively and properly the so-called golden rule is implemented. I have tabled parliamentary questions and was referred to annex B of the Red Book. I searched annex B for a definition of capital spending, but the nearest I could find was in paragraph B.62 which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Public sector capital expenditure ... includes ... gross domestic fixed capital formation (ie expenditure on fixed assets schools, hospitals, roads, computers, plant and machinery etc)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appears to be the only definition, other than that on page 20 of the Government's new glossy document, "Stability and Investment for the Long Term", in which spending on capital is defined as spending which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"creates assets which support services and benefit taxpayers in future years as well as now."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The definition is unclear, but it is crucial, because on that definition will depend whether the golden rule is valid. For example, do repairs to a school building constitute capital spending or revenue? Can the Paymaster General answer that specific question this afternoon? Do repairs to roads constitute capital spending or revenue? The definition in paragraph B.62 includes roads, hospitals and schools. Repairs constitute only capital spending under the Government's definition. No accountancy definition of capital spending would include a repair to a building. It is current spending and should be regarded as such by the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman may have a point, but surely what matters is whether the Government's definition of capital expenditure is different from that used by the previous Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No, because under the previous Government it was irrelevant whether something was capital spending or revenue spending because no distinction was made in the accounts. The key point is that the level of debt was not determined by a notional figure of how much would be spent on capital spending. When it comes to Government expenditure, the distinction is difficult to draw. Indeed, many people outside this place regard the distinction as false because it is so dependent on the definition of the term. Many economists believe that the level of Government debt should be determined by the economic cycle. For example, when the economy is in a down cycle, the Government should be permitted to go into deficit.
<P>
One member of the Monetary policy committee said in evidence to the Treasury Select Committee yesterday that the golden rule was wholly bogus. The level of Government debt should be determined not by their decision to invest on a wholesale spending spree throughout the country but by the economy's cycle. In a down cycle a recession tax receipts are low and cyclical expenditure on social security is high. That is when Governments should be permitted to borrow. When the economy is in an upswing, during a period of strong growth, the Government should be repaying debt. The level of debt should not be based on the arbitrary decisions of the Government to invest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): In the light of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, will he clarify two points? First, if the definition is so imprecise, why does he want to incorporate it into statute so that it is a legal requirement? Secondly, he quoted the PSNCR figures, saying that they were greater than the average for the past 18 years. Does he concede that the figure from 18 years ago would have bought a great deal more? Does he accept that in real terms he has to compare like with like? It simply will not do to fudge an average over a time span of 18 years and compare it with the forecast for the next two or three.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On the latter point, we are talking about percentages. Therefore, what the hon. Gentleman said about inflation is irrelevant. As for why I am supporting an amendment that seeks to incorporate the golden rule into statute, I believe that it is important for the Government's rhetoric to become part of law and reality. If the Government say that they are going to do something, they should be made to do it, and that stipulation should be in statute.
<P>
The problem with the Government, which will bring them down in the long run, is that there is too much divorce between what they say in public and what happens in reality. Later amendments will allow us to discuss a number of examples of the way in which the Government are seeking to fudge and manipulate the accountancy figures in the same way as they fudge and manipulate media coverage of their activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Does my hon. Friend care to comment on charts B2 and B3 in the Red Book. They show that the tax to GDP ratio will increase over the planned period, but Government expenditure will decrease. Everyone in this country will be paying more tax but getting less for it. Does my hon. Friend think that that is good fiscal management of the economy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It is clear from the Red Book that the Government are predicting growth of 1.75 per cent. next year. But they intend to spend 2.75 per cent. on average during this Parliament. Almost by definition, the level of debt in this country will increase because spending will outstrip the growth in the economy. It is difficult to work out, even on percentage terms, how the figures will be sustainable. If the level of growth is not as high as the Government anticipate, the profligacy of the plan will cause the country and the economy serious problems. Yesterday, if was announced that the number of unemployed people had increased by 1,700. The Government have neither apologised for nor even mentioned that. If those figures mark the beginning of a downturn in the economy, serious economic hazards lie ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I am curious about the contribution of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). When I was browsing in the Library, as is my wont, I came across a document that he had written, entitled "Maintaining Momentum: a radical tax agenda for the 1990s". In it, he proposes the abolition of inheritance tax, stamp duty and the higher rate of income tax, in addition to his earlier proposal to abolish capital gains tax. How can his claim to want to reduce the national debt have any credibility?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have always believed in low taxation, and I will continue to advocate it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> What would you cut?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks a question from a sedentary position, and I shall answer it. For example, I would not spend between £1 billion and £4 billion on the working families tax credit, which is the estimate given by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
<P>
The Government have got their priorities wrong. Some £5 billion from the windfall tax has been set aside to finance a new deal scheme that has created virtually no jobs. Such projects have proved to be worthless, and they will be proved today to be a waste of public spending. Instead, the Government should be spending taxpayers' money on the priorities that they set out during the general election campaign. They promised to reduce health service waiting and to reduce class sizes, but they have failed to keep either promise.
<P>
The debate has veered away from the subject on which I had hoped it would concentrate [Laughter,] I am happy to debate that subject, which is the Government's capital spending. The golden rule is open to wide interpretation, and it should therefore be incorporated into the statute book. Moreover, in winding up today's debate, a Minister should provide the Committee and the country with a precise definition of capital spending. To describe capital spending as spending on schools, hospitals and roads is not sufficient. A clear distinction needs to be drawn between a repair and an improvement. I would be grateful if the Paymaster General would tell us whether a repair to a school, a hospital or a road constitutes capital spending or current spending.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I did not intend to speak during this short debate, so I shall make my comments brief.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton seemed to suggest that the distinction between current spending and capital spending was a difficult one to make. That is rather remarkable, given that his contributions during the Committee's deliberations have impressively demonstrated skills acquired during his many years in accountancy. One would have expected him to bring to the Committee a knowledge of the private sector, in which commercial companies make just such a distinction between current and capital spending. He should realise that the making of that distinction is not so difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was not saying that the distinction between capital and revenue was difficult far from it. Such practices and principles are well-established in the private sector. I was simply trying to ascertain the Government's distinction between capital and revenue, which is not clear. Everything to which I have been referred in response to my parliamentary questions has proved vague. For example, paragraph B.62 of the Red Book refers to capital spending on roads, hospitals, computers, plant and machinery, and so on. However, it is unclear whether that spending is on repairs or on construction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> It is for the Minister to be precise. Given the briefings that he has had, I am sure that he can enlighten us on the matter.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has clearly forgotton the actitivies of the previous Government. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) proposed a reform to public sector financing called resource accounting and budgeting. I believe that it was proposed in the 1995 Budget; however, I am sure that at least one Opposition Member can intervene if I am wrong. That reform proposed a clear distinction within departmental budgets between capital and current.
<P>
One would expect the Government to continue with that distinction. They are going ahead with the resource accounting and budgeting proposals, for which they have cross-party support. The distinction between current and capital spending that is incorporated in the golden rule, which follows long-established lines, is surely self-evident.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No one objects to the distinction between capital and revenue, or to resource accounting. However, when the concepts of the golden rule, of capital versus revenue and of resource accounting are introduced, one has to define certain terms. I sought to obtain those definitions but I have not received a satisfactory response, which is why I am concerned about the matter. We need a definition of capital that distinguishes between repairs, current expenditure and capital expenditure. In relation to resource accounting we need to know, for example, whether the Government will include liabilities such as the state earnings-related pension scheme liabilities on the balance sheet. We need answers before we can proceed and we would have received answers from a Conservative Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am coming to the end of my remarks. The hon. Gentleman may not have received an answer from Ministers about definitions because the definitions are already well established. During the debate on the Maastricht criteria, they were laid out at the European level, and they meet international standards.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): In the hon. Gentleman's estimation, were maintenance and repairs to roads items of current expenditure under the previous Government's regime?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> My recollection is that they were deemed to be items of current expenditure. The Government might want to reconsider that matter, although my understanding is that they have kept to that definition. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked the Paymaster General for clarification, and I support him in that request.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper </B>(Pontefract and Castleford): I want to come back to amendment No. 146, which we have not heard much about recently.
<P>
The amendment is misguided and would make for bad legislation. I assume that Opposition Members tabled it in an attempt to cover up the fiscal mess that the Conservatives created but, rather than cover up that poor fiscal record, they have drawn attention to the fiscal incoherence that underlies their thinking.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) talked about devaluation. Apart from his minor omission of the devaluation that was brought on by the exchange rate mechanism he spoke as if devaluation was a fiscal strategy, but it is not it is a monetary strategy, and it has nothing to do with the amendment or with the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton used the words "borrowing" and "debt" as if they were the same. I suggest that he has another look at his words in Hansard. Of course they are not interchangeable there is a big difference between borrowing and debt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does the hon. Lady accept that if one borrows in one year, one increases one's debt?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> I am glad to hear that the hon. Gentleman understands the distinction. Debt is the total sum of borrowing and borrowing relates to one year's borrowing. The hon. Gentleman referred to one year's borrowing, which is what the amendment is about. Amendment No. 147, which we shall come to shortly, is about debt but amendment No. 146 is about the golden rule and borrowing. Anyway, it is for the hon. Gentleman to choose how far he wants to stray from the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) gave a classic description of fiscal tightening he did not even seem to know what it was. The Government have been promoting the fact that we are undergoing fiscal tightening, which is good, sensible fiscal policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the hon. Lady be so keen on fiscal tightening budgets when the economy starts to run into recession?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> A little bit of economic coherence from the hon. Gentleman, at last although he is absolutely right to imply that one has to take account of the economic cycle. Previous Governments simply failed to do so when they were developing their fiscal strategy.
<P>
There is an economic principle that lies behind the amendment with which I agree: it is the golden rule, which says, "You borrow to invest; you don't borrow for current consumption over the economic cycle." That makes perfect sense.
<P>
The amendment would add that principle to the Bill. The Opposition do not agree with the golden rule, no matter what they may say about fiscal prudence. They have proved that by the statements they have made in Committee, but they have also proved it by their record. The Conservative Government's record on the golden rule was dismal. Between 1979 and 1997, the current balance was positive for just four years it was negative for 14 years. Over the economic cycle, between 1985-95 and 1996-97, the current balance averaged minus 1.7 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): If the hon. Lady regards the performance of the Conservative [Mr. Nick St. Aubyn]
Government over that period as disgraceful, how would she describe the performance of our economic partners in Europe?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> I am not entirely clear what that question has to do with the amendment. The hon. Gentleman's attempt to cast the blame more widely makes no difference to his party's economic record.
<P>
The fact is that the Conservative Government failed to obey the golden rule over the last economic cycle not just by a little bit not just by 0.5 per cent. here and there but by a massive minus 1.7 per cent. They also managed to let their current balance swing from more than 2 per cent. of GDP to a deficit of minus 5 per cent. in only three years. By no stretch of the imagination is that signing up to the golden rule. The implication was that future taxpayers would pay for the current spending during those Conservative years.
<P>
There is a difference between investment and consumption and borrowing for investment. Borrowing for future taxpayers to enjoy the benefits makes sense whereas borrowing for consumption does not. More important, the Conservatives did not even try to obey the golden rule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham):</B> Is the hon. Lady saying that, for 18 years, the Conservative Government were wrong to increase public spending by 1.8 per cent. a year as opposed to the 1.5 per cent. that featured in the forecasts in the Chancellor's recent statement? Were we wrong to increase public spending by that amount?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> The big problem with the Conservative Government was that they did not know what they were spending the money on in fact, that is not true, they did know; they were spending it on current spending rather than on public investment. If one keeps cutting public sector investment and keeps putting the money into current spending, sooner or later, the chickens will come home to roost because, sooner or later, school buildings and hospitals will fall down.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> I am going to stop taking interventions because I need to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> I shall give way one more time, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way. As a fellow member of the Education and Employment Select Committee, perhaps she would tell me whether she is arguing that, if there is pressure on the Government's finances in the near future, they should spend more on schools and cut back on teachers' salaries.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> The golden rule is clear: borrow to invest, not for current spending. If that means that tough decisions must be taken, so be it, but stick to the golden rule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> I am afraid that I will not because I need to make progress.
<P>
The Conservatives did not just fail to meet the golden rule, they did not even try because they disagree with it. They did not just attempt to meet it but not quite get round to it; they disagree with it in principle. The charitable interpretation is that they had a different economic objective. The uncharitable interpretation is that they did not know what they were trying to do. They talked a lot about moving towards a balanced budget somewhere, somewhere, at a never-ending end of the rainbow that kept drifting forwards, so we never quite got there. That was about the sum of their fiscal strategy. So there were two problems. First, no one ever knew what their fiscal strategy was. Secondly, if there was one, they never quite got to the end of the rainbow anyway.
<P>
In response, we can try to legislate for transparency and to make Governments spell out their fiscal objectives, their fiscal stance and say what they are trying to do. That is the purpose of the Bill and this clause. Although I agree with the golden rule, it should not be put into the proposed legislation. The reason why is clearly spelt out by the fact that the Conservatives do not agree with the golden rule; they would have a different economic objective. The Government change the inflation target but the legislation sets the framework of responsibility for the Government to do so and for the Governor to answer if that inflation target is missed. In the same way, the Bill sets out the responsibility of the Government within the fiscal framework and the information that the Government should provide to Parliament. It provides for a kind of transparency that never existed during the past 18 years. That transparency is not just good for voters; it is also good for markets to know the Government's fiscal policy.
<P>
In those circumstances, it is inappropriate to put such an economic objective even though I believe in it and support its application by the Government into the Bill. Future Conservative Governments, if elected, would have the right to change that economic objective and to change or get rid of the fiscal rule I presume that they would do so, as they never stuck to it. It is unfortunate that we cannot protect future voters from the economic incompetence and incoherence if they follow the example of past Governments of future Conservative Governments. However it is appropriate to legislate, set the framework and establish the transparency that gives voters the right to decide, choose and hold Governments to account as they did in May last year if they make the wrong decision.

<P>

<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> We have had a fairly wide debate on fairly narrow clauses. I am not sure, Mr. Butterfill, whether you will be minded to have a stand part debate on clause 151 or, indeed, clause 152, which is largely concerned with some of the self-same issues that we are currently discussing.
<P>
On amendment No. 146 and the golden rule, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was anxious to point to the level of debt, which is indicated on page 43, table 4.4 of the economic and fiscal strategy report. He knows well that the only sensible way to assess net debt is as a ratio of debt to the GDP, which he will be aware is projected to fall from the 45 per cent. that we inherited in 1997 to 36.3 per cent. in 2003-04.
<P>
The other point on which he pressed me hard was the definition of capital expenditure investment and whether it would include repairs to roads and schools, for example. I never served in his former profession but I have come across many sets of accounts at the year-end. Although I cannot set this down as a hard, defining rule for the whole Government accounting system, it was always my understanding that simple repairs were normally taken as current spending. Where repairs are substantive and involve improvements, it would be likely that, after consultation with auditors, they would be capitalised. Those are the normal principles, which I understand to be pretty much in line with the national accounts definition. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to express his views on this and report to Parliament under clause 152(5), which we will discuss shortly. That will bring the matter within a scheme of proper scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> With respect, the hon. Gentleman has missed two sittings of the Committee. We are anxious to make progress and I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) so effectively demolished the Opposition's claims to any competence, probity or integrity when they were in charge of the nation's affairs. My hon. Friend made it clear why we could not bring the golden rule into statute.
<P>
The amendments introduce concepts that would be extremely difficult to frame in legislation. I have to tell the Committee that neither New Zealand nor Australia have legislation that works in that way. If the Government were ever so foolish as to accept the amendments, Parliament and Government would be accountable through the law courts, with all the unnecessary entanglements that that would involve.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In "The Code for Fiscal Stability", we have set out the principles of fiscal management that will guide us. In the golden rule, we have described the necessarily different treatment of current expenditure and capital expenditure, and we have made it clear that our approach to the net debt will be cautious and prudent. These are things for which we have legislated, as appropriate, in Budgets. We have shown, clearly and beyond doubt, that we are not going back to short-termism and the straightforward mistakes made by the previous Government. I have before me a document entitled "Fiscal Policy Lessons from the Previous Economic Cycle". I commend it to Conservative Ministers: they will see that we have learnt those lessons and embodied them in the Bill. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): I take it from his final sentence that the Paymaster General is not commanding the amendment to the Committee, and may even be inviting the Committee to reject it.
<P>
I welcome the contribution from the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford. The Finance Bill Committee should be all about contributions from both sides, and I hope that other Labour Ministers will be encouraged to pitch in as well in our remaining sittings.
<P>
The hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford acknowledged the importance of the golden rule, and it is good to have that on record. She said that the Conservative party did not, and would not, abide by it. However, her only reason for not incorporating the golden rule in statute was the curious one that we might define it differently. If the hon. Lady were really keen to protect the country from a future Conservative Government, would not there be an argument for incorporating her definition of the golden rule in statute? That would mean at least that an incoming Government Conservative or, who knows, Liberal Democrat would have to introduce primary legislation to change the definition of the golden rule. If a satisfactory consensus about the golden rule could be achieved, there would be a case for entrenching it in statute.
<P>
In one of his sleights of hand, the Paymaster General said that New Zealand did not have such legislation. He is wrong about that. The rules are incorporated in New Zealand's Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994, and the five rules governing the principles of responsible fiscal management are clearly spelt out in section 4.
<P>
In the end, the argument comes down to the fact that the Government are nervous about enshrining the golden rule in legislation. They know that the time may come when they have to blur the rule at the edges. They may need to tweak the original definition, propose a new starting point for the economic cycle, or introduce a new definition of the difference between current investment and capital investment. They do not want to be caught out as Snowball in "Animal Farm" was when he climbed out on to the roof at midnight to add extra words to the principle that had been adopted and spelt out for the rest of the farm.
<P>
There is a good case for incorporating the golden rule in the code.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I assure my hon. Friend that my intervention will be helpful. Is he aware of the Gramm-Rudman Act in the United States Congress, which introduced into the stature provisions similar to the golden rule in this country? If that can be done in an economy as complicated as that of the United States, why not here?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> My hon. Friend is always helpful to the Committee, and to me. His argument is valid. More and more, modern economies the world over consider the issue of fiscal entrenchment, and see what can be done to protect people from the mistakes that various Governments have made in the past. If that can be done in the United States and in New Zealand, I see no reason why it cannot be done here. As the Paymaster General is not at all interested in enshrining that protection in law, and because he has given no decent argument why the[Mr. Fallon]
Government are not doing so, perhaps we can start again on amendment No. 147. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the next amendment, I should tell the Committee that I am still minded to allow a clause stand part debate. The amendments that we shall soon consider, however, will probably go to the heart of the entire clause. Therefore, it is likely I can say no more than that that the clause stand part debate will not be required when we have considered these amendments. I shall make the judgment at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 147, in page 138, line 13, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at a stable and prudent level as a proportion of national income".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to put the second rule on to the statute book. The Government do not call this rule a golden rule or even a silver rule. I think that they call it the rule of sustainable investment, but the argument is the same. If it is to be a strict rule, there can be no objection to its becoming a law, so that it is less likely that the Government or a successive Government will deviate from it.
<P>
It is all the more important to put the rule of sustainable investment onto the statute book, as it contains somewhat looser phrasing than the golden rule. In particular, it contains the phrase "stable and prudent level". The definition of that level is, of course, entirely arbitrary and subjective. Currently it is left to the Government to say what the level is. One could argue under the golden rule that there is a reasonable corpus of academic opinion about the definition of a cycle. The Government can, however, make up the meaning of the phrase "stable and prudent" level as they go along. It is all the more necessary, therefore, that it is given full statutory effect, not necessarily so that it can be tested in the courts, but so that it is in black and white on the statute book and so that the Government have to abide by it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> As you can see, Mr. Butterfill, we continue to move round the still point of a turning circle. The Opposition continue to want to put on the statute book things that are already stated policies on which the Government will be judged. We will be judged on the stable and prudent management of investment and on our success in ensuring that investment can be sustained in a way that prevents stop-go cycles, which the hon. Gentleman will find graphically illustrated on page 50 of the Red Book, among a series of statistics on public debt and net worth. Massive reductions occured in 1988-89 through to 1991-92, only to swing in entirely the other direction when the then Government realised that those levels were not sustainable.
<P>
The reason for not including the suggestion is simple. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks is right that New Zealand has such laws, but one one has tested them in the courts. What is the point of including something in an Act of Parliament if it ultimately cannot and should not be enforced? The hon. Gentleman himself gave good reasons why it should not. The matters involved are essentially matters of judgment, and are, therefore, for the House and for the country to decide, and not for the law courts.
<P>
We keep returning to the same issue, and while I commend the clause, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. I regret to say that that will go for each amendment in which the Opposition raise such difficult concepts. They are already difficult enough, and one cannot get two economists to agree on them or on what the definition should be. The sheer impossibility of producing any acceptable legislative wording would be one difficulty. To get them interpreted in the courts, with economists and others giving evidence, would be a scenario involving anything other than rational evaluation of the Government's economic policy. It is as simple as that. I suggest that we make progress. We would have had to reject all such amendments so far considered had they been pushed to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I do not think that we can deal with the Bill in quite the way that the Paymaster General suggests; we still have to go through the form in Committee. I know that it would be for the Paymaster General's convenience if we swept away whole sets of amendments just because he had no interest in them. While we still have Finance Bill Committees and the House, however, we have to consider amendments. I hope that the Paymaster General accepts that we have the right to table them.
<P>
Our interest in the amendment springs from the Government's pronouncements. They have said that they are keen to bind themselves in and to follow the principles that they have expressed. Let me refer the Paymaster General to a somewhat excited press release from the Treasury on Budget day. It begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For too long, economic policy-making has been conducted behind closed doors".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was about a month before the permanent secretary resigned, saying that policy was being conducted behind the closed doors of the Grosvenor House Hotel. That aside, the press release goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"From now on, Governments will be required by the Code to conduct fiscal policy with regard to a clear set of principles".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we see the code and the statutory provision that has been made for it, we see that there is no specific requirement. All that the Treasury is being asked to do is to publish a document we discussed amendments on that earlier. All the document does is to set out the Government's definition of what they are required to follow. That is not satisfactory, but in view of the Paymaster General's obvious lack of interest in the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 271, in page 138, line 14, after "fairness", insert "sustainable development,".
<P>
We have tabled the amendment in a genuine attempt to improve "The Code for Fiscal Stability". We welcome the code because it will bring transparency and responsibility to the management of public finances, which must be good news given the jiggery-pokery with the public finances that we saw from the previous Government.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that "The Code for Fiscal Stability" contained a further principle: sustainable development. We suggest that not just for environmental reasons, but for hard-nosed economic reasons. Economics increasingly recognises the interrelationship between the economy and the environment; as any Government's fiscal position depends so much on the health of the economy, that interrelationship must be crucial to fiscal stability. There is a clear link. Such interrelationships form the rational for our amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sure that hon. Members are very much aware of those interrelationships, but perhaps I may give an example to illustrate my point. A few years ago, the Confederation of British Industry calculated that traffic congestion a damaging environmental phenomenon was costing the British economy £20 billion a year. Another such example is pollution, which has a direct cost to the national health service. We all know how asthma has increased in recent years. The cost of treating it and other respiratory diseases, as well as the skin conditions that are attributed to pollution, is increasing significantly.
<P>
Past unsustainable economic developments such as nuclear fission and gas works that cause hazardous gas contamination have created a burden for future generations. We are paying for that now and we will continue to have to pay for it in the future. Those are fiscal costs for future generations. The notion of sustainable development needs to be in the code to ensure that such costs are taken into account when decisions on economic development are taken.
<P>
It is not only the Liberal Democrats who are concerned about the omission of sustainable development from the list of principles. The Environment Audit Committee also expressed concern. In answer to the Committee, the Treasury said that the principle of fairness, which is in the code, include the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consideration of fairness to future generations and the world in which we live".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Having seen that answer, I looked in vain in "The Code for Fiscal Stability" for a repetition and clarification of those words. I refer Committee members to paragraph 7 on page 8 of the code, where the principle of fairness is described. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The principle of fairness means that, so far as reasonably practical, the Government shall seek to operate fiscal policy in a way that taken into account the financial effects on future generations, as well as it distributional impact on the current population."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I emphasise the word "financial" because there is no mention of environmental issues or sustainable development. In the code, the Treasury did not set out a link between fairness and sustainable development.
<P>
The phrase used in the Treasury's answer to the Environmental Audit Committee about considering the fairness to future generations and the world in which we live is rather weak. It does not go to the heart of the environmental debate, and it is not entirely clear. If that thinking really lies behind the Government's principles, why do not they accept the amendment and ensure that a term that is recognised the world over is enshrined in the code? Clearly, the five principles do not reflect the Government's commitment, stated elsewhere, to sustainable development. We are pleased that they have said in other publications that they are committed to sustainable development.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I was one of the co-authors of that report. The hon. Gentleman points out that the Government were slammed for their tokenistic references to sustainability and vague, woolly definitions. Every time we attempted to pin the Financial Secretary to the Treasury down regarding practical, environmentally sustainable solutions, the catch-all phrase "social justice" recurred. In other words, the Government would be as environmentally unfriendly as they chose if a situation did not suit their social justice criteria.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I am not sure whether I understand it, because social justice is not a principle in the code. I shall have to refer to the Financial Secretary's evidence to the Committee on which the hon. Gentleman sat to understand his remarks fully. I am worried that if sustainable development is always going to be sacrificed for other priorities, we will never make progress towards putting sustainable development at the heart of the Government's economic policy-making. The amendment seeks to ensure that sustainable development is enshrined as one of the key principles that guides the Treasury's fiscal policy. Her Majesty's[Mr. Davey]
Treasury needs radically to change its culture, so that environmental analysis and considerations are embedded within the calculations and policies that emerge from Great George Street.
<P>
The amendment is linked to amendment No. 272, which you understandably chose not to call, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not at liberty to speak to an amendment that has not been selected. He must confine his remarks to the current amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I anticipated that you might call me to order, Mr. Butterfill. I was seeking to explain to the Committee that if the Government accepted amendment No. 271, it would logically follow that they would produce a document for the House of Commons, as specified in amendment No. 272, so that we could debate environmental strategy alongside financial and budgetary policies and thereby ensure a proper assessment of the environmental implications of those policies. That link is worth bringing to the Committee's attention.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) explained during previous debates that the Financial Secretary had broken her promise to come up with a full document a green book that explained the environmental impact of the Chancellor's proposals. We had merely a green page, and that is shocking. The amendment represents a real test of the Government's environmental credentials. The manifestos and policy papers that the Government produced prior to the election implied that they had signed up to sustainable development, and that they were great believers in it. If that is so, they should accept the amendment and ensure that those worlds appear in "The Code for Fiscal Stability".
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): As we reach the end of the Finance Bill, we are approaching its best aspect save and except clause 158. We shall hear a lot more about that clause's arbitary and unaccountable provisions.
<P>
We welcome "The Code for Fiscal Stability" because we believe that it will be a positive step towards transparency and clarity in the conduct of public business. Similar arrangements, as the hon. Member for Sevenoaks mentioned, apply in New Zealand, where they have proved to be a considerable success. The more that the Government can do to reduce uncertainty and increase accountability, the better.
<P>
In our election manifesto, the Liberal Democrats called for the Government to be openly accountable for following the golden rule. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and others that the Government must publish a clear and comprehensive definition of capital expenditure. Fiscal stability requires sustainable development because the economy and the environment are closely inter-related. The Government's finances depend on a healthy economy. If the environment is damaged, the economy is damaged too, and the Government's fiscal position is destabilised.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton gave several examples, not least of which was the CBI's estimate of the £20 billion per annum cost of traffic congestion. The Treasury should consider, and be seen to consider, environmental issues which have such a fundamental impact on our economy.
<P>
The amendment will lead to a change in the culture of Government. It will alert other Departments of State, especially the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, to the importance of environmental considerations and should precipitate a more co-ordinated approach by Government Departments to the implementation of environmentally benign policies.
<P>
The lack of co-ordination was well highlighted this morning by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, (Mr. Hammond) who, unfortunately, is not present this afternoon. I am grateful to him for allowing my intervention, which gave a clear example of the consequences for environmental policies when there is such a lack of co-ordination.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I fear that the hon. Gentleman is straying significantly into discussion of amendment No. 272. He will be aware that we could not select amendment No. 272 because it would have extended the scope of the Bill in excess of the long title. That cannot be permitted. We cannot, therefore, now have a debate on environmental policy. The hon. Gentleman must confine his remarks to the narrow remit of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am extremely grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill. I am coming to my peroration the climax, or crescendo of my speech.
<P>
I conclude by saying that it would be a grave mistake if clause 151 was enacted without the inclusion of sustainable development as a key principle, along with transparency, stability, responsibility, fairness and efficiency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> An all-Liberal team has been fielded to speak to the amendment and I am surprised that they thought it necessary. Sustainable growth is a most important issue. Hon. Members will be aware that we have consulted on the subject. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister launched an excellent paper on the subject and I hope that hon. Members will take part fully in discussions, as I have encouraged them to do on other matters, to ensure that we get the right answers on the integration of policies across Government Departments. That is necessary now and may be even more necessary in forthcoming years.
<P>
We are extremely concerned about pollution and congestion and about the impact of economic policies on the environment, which must be taken into account. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton called for a change in the culture, and a different approach. As the hon. Gentleman will see, the Treasury report on economic and fiscal strategy, "Stability and investment for the long-term", which we have just issued, makes a clear statement on growth and the environment. It could not be more integrated into the general process of Treasury thinking, but it has no place in "The Code for Fiscal Stability" which, rightly, addresses the five key areas of transparency, stability, responsibility, fairness and efficiency. Those are the matters that will determine our fiscal management; we hope to do even better as a result of the consultation and to ensure that by co-ordinating Government policies we take proper account of the environment.
<P>
Page 8 of the Treasury document, it is stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Economic growth cannot be considered in isolation from other aspects of development. In particular, consideration needs to be given to environmental factors to ensure that economic growth is sustainable."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those factors are being widely introduced into Government policy. It is not possible to say, "Oh well, we now have a code for fiscal stability. Let's try and stick them in there by way of an amendment that just passed muster." We have taken action to reduce the environmental damage caused by landfill; we have increased road fuel duties to help tackle congestion and pollution; and we have provided more than £500 million for public transport over the next two years.

<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Well, everything to the Liberal Democrats 
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> It was the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We have a new recruit to the spend, spend, spend brigade. Perhaps the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham would like to tell us how much more he and his party want to commit to spend. We may doubt the Liberal Democrats' sanity when they commit to spend more, more, more, but we do not doubt their honesty. I am surprised at the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham 
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I must get on.
<P>
We have also launched a consultation document. Our good faith has been clearly demonstrated. No one could doubt that we want to integrate environmental concerns into policy. What is not necessary, however, is their integration into "The Code for Fiscal Stability". I do not think that there would be much support in the Committee for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I shall be brief. The Paymaster General was supportive of the Government's position on sustainable development. He referred to the number of documents that reflected the Government's views and stressed how much they wanted to promote sustainable development. But he did not come up with one solid argument against including sustainable development in "The Code for Fiscal Stability". He did not contradict our argument about the interrelationship between the economy and the environment and, therefore, the fiscal position of the country. We want to press the amendment to a vote because we believe that sustainable development should be included in the code.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 145, in page 138, line 17, after "Treasury's", insert "definition and".
<P>
This is the last in this series of amendments to clause 151. I know that the Paymaster General finds it something of a chore to reply to all of these amendments, but this is the last chore that he will have to perform in relation to the clause.
<P>
The amendment deals with a serious technical weakness that we touched on earlier. It is only the Treasury's understanding of the five principles that needs to be incorporated into the code. As I said earlier, that is entirely subjective it is the Treasury's view of how the five principles can be construed. Helpfully, the Treasury's definitions of the five principles can be found in the Government document, "The Code for Fiscal Stability". It would be much nicer if they were defined in the Bill, and the amendment would ensure that they were fully defined in the code.
<P>
The Paymaster General may accept the amendment he may say, "Here are the definitions; they are already in the code and the final text of that code will be laid before Parliament towards the end of the year." The key point is that the code should contain definitions we should not have to rely on the Treasury's understanding of what the principles mean.
<P>
The Treasury's understanding of the principle of fairness, for example, is that the Government should seek to operate fiscal policy in a way that is fair between the generations. However a different Government perhaps a subsequent Labour Government may reinterpret that and say that the principle should be fair between generations, depending on the economic wealth of the country that each generation enjoyed; or[Mr. Fallon]
that it should be fair between generations but that it should also reflect the differences between the different parts of the United Kingdom. The various principles can be understood in different ways.
<P>
The Treasury helpfully set out its definition of the five principles, and the amendment would ensure that the final code contained not the Treasury's understanding of the principles but their definitions. It is up to the Treasury to decide whether to alter its understanding of the principles.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Government should clarify what they mean by Government borrowing and Government debt. Different economists use different definitions, all of which are internationally accepted.
There is a gaping hole in the virtuous posture that the Chancellor adopted last week. His definitions of Government borrowing and of Government debt effectively ignored private sector debt that had been guaranteed in full by the Government. As I understand it the Paymaster General may clarify this point such guarantees are reflected in the Government borrowing and PSBR figures if and when, and to the extent that, such guarantees are called. The Government may protest that they are being virtuous in achieving a Government debt that is 40 per cent. of GDP, while at the same time allowing a much bigger burden to arise through off-balance-sheet financing and guarantees of private sector debt.
<P>
This is no mean matter. The scale of Government guarantees of the private sector is huge among some of our continental partners, including France and Germany. It has been calculated that if one combines their guarantees with their obligations to their pensioners or their future pensioners Germany's level of Government debt to GDP is about 300 per cent. and that of France is 200 per cent. In contrast, the level inherited by the Government from their Conservative predecessors was only about 100 per cent. I say "only" about 100 per cent. but I do not pretend to be entirely happy with that figure. Nevertheless, it is much less, by a factor of two or three, than that of our major European partners. Therefore, the Paymaster General owes us an explanation of why the question was fudged by the Chancellor in his statement last week and why there is no exposition anywhere, either in the statements about the golden rule or in the statements about "The Code for Fiscal Stability", that makes it clear that the Government recognise that if they guarantee a private sector debt, for the purposes of true fiscal stability, that is as good as that money being part of the PSBR.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I imagine that the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) is raising the fact that guarantees were given in relation to the channel tunnel rail link reconstruction. I can only inform him that the accounting treatment that we have adopted was taken up after we consulted with the Office for National Statistics as every Government do. Sometimes, it may be that a guarantee should be brought on to the balance sheet, at least in part. Certainly, the hon. Gentleman is right when he says that if and when it is called, and depending on to what extent it is called, a guarantee must be an immediate on-balance sheet charge. I imagine the likelihood of call is another factor that the Office for National Statistics takes into account when it decides on the treatment. Nothing has changed. The Office for National Statistics, applying the same principles that it has applied previously, decided that the treatment should be as it was, and we accepted its advice on the matter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am not satisfied with the Paymaster General's response. It is a fact that, until last December, the independent funding of grant-maintained schools was treated by the Office for National Statistics as not being part of the PSBR. The Office for National Statistics then reviewed its criteria and suddenly decided that such funding was part of the PSBR. What assurance can the Paymaster General give that, in respect of the refunding of the channel tunnel or the guarantees currently being given of billions of pounds of sales from the student loan book, the definitions will not be changed by the Office for National Statistics?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The Office for National Statistics reviews its definitions from time to time and makes changes. That is part of its job. It is not ossified in stone for all time. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that, at one time, it took a different view on British Nuclear Fuels and said that it should be included, whereas it had previously not been included. Those are matters for the Office for National Statistics, and I am sure that it will discharge its responsibilities with the good sense that it has always brought to such matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks suggested that we might find it in our hearts to accept the amendment. I regret that I cannot because of the legal problems that including the word "definition" could easily cause. The clause uses the word "understanding" because it is necessary not only to produce an abstract definition of a whole concept but in order to explain its relevance to the subject matter of the code. I believe that the word "understanding" is better for that reason. However, even if it was not better, we would be back to the problem of bringing the law into an area to which it is not suited and, as in New Zealand, the problem of the impossibility of imposing sanctions through the legal system. For those reasons, we shall vote against the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am always suspicious of defences that comprise two arguments instead of one, and I did not have much confidence in the first. I was emphasising to the Paymaster General that it was not that we required the definition of the principles to be included in the statute, but simply that, in the code, the Treasury should have to define how each of the principles was relevant to the two policies. However, we are not making headway in our attempt to make the process more transparent, and in view of that and the need to press on to other equally important clauses, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As you intend to allow a clause stand part debate, Mr. Butterfill, I would like to raise one brief but important point with the Paymaster General, which was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Can he tell us how off balance sheet events such as PFI and public-private partnership payments which are perhaps more important, in view of the Chancellor's economic statement last week are to be dealt with in the code for fiscal stability? Those are part running costs, but they contain a significant element of capital costs not only in the current year but in future years.
<P>
As we more towards resource accounting, the distinction between running costs and capital costs will have to be defined more carefully. However, I am not clear as to how those matters will be dealt with. I would be grateful if the Paymaster General could provide some clarification. If he wants more time to consider this important subject in greater detail, perhaps he could provide the Committee with a note.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I willingly accede to that request. It is not appropriate here to discuss the many interrelated potential problems that, as hon. Members know, concern FRS5. Those problems include the question of lease or purchase, and at what point sufficient of the risk has been transferred for it genuinely to be passed and not consolidated.
<P>
It would be premature to promise a note in the near future. However, decisions will be reached soon on a number of the issues that I set out for the hon. Gentleman. For the moment, I cannot reach conclusions on the points he has raised.

<P>
We shall of course vote on the amendments and the new clause separately, as we come to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> This is a straightforward amendment that seeks to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General has the necessary authority to fulfil his duties in examining and reporting to the House on the conventions and assumptions underlying a Budget document. The Committee doubtless wish him to have that authority, and we have discussed the matter with him in the usual way. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I do not know if the Paymaster General has had a particularly heavy day but he appears to have misunderstood you, Mr. Butterfill. We had expected him at least to speak to new clause 11. We cannot incorporate an entire Government clause without his saying something in its support. We fully understand that we shall vote on the new clause at a much later point, but it would help the Committee if the Paymaster General spoke to the other amendment and to the new clause, which have been grouped together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am happy to do that.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 314 and 315 are simple amendments. Amendment No. 314 will insert the words "examine and". Because of that, amendment No. 315 omits "consideration" and inserts "examination", so the two amendments are interrelated.
<P>
These are minor textural amendments with none of the legal implications of enshrining in statute the points that the Opposition made on earlier amendments, which we had to reject. If the hon. Member for Sevenoaks has a genuine objection to the insertion of "examine" and "examination" and to new clause 11 which gives the Auditor General the right to carry out that examination perhaps he will let us know what it is. The amendments seem to be so throughly in the spirit of openness and transparency and of objectively independent verification of that the Government are doing, that they should be welcomed by the Committee without much question.
<P>
One reason for making the amendment is that when we came to office we had to have an audit of the previous Government's figures by the National Audit Office because we were so uncertain of them. The clause will ensure that the right approach continues in the future.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 315, in page 139, line 16, leave out "consideration" and insert "examination". [Mr. Geoffrey Robinson.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 164, in page 139, line 16, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5A) It shall be the duty of the Director of the Office for National Statistics to report to the House of Commons on the statistical accuracy, conventions and assumptions of the documents prepared under this section."<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 165, in page 139, line 17, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`and by the Director of the Office of National Statistics under subsection (5A) above'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We have just heard from the Paymaster General how important it is that the Comptroller and Auditor General has proper access to the books when examining the various documents that have been laid under the code for fiscal stability and alongside the code. The amendment would ensure that the director of the Office for National Statistics has similar access and is able to question and query the various statistical[Mr. Fallon]
assumptions involved in the preparation of the documents. The case for the amendment was made by the Paymaster General about five minutes ago when he said how important it is that the Office for National Statistics is consulted and involved. In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford he said that on certain matters the Office for National Statistics decided.
<P>
It is more important than ever to state the role of the Office for National Statistics in statute alongside that of the Comptroller and Auditor General because the Office for National Statistics is now a more independent body. It is right to ensure that it has proper access to query the various assumptions and to check the statistical base of the Government's figures. That is becoming urgent for a number of reasons. A series of events surrounding the Budget has made the Opposition and those outside the House begin to suspect the Government of fiddling their figures. The issue of the definitions under private finance initiative are still subject to argument between the Government and the Accounting Standards Board, as the Paymaster General has just confessed. The classification of the working families tax credit is still subject to argument three months later. That has still not been settled and perhaps the Paymaster General will be able to report some progress on who is winning that argument.
<P>
We recently discussed the definition of school repairs and whether they are classified as current or capital expenditure. That argument was raging a long time ago when I was the Minister responsible for school repairs in the Thatcher era.
<P>
The argument is that the director of the Office for National Statistics should have some sort of right of access as the Comptroller to check the various statistical assumptions and conventions and the accuracy of the figures. If the Paymaster General is in any way disinclined to accept the amendment, we shall be all the more suspicious that the Government are not prepared to have their conventions and assumptions externally validated by an independent body. The amendment is simple and reasonable and I shall have great difficulty in wondering why the Paymaster General is able to resist it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I support my hon. Friend. His point goes beyond what we discussed under the previous amendment.
<P>
A good example of why there is real anxiety is provided by student loans. The Government appear to be selling off the student loan book with substantial guarantees, but are counting on the fact that the Office for National Statistics will deem those guarantees not to count as part of the PSBR unless they are at some point called. Those of us on the Select Committee on Education and Employment, who have considered this issue, are worried that that is contrary to the rules and guidelines that the Office for National Statistics stated when giving evidence to us only a few months ago. The amendment provides an opportunity to ensure proper regulation, without which Government accounts could suddenly be thrown into confusion at some point in the near future. Such confusion would occur if the Office for National Statistics were suddenly to decide that the Government's approach was deeply flawed and that the guarantees were part of the PSBR, which could have a significant effect on the funds available for further education in the Department for Education and Employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No one doubts the skill of the Labour party in spin and presentation, which is why they were so successful at the last general election. Concern exists among Opposition Members and outside the House, however, that that skill is also being applied to the Government's books and records. That concern is felt not only by Members of Parliament but in the real world.
<P>
My hon. Friends have already cited one or two examples, such as the private finance initiative. The Government and the Accounting Standards Board a private sector body that authenticates and draws up rules about accounting practices in the private sector are involved in a row. Why are the Government so determined to win the battle over whether the liabilities created by the private finance initiative should be on the Government's books? The reason is that they want those liabilities off their books; they want to use their powers of manipulation to reduce the debt seen in their books. The Accounting Standards Board thank goodness is sticking to its principles and not allowing the Government to get their way. If they did get their way, the new principles would apply to the private sector and allow a number of private sector companies to shift their liabilities off balance sheet as well. That would lead to many private sector bankruptcies.
<P>
The only way the Government will get away with opposing this accounting treatment exposure draft FRS5 is by not agreeing to adopt it. The Government are not compelled to adopt that exposure draft as they are not covered by the private sector rules. If they did agree to adopt the draft, it would be an embarrassment to them. We would highlight that embarrassment and it would also be highlighted elsewhere. The Government's determination is due to their desire to manipulate the level of debt downwards.
<P>
Another example referred to by my hon. Friends is the Government guarantee for the £3.8 billion loan for the channel tunnel rail link. It is not to be counted as part of Government debt but included in the consolidated accounts as a contingent liability. It therefore counts as Government debt only if, as has been pointed out, it falls due. If the private sector would not lend £3.8 billion to the channel tunnel rail link consortium without a Government guarantee, that loan must be regarded as a high risk loan. But the Office of National Statistics has assessed the loan and stated that the risk is sufficiently low that it will not be called in and that it should not be regarded as part of the public sector borrowing requirement or as a Government debt. Those two things do not stack up, which is why the Opposition would like to examine and to question the assumptions used by the Office for National Statistics, which led to the ruling that the debt should not count as part of Government debt. If the loan had been guaranteed by a bank or by a consortium of private investors instead of by the Government, guaranteeing rather than providing somebody else's loan, the liability would be included on the liability side of the balance sheets of the organisation or bank. If that could and should apply to the private sector, it should also apply to the Government.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We move on to the working families tax credit, which is a wonderful sleight of hand by the Government. They have managed to convert billions of pounds of expenditure on family credit into a tax reduction. The element of family credit that has been turned into the working families tax credit, which is paid to working spouses as a reduction in their income tax bill, is no longer to be regarded as public expenditure. It will now be regarded as tax forgone and as a reduction in income tax raised. No change has occurred, and expenditure is higher under the working families tax credit. The Government have changed the level of expenditure and the income tax raised, simply by changing the accounts. The policy has another advantage, as it reduces the tax burden. The Government are spending billions of pounds more, and yet have reduced the tax burden because of the way in which the spending is accounted for, and by the manipulation of accounts. The Government may come back and say that that is the method used for MIRAS, but that is different, because MIRAS was never public expenditure in the past.
<P>
Why do not the Government, for example, change the method of paying the basic state pension? Perhaps I should not continue. I am giving them more ideas on how to manipulate the accounts.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman should not continue too much further on that line. We are getting a little wide of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was raising the matter because I want the assumptions to be addressed. It could be that the Government convert other expenditure into credit by, for example, paying child benefit to the working spouse and reducing his income tax bill using the same technique. Another example is capital versus revenue, which the Committee discussed. The windfall tax and associated spending are also relevant, and seem to be excluded from what is now called the public sector net cash requirement in tables 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the new economic and fiscal strategy report. Why have both the taxation and spending sides of the policy been removed? Why should not those figures be included in the figures to which everybody refers?
<P>
Finally, why have the Government ended the concept of control totals? We are now faced with total managed expenditure, departmental expenditure limits and annual managed expenditure. Yet the control total was enormously successful, and was a system introduced by the previous Government. Goldman Sachs, one or two partners of which are closely associated with the Government, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is not obvious why the Control Total system has been scrapped, particularly as this method of controlling public expenditure has been a resounding success. The Control Total could easily have been split between current and capital spending."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The organisation is anxious about the end of that control total. I am very concerned about the Government's general manipulation of the accounts. The same concern is felt outside the House, by the City of London and by business generally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> In previous sittings, the Opposition tried to develop this leitmotif by saying that the Government were pushing through the House regulations which were subject to negative resolution much more frequently than previous Governments. So much did they harp on about that that I had the matter examined. It was clear that that was far from true because fewer regulations are being dealt with in that way. In certain respects the provisions deal with less sensitive issues than in previous Finance Bills. Hon. Members shake their heads, but those are the facts and figures.
<P>
Similarly, the Opposition have just given a totally cooked up and fictitious account of national accounts being handled differently by the Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. What is the whole purpose of "The Code for Fiscal Stability"? What is the purpose of involving the National Audit Office in ensuring that the assumptions and conventions that the Government are building in are correct and accord with the traditions of international and national accounting conventions?
<P>
I understand that a review of the Office for National Statistics is under way to ensure that it is properly established with the right degree of independence. I do not want to anticipate the outcome of that review, except to say that we all have a vested interest in ensuring that the ONS is properly independent of any Government and does not experience the manipulation that the previous Government used on employment figures in successive years when they were trying to massage them downwards. Those are precisely the tactics that we want to avoid. That is why our call is always for transparency in the first instance.
<P>
I shall take just one or two of the examples that were mentioned not all of them were strictly relevant to the amendment. The Education (Student Loans) Bill is entirely in line with national accounting conventions; there is no problem with that.
<P>
I referred to the next point in an anticipatory reply to the hon. Member for Cotswold and promised a note in due course on a slightly related matter. There is a big issue about FRS5. Not just the Government, but quite a lot of industry has a point of basic discussion with Professor Tweedie. That is correct. I do not know on which side of the argument various accounting houses will come down, but I know that we are trying to sort out the issue. There is no question of the Government trying to locate borrowing off balance sheet. Our levels are, as the hon. Member for Guildford said, much lower than in France or Germany. There has been no change in the treatment since the Government took office.
<P>
On the channel tunnel rail link, I should tell the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that it is not just an issue of risk; there is also the question of the financing costs that a Government guarantee can ease. I am sure that they were one of the factors that made it possible for us to rescue yet another total Tory mess up. The financing of the channel tunnel rail link was done on an unsustainable basis. We told them at the time that it would never fly, but they would not listen and pushed it through, fudging the figures for political reasons. We have had to pick up the mess, and we shall have a[Mr. Geoffrey Robinson]
workable scheme for the channel tunnel rail link as a result.
<P>
I have said enough to make it clear that we are fully behind the proper independence and correctness of the ONS. No hon. Member has so far mentioned this, but the amendment would substitute the ONS for the National Audit Office. Perhaps there is some confusion about their roles. The National Audit Office is perfectly competent to carry out the auditing role; we have given it the right to do that, we have extended it and we have put the word "examine" into the Bill. That is all as a result of proper consultation and listening. I noted that, quite properly, no Opposition Member opposed the Government amendment and I imagine that that will be the case with the new clause that enables the National Audit Office to do the job I have described.
<P>
The ONS has a different job, which relates to terminology and the treatment of certain things. It is separate from the NAO, but they can consult if they think that there is an overlap. The hon. Member for Cotswold made a fair point about FRS5 and the treatment of leases and assets, and the NAO and ONS can consult on those. There is no problem about that. The position of the ONS will be clarified once the review is complete.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members can see that the amendments are again unnecessary and inappropriate. If pushed to a vote, we will resist them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The reason for the amendments is that, under the clause, we are getting not transparency, but a whole series of documents. The title of the clause is "Annual Budget documents". We are getting a code for fiscal stability, a pre-Budget report, a financial statement and Budget report, an economic and fiscal strategy report, and a debt management report I hope that there will be a paper management report after all that printing. We are getting far more reports than we used to. It is important to ensure the external validity of the assumptions that underlie them.
<P>
I did not buy the argument that the National Audit Office can be responsible for all that. It is not within its remit to check the statistical conventions; indeed, the Paymaster General accepted that. He said that the National Audit Office and the Office for National Statistics have separate and different roles. It is not enough to say, "If there's an overlap, they can consult." We want the director of the Office for National Statistics to have the same right of access as the Comptroller and Auditor General when it comes to checking that the documents have been prepared properly.
<P>
Given the fiddles that we have seen already, it is right to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 316, in page 139, line 27, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". (10) All economic forecasts and fiscal projections contained in the documents mentioned in subsection (1) above shall be updated and published by the Treasury, after being independently audited by the National Audit Office, not less than two weeks before the date of a General Election.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment continues the tradition established by the Liberal Democrats in this Committee of opposing the Government in a constructive manner. It follows on from our general support for the "The Code for Fiscal Stability" and the documentary requirements set out in the clause. However, the amendment would improve both the code and those requirements.
<P>
We agree that there is a need to improve transparency and promote stability. The amendment would take that further by ensuring that that is done directly before an election, by requiring the updating and publication of the key elements of the annual Budget documents the economic forecasts and fiscal projections just before polling day.
<P>
The amendment would enhance accountability. It is vital that information is updated before a general election and set before the electorate. That would promote stability and prevent Governments arguing on the basis of disputed figures just before an election. It would ensure that figures in the general election debate would be agreed and up to date.
<P>
We agree that transparency and the other principles set out in the code are vital and that history has shown the need for them. However, we want to introduce the link with elections because of experience. Before the 1992 general election, I had the good fortune to work as economic adviser to my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). I helped him to analyse the Budget presented by the former right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames, Mr. Norman Lamont, who published a Budget two days before the 1992 general election was called. In that Budget he slashed income tax, introducing a 20p rate, and at the same time produced a forecast of £23 billion for the PSBR for that financial year. He claimed that his fiscal policy was responsible, fair and prudent. The PSBR for that financial year, however, turned out to be a massive £50 billion.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is what the Conservatives did two days before the general election was called, and we must prevent any future Chancellor from being able to do it again. The 1992 general election was fought on a false prospectus. The Conservatives fiddled the figures; they cooked the books. In doing so, they deliberately misled the electorate. That should not be allowed to happen again.
<P>
The code represents a welcome, and large, first step towards preventing such a repetition. However, our modest amendment suggests that it should go a little further. The Committee has heard how "The Code for Fiscal Stability" has drawn on New Zealand's Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 many elements have been borrowed from that interesting piece of legislation. That Act imposes a requirement on the New Zealand Government to do what our amendment proposes.
<P>
In conclusion, the advantages of the amendment would be huge. It would assist informed debate during the general election period, rebuild voters' trust in Government publications and prevent new Governments from claiming that they have just realised that they cannot fulfil their manifesto promises because the fiscal figures do not add up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That sounds familiar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that it sounds familiar. I hope that he will therefore support our amendment. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for long on this point, other than to say that we are grateful to Liberal Democrat Members for welcoming "The Code for Fiscal Responsibility" and the general transparency with which we are conducting fiscal and monetary policy, such as the changes regarding the publication of the Bank of England's minutes and voting records. That process has gone much further than anyone would have expected in the course of one short year of Government. Among the many congratulations that have been sent to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was one from New Zealand's Minister of Finance, Mr. Birch. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"First of all I would like to congratulate you and your Government for the bold initiatives taken towards macroeconomic policy reforms. The proposed Code is certainly an essential element of the reform process. In this respect your interest in our Fiscal Responsibility Act is much appreciated ... Transparency, which you have aptly put down as the first principle in the Code, has been a critical element of our fiscal management."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are prepared not only to consult and to listen we are also prepared to learn from other countries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Paymaster General just said that he is glad to learn. Would he then be glad to learn from my party, the Liberal Democrats, who went into the general election stating categorically that we would constitute an independent central bank?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There is so little to learn from the Liberal Democrats, and yet such a variety of advice coming from them, that one does not know quite what to pick. One of my hon. Friends on the Committee has costed one of their programmes at £16 billion. The physical proximity of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham must be infectious. No doubt we see there a potential recruit for the Liberal Democrats. In all honesty, I do not think there is much requirement for the proposal; no other Government have conducted policy with such transparency and for the long term. We have the Budget report, and the pre-Budget report, which are detailed documents and, by any definition, the longest period between the issuing of such documents and an election is only six months. The hon. Gentleman wants the period to be shorter.
<P>
We have legislated for a fiscal code and for a report on economic and fiscal strategy. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks may have been tempted to say that too much information was provided; I would not say that and, again, I commend to the Committee the fiscal policy report entitled "Lessons from the last economic cycle", which bears re-reading.
<P>
I cannot accept the amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will not press it to a Division as there will not be much support for it. There has been little support for similar amendments previously, but there may be nothing further that I can do to deter him from dividing the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am extremely disappointed with the Paymaster General's reply, especially as he read out a letter from Bill Birch, the New Zealand Minister of Finance. My hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) and I had the privilege of going to New Zealand to discuss with politicians and civil servants in the Treasury their experiences of legislation and to learn lessons to apply here. Had the Paymaster General asked Bill Birch about publishing and updating economic forecasts and fiscal projections prior to a general election, his answer would probably have been that it was an important part of New Zealand legislation. I am sure that the Paymaster General was not quoting selectively from the letter, but the problem is that the Government are dipping in and taking the New Zealand legislation selectively. We are asking the Paymaster General to learn a lesson from the New Zealanders; the amendment would make a valuable contribution to public finances and Government documents in key electoral periods by making them much more transparent.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Would Opposition Members indeed, all Committee members please refrain from exchanges and conversation during a Division. It makes it extremely difficult for the Clerk and it must stop.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammon </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I should like to make just one point on clause 152. Subsection (1) lays out a requirement for certain documents to be prepared and laid before Parliament, but missing from that list is any reference to a green book evaluating the environmental impact of the Budget.
<P>
I am sorry that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is not here today because you may remember, Mr. Butterfill, that back on 12 May when you were again in the Chair I reminded the Financial Secretary that she had given a commitment as recently as last July that the Government would publish along with the Red Book a green book evaluating the environmental impact of the Budget. In fact, all we got was a single table on page 158 of the Red Book.
<P>
Thus, in less than a year we have seen the Government's green rhetoric evaporate from a full Budget book of equal standing, and to be published simultaneously, with the Red Book, to nothing. Clause 152 is the perfect way for the Government to enshrine their commitment to evaluating and publishing the environmental impact of the Budget each year. It could have gone in as paragraph (d) of subsection (1), but it did not. Will the Paymaster General explain how that Government commitment has evaporated so quickly and so completely?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary cannot be here because she is chairing an important EC Committee.
<P>
There is no environmental green book per se we have been over that already. However, there is a clear analysis in the Red Book and it is obvious from what I said earlier that all the measures we have taken illustrate our intentions with regard to the environment. No Government have greener credentials than this Government.
<P>
Clauses 151 and 152 deal with important matters relating to "The Code of Fiscal Stability" and the Government's economic management. Naturally we will consult on the environment. I have already explained to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that the Green Paper "Opportunities for Change", which we have put out for consultation, will pull all that together. The subject cannot be limited to these clauses it runs across the whole Government. I urge the hon. Gentleman to co-operate with the pattern of consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment. The hon. Gentleman will find that we have a clear commitment not only to the environment and policies benefiting it, but to the co-ordination of such policies across Government Departments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I hope that the Paymaster General is not downgrading the importance of environmental accountability. As was clear in the Environmental Audit Select Committee hearings, before the election the Labour party's environment spokesman, backed up by his colleagues, promised that a green book would be published with every Budget. That has not happened we have seen only a weak version amounting to just a few pages. Will the Paymaster General admit that his Government have gone back on that key pledge?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> All I have to admit is that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham is a late convert to the Liberal Democrat school of spend, spend, spend. We note that he thought that £500 million for transport

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will not give way. We are beginning to waste time.
<P>
No Government have committed themselves more fully than we have. It is clearly stated in the economic and fiscal strategy report how the impact of environmental matters has to be tied into Treasury policies. That is part of Treasury objectives. There is no need to do what Opposition Members suggest. What the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said has been noted. I do not doubt his sincere concern or that of his hon. Friend the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, who is a member of that Select Committee.
<P>
The environmental assessment in the Red Book clearly shows that Budget measures will improve local air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There can be no doubt about that or our commitment to Government targets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster General has singularly failed to answer the charge. In terms of spin, the Government have shot themselves in the foot. They had a perfect opportunity to include in the clause the requirement to produce an environmental impact assessment and lay it before Parliament. The Financial Secretary said in July 1997 that the Government would do that in this Budget, but they have failed to do so. Environmental groups throughout Britain, which are already extremely disappointed with the gap between the Government's rhetoric in opposition and the reality of what they have done in this Finance Bill, will draw their own conclusion about the reality of the Government's commitment to the environment.

<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 92, in page 142, line 14. leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"annulment in pursuance of a" and insert "affirmative".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford for allowing me to move the amendment which is tabled in his name. I look forward to his contribution.
<P>
If you permit me to go a little wide of the amendment, Mr. Butterfill, we will not seek a debate on clause stand part. I make that request because the issue of secondary legislation that is raised by the clause illustrates a more general point about the Bill. The amendment would replace the requirement to follow negative resolution procedure with the requirement to follow positive resolution procedure. We did not raise that matter when we debated other clauses, although it applies to many parts of the Bill, because we knew that this clause was a particularly good example of the use of secondary legislation.
<P>
It is not just me and my hon. Friends who have noticed a step change in the Government's use of secondary legislation. The Government may say that previous Governments have made equal use of secondary legislation and of legislation that is approved by negative resolution. That may be true in terms of numbers but it is our contention that the Government are setting a precedent and that new provisions are subjected to secondary legislation rather than to the scrutiny to which a Bill is subjected.
<P>
Many outside commentators have noticed that, but I shall mention only the Law Society's submission. It pointed out that there is an entirely legitimate use of secondary legislation for "administrative or management matters", and I endorse that. However, it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We condemn an approach which permits substantive matters to be dealt with in that way."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It drew attention to clauses 30, 87 and 158, which we are currently debating. It pointed out that clause 30, which deals with corporation tax, will allow the Government to set the date of payment by regulation, and that that is not simply an administrative matter huge sums of money are at stake. By altering the payment date for interim payments, the Government will raise £2 billion a year. The Law Society deprecatesthe fact that the date and that tax-raising power will not be scrutinised by the House.
<P>
The Law Society goes on to observe that clause 87, which deals with personal portfolio bonds,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is an even worse example."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We discussed that clause earlier and I do not intend to repeat our debate but we discovered that the Government were using wholly oppressive measures effectively to penalise holders of those bonds their proposal went well beyond what was needed to block an avoidance route. The proposal was lost in the House of Lords, so the Government returned to Parliament to get powers, but using secondary legislation.
<P>
I move on quickly, you will be pleased to hear, Mr. Butterfill to clause 158, which the Law Society said was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"objectionable in that it contains a regulation-making power which delegates to the Treasury the power to impose a charge to tax. Such a power appears to be unprecedented."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The use of secondary legislation is of some antiquity, although it has always been controversial. The House of Commons Library has helpfully supplied me with several research papers, which showed that the matter has engaged Parliament's attention on a good many occasions. For instance, in 1929 the Donoughmore committee was set up by Parliament to examine the question of Ministers' powers. It reported in 1932, and it examined in particular the so-called Henry VIII powers, of which clause 158 is a good example. The Committee may be interested to learn that the power gets its name obviously from the monarch of that name because he used the Statute of Proclamations 1539 to legislate by proclamation without reference to Parliament or to anyone else. When the old rogue died eight years later it was repealed but during those years of his reign he was able to legislate simply by issuing a proclamation in his name.
<P>
The Donoughmore committee was set up because it was thought that similar provisions and powers were on occasion being taken by modern Governments in other words, that they were using subordinate or secondary legislation to amend or repeal primary legislation. That is clear in clause 158(4)(b), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The power to make regulations under this section includes . . . power to amend or repeal any enactment".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is practically a definition of a Henry VIII clause.
