						<a name="07012577000413"></a>
							<b class="B">Michael
Gove</b> (Surrey Heath) (Con): It is entirely understandable
that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington should have risen at
that point because when the clock stopped at five o&#146;clock last
week, he was frozen in the middle of what I considered to be an
exemplary analysis of the requirement for the Mayor of London and the
Greater London authority to have a water sewerage strategy.</div>
					<a name="07012577000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Talking of
things being frozen, many of us might remember that in April 2006 there
was a magnificent ice sculpture on the other side of the Thames that
contained galleries, a bar, an auditorium and, of course, a skating
rink. To construct that magnificent ice sculpture and provide that
tourist attraction, it was necessary to have 200,000 litres of water
frozen. What was striking was that the water was not British, but had
had to be imported from Canada simply to provide that attraction and
amenity for London citizens. I mention that because London, like many
parts of east and south-east England, is in the grip of an acute water
shortage.</div>
					<a name="07012577000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Just one
month after we all enjoyed the ice installation, the Environment Agency
pointed out that there is less water in London, per head of population,
than in parts of the Sudan, Morocco, Egypt and Kenya. When one thinks
of the water situation, particularly given the last couple of weeks,
they are probably more inclined to think of flooding, inundation and
the effect that they have on homes and other insured properties.
Flooding is certainly a problem across the country, but the acute water
shortage faced by Londoners is chronic and goes beyond seasonal
alterations in
rainfall.</div>

							<a name="07012577000415"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am well aware that the ban has been lifted and I
am very grateful for it. I am particularly grateful that Sutton and
east Surrey had their ban lifted, allowing the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington to water his garden this weekend, if he so
wishes. However, he will not need to, for the reasons that I mentioned
earlier&#151;we had rather a lot of rainfall in Surrey, where I was
lucky enough to spend the weekend. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon.
Member for Chatham and Aylesford, from a sedentary position, refers to
Surrey, where I spent many happy hours.</div>
					<a name="07012577000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Funnily enough, on Friday
night, while other hon. Members were perhaps watching &#147;Ugly
Betty&#148; or &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148;, I was presiding
over a flood 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 343</div>forum dealing with issues of flooding that have afflicted many parts of
south-east England. But as I said, while climate change can lead to
flooding in some parts of the country, it is also contributing directly
to the water shortages being faced by
Londoners.</div>

						<a name="07012577000416"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush)
(Lab): I rise in part to query whether the hon. Gentleman
writes his speeches. I thought that they were more streams of
consciousness. On London&#146;s water problems, does he agree that if
one single factor contributes to it, it is privatisation? My problems
with Thames Water are mainly down to the fact that its ownership
changes regularly and that the priorities of the management are always
its share price and investors, not the people to whom they supply
water.</div>
					
					<a name="07012577000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000417"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point in
attempting to row back on privatisation. Of course, the question that
we must ask is whether it is now Government policy to invest a
considerable amount of public money in renationalising those
companies.</div>
					<a name="07012577000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I incline
to the view&#151;I think it is also Government policy&#151;that
privatisation can bring particular benefits, but one needs a strong and
effective regulator and a clear role for publicly accountable and
elected representatives. On the specific point about Thames Water, the
company faces real problems in delivering water to Londoners and I am
aware that it loses something like 197 million gallons of water every
day. However, one point that we must bear in mind is that the
infrastructure of Thames Water has suffered because of a lack of
investment over many years, indeed over generations, in London&#146;s
water and sewerage infrastructure. That lack of investment pre-dates
privatisation.</div>
					<a name="07012577000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of
the arguments for privatisation, not just of water but of railways, was
that private companies could bring capital in, which would enable them
to invest in upgrading an infrastructure that had been neglected when
water and rail were in public ownership. An argument that transcends
party politics&#151;it is now just a matter of accepted common
sense&#151;is that, when certain utilities are in public ownership,
what one may apparently gain in terms of public accountability, one
also loses in certain respects. That is because it is sometimes the
more unfashionable utilities&#151;utilities that must rely on
Treasury funding to ensure that their infrastructure is up to
scratch&#151;that lose out in the allocation of public money. That
has certainly been the case when one looks at the history of both water
and rail in this country. During the period when British Rail was
nationalised and water was a utility in public hands, I would submit
that both parties&#151;Labour and the Conservatives&#151;failed to
invest adequately. Since privatisation, private sector capital has
played a part in improving the water
infrastructure.</div>
					<a name="07012577000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
entirely sympathise with the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and
Shepherd&#146;s Bush when he argues that there is a lot more that
Thames Water can do. Thames Water serves my constituents in the same
way that it serves Londoners, and it is undoubtedly the case that many
of my constituents would like to see Thames Water raise its
game.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 344</div>
					<a name="07012577000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">One way that Thames Water could
be more effectively equipped to raise its game would be if it operated
in partnership with a Mayor who had the power to set a strategic water
and sewerage policy. New clause 7 would give the Mayor that power. In
many respects, it is complementary to new clause 6. Although vanity of
ownership would incline me to believe that new clause 7 would be a more
effective way of achieving those aims, if the Government were minded to
accept new clause 6 and reject new clause 7, then, in the spirit of
public-spiritedness, I would entirely acquiesce in that manoeuvre. If
you are the Minister, you pays your money and you takes your choice
between those two options.</div>
					<a name="07012577000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The position that Londoners
face when it comes to their water supply is precisely the type of issue
that should allow us to transcend party political trenches. That is
why, although the Conservatives have been characterised as being
opposed to Mayor Livingstone and anxious to clip his wings, we are
joining the Liberal Democrats in proposing that this Mayor or future
Mayors should have greater power and authority to shape a water
strategy.</div>
					<a name="07012577000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Battersea pointed out that the hosepipe ban has been lifted
recently, and we all welcome that development. However, many of us
would ask why the hosepipe ban, which we would expect to be an
emergency measure introduced only perhaps during the summer or periods
of drought, lasted until the middle of January. Those of us who
remember last summer in London will remember the use of standpipes, the
fact that vans were delivering drinking water to some neighbourhoods
and that those vans had &#147;Ban the drought&#148; on the side of
them. We will all remember the effect that hosepipe bans had on
particular households.</div>
					<a name="07012577000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I suspect
that we are also all aware that the level of water usage in London is
particularly high, in both national and European terms, with figures
suggesting that the average Londoner uses between 160 and 170
litres of water a day.</div>
					<a name="07012577000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are already agencies that
have helped to ensure that Thames Water fulfils its obligations, not
just to its shareholders but to its stakeholders, as I am sure the hon.
Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush would wish to see.
Ofwat has made a number of suggestions as to how Thames Water might
raise its game. However, with respect to the hon. Gentleman, Thames
Water is not the only player in this game. There are things that can be
done by others. For example, we can try to ensure that new housing
developments are as water-neutral as possible. We can introduce
measures in such developments that will enable people to monitor more
accurately, and thereby limit, the water that they use without having
an adverse impact on their lifestyle or their family
obligations.</div>
					<a name="07012577000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, London&#146;s water
position links in with the water position of neighbouring areas. To
meet London&#146;s water needs, Thames Water is planning to build a
reservoir in Oxfordshire. It therefore seems appropriate that the Mayor
should have a role in negotiating with other local government and
central Government bodies to ensure that any water strategy for London
is a joined-up
phenomenon.</div>
					<a name="07012577000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
heard earlier in the debates on both planning and housing about how
London, if it is to survive as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 345</div>
						successful global city, will need new housing
development. If it is to have such development and if that development
is not to impact adversely on the quality of life of London&#146;s
existing residents, we need a coherent way of dealing with water and
sewerage supply. Our new clause and that tabled by the Liberal
Democrats offer competing but complementary ways of providing provide
that, and I hope that the Minister will look favourably on either of
the
proposals.</div>

							<a name="07012577000418"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Jim

						</b> Good morning, Lady Winterton. It is a
pleasure to see you this morning, refereeing our final
sitting.</div>
					<a name="07012577000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
new clauses would extend greatly the Mayor&#146;s responsibilities
for energy and water companies. New clause 6 would require him to
detail in his state of the environment report the efficiency of
suppliers of water and energy services in the Greater London area. The
Mayor is already required to report on water quality, emissions to
water, ground water levels, energy consumptions, emissions of
greenhouse gases, and any other matters in relation to Greater London
that he considers appropriate. That requirement already ensures that
the Mayor will be reporting on fundamental energy and water issues
relating to
London.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000419"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> Clearly, the Minister is setting out the effect of
the new clauses, but does he agree that one significant omission in the
Mayor&#146;s responsibilities is water leaks over which he currently
has no
remit?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000420"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I hope to explain later to the hon. Gentleman
why we think that what the Mayor does at present is adequate and why
the additional requirements proposed under new clauses 6 and 7 would be
burdensome, bureaucratic and unnecessary. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman
will attract my attention if I do not respond fully to the issues that
he has
raised.</div>
					<a name="07012577000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is unclear what value the new reporting requirements would add. The new
clause would duplicate the ongoing work carried out by the economic
regulators for such sectors. Extensive reports on the efficiency of
water and sewerage companies are already published by Ofwat. Each year,
water companies in England and Wales, the Environment Agency and the
drinking water inspectorate provide information to Ofwat on the
performance of companies against various aspects of service and
performance. Through that process, Ofwat can make comparisons and
assess publicly the efficiency of individual companies against

similarly oversees the efficiency of the national transmission and
regional distribution of energy in the United Kingdom, and the
operation of effective competition in the UK wholesale and retail
energy markets. It ensures that suppliers meet environmental
obligations, for example under the energy efficiency commitment. Ofgem
produces regular reports on the state of competition and quality of
service in the United Kingdom energy
markets.</div>
					<a name="07012577000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The interests
of London water and energy consumers in respect of the companies that
serve them are already defended ably by Ofwat, the Consumer Council for
Water, Ofgem and, pending the creation of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 346</div>
						a new consumer body that will replace it,
Energywatch. The Secretary of State has also directed the Consumer
Council for Water to maintain a statutory regional committee in the
Thames area. It is difficult to see how providing the Mayor with
similar duties in respect of water and energy companies could be
justified.</div>
					<a name="07012577000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New
clause 6 would simply create additional bureaucracy and, I suggest,
could be seen to be a waste of public funds. It would also give the
assembly powers to require water and energy regulators to appear before
it and to produce documents. Currently, the assembly has powers to
summon certain categories of people to give evidence at its meetings
and to produce documents as we discussed earlier in Committee. However,
at present. they are people with whom it has a direct relationship,
such as assembly members and
contractors.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07012577000378"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="07012577000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
new proposed power is wide-ranging and would set an important
precedent, significantly widening the power of the assembly to require
organisations working in London, with which it does not have such a
direct relationship, to appear before it. It would also be an entirely
new departure to extend the power to national and independent economic
regulators who, by virtue of their statutory duties, are answerable to
Parliament rather than the assembly. Those regulators regularly appear
before various Committees of the House to report on their functions.
Water and energy companies also occasionally appear before Committees
to contribute to other aspects of those Committees&#146;
work.</div>
					<a name="07012577000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 7
will give the Mayor a duty to produce and keep under review a water and
sewerage strategy that will include proposals and policies for ensuring
that the water and sewerage infrastructure is able to cope with
&#147;actual and planned&#148; developments. That would, in effect,
make the Mayor another water regulator in an already heavily regulated
area. The water sector in England has three core regulators: Ofwat, in
relation to economic regulation; the drinking water inspectorate, which
looks after drinking water quality; and the Environment Agency, which
is responsible for water resources and the
environment.</div>
					<a name="07012577000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
development, the Environment Agency is already a statutory consultee in
relation to sewerage infrastructure and water and sewerage companies
are consulted locally when new developments are being considered. The
Environment Agency advised Ministers as recently as last September that
large-scale water transfers for south-east England are not currently
necessary before 2025. However, development matters relating to water
and sewerage infrastructure are already under consideration by
regulators and the companies. Water companies already produce long-term
water resources management plans and that is due to become a statutory
requirement, with effect from April this year. Those statutory plans,
which will be published, already make provision for additional people
living in and around London and the
south-east.</div>
					<a name="07012577000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulation of water is also more complex than that of other utilities.
Regulation is based on water company areas, which are largely based on
river catchment boundaries rather than political borders. Any policies
or proposals that meant increased expenditure in London, for example,
by Thames Water, would have an impact on the water bills of all Thames
Water customers, including those outside the Mayor&#146;s
jurisdiction.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 347</div>
					<a name="07012577000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The net effect of new clause 7
on the regulation of water would be to reduce the discretion of
regulators and water companies without giving the Mayor any additional
real powers. It would also duplicate much of what happens already. It
is possible that there would be implications for customers who fell
outside the Mayor&#146;s
jurisdiction.</div>
					<a name="07012577000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the Mayor intends to produce a non-statutory water
action framework for London. That could usefully add to the debate on
water resources and water efficiency. The Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has already said that he will take
that into account in the run-up to the next price review for the water
sector. I hope that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington will
ask leave to withdraw the motion and
clause.</div>

					<a name="07012577000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise for
not welcoming you to the Chair at the beginning of the sitting, Lady
Winterton. I was temporarily distracted by the confusion, as much in my
mind as in that of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, about
which of us was speaking at the moment when the clock froze the debate
last Thursday. I associate myself with the Minister&#146;s
comments&#151;it is a great pleasure to see you refereeing what I
suspect will be the final stages of our
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="07012577000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 15 is an attempt to deal explicitly with a controversy that has
arisen around this Mayor. It has been our intention throughout the
debate to separate as much as possible the personality of this
incumbent from the broader office of the Mayor, for obvious reasons.
However popular this incumbent might have been, one cannot expect him
to continue in office throughout our lifetime, and we need legislation
that is appropriate for whoever might occupy the office. Inevitably,
though, for as long as there has been a mayoral office in London, Ken
Livingstone has been the occupant, and his exercise of those powers has
to an extent defined in the public mind what the Mayor&#146;s job
could and should
be.</div>
					<a name="07012577000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
legitimate controversy about many of the Mayor&#146;s decisions and
the powers that he has exercised. We have had an opportunity to revisit
some of those matters&#151;the congestion charge, housing,
planning&#151;and we accept, although we as Conservatives might take
a different view, that the Mayor is within his rights to exercise the
powers allotted to him by the House to shape London in line with the
vision that is his mandate.</div>
					<a name="07012577000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we are genuinely
concerned that the Mayor is overreaching himself by attempting to use
the office of Mayor of London&#151;and, by association, the prestige
of our capital city&#151;to pursue a foreign policy that is out of
kilter with the views of a majority of Londoners and in opposition to
the Government&#146;s own stated goals. We are all aware that in the
1980s various local authorities attempted to use public money to
effectively turn local authorities into lobbying groups for
international policies. There were lively debates about whether that
spending was legitimate or ultra vires. The new clause would clarify
for this Mayor and, if the Government are willing, other local
government figures, what is legitimate in spending on contact with
foreign cities and other
nations.</div>
					<a name="07012577000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
entirely appropriate for this Mayor and other local figures to develop
close ties and bonds with comparable cities and bodies in other nations
to help them in the exercise of their duties. Whether it be town 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 350</div>
						twinning, visiting other cities that have hosted the
Olympics or travelling to New York or Sydney to discover how one city
hones its policing or another its planning policies, such activities
are entirely legitimate. There has recently been controversy about the
amount of time that the Mayor spends in the air, and the Greater London
assembly has pointed out that in the past year he has been responsible
for something like 13 or 14 intercontinental flights. It is
not our business on this occasion to object to the Mayor travelling: it
is how he uses his journeys abroad that concerns
us.</div>

views that we object to as when they conflict with his primary duty to

relating to a bus route in my constituency, the C1. Everybody
was there: myself, the two leaders of the council, the neighbouring

						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I
shall come to the role that the Mayor envisaged Venezuela playing in
London. One of the technical problems with the Mayor&#146;s attempted
oil deal with Venezuela, which on the surface might have been
attractive to some Londoners, was that any petrol that he managed to
secure would have been subject to excise duty and other taxation. That
would have meant that any saving for Londoners was minimal. Whether
those excise duties are too high is a matter for the Treasury. I simply
point out that, not for the first time, the Mayor was on a
fool&#146;s errand in economic
terms.</div>
					<a name="07012577000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman and I have mentioned Cuba and Venezuela, and we must address
how the Mayor has used his office to carve out a distinctive foreign
policy for London. It is not one that reflects particularly well on
London, because there has been a striking connection between the people
whom he has seen. He has sought to use the prestige of his office and
the money of London taxpayers to support and burnish the reputation of
some of the least attractive leaders in the world. Cuba is a country
that, for understandable reasons, occupies an honoured place in the
minds of some people on the radical left. It is entirely understandable
that the romance of the Cuban revolution, which led to the replacement
of the Batista regime, can still entrance and enchant some. The reality
of the revolution is now the betrayal of many dreams: the incarceration
of gay men and women, the suppression of dissent and the limiting of
political freedom where it matters
most.</div>

						</b> I fear that the hon. Gentleman might be falling
into the trap that he accuses the Mayor of falling into. I am not sure
why the history of the Cuban revolution is relevant to the Bill. I hold
no brief for Hugo Chavez, but I can see why the Mayor might sympathise
with a left-wing politician who has been the subject of vilification
and abuse by extreme right-wing forces for a long time. I am not aware
that there are any plans by the Conservative party to kidnap the Mayor
of London in a coup, as happened to Senor Chavez, but if it does
happen, I hope that my constituents will march peaceably on central
office until he is released.</div>

Minister for Europe wrote:</div>

subject to right-wing vilification was intended to allow us to see Ken
and Fidel in the same light. If it was not, all I can say is that he
should have made it clearer who he was talking about. I hope that he
and other hon. Members will join me in making clear our unhappiness
about what has been happening for the past 20 years in Cuba under Fidel
and his associates. I mentioned the incarceration of homosexuals.

						</b> I certainly will, Lady Winterton. I am grateful to
you for that gentle reminder. However, Cuba is material to the exercise
of the Mayor&#146;s powers because, as we know, he recently travelled
to Cuba and, when he did so, he made a conspicuous and deliberate
choice about whom he saw when he was there. He deliberately chose to
see a group of individuals who were family relations to those known as
the Miami five. The individuals whom he saw were the relatives of those
who had been arrested by America on suspicion of terrorist
activity.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 352</div>
					<a name="07012577000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It could be
argued that it was fair enough for the Mayor to have spent some time
visiting those people but it is striking that when he was in Cuba, he
did not choose to see the women in white&#151;the recipients of the
Sakharov prize given by the European Parliament to those who have
genuinely been struggling for human rights. The women in white are the
relatives of 75 distinguished liberal academics and
journalists incarcerated by Fidel Castro for speaking up for human
rights. The question that we have to ask is what message does it send
when the Mayor makes such a decision? If he is going to spend public
money travelling to Cuba, we have a right to ask why he is using our
council tax to fund that jaunt. When the Mayor goes to Cuba and the
people whom he chooses to visit are those who support repression and
the people whom he chooses to shun are those who champion democracy, we
have to say that London&#146;s reputation suffers as a
result.</div>
					<a name="07012577000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
just Cuba: the Mayor&#146;s thwarted intention to travel to
Venezuela, alluded to by both the hon. Members for Carshalton and
Wallington and for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush, also
raises troubling questions. The president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez,
with whom he was attempting to negotiate a particular oil deal, is an
individual who recently embraced Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the President of
Iran, and made common cause with him. As I am sure the Committee knows,
Ahmadinejad is a holocaust denier who said that Israel should be wiped
off the face of the map. Is it appropriate for the Mayor of London to
champion someone like Chavez, who is happy not only to share a platform
with a holocaust denier, but to embrace
him?</div>

regime in Chile was a gross abuse of human rights. There is now a
welcome greater recognition across the parties that human rights are
integral to any modern foreign policy. If are talking about the sins of
the fathers, I point out that it was a Labour Government who enabled
President Ceausescu to come here to meet the Queen and to receive an
honour. In that respect there are skeletons in both parties&#146;
closets. My point, which goes to the heart of the new clause, is that
whatever past Conservative or Labour Governments might have done, they
were the duly elected Governments of their country with the
responsibility to discharge foreign policy, and both were subsequently
defeated at the ballot box. The difference with the Mayor is that he is
attempting to frame his own foreign policy when it is entirely outside
the scope of the office that was originally
envisaged.</div>

								Michael
Gove:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes an absolutely valid point. The
embrace of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by Hugo Chavez will have offended the
majority of moderate Muslims in London and given other communities in
London, notably the Hindu, Sikh and Jewish communities, pause for
thought. They might have been inclined to notice that embrace more than
others because of a previous hug that the Mayor himself indulged in. He
physically embraced<b class="B"> </b>Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi<b class="B"> </b>the head of
the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organisation that has extensive
international links. Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi<b class="B"> </b>is on the record
as supporting suicide bombing, the physical chastisement of homosexuals
and of husbands hitting women in the home with an open hand&#151;he
said explicitly that a slap is an acceptable way of enforcing
discipline at home. Most of us would find those views at best mediaeval
and at worst barbaric, yet the Mayor chose deliberately to embrace that
individual as part of what he construed as his own distinctive
contribution to foreign policy.</div>
					<a name="07012577000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon. Friend the Member
for Hammersmith and Fulham says, the expense of bringing Sheikh Yusuf
Al-Qaradawi over here is one thing, but the message that that embrace
sent out about London and what the Mayor of London considered to be an
effective model of multiculturalism is one that many of London&#146;s
minorities found deeply worrying.</div>

will be more than happy to sit down to save myself the bother of
developing the case and the hon. Gentleman the expense in time of
listening to it. However, it is important to rehearse the case because,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham pointed out,
these issues go to the heart of the character of the current incumbent

the hon. Gentleman&#146;s defence. He has sat through the porridge of
the Bill so far and this is his jelly and ice cream; this is what he
enjoys doing. It is a little bit of froth on the top. He dismissed the
comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington,
North rather too lightly. He cannot completely exculpate himself from
his party&#146;s link to, say, the regime of General Pinochet, who
died recently. A great apologist for him, Lord Lamont, said that in
South American terms the 300 or 3,000 people or whatever it was that
Pinochet bumped off was a relatively trivial matter. Is that the
official view of the Conservative party? There is a direct link of
hagiography from Lord Lamont to the right hon. Member for Witney
(Mr. Cameron) to the hon. Gentleman. I think that he ought
to be a little more precise.</div>

Kensington, North, past Conservative Governments have made specific
foreign policy mistakes, some of which I have had the opportunity to
point out elsewhere in Committee. For example, they could be taxed with

								Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful, Lady Winterton. I mentioned the
particular case in response to my hon. Friend the Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham and the concerns of London council tax payers.
One such concern will be the projected cost&#151;&#163;2
million&#151;of a festival that the Mayor proposes to hold in 2009 to
celebrate 50 years of the Cuban revolution. With your permission, Lady
Winterton, I thought it appropriate to outline the Mayor&#146;s views
because I, and many Londoners, consider the nature of many of the
regimes that he has feted to be unacceptable. The money is being spent
on a cause and for a purpose that is entirely out of sympathy with the
views, I believe, of a majority of
Londoners.</div>
					<a name="07012577000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
beginning of my remarks I pointed out that in the 1980s there were
lively debates about whether it was appropriate for local government to
spend taxpayers&#146; money on pursuing foreign policies, or whether
such expenditure was ultra vires. Central to that question was the
importance of drawing a distinction. Local government can legitimately
undertake activities to bolster civic pride and establish commercial
and personal links between particular local government areas and
comparable areas abroad. Twinning and fact-finding missions are
entirely legitimate. What we content is not appropriate is use of the
mayoral office and council tax payers&#146; money on the prosecution
of a foreign policy that runs counter not only to the stated foreign
policy of the Government in power, but to the values that people in
Britain and in London increasingly consider to be integral to civilised
life.</div>
					<a name="07012577000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Mayor of London held a conference on Saturday, entitled &#147;A World
Civilisation or a Clash of Civilisations?&#148; The Mayor used that
conference as a platform to outline some views that I and, I suspect,
the majority of Londoners do not share. I recognise as entirely
legitimate that the Mayor may hold conferences in London on how London,
as a multiracial, multicultural and multi-ethnic city, can be better
governed and more harmoniously led. To do that is entirely within the
ambit and scope of what is appropriate for the Mayor. However, the
present or any future Mayor using public money to travel abroad and
laud regimes that most Londoners and Britons find offensive is not
appropriate, nor is then putting London council tax payers&#146;
money into festivals intended to celebrate the achievements of regimes
that the majority of our fellow citizens consider not worthy of
celebration, but, rather, worthy of working to
change.</div>

brief.</div>
					<a name="07012577000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Surrey Heath is normally very persuasive. However, in the
course of his argument in favour of new clause 15, my position changed
from support to opposition. I might characterise the new clause as the
<i class="I">Evening Standard</i> new clause because it is intended to create a
headline about not wanting a Mayor who spends more time in Havana than
Havering, or more time in Caracas than Kew&#151;a place that the
Mayor has never visited.</div>
					<a name="07012577000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand what the hon.
Gentleman is trying to achieve. He will probably agree with me that in
practice, the present Mayor or a future one will pay for any foreign
escapades at the ballot box. That is the appropriate place to pay for
any excesses. If we examine the proposed new clause, we find that it
would introduce a degree of uncertainty. For instance, it would be
difficult to confirm whether the Mayor has overstepped the mark by
encroaching on something that is primarily the responsibility of the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, or whether the expenditure that he
incurs in co-operating with other major world cities is legitimate. The
hon. Gentleman will realise that if the proposed new clause were
accepted, the Mayor could proceed exactly as now. He would be able to
say that he was having a series of meetings with key people in a major
city, as opposed to encroaching on work that would be better done by
the FCO and the Department for International Development.</div>

							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I shall be brief in
voicing my support for new clause 15 because the basic principles have
been well rehearsed. I am disappointed by what the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington says about it because the Liberal Democrats
in the assembly have condemned some of the Mayor&#146;s more
outlandish escapades just as vigorously as the Conservatives have.
Members of the Labour group on the assembly have looked embarrassed, as
I hope some Government MPs are.</div>
					<a name="07012577000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Mayor&#146;s behaviour is
representative of a cast of behaviour that damages the institution of
the mayoralty. When any Mayor does something that Londoners regard as
wholly off the wall, it causes them to think that everyone at city hall
is a waste of space and to ask what they pay their council tax for.
That is a shame and a matter of regret for those of us who supported
the creation of strategic city-wide governance for London at a time
when it was not fashionable within my party.</div>
					<a name="07012577000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is that the Mayor
damages the argument for having an effective, strategic authority for
London by going off on his digressions. One cannot help but feel that
way. In the eight years the Mayor has been in office, he has visited
Bromley three times and Bexley twice. People in those parts of London
will compare them to the other places the Mayor has visited and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 356</div>question his priorities. That argument is not a game or a bit of
knocking copy. The Mayor not only damages himself at the ballot
box&#151;though I hope he does&#151;but damages the institution,
which is the more serious point. The fact that he does so by visiting
some particularly authoritarian types makes it all the worse.</div>

						I was
particularly concerned about the Mayor&#146;s recent jaunt, which I
raise here because we have not yet had a satisfactory response. I shall
not go into the details of his trip to Cuba, but considering some of
the comments made by Labour Members, it is ironic that when the Mayor
was asked about it in the London assembly meeting, he spent the bulk of
his reply rubbishing the Foreign Office&#146;s considered assessment
of the human rights situation in Cuba. He specifically rubbished
quotations from the Foreign Secretary that I read to him. I simply
throw that into the ether for the consideration of Labour Members so
that they know what their friend is

						The
interesting thing about the Mayor&#146;s attempt to enter into
contractual relationships with the Government of Venezuela was that he
was not dealing with another municipality or city. It was not the sort
of deal that might be done between the Greater London authority and the
authority of Shanghai, New York city, Bombay or another major city. It
was an attempted deal between a local authority in the UK and a
national Government, or at any rate the national corporation that
controls the oil. That is bizarre, and I have not had a satisfactory
answer from the Mayor on whether he sought advice from the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, the Department of Trade and Industry or&#151;I
shall come to my reason for including this last
Department&#151;the Home Office.</div>
					<a name="07012577000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It was not
only the contract that was of concern. The hon. Member for Carshalton
and Wallington might recall that in the assembly debate the leader of
the Green party group made the fair comment that the Mayor did not seem
to understand that oil was not necessarily compatible with a
climate-friendly approach. The Mayor seemed to think that there were

					<a name="07012577000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
final point that it is important to make while the Minister is here
because he might not be aware of it. Many of us were particularly
concerned when the Mayor indicated that he was prepared to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 358</div>enter into an arrangement with the Government of Venezuela to make
available to them Metropolitan police expertise and data on
surveillance, fingerprinting and other technical matters. The
Government of Venezuela&#146;s human rights record has been
criticised by Amnesty International&#151;an organisation with which
the Mayor is not unfamiliar and which can hardly be characterised as
right wing. It is genuinely troubling if a Mayor of London seeks to
make such material available to a foreign Government with a question
mark&#151;to put it mildly&#151;over their human rights record, and
does so without consulting Her Majesty&#146;s Government. That has
implications for Government policy and the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office. There ought to be mechanisms to restrain such behaviour. I have
never succeeded in getting a satisfactory explanation of what attempts,
if any, the Mayor ever made to consult with Her Majesty&#146;s
Government on something that could, for obvious reasons, have damaged
significantly not only London&#146;s reputation, but the United
Kingdom&#146;s. That is why we have proposed the new clause and why I
hope that hon. Members will support it.</div>

							<b class="B">Norman
Baker</b> (Lewes) (LD): First, I apologise to you, Lady
Winterton, and to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath for not being
present for the beginning of his contribution this morning. I am happy
to take part in the debate. Secondly, I wish to defend Conservative
Members. I do not do it very often, but let me do it quickly. The House
of Commons operates a democracy and we are entitled to use the time
available for what we think is appropriate. The Bill has been
timetabled for a particular length of time and if Conservative Members
want to occupy it with the debate that they have introduced this
morning, that is a matter for them. If I may say so, it is not for
others to bring in arguments about how much a particular debate might
cost. That is entirely
inappropriate.</div>
					<a name="07012577000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
defended Conservative Members, I shall now disagree with the case
advanced this morning by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. There is a
danger of confusing the occupant of an office with the office itself.
Comments this morning have been largely critical of the activities of
the Mayor. I am not going to defend his activities in all respects. I
do not think that some of his foreign affairs expeditions and
activities are appropriate. I would even go as far as to use the word
&#147;escapades&#148;, which I think was used by the hon. Member
for Bromley and
Chislehurst.</div>
					<a name="07012577000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee might recall, however, that last week we had a debate on
climate change, during which I argued strongly, as too did Conservative
Members, that it was inappropriate for the Government to set terms of
reference for the Mayor&#146;s climate change strategy and that he
should be free to pursue a policy on, say, energy or transport that
might differ from the Government&#146;s if he thought it appropriate
for London. We argued that the Mayor has his own mandate through the
ballot box and is fit to discharge it, and the people who should judge
whether he discharges it appropriately or whether he is abusing his
position to undertake activities that are irrelevant to London are the
electors of London when they next vote for a Mayor. The same argument
applies
today.</div>
				
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 359</div>
					<a name="07012577000381"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div>
					<a name="07012577000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think
it is appropriate that the Mayor has undertaken some of the activities
he has but he should be free to behave badly, if that is how people
wish to interpret it. He should be free to undertake escapades, to use
the expression of the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. He
should be free to liaise with unpleasant, dictatorial, authoritarian
regimes if he thinks that he should. I happen to think that he is
entirely wrong on that. I think he is entirely out of step with the
people of London in following that course, but he has his mandate to do
so and he will pay the price for that accordingly&#151;and indeed
does pay the price by way of the negative coverage that appears in the
newspapers and the damage to his personal reputation.
</div>
					<a name="07012577000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also think it is
dangerous to try to talk about the regime. We should stick to
principles here. Members have criticised the Mayor for meeting
particular regimes that are authoritarian by nature, as indeed they
are, and which have rather unpleasant aspects to them, but would the
same criticism apply if he met people from Italy or from Canada or from
New Zealand or other countries where the same criticism on the same
human rights basis would not be applicable? I did not hear criticisms
of that. I hope that we are not saying that the Mayor is free to meet
foreign leaders or undertake a foreign policy where Members would not
object to the people he is meeting but not free to meet those to whom
they would object. Surely the principle is whether or not he is free to
undertake meetings at all on a foreign policy basis. I happen to think
that he is because he has his own mandate; because London is a very
important city in the world; and because there is a great deal of
decentralisation in most countries of the world, beyond that which
there is in this country in terms of the power exercised by leaders of
major cities. Indeed, leaders of major cities across the world would
expect the Mayor of London to deal with matters beyond whether the
dustbins are emptied on time. It is a great pity that the Mayor of
London, and indeed our local elected representatives at all levels, do
not have the freedom in this country that they have in other countries,
and we should move towards that.</div>
					<a name="07012577000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be entirely
respectable and understandable if leaders of other major cities in the
world wanted to discuss foreign policy and foreign matters with the
Mayor. As I say, he will pay a price or otherwise for that. I urge
Conservative Members not to play the ball but to play the game, as it
were, on this particular occasion because we had an unfortunate
incident 25 years ago when the then Conservative Government
took great dislike to the same individual, Ken Livingstone, when he was
running the Greater London council. They objected to how he was using
his powers in the Greater London council and the consequence of that
was that Mrs. Thatcher decided to abolish the Greater London
council. In my view, that was an entirely wrong decision to have taken.
She should have criticised the leadership, if she wanted to. She did do
so and I would have to agree with her on many occasions regarding Ken
Livingstone&#146;s activities in that incarnation as leader of the
Greater London council. Just because the occupant at the time was
behaving in a way that many people would find unacceptable, however, is
not a reason to abolish the authority. Similarly, because the present
Mayor of London is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 360</div>to everyone&#146;s taste and is not particularly to mine in many
respects either, that is not a reason to impose curtailing powers on
what a Mayor might do. I ask Members to look at the general principles
rather than the personalities; to consider the principle, apart from
anything else, of devolution and of his own particular accountability
and mandate. For those reasons I cannot support the new
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000489"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> I join other Members in welcoming you back to the
Chair, Lady Winterton. You will be delighted to hear that I am not
going to speak at length and nor am I going to discuss items of foreign
policy because I think that is slightly missing the point about this
amendment. This amendment is in a tradition of regulations governing
local authorities on things like ultra vires. It is about what local
authorities, in this case the GLA, or the Mayor of London can or cannot
spend. The key part, in my view, of this proposed new clause are the
two words &#147;incur expenditure&#148;. I do not think that
anybody is disputing the fact that the present Mayor or future Mayor
or, indeed, anybody here may or may not have views on the big foreign
policy issues of the day. The key question, in my view, is whether he
or she should be allowed to incur expenditure in promoting those views.
I agree with the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's
Bush&#146;s criticism of those at the assembly who sought to initiate
a debate about human rights in Cuba, when real the point was whether
the Mayor should incur expenditure in promoting a particular view about
Cuba. This is really a debate about what local authorities should be
able to spend money
on.</div>
					<a name="07012577000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking
about considerable sums. The conference last Saturday, &#147;A World
Civilisation or a Clash of Civilisations?&#148; to which my hon.
Friend the Member for Surrey Heath referred, was held at lavish expense
at the QEII conference centre; the entire centre was booked out to
discuss foreign policy. An elite panel of speakers from around the
world came to the conference, which included sessions on democracy in
the middle east. I am a huge believer in promoting democracy in that
region, but I have never used council tax payers&#146; money to do
so, which is the key point behind the proposed new clause.</div>
					<a name="07012577000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many council tax payers in
London are feeling the effects of rising council tax, although my own
council, Hammersmith and Fulham, has just achieved a 3 per cent. cut.
Residents are appalled that, at the same time as their hard-working,
newly elected council has achieved that reduction, the Mayor has hiked
his take in the GLA precept by more than 5 per cent. Part of that rise
is undoubtedly due to huge extravagance on the part of the Mayor in
running events such as that at the QEII conference centre.</div>
					<a name="07012577000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am surprised that the Liberal
Democrats do not support the proposed new clause, as it would protect
council tax payers&#146; money. It is in the ultra vires tradition,
in which I assume they believe. It would give protection against local
authorities spending council tax payers&#146; money on things that
were well beyond their remit. I therefore support the proposed new
clause.</div>

							<a name="07012577000490"></a>The
Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):

welcome you to the Chair, Lady Winterton. I will follow your guidance
in refraining from tours of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 361</div>Cuba, Latin America, the Balkans and whatever other countries Opposition
Members may suggest.</div>
					<a name="07012577000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Surrey
Heath has said throughout the passage of the Bill that he does not want
to be capricious, to personalise the debate, or to single out
particular individuals. That is exactly what he has done, however. I
agree with the hon. Member for Lewes that a political debate about an
individual has been confused with a debate on the sensible legislative
proposals that the Committee must consider.
</div>
					<a name="07012577000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham attempted to make the proposed new clause an
issue of principle, which I assume is to distinguish between the
interests of the Foreign Office on one hand and good relations between
cities on the other. I am sure that hon. Members want to be consistent
and, as the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said, would apply
that principle to any mayor, be it the Mayor of London, a borough
mayor, the mayor of a local council or the lord mayor of London. In
order to depersonalise the issue, it is worth considering the impact of
that approach on the lord mayor of London and his foreign visits. In
his speech to the City banquet in September, the lord mayor
said:</div>
					<a name="07012577000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;During
this year so far, some 72 heads of
government...or...ministers from 39 countries have called on
the Lord Mayor...I am in the final stages of an annual programme
of visiting 23.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012577000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an
earlier debriefing after a series of trips, he said:</div>
					<a name="07012577000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Welcome to this debrief
on the Mayoral visits to Kuwait in January; Libya, Tunisia and Malta in
February and Iran; Oman and Qatar in April and

							<a name="07012577000491"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> Fundamentally, the Minister does not understand the
nature of the City of London corporation. The role of the lord mayor of
London is to promote London as a financial centre, which is what the
visits are all about. The visits are paid for by businesses located in
the square mile, which are more than happy to see London promoted as a
financial centre competing with the relative attractions of Frankfurt
and New York. Those visits are very important. It is events such as the
clash of civilisations conference in the QEII conference centre that
she appears to support and that the amendment is seeking to
stop.</div>

the promotion of London, whether as a financial centre, a great
location to do business, the best possible location for the Olympics or
a great capital city. He is absolutely right&#151;we do believe that
that is important. Many of the issues raised by the lord mayor of
London on his overseas trips are ones in which the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office has a strong interest. Many of them could well be
regarded as primarily the responsibility of the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office. The point is that the new clause&#146;s approach
is simply not practical. It is not sensible and confuses personality
debates with the attempt to provide sensible legislation for the future
of the mayoral role.</div>

Linton:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that. Is it not also
true that the lord mayor of the City of London often gives the
impression on foreign trips that he or she is speaking for the entire
population of London? Often they speak not only in the interests of the
City but against, for instance, Canary Wharf in the constituency of my
hon. Friend the Minister for London, which is a competitor to it. The
lord mayor of London often actually damages the interests of the rest
of London, and it is only right in those circumstances that the true
Mayor of London should have the flexibility, when he judges it to be
right, to promote the interests of all Londoners and not just those of
a section.</div>

						</b> It is unfair and wrong of the Minister to seek an
equivalence between the role of the lord mayor of London and the

promoting London as a financial centre, the envy of the world; New York
City has just launched its own large-scale inquiry into why it is
falling behind London as a financial centre. To equate his work in any
way with the activities of the elected Mayor of London and his foreign
policy activities is fundamentally wrong and undermines the role of the
City of London Corporation in promoting Britain as a financial

an indirect compliment to the hard work of the Government&#146;s City
Minister, who has indeed been working hard alongside the lord mayor,
whether in New York or in other countries, to raise issues about the
City. I do not think that the debate is about the individual trips that
any mayor, lord mayor, mayor of a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 363</div>borough or mayor of a council across the country should take. It is
about the appropriate framework for the legislation. We do not think
that it would be appropriate, as Conservative Members seem to be
suggesting, to introduce restrictions on mayors who are directly
elected that we would not introduce on those who are not. On that

						</b> I am disappointed that the Minister declines to
speak warmly of the amendment, let alone to support it. I am surprised
that she seeks to shelter behind the lord mayor&#146;s carriage to
avoid expressing any view on issues of political moment to Londoners.
In a way, I am not surprised that she has done so. It seems to be a
rather tragic example of political cowardice at a time when the country
is crying out for political leadership that she should decline to offer
any opinion about one of this country&#146;s most famous Labour
politicians and his embrace of authoritarian regimes and mediaeval
theocratic ideologues, but I think that Londoners can draw an
appropriate inference from her silence on such matters. Her Pontius
Pilate approach does not reflect well on her or the
Government.</div>
					<a name="07012577000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
quite clear from the Government&#146;s approach that they are
perfectly happy to play a double game. They are happy to allow Ken
Livingstone to run a foreign policy in London in order to gather votes
from one particular constituency and at the same time, with the voice
of the Foreign Office, to run a foreign policy more closely in tune
with the country&#146;s interests. Londoners will draw an appropriate
conclusion about the cynicism of the Government from the way that the
Mayor is operating at a deniable distance for electoral reasons. For
that reason, I believe that this debate has served its purpose. I beg

attention was given to abatement of GLA members&#146; salaries when
the Greater London Authority Act 1999 was considered. The then Minister
for London, the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
(Mr. Raynsford), when pressed by the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), gave good guidance on the
issue of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 364</div>MPs drawing full pay, either as members of the London assembly or indeed
as Mayor, for two public posts. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07012577000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
proper that people should not be paid from the public purse for
performing two functions without an abatement of their

323, c. 568.]</div>
					<a name="07012577000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must declare an interest in
the matter as a member of the London assembly. Currently, assembly
members who are Members of Parliament receive two thirds of the normal
salary&#151;they are abated by a third. Indeed, the finance officer
of the GLA, the excellent Anne McMeel, was in my office the day after
the general election to advise me of the good news that the abatement
would take place. She gave the information with great enthusiasm. At
least there was some saving for the London
authority.</div>
					<a name="07012577000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">What has
changed since the 1999 Act is that, quite properly, we have seen a
significant increase in allowances for members of local authorities.
That is most justified by the work that they do. Allowances for
executive council members are now realistic in reflecting the amount of
work done under the stronger executive model pursued by the Government.
Thus by changes under the Local Authorities (Members&#146;
Allowances)(England) Regulations 2001, following the guidance from
Professor Malcolm Grant in his brief, &#147;Making allowances: the
remuneration of councillors in London&#148;, and in work currently
being done by Rodney Brooke CBE, significant allowances are now being
paid to councillors. In London, under the current recommendation, the
basic rate is &#163;10,000: in some councils the rate is above that
and in others it is below. However, payments for executive members can
be anything from &#163;32,000 to &#163;51,000 per year. An
executive member of a local authority who also sits as a London
assembly member could receive some &#163;100,000 a year from the
public purse. It might be worth considering whether, in the changed
circumstances since the 1999 Act, the abatement should also apply to
senior executive members&#151;not ordinary back-bench-level
councillors or people chairing the licensing committee&#151;who
should be providing such a saving to the public
purse.</div>

						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for tabling the
amendment, as it provides an opportunity for me to highlight one of the
Government&#146;s proposed minor changes from the GLA review, which
we intend to take forward through an order following the passage of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012577000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">We propose to
abate the salary of the Mayor or an assembly member who is also a
Member of Parliament or a Member of the European Parliament by two
thirds of salary, rather than one third. That proposal reflects one of
the key recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review Body&#146;s
last report, in 2005, on the remuneration of the Mayor and assembly
members. The SSRB&#146;s reasoning for the level of abatement to
increase to two thirds of salary, which the Government accept, was that
membership of the assembly should generally be considered to be a
full-time role and that it is unlikely that the Mayor and assembly
members will hold dual mandates beyond a short period. It would also
bring the GLA in line with the salary abatement arrangements for the
Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly.</div>

					<a name="07012577000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are aware, of course, that
the hon. Members for Croydon, Central and for Bromley and Chislehurst
are also assembly members and are accordingly subject to this order. I
reassure them that the Government do not intend to bring a revised
order into force until after the next mayoral and assembly elections in
2008.</div>

						</b> We will also consult widely before making the
order.</div>
					<a name="07012577000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid
that the Government cannot accept the amendment. As the hon. Gentleman
said, the amendment would add local councillors who receive any
allowance for executive responsibilities to the list of memberships
explicitly referred to in section 25 of the 1999 Act which could be
subject to the order by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State
already has the power to include councillors who are in receipt of an
allowance for undertaking executive responsibilities, under section
25(1)(c), which allows the Secretary of State to specify the membership
of other public bodies beyond the UK/European Parliaments to be covered
in the order. Accordingly, the amendment is not strictly necessary and
only highlights the fact that this category of political representative
may be affected by an order under section
25.</div>
					<a name="07012577000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, the
Government have no plans to extend our proposed revised order on the
abatement of salaries to cover councillors who are in receipt of an
allowance for undertaking executive responsibilities. Such an extension
would raise a number of complicated issues, such as the treatment of
councillors who undertake executive functions on a part-time basis,
which would need to be considered carefully, as I am sure the hon.
Gentleman would
accept.</div>

accurate. To reinforce the point that he has raised, the Senior
Salaries Review Body has also not considered the issue to date. It
seems sensible, from our point of view, for the SSRB&#151;as an
independent body with considerable expertise in deciding such
matters&#151;to consider the issue in any future reviews of the Mayor
and assembly members&#146; remuneration before Ministers consider any
legislative changes. If in future the board decides that such a
legislative change is justified, I am sure that Ministers would want to
consider the issue again. With that explanation, I request that the
hon. Member for Croydon, Central consider withdrawing the
motion.</div>

intervention by the hon. Member for Battersea, out of the Olympics, as

themselves in the future. The hon. Gentleman might feel that it is more

						</b> Throughout the progress of the Committee, one of the
points that we have emphasised is the requirement for balanced new
powers for the Mayor and new powers of scrutiny for the assembly. The
three new clauses would give the assembly the power to call in mayoral
directions and to subject them to appropriate scrutiny. Over the past
two and a half weeks, the Opposition&#146;s commitment to giving the
Greater London assembly greater powers of scrutiny has been testified
to by the weight of argument put by myself and my hon. Friends. All I
would say is that the Minister is probably familiar, if not wearily
familiar, with the arguments and I look forward to hearing him once
again demolish them when he takes from his civil service brief yet
another series of impeccably framed arguments against scrutiny and in
favour of the unfettered exercise of Executive
power.</div>

							<a name="07012577000534"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> This is familiar territory for me, having spoken
only a few moments ago. I want to draw particular attention to new
clauses 43 and 44 regarding the power of the assembly to call in
directions and guidance to the London Fire and Emergency Planning
Authority and other GLA functional bodies. Providing the Mayor with the
power to direct LFEPA will give him or her considerable new direct
powers over the authority. He obviously already has such powers in
relation to Transport for London and the London Development
Agency.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 370</div>
					<a name="07012577000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that colleagues on the
Greater London assembly do not oppose that power in principle, but they
wish to ensure that there is an appropriate degree of transparency and
accountability. The Mayor might use the power of direction to compel a
functional body to take a particular course of action against its own
will. In those cases, there should be a mechanism for reviewing the
direction before it takes
effect.</div>
					<a name="07012577000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities throughout the country already have the power, including
those with directly elected mayors. In those circumstances, the
executive is required to publish a forward plan of its forthcoming
decisions and the council has the power to call in any of those
decisions. The new clauses therefore do not represent an innovation;
they would merely extend the powers available to local councils, in
relation to their executives, to the role of the London assembly in its
relation to the
Mayor.</div>
					<a name="07012577000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
local authorities, the power to call in decisions has not led to undue
delays in the decision-making process. It has simply introduced a
degree of transparency and accountability. That is perhaps even more
important in respect of the current Mayor than it might be in local
authorities. The new clauses would not take power away from the
executive. The assembly would not be empowered to block any mayoral
decision. Instead, it could ask questions within a reasonable time
scale of 21 days and make recommendations to the Mayor either to revise
the direction or not to issue it all. The final decision would,
however, rightly rest with the
Mayor.</div>
					<a name="07012577000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Unlike
local authorities, which have the power to call in all executive
decisions, the power would relate only to directions to functional
bodies, not to all mayoral decisions. Very few directions have been
issued to the London Development Agency or to TFL by the current Mayor.
An average of five directions were issued in each year from 2000 to
2005. The power is used generally in exceptional circumstances.
Accountability is perhaps most important when exceptional steps are
being taken by an executive. It is in those circumstances when
Londoners would expect the London assembly to undertake a role of
scrutiny and expose the decisions to public
debate.</div>
					<a name="07012577000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
are two separate proposals, one relating to LFEPA and one relating to
all functional bodies, and that deserves some explanation. The boards
of Transport for London and the London Development Agency are appointed
by the Mayor without reference to political balance. The board of LFEPA
is mainly made up of politicians in proportion to their representation
on London councils and the London
assembly.</div>
					<a name="07012577000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the cases
of TFL and LDA, there is therefore less risk of a fundamental
disagreement between the Mayor and his appointees. Since the Mayor is
the only party with a democratic mandate, his will is likely to prevail
in any consternation with TFL or the LDA. As for LFEPA, it is entirely
possible that there could be political disagreements between the Mayor,
with his direct mandate, and LFEPA, with its indirect democratic
mandate. The power of direction would be used to resolve such
disagreements. I am sure that the assembly would not argue against the
Mayor being empowered to so direct LFEPA to do certain things. However,
in the case of LFEPA, when there is more potential for directions to be
controversial politically and unwelcome, it is particularly important
that the Mayor&#146;s directions are subject to proper transparency 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 371</div>and debate before they take effect. Thus, the opportunity is given to
the Committee to give consideration to the special circumstances of
LFEPA. Before I conclude, I shall give way.</div>

Brake:
						</b> I sensed that the hon. Gentleman was about
to conclude. I had hoped to intervene on the speech of the official
Opposition spokesman, but his contribution was so succinct that I am
intervening on the speech of the hon. Gentleman instead. I wish to
bring him briefly to new clause 30. I am sympathetic to the group of
new clauses, but it was not clear to me under that new clause precisely
what additional powers would result from its introduction that
do not already exist under section 59 of the 1999 Act. That allows the
assembly to keep under review the Mayor&#146;s exercise of statutory
functions and it can produce reports and investigate matters of any
actions taken by the Mayor. Will the hon. Member for Croydon, Central
clarify what additional powers would result from new clause
30?</div>

30.</div>
					<a name="07012577000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The London
assembly does indeed have the powers of scrutiny to which the hon.
Gentleman referred, but there is a formality to the process of call-in.
It would be more likely to prompt the current incumbent to provide a
more detailed response to call-in procedure than saying, &#147;I got
elected, therefore I decide what to do.&#148; It would not be
possible to sustain that approach through a formal call-in process.
With those comments, I conclude my
remarks.</div>

not having welcomed you back to the Chair when I spoke
earlier.</div>
					<a name="07012577000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
reinforce the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon,
Central. It has been a theme throughout our party that we do not oppose
giving more power to the Mayor but seek to balance the power for the
assembly to call in. When the matter was considered by the London
assembly, support for this proposition and the principle of call-in
powers was agreed only with the abstention of the euphemistically named
&#147;One London&#148; group&#151;the ex-UK Independent party,
ex-Veritas group. In other words, every serious group of politicians,
of all shades of opinion, supported the call-in powers. I hope that the
Government will take that point on board.</div>
					<a name="07012577000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister is about to
spring into action, perhaps he will tell us why, if it was good enough
for the executive-strong mayor of Lewisham, it is not good enough for
the Mayor of London to have to deal with the call-in power on this
basis?</div>
					
					<a name="07012577000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000538"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The new clauses return the Committee to our
debates on part 1 of the Bill, as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath
said. Those debates centred on the respective roles of the Mayor and
the assembly. It was made clear then that it is our belief that the
current model for the Greater London authority works well, with a
strong Mayor as the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 372</div>executive arm of the authority and the assembly holding him to account
on behalf of Londoners. Our view is unchanged, but the new clauses
would fundamentally alter the balance of power between the Mayor and
assembly, and we cannot accept them.</div>
					<a name="07012577000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall summarise each of the
new clauses in turn. New clause 30 would allow the assembly to call in
for scrutiny a decision made by the Mayor, except planning decisions,
if at least 13 assembly members make such a request in writing to the
chief executive within 14 days of the decision. The assembly must then
meet within 12 days of the call-in to debate the decision.
Such a provision would serve little purpose. The assembly may already
scrutinise the decisions and actions of the Mayor, as the hon. Member
for Carshalton and Wallington pointed out. Indeed, the assembly has a
statutory duty to keep under review the Mayor's exercise of his
statutory functions. New clause 30 would merely serve to formalise an
existing process, and I see little merit in seeking to pigeon-hole
assembly scrutiny of the Mayor into a rigid, time-bound process.
</div>
					<a name="07012577000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New
clause 43 would require the Mayor to send to the assembly any direction
that he intends to issue to the London Fire and Emergency Planning
Authority. Hon. Members will recall that clause 27 gives the Mayor a
power of direction over LFEPA. The Assembly may recommend to the Mayor
within 21 days of receiving the proposed direction that he should not
issue it, or should issue it with amendments. The new clause also
imposes a duty on the Mayor to have regard to the assembly's
recommendations and, within 21 days of receiving them, prepare a
statement giving reasons why any of the recommendations made by the
assembly are not accepted. New clause 44 would make a similar provision
in respect of any directions or guidance issued by the Mayor under the
1999 Act.</div>
					<a name="07012577000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses would gravely hinder the Mayor, leaving him unable to act
quickly and decisively when exercising his powers of direction. The
Mayor would need to wait up to three weeks for the assembly to make its
recommendation on his proposed direction, and he would not be able to
issue directions in a timely manner.</div>
					<a name="07012577000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, there is nothing to
prevent the assembly scrutinising retrospectively any directions issued
by the Mayor. However, part and parcel of our model for London
governance is that the Mayor, as the executive, should be free to act
in a strong and decisive way, and that the Assembly should hold him
accountable for his actions. Extending the assembly's power of scrutiny
to decisions that he intends to make would change fundamentally the
balance of power within the GLA&#151;a balance that is proven to work
for the benefit of Londoners.</div>
					<a name="07012577000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore urge the hon.

motion.</div>

Once again, with admirable clarity, he outlined the Government&#146;s

disappointed that the Minister will not accept what we believe is the
logic of our argument. It is clear from earlier debates that when the
Mayor needs to issue directions, not least to LFEPA, at moments of
crisis, a responsible

point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

					<a name="07012577000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Almost the best
point in favour of new clause 31 was made in passing, but with some
eloquence, by my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham. He
pointed out earlier that the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham
is about to extend to those wise enough to vote for its current
administration&#151;and to those who do not vote for it&#151;a 3
per cent. reduction in the council tax. That is a remarkable
achievement. However, any resident of the borough who anticipates
paying less will be gravely disappointed when the total bill is
presented to them. As we all know, the likely GLA precept is to be 5
per cent. above the current level that is being paid, so the savings of
Hammersmith and Fulham will be wiped out by Mayor Ken&#146;s
extravagance.</div>
					<a name="07012577000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the new clause would ensure that, for busy council tax
payers, it was clear where responsibility lay when a local authority
was lowering its council tax, but the Mayor is increasing the burden.
It is understandable when a council tax bill comes in and we see at the
top of the bill the crest of our respective local borough that we are
inclined to think, &#147;Bloody Westminster&#148; or, &#147;Dear
me, Hounslow has been overspending again&#148;, when in fact
Westminster and Hounslow may have been keeping their own houses in
order, but have to act, in effect, as tax gatherers for the
Mayor.</div>

but perhaps unwittingly, provided me with an argument to underwrite the

Once again, it underlines two of the qualities that he has shown

					<a name="07012577000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
people who might want to shield the Mayor from his own extravagance do
not have an ally in him. This Mayor is proud of his extravagance. He is
in the proud old Labour tradition of big spenders who consider their
level of expenditure to be a virtue. In that respect, the widespread
support for the new clause&#151;given that it favours transparency,
is supported by London councils and that the Mayor wishes to endorse
it&#151;should recommend itself to the
Minister.</div>

of transparency, there is the truth and there is the whole truth?
Following his argument, does he support the fact that local authorities
such as mine, Westminster, would also be required to advertise to their
local population something that they strikingly do not? I draw
attention to the fact that 86 per cent. of all funding for services
delivered in the borough of Westminster is delivered through local
government grants. A mere 14 per cent. is actually raised from the
council tax. Does he agree that, if we want a well-informed electorate
who can exercise the need for control over their local authorities,
they should be supplied with all the information and advice about their
local authority finance?</div>

							<a name="07012577000548"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I do, indeed, agree with the hon. Lady; it is a pity
that her Front-Bench colleague does not. Exactly that provision was
contained in the Sustainable Communities Bill, which received its
Second Reading on Friday. I take it from what the hon. Lady said that
she will support that Bill when the opportunity arises, because it is
certainly our wish to do so. It is a tragedy that the Department for
Communities and Local Government is not doing so, and I suspect that it
tells us something about its mixed priorities that last night in the
House of Commons the Minister for Local Government made it clear that
the Department regarded the Bill as overly bureaucratic and beside the
point. To my mind, it was a tragic missed opportunity and a suggestion
that the DCLG does not have at its heart the admirable commitment to
localism displayed by the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington,
North.</div>
					<a name="07012577000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Transparency in
billing would serve the interests of accountability by ensuring that
those Mayors who believe that high expenditure is the route to
re-election would have the opportunity to campaign on that basis, and
other Mayors&#151;perhaps such as the Conservative Mayor, who is
likely to triumph at the next poll&#151;would have an opportunity to
advertise their prudence and their value-for-money programme through a
separately billed precept, and as a result would be able to win the
election in 2012 and preside over our successful
Olympics.</div>

							<a name="07012577000549"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I support new clause 31. It is straightforward and
simple. It is about transparency in billing, which is something that we
must all support and recommend. Most local authorities do that well
through the leaflets that come with the council tax bill, certainly in
Sutton, which explain what portion of the pie comes from grants and
council tax and so on. I hope that Labour Members will also be willing
to support the initiative. The fact that it has the support of the
Mayor and London councils is significant. It would also give the
Minister an opportunity to show that the Committee stage is meaningful
and that the Government are willing to take on board sensible proposals
that receive support from all quarters and are about making the
important issue of the precept much clearer to our
constituents.</div>
					<a name="07012577000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
constituents are very exercised indeed about by council tax increases
above the rate of inflation, but often the arguments about a mayoral
precept that has increased by 100 per cent. over four years are lost.
The focus is on what the local authority is doing, and the Mayor is
fortunate to be let off the hook. This is a sensible proposal. I cannot
for the life of me think why the Minister would possibly want to reject
the new clause, and so I look forward to hearing his message in support
of it.</div>

							<a name="07012577000550"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The Government accept that it is important
for local taxpayers in London to understand to whom they are paying
their council tax and the contribution that the GLA as a major
precepting authority makes to council tax bills issued by the boroughs
in London. Local taxpayers rightly need to understand where their
council tax is going and what services it funds. Clear information is a
vital prerequisite for that.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 376</div>
					<a name="07012577000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the Government cannot
accept the new clause, which would require the GLA to print its own
bill and explanatory notes dedicated solely to the GLA precept. Such a
requirement on the GLA would be costly and potentially more confusing
to council tax payers than the present arrangements. First, it is not
clear how the new system would work in practice, as the boroughs would
still remain legally responsible for the collection of the precept. If
the intention is for the borough as the collecting authority to
continue to issue the demand for payment, and for the GLA to issue an
additional bill that would not actually be a demand for payment, we
would be creating a recipe for potential confusion for the taxpayer.
If, instead, the intention is for Londoners to receive two separate
demands for payment, one in respect of the GLA and one in respect of
the borough, but pay both to the latter, that seems even more confusing
for
taxpayers.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07012577000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
GLA has indicated that the additional costs of separate billing could
be up to &#163;10 million a year, depending on how the new duty was
implemented, given that there are more than 3 million eligible
households in London. That additional cost would have to be funded by
either higher taxes or cuts to services, which nobody wants. My advice
is that the Mayor does not support the provision in the new clause,
which is contrary to what Opposition Members have said. I apologise for
the confusion, but that is the information that I have been given.
There is clearly disagreement on
that.</div>
					<a name="07012577000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, it is
not clear whether requiring the GLA to produce its own billing notice
would improve local taxpayers&#146; understanding of their council
tax bills. The GLA precept is already clearly identified on the current

boroughs.</div>

There is no intention to mislead on either side. There have been
occasions when Conservative Members have supported the Mayor&#146;s
view and we have opposed it, and vice versa. There is no inconsistency
in saying that, whether or not the Mayor supports the new clause, we
sadly do not.</div>

saying, the GLA precept is already clearly identified on the current
bill issued by each borough. There is also a statutory requirement for
information about the GLA&#146;s budget, expenditure and the impact
of changes in the amount of council tax charged to be included in the
explanatory material that accompanies
bills.</div>
					<a name="07012577000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Finally,
the new clause would set a precedent for separate billing for other
major precepting authorities&#151;county councils, police and fire
authorities&#151;which would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 377</div>be costly and unnecessary. For those reasons the Government consider
that it would be best to continue with the well established and
generally efficient arrangements for collecting council tax in London
whereby boroughs bill and collect the GLA precept on behalf of the GLA
as part of their council tax billing notices. I therefore urge the hon.
Member for Surrey Heath to withdraw the

response. It was intriguing that he spent most of it aiming at his
straw man, which was that under the new clause the GLA would be
responsible for separate billing arrangements. I hope that I and the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington made it clear that we wanted
greater transparency within one bill, to be sent by the borough. We

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000570"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07012577000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move the
motion with the experience of having sat on the board of the London
Development Agency, which sits in the wider regional development agency
family. The targets that are set for the London Development Agency
might be applicable to RDAs generally, but they have often been found
not to sit so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 378</div>well with an agency that operates within a separate democratic process.
There is significant input from the Mayor and the Mayor&#146;s
office. However, a lot of the reporting information that is required of
the London Development Agency has been quite irrelevant to the needs of
an agency that operates within the overall democratic structure of
London&#146;s governance.</div>
					<a name="07012577000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also important that the
London Development Agency should be able to secure its direction from
the Mayor, in having targets set for it in respect of his or her
desires for the performance of the London economy, and for the
rejuvenation of those parts of London that are deprived and in need of
special support. In that respect, I am again grateful for the strong
support for the new clause from London First, which says that it is
appropriate that the Mayor should set such priorities, rather than
central Government, so that the work of the LDA is entirely consistent
with the overall economic development strategy for the
capital.</div>
					<a name="07012577000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our approach
throughout the discussions on the Bill has been, where possible, to
devolve powers from central Government to the Mayor, while also
ensuring that the Mayor does not secure powers up from local
government. The new clause therefore sits well within our overall
philosophy for the Bill&#151;to be radical and positive about extra
powers for the Mayor, while ensuring that political decisions are made
at the lowest political level, in terms of their closeness to the
residents who elect the
politicians.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000571"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I shall speak briefly in favour of the new clause,
which is a devolutionary measure that we support. We have taken
guidance from the Liberal Democrat members on the GLA throughout, to
ensure that what we say there is entirely consistent with what we say
here. That is something that other parties might envy, particularly the
Labour party, in that it ensures a consistent approach to such
matters.</div>
					<a name="07012577000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is important and would provide strategic direction for the LDA.
It is true that the LDA has a lot of targets, but they seem to change
with some frequency. It is not always clear from the agency&#146;s
budget what precisely it is seeking to achieve. On the basis that the
new clause not only would give the agency greater direction and more
focus, but would be a devolutionary measure, I should be happy to
support the hon. Member for Croydon, Central, should he press the
matter to a
vote.</div>
					
					<a name="07012577000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000572"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I am afraid that the Government cannot accept
the new clause, which would enable the Mayor, on a statutory basis, to
set the LDA&#146;s annual performance targets, following consultation
with the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="07012577000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The 1999 Act
amended the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 to establish the LDA
as a functional body of the Mayor. The office of the Mayor was given
considerable statutory control over the agency&#151;the Mayor
appoints its members, approves its strategy, decides its budgets and
can issue directions and guidance to it. The current Mayor has already
used those powers effectively to ensure that the LDA is supporting the
economic development and regeneration of London. Most notably, the
agency played a crucial role in supporting the Olympic bid and
assembling the land for the Olympic park. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 379</div>Government expect the Mayor and future Mayors to continue to shape the
agency so that it can better address the key challenges facing
London&#146;s economy.</div>
					<a name="07012577000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the LDA is also an
integral part of the wider regional development agency network for
England, which receives considerable funding from the
Government&#151;more than &#163;2.2 billion of
taxpayers&#146; money this year, of which nearly &#163;400 million
is for the LDA itself&#151;to support regional economic development
and to contribute to national objectives such as increasing
productivity. Given that considerable Government funding, it is
important that the LDA, like other RDAs, supports underlying national
objectives when taking action to improve London&#146;s economy, which
is why it is part of the wider RDA tasking arrangements. As a condition
of the LDA&#146;s grant, the Mayor has been required since the last
spending review in 2004 to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s
approval for the LDA&#146;s annual targets.</div>
					<a name="07012577000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those arrangements have given
the LDA sufficient flexibility to develop its own programmes and
projects and to address London&#146;s specific challenges, such as
affordable child care and the Olympic land assembly programmes. At the
same time, they provide assurances to Government and ultimately
Parliament that funding given to the LDA is contributing to underlying
national objectives.</div>
					<a name="07012577000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">By putting the LDA&#146;s
performance targets on a statutory footing, the new clause would change
those arrangements substantially. The Mayor alone would be responsible
for setting the LDA&#146;s performance targets following consultation
with the Secretary of State. That arrangement would be enshrined in
statute and would remove an important Government control that currently
ensures that the LDA and national economic policies are complementary
and mutually supporting. The merits of such a new clause must be
carefully considered, and we suggest that that would be done best not
as a last-minute change to the Bill but as part of a wider policy
review.</div>
					<a name="07012577000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s review of sub-national economic development and
regeneration is considering the role of RDAs and other sub-national
bodies involved in economic development and regeneration, and whether
the framework and relationships between them and with central
Government are the most effective for meeting the long-term economic
challenges. The review may have wider implications for the LDA&#146;s
governance and performance arrangements, and we should not introduce a
statutory change to the LDA&#146;s output target arrangements before
the outcomes of the wider review are decided. The sub-national review
will report to Ministers before the comprehensive spending review later
this year.</div>
					<a name="07012577000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Croydon, Central has raised the question of land disposal
several times. I can advise him that TFL and the LDA have a different
statutory disposal of land consent regime. Under section 5 of the 1998
Act, the LDA needs to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s consent for
the disposal of land only if that land is being disposed of at less
than market consideration. Following the Government&#146;s decision
in the 2005 Budget to give the LDA more freedoms and flexibilities,
that consent is only required for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 380</div>disposal of lands worth more than &#163;2 million on the open market.
Local authorities are subject to a similar statutory consent
regime.</div>
					<a name="07012577000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that clarifies the position and assists the hon. Gentleman. However, as
I have explained, the Government cannot accept the new clause as it
stands and urge that the motion be
withdrawn.</div>

by his colleagues in the Liberal Democrat group on the London assembly.
I hope that as the debates continue elsewhere, the Government will give
clear cognisance to the value of such a devolutionary approach, which
seems after all to be the theme that they also wish to pursue. With
those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

is very important for the operation of the London assembly.
Analysing the overall performance and the budgetary performance of the
GLA family and its functional bodies should be at the very heart of the
scrutiny role.</div>
					<a name="07012577000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						One criticism
of the GLA budgetary process made by academics&#151;most notably by
Tony Travers&#151;is its tremendous weakness in not providing a
separate and independent office with the ability to provide advice to
the GLA and to Londoners on the performance and the financial
activities of the GLA. It is difficult to progress a budgetary process
when one relies on officials who are intimately involved in the
production of the Mayor&#146;s budget, and are required to maintain
complete secrecy about what is enclosed within that budget, while at
the same time giving advice to the London assembly on the construction
of an alternative budget.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000575"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I seek clarification on one point. Is the hon.
Gentleman proposing that we use the New York model, which I understand
has an office distinct from both the mayor and the assembly? However,
the relationship in the new clause between the assembly and the budget
office seems to be much closer than in the New York
model.</div>
					
					<a name="07012577000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000576"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
mentioning the New York City charter. He is a little unfair in
suggesting that the process I have outlined departs very far from the
New York charter. While I would not wish to be charged with plagiarism,
the structure of the new clause relies heavily on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 382</div>provisions in that charter. Indeed, I positively decided to use that
model because it has been so successful in the governance of New York
city.</div>
					<a name="07012577000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
benefits of that approach is that it will give ownership both to the
assembly and to the Mayor by allowing the Mayor and the chairs of the
functional bodies to appoint the board, which will appoint a director
of the budget and performance office. There will be that involvement
and support through that appointment process. Under the new clause, the
director would be appointed in such a way that he or she was an
independent person, free from party political affiliation, who had the
particular qualifications to support that office.</div>
					<a name="07012577000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause would promote
good discipline as regards the &#163;11 billion that is spent
annually on the London Assembly, &#163;44 million for every sitting
between election cycles of the assembly. Money would be directed to an
effective budget and performance office that Londoners were able to
recognise as an excellent and independent source of information on the
performance of the functional bodies of the Greater London
authority&#151;an office that was free from the spin of the politics
of the assembly or of the Mayor through <i class="I">The London
Paper&#151;</i>so that people could feel confident that they were
making a real judgment on the quality of the performance as regards
&#163;11 billion of public
expenditure.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000577"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> In case the hon. Gentleman was about to conclude
his comments, I just wanted to seek some clarity. The new clause refers
to the office receiving the equivalent of 10 per cent. of the annual
expenditure of the GLA finance department. My understanding is that
there is no such thing as the GLA finance department, so did he mean to
refer to the finance and performance department, which is a very large
department? Is he including in his figures the people in the different
functional bodies who work on financial matters? Will he give us an
idea of the scale of the funding to which he is
referring?</div>
					
					<a name="07012577000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012577000578"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me
the opportunity to provide further colour to the new clause. I was
indeed referring to the finance and performance department within the
strategic body of the GLA, and most definitely not to the finance
departments and organisations within the functional bodies. There would
be some significant expenditure involved, but the most important thing
in that provision is that it ensures that there is some protection for
the amount of money&#151;serious money&#151;given to that
office.</div>
					<a name="07012577000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
conclusion, the new clause offers the prospect of providing a strong
discipline to the assembly, so that its resources are deployed on its
fundamental role of scrutinising the budgetary process. The ability to
vote down the Mayor&#146;s budget on a two-thirds majority is the
only real executive power that the assembly has. That is important. The
proposals would ensure that resources are not unnecessarily applied in
respect of the political interests of assembly members. Rather, they
would be applied to hold the Mayor to account on financial and overall
performance, in line with the model that has worked so successfully in
New York city.</div>

the sitting to run on a little longer if necessary. As Chairman, I have
discretion to be able to do that, and I felt that it would make people
feel more comfortable to know.</div>

you, Lady Winterton, as our referee, that in professional football
there are now men who come out and hold up a board to indicate the
amount of time remaining.</div>

						</b> We will not go beyond the agreed time as a result
of my intervention. I rise simply to confirm that my earlier
interventions were of a sympathetic nature, probing the new clause.
Should the hon. Member for Croydon, Central have the time to press the
motion to a Division, I will be inclined to support
it.</div>

Cooper:
						</b> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central&#146;s
approach is based on models from the United States. Bodies such as the
congressional budget office perform important functions in US political
life and there are similar examples throughout the American political
process, but he will appreciate that the structure and process are
different here. From a legal perspective, it is possible for the
assembly to set up its own budget research unit or office under its own
ambit, using powers given by section 34 of the 1999 Act. The assembly
can also use its scrutiny powers. The proposal in the Bill for the
assembly to have its own budget could make it easier to fund a budget
research unit.</div>
					<a name="07012577000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason why the Government think that the new clause would not be
appropriate is that, unlike America, we have a common legislative
framework for local government finance and performance, to which the
GLA and its functional bodies are subject. The GLA group&#146;s
financial performance and accounts are independently scrutinised by the
Audit Commission. The group is also subject to the provisions of part 2
of the Local Government Act 2003, which mean that the GLA&#146;s
chief finance officer is under a duty to report to the Mayor and the
assembly on the robustness of the authority&#146;s draft final
consolidated budget calculations.
</div>
					<a name="07012577000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">A statutory budget
and performance office would cut across those existing provisions,
potentially leading to duplication and confusion in the audit and
scrutiny processes. For that reason, the Government are not convinced
about the need for a statutory budget and performance office, and so
ask the hon. Member for Croydon, Central to withdraw the
motion.</div>

not been able to make my case sufficiently well to persuade the

Cooper:
						</b> On a point of order, Lady Winterton. May I thank
you and your co-Chairman for the professional and effective way in
which you have refereed, supervised and assisted our scrutiny of the
Bill? I thank you for your tolerance of some of the flights of fantasy
and fancy in which we have engaged at times.</div>
					<a name="07012577000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I also thank
the Clerks, <i class="I">Hansard</i> Reporters and Doorkeepers for helping to
make the business of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 384</div>Committee smoother than it might otherwise have been. I particularly
thank my hon. Friend the Minister for London for his hard work and
support. I thank all my hon. Friends for their contributions and
enthusiasm.</div>
					<a name="07012577000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
extend thanks to the Opposition spokesmen, the hon. Members for Surrey
Heath and for Carshalton and Wallington, and their Opposition
colleagues, for the way that they have made their points. This has been
one of the most cheerful and entertaining Committees on which I have
had the pleasure to serve; given some of the others, I am not sure how
strong a compliment that is. This Committee has been cheerful and
amiable throughout. I hope that on Report things will continue in that
spirit.</div>

							<a name="07012577000585"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> On a point of order, Lady Winterton. I associate
myself completely with the remarks made by the Minister for Housing and
Planning. It has been an absolute pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship and that of your co-Chairman, Mr.
O&#146;Hara. The Committee has been an education for me and although
it may have been a trial for you and Mr. O&#146;Hara, I am
grateful for your forbearance and patience.</div>
					<a name="07012577000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am also
grateful to the Clerks for their guidance during the
Committee&#151;and before it, when my hon. Friends and I were framing
our amendments. I thank the Doorkeepers and <i class="I">Hansard </i>Reporters
for their kindness and support. I completely associate myself
with the Minister&#146;s remarks about the good humour and amiability
with which the Committee has conducted its business. That is due in no
small part to how she, the Minister for London and the hon. Member for
Chatham and Aylesford have combined a firm hand on the Executive tiller
with an indulgent smile for the Opposition&#146;s
sallies.</div>
					<a name="07012577000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I came
to this House, I paid close attention to comments made by the right
hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) when he was Home
Secretary. He said that there had never been a Bill for which he was
responsible that had not been improved by its passage through the House
of Commons, in particular the Committee stage. I rather admired his
saying that, because it suggested a degree of open-mindedness that did
him and his office credit.</div>
					<a name="07012577000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I should like to place
on the record that although I admire the Government&#146;s generosity
of spirit in their handling of this Bill, we have put forward a string
of amendments and new clauses, not a single one of which has been
accepted by them. We have laboured in vain, but I hope that on Report
and on Third Reading the opportunity to reflect on the arguments that
have been so faithfully committed into <i class="I">Hansard</i> by the
Reporters&#146; hands will lead the Ministers to think again. They
may recognise that many of the arguments put forward by my hon.
Friends&#151;and, indeed, the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington&#151;deserve to be revisited and perhaps incorporated at
one of those later
stages.</div>

						</b> On a point of order, Lady Winterton. I thank you
for your chairmanship and echo the thanks of the Minister and the hon.
Gentleman to all those involved in ensuring that events have run
smoothly. I agree that the debate has been good humoured, and I am sure
that that approach will be maintained on Report and in the other
place.</div>

Chairman:
						</b> Before I put the question, I should like, on
behalf of my co-Chairman Eddie O&#146;Hara and myself, to respond to
the kind remarks made by the Minister and the Opposition spokesmen. The
Committee has debated some weighty matters constructively and
good-humouredly. I say without contradiction that it has been the best
and most 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 386</div>interesting Bill that I have had the pleasure of chairing. I thank all
Committee members for
that.</div>
					<a name="07012577000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, too, thank
the Doorkeepers, the police, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> Reporters and in
particular the Clerks, without whose expertise we would not be so well
placed to debate and carry the Committee stage through in the
traditional manner.</div>

to blow the final whistle.
