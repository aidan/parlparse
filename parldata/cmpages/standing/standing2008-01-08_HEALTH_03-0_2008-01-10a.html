							<b class="B">Anne
Milton</b> (Guildford) (Con): Good morning,
Ms Dodds. You welcomed the proposal for a health in pregnancy grant,
but also pointed to the need for continuing advice. Will you expand on
your belief that the one-off payment will make a difference? What other
measures do you consider necessary to improve on
that?</div>

						<i class="I">

Dodds:

						</i> The important thing is the intention of the
payment. Originally, there was a lot of discussion about impact on
birth weight and prematurity, but the intention of the payment has not
been made clear. In order to answer the question about what the impact
would be, we need to know the intention of the grant. If the impact is
desired on birth weight and on prematurity, my understanding is that
even 25 weeks is too late, from the evidence base, to have much impact.
If the intention is to support pregnant women and to support new
families&#151;their health in general but also in a wider
sense&#151;that needs to be measured differently.</div>

					<a name="08011049000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">A contribution
of &#163;190 I am sure would be welcome because it is a time, as I
have pointed out in the evidence, when families are particularly under
stress and low-income families obviously are harder hit. The stress of
being in debt or having a very low income is an additional factor in
pregnancy-related
disorders.</div>

you effectively saying that you think the reasons that have been given

							<b class="B">

						</i> I am not clear what the reasons are because my
understanding originally was that the emphasis was to improve health
and to improve diet in particular, with a view to reducing the risk of
prematurity and improving birth weight in this country and, therefore,
to give children a better start in the long term.</div>
					<a name="08011049000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is good
reason to think that improving women&#146;s diet at the
pre-conception stage may have that impact but improving diet later in
pregnancy is likely to have much less impact. Therefore, I would like
to be clear, and I would like the Government to be clear, what the
intention of the payment is because then it will be possible to assess
the impact. Does that answer what you were
asking?</div>

							<a name="08011049000234"></a>Greg
Mulholland:
						</b> Yes, I think it does and I think it is quite
revealing. There has been a lot of criticism. You generally support the
measure, although, as I think is clear, you support it perhaps not for
some of the reasons that have been given for bringing it in. You are
also aware that there is a lot of criticism about it. A lot of
organisations and experts have said that they do not think that it is a
good idea. In fact, the King&#146;s Fund has dismissed it as, I
quote,
&#147;silly&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011049000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
you think it is a good idea, albeit for different reasons from the ones
that have been given for bringing it in, how do you think it could be
changed? What other provisions do you think could be introduced or
alternatives brought in to make it actually deliver and succeed in the
way you that you would clearly wish it to
be?</div>

								Rosemary
Dodds:

						</i> One of the things that would help would be to
pay it earlier in pregnancy, from as early as possible, from 10 or 12
weeks, when women first attend for antenatal care. It should be
possible to do that even if women attend later. They can start later
and receive the same amount of money. I think the logistical problems
could be overcome. It would then have the advantage of particularly
supporting the women whose babies are born at 25 weeks. They are not
going to benefit at all if the grant does not start until after 25
weeks.</div>
					<a name="08011049000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing that could have a potential impact on women&#146;s health in
pregnancy and their children&#146;s future health would be to
increase the healthy start payments which have been stuck at
&#163;2.80 since they were introduced. That is the same sort of level
as they were previously under the milk tokens scheme.</div>
					<a name="08011049000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Healthy start
can commence at 10 weeks and continue throughout the pregnancy up to
the age of four. That may also have an impact on the future pregnancies
of a woman who is in a poor nutritional state when she starts her first
pregnancy. It is a way of reaching the pre-conception stage for
subsequent pregnancies and it also goes to all women under 18 who are
pregnant, who are at a particular nutritional
disadvantage.</div>

							<a name="08011049000235"></a>Greg
Mulholland:
						</b> Clearly healthy start is conditional and
therefore is spent on exactly what it is devised to achieve. Do you
think therefore that this new payment to women, whenever it
is&#151;you have clearly stated that, ideally, it would be
earlier&#151;should also have some conditionality to ensure that it
is spent on something relevant to assisting diet, baby clothes or
whatever? Do you think that there should be some
conditionality?</div>

						<i class="I">

								Rosemary

benefits.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Rosemary
Dodds:

						</i> In the same way that child benefit is not
conditional on spending even that money on the child itself, there are
advantages in enabling women to make their own decisions about how to
spend the pregnancy grant. It may be that if they are in debt, the
greatest advantage to them would be to pay off their debts and then
reduce their ongoing interest payments, and then they will have more
money available to spend on food. So I do not think that conditionality
would overcome all the
problems.</div>

							<a name="08011049000237"></a>Greg
Mulholland:
						</b> But again, presumably you then have to be
clear what this payment is actually for, in the light of why it is
being given. If it is supposed to be about diet, which has been one of
the suggestions, and is going to be spent on debt repayments, that is
not going to achieve anything in terms of diet. We must be clear on
that.</div>

diet&#151;if it means that women are spending less on exorbitant
interest payments, they will have more of their household income to
spend on diet. I think it is important to be clear about the intent in
order to evaluate the impact, because I think that the Government want
to be evidence-based and you cannot be evidence-based unless you have a
reason for doing

						</i> No, but there is a lot of support for the
redistribution towards families. Obviously there are many, many reasons
for that, and the health of children in the very early
stages&#151;prior to conception and in the first few
months&#151;does have a long-term impact on their future health, in
terms of their complete lifespan health. So there are some logical
reasons to think that improving health, particularly among the poorest
people, will have a future benefit. What you are saying is one reason
why we think it is important to evaluate the impact of this and to
commission research studies&#151;we said the same at the launch of
healthy start&#151;to look at what happens to the grant and what
impact it
has.</div>

poverty alleviation. If that is what you think this is about, then
surely there should be a discussion about the right ways of helping
poor, pregnant women. What we have here is actually a one-off payment
to all pregnant women. Do you think it is fair to criticise it on the

						</i> I think that in order to reach all pregnant
women who are in need, a universal benefit has a lot of advantages in
itself, but there are advantages in supporting all women who are
pregnant, whatever their income, because of the redistribution impact
that I mentioned earlier and because this method of payment reaches
many more of the poorest women. Universal benefits are well known to be
administratively easier, both for those who are giving the money out
and also for claimants, so that they are always clear that they are
entitled and almost always apply. There is a very high take-up rate and
therefore it is a very effective way of reaching people. As I mentioned
in my submission, the End Child Poverty Coalition is very supportive of
this move to increase universal
benefits.</div>

foetal nutrition, particularly, for example, in the laying down of the
initial calcium for bones and teeth, where certain foods are very
relevant. Are we satisfied that there is enough information out there
so that when women get this money they really do have the knowledge and
perhaps even the motivation to spend it on the right things that are
actually going to help foetal health and the long-term health of the
child?</div>

						</i> No, I think you raise a very important point
and as I have pointed out, health professional bodies have in general
said that they do not have sufficient training on nutrition to provide
individualised dietary advice to women. It is no good suggesting that
women eat a lot more high-value foods if their income is not going to
cover it, for instance. It is not only calcium and vitamin D, for
instance, that are important, but also oily fish. There is a lot of
confusion about oily fish yet there is good evidence that it can have
an impact on the future health of the child. That is one reason why we
mentioned improved training, particularly for midwives and GPs who have
said they really do not have enough nutrition
knowledge.</div>

Chairman&#151;I did study nutrition to an advanced level
myself&#151;I do wonder. If we take, for example, the battle Jamie
Oliver had with the Turkey Twizzlers, just getting mums, particularly
mums who were probably in areas where they most needed information and
expertise on why to eat a balanced diet, to understand why fruit and
vegetables are an important component of diet. I worry that socially,
there is still lack of acceptance of the need to eat a proper, balanced
diet; even if Marks and Spencer cut out all their salt and all these
sorts of things happen, I worry that the people who would benefit most
will not do so, because they either do not know, or equally are not
going to use it because of lack of motivation to do so
anyway.</div>

Stephen O'Brien</b> (Eddisbury) (Con): I am grateful to
Rosemary Dodds for making such a clear exposition of the challenges
that we face in trying to make something intended to be a good,
actually work. As best as we can understand, the genesis for this was
when the Prime Minister was Chancellor and first 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>announced the then extension of child benefit into the last months of
pregnancy. He said that it was on the basis that nutrition is most
important</div>

months of pregnancy&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 6 December

					<a name="08011049000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has
the National Childbirth Trust, as one of the greatest practitioners and

						</i> No, I cannot say that we were consulted. My
reading of the evidence is that it is pre-conception and very early
pregnancy nutrition that is most important. That is not to say that
women who are sick and do not manage to eat very much at all will not
have babies that are often just as healthy, so it depends on the
functioning of the placenta, and that is influenced by many other
factors. Diet is one factor, but definitely the time around conception
is most
important.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful for that. It will no doubt lead us
to some interesting discussions during our deliberations in the coming
weeks. At the outset of your remarks, you made clear that it is
difficult to make judgments on the area until one is absolutely clear
what the intention is. I think we are all agreed that it would be
helpful when the Minister appears after you to try to gain some
clarification from him. If the intention is to tackle birth weight and
prematurity, that is one set of circumstances whereas if it is just for
the general support of the mother and the family that is another set of
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08011049000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Tuesday we
had the Which? representatives in front of us, and they indicated that
they are willing to supply written evidence, as a result of our
questioning, which might impact on what behaviour, influences and
evidence can be found to make sure that the proposal will work. In your
experience, what tends to influence the behaviour and choices of
pregnant women? Particularly, as you say, at the conception stage and
the early days of pregnancy, in the first three months when often they
have not told many people&#151;which is normal practice. What
influences them to make the right choices? At the extreme level,
cigarettes and alcohol are given up, but also, more positively, if this
is to deliver, what influences their choice on nutritional
improvement?</div>

								Rosemary
Dodds:

						</i> I have to say that the most important thing is
education. Education in schools is one of the best ways of reaching
people. We are aware, from research on encouraging women to take folic
acid prior to conception and for the first 12 weeks, that it is the
women who are most well educated, most likely to look at websites and
read magazines who are most aware of that information. We need to put
more emphasis on providing girls in particular, but girls and boys in
general, with nutrition education in schools and encouragement to
implement those nutrition messages by explaining the impact on the
future health of themselves and their
children.</div>

							<a name="08011049000250"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful. I was interested in
the Minister&#146;s question about the three
European countries. The other evidence we have is from Australia, where
some people have, rather brutally, called their one-off payment the
&#147;plasma payment&#148; because of the tendency&#151;which is,
I expect, anecdotal&#151;of a number of pregnant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>mothers to go off and buy plasma screens rather than the necessary
improved food. I am therefore anxious for us to understand, from your
point of view, and with your experience and the great contact you have
with pregnant mothers, with what evidence you would hope to show that
this initiative would bring about the intended behavioural changes, to
encourage women to make the right choices? Let us say that the cost is
&#163;80 million at the moment. If you were given a cheque for that
amount, is this the way you would use it to improve maternal and foetal
health?</div>

						</i> The latter question I will come back to. In
terms of improving awareness of the importance, I am likely to get into
philosophy if I am not careful, because the importance of children in
society and of the parenting role needs to be bolstered in order to
encourage women to take their health and the health of their children
seriously. At the moment, parenting is seen as an optional add-on for
many people, and not something that is an important part of their
lives. Work is the most important thing; parenting is sometimes
denigrated and not sufficiently valued as an important part of the
future society. That involves not only health, but how much time you
spend with your children and how you bring them up. In order to
encourage women in particular to improve their diet to maintain their
health and the health of their children, I would like to see parenting
and child rearing more valued in society.</div>

Hopkins</b> (Luton, North) (Lab): I wonder what you think the
Government might do more positively about the biggest single problem
with foetal damage in pregnancy, which is from
alcohol&#151;particularly that consumed just prior to conception and
during the early stages of pregnancy. As I understand it, foetal
alcohol damage is far and away the most significant factor affecting
babies before birth, causing greater damage than all the other factors
put together. Have you got a message for Government, as to what they
might do to improve the health of babies before they are
born?</div>

in relation to the health and pregnancy grant. Smoking, alcohol and

not survive because of the substances that their mother is
ingesting.</div>

is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>one of the factors, but I do not think that the correlations are as
strong as you suggest. Yes, there is more that could be done to inform
young women, in particular, of the dangers of drinking excessive
amounts of alcohol, but so many of those women are also
smoking&#151;they are not considering that their health, or their
baby&#146;s health, is damaged by those behaviours.</div>

services are increasingly delivered in an integrated way. Other
political parties and stakeholders have for some time called for
integration. We accept that change such as this is never easy; it will
always cause an element of disruption. However, the reasons for the
intent and the timing of the measure are that we have a legislative

or the tone in which they were articulated. I was also slightly
concerned to read them in the press before evidence was given to this
Committee. However, during the Sitting, we usefully teased out the
position of the three regulators, including the Healthcare Commission.
You may recall that when I asked Sir Ian, he said that since he wrote
the Bristol report some years ago, it was his position that bringing
together health care and social care is desirable. He said that the
citizenry do not know and care less under what system they are being
looked after. They want it to be seamless and well organised, so the
principle is right. His concern seemed to be about the timing, and we
have already had a brief discussion about that. In some senses, the
timing is never attractive to someone who is already in charge of a
regulatory body that is doing a very good job. It is not natural to
welcome that level of disruption and also the abolition of your very

organisations than by the Healthcare Commission, which feels that it
already has adequate powers. You are right, Mr. Burden, to
say that, when questioned, Anna Walker said that she did not want those
powers to be taken out&#151;I suspect because there is a belief that
the new range of powers is not only about how the commission will use
them, but the galvanising and deterrent effect that the existence of
those powers will have on provider organisations. I do not think that
we should lose sight of that issue, which was not really raised on
Tuesday. We should leave that to the judgment of the new commission. I
do not think that we should lay down in the legislation under what
circumstances the commission should issue a penalty notice or suspend a
licence. That will be for the commission itself to decide, in a
proportionate but robust
way.</div>

						</i> This is where I slightly disagreed with
what Anna Walker said on Tuesday, because I think that the new powers
will enable the new commission to be more flexible in its interventions
in relation to health care-acquired infections and to intervene more
quickly. The increase of the maximum fine to &#163;50,000,
potentially&#151;that is for just one breach of a regulation and
there could be multiple &#163;50,000s in a very serious
case&#151;is an extra tool in its armoury. One should not lose sight
of the damage to an organisation&#146;s reputation that could be
caused if it was fined in that way. The Healthcare Commission might say
that it has enough powers at the moment, but the flipside of giving it
these new powers is the motivational and deterrent effects on health
care organisations to ensure that they improve their
performance.</div>

is one of the areas that we have been working on closely with the
Healthcare Commission over recent months. One of the reasons why I was
so disappointed with the tone and content of Sir Ian&#146;s written
evidence was that we have moved on that issue. The Healthcare
Commission was very much concerned that its powers should not be
limited to providers, given that 80 per cent. of the taxpayers&#146;
money that is now spent on the health service is being spent through
primary care trusts, which are the main commissioners. I entirely agree
with that. We are confident that the Bill makes clear that the

provision.</div>

existing regulatory organisations and nobody likes to be abolished.
What is interesting is that by the end of the sitting on Tuesday, two
out of the three organisations had acknowledged that they supported the
principle of integration. They did not start in that position. I do not
know; it would be more fruitful to ask it. I am not sure that it has

conduct of the practice panels of the General Medical

a new and separate body is necessary, I wish to point out that the GMC
will still be able to publish guidance telling the OHPA what sanctions
to impose on professionals found unfit to practise, thus giving rise to
the potential for confusion about who has the ultimate responsibility.
Given the extensive evidence that we have already had on the subject,
during which, of course, you have been present, I would be grateful if

						</i> As I am sure hon. Members are aware, that
was one of the main recommendations to come out of the numerous
inquiries that Dame Janet Smith carried out into the Harold Shipman
murders. It is widely supported by everyone, with the exception of the
British Medical Association. The original motivation was the view that
the independent adjudicator should be given the genesis of this,
independent of medical professional interests. More recently, people
have begun to debate the exact status of the body, and I point out to
the Committee&#151;we discussed this at some length on
Tuesday&#151;that people do not suggest that the Healthcare
Commission, which itself is an non-departmental public body, or the
Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Human Fertilisation
and Embryology Authority, which are other NDPBs, are not independent of
the Government. I also noted from the questioning on Tuesday that
although Dame Janet expressed some sympathy with the concerns of the
GMC on its exact status and distance from Government, neither she, the
GMC, nor any other witnesses had a clear idea of what alternative
status they would recommend for
it.</div>
					<a name="08011049000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of the legal qualification of the chair, if there is wide
concern in the Committee about that, we are prepared to look at it.
However, it is important to bear in mind that the GMC was a bit iffy
about that issue because its view was that in some cases it is
important&#151;particularly in complex medical cases&#151;that the
chair has medical rather than legal expertise. That is why we
introduced the provision of having a legal assessor and the possibility
that the independent adjudicator may include a legal assessor. If there
is a way out that would mean we could specify that it could have either
a legal assessor or a legal chair, that might be a way to satisfy the
concerns of both Dame Janet and members of this Committee. We are
certainly happy to go away and think a bit further about
that.</div>

						</i> I am afraid that I was not surprised by the
evidence given by the BMA on Tuesday. The BMA seems to want the
Committee to reject every single recommendation that Dame Janet has
made after looking into the issue for four long years. The reason why
we are doing this is because, first, it was one of the central parts of
Dame Janet&#146;s report and, secondly, because all but two or three
other health care professions already use the civil standard, and the
others are quite willingly and happily moving towards the civil
standard. They, unlike the BMA, have recognised that it is sensible to
restore public confidence in the process. I do not accept that it will
lead to doctors being too careful; I thought the arguing was slightly
bizarre from the BMA there. Doctors should be careful, and one problem
with the existing system is that you have two extremes. Because of the
criminal standard, there is often reluctance to make a ruling when it
is a bit borderline; whereas the civil standard will allow a whole
range of sanctions, from serious sanctions to retraining or
help.</div>

should feel much more relaxed about the civil standard being used than

enable quite routine actions to protect public health, as well as
responding to threats that may or may not be serious and imminent. For
example, we intend to use the powers in new section 45C to impose
standing duties on registered medical practitioners to notify cases of
specified infectious diseases, exactly paralleling the system that we
have at the moment, though working rather more effectively. That
requirement to report is certainly nothing to do with a serious and

Government Association was wholly against it, I think that it had a
particular issue with the role of JPs vis- -vis their own
traditional role. We may come on to talk about that, but I think it was
based on a slight misunderstanding of the law. The point made by one of
the local government witnesses about the Litvinenko case&#151;that
under our proposals, it would mean that we would have to make 40-plus
applications&#151;is not the case. It actually makes it much easier
because a single 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>application would take in all those premises. What was interesting about
the Litvinenko case was that the local authorities did not have the
powers to do what they needed to do. It was based on a slight
misunderstanding and, on the part of the LGA, a misunderstanding about
the availability and speed of action of JPs. The HPA was right in that
case. It welcomes such a move, because in its current experience,
getting decisions made by JPs tends to be quicker than getting
decisions made by local
authorities.</div>

of a difference in that regard, she acknowledged that help later on

On how they spend it, as I said and as our witness acknowledged, there
is clear evidence from both this and other countries that less well-off
people who experience an increase in their income&#151;women in
particular&#151;spend a higher proportion of the extra income on
their children&#146;s, husband&#146;s or partner&#146;s welfare

benefit&#151;child benefit&#151;which is paid to all. Maternity
grants are available to low-income mothers from the 29th week of
pregnancy. Help should be available to all mothers expecting a child,
so child benefit will be paid on that basis to every

Mr. Crabb raised it on Second Reading&#151;namely, that
the grants will be made in the period after which there are few, if
any, miscarriages or abortions, so we will not be making grants to

						</i> Specifically, we have had some very helpful
discussions with the Royal College of Midwives, who have been very
welcoming of the proposal. We have been looking at how we can help them
and use them as a way of helping to promote awareness of the grant, but
also we want to minimise the burdens on health professionals. We do not
want them to see this as an extra bit of form-filling that they have to
do. We are working very closely to try to help them do that job. For
some women&#151;a very small proportion of women who do not seek
regular contact with the health professionals&#151;it may actually
provide an incentive for them to make contact with a midwife and
therefore to get access to the grant. Midwives are a group we are
talking with, trying to use them as a primary way of delivering the
grant.</div>

						</b> You have clearly never had an antenatal
appointment. They are generally 10 minutes long. Other checks have to
be done. You cannot give that sort of advice in two or three minutes.
Antenatal classes are being cut around the country. I think that this
needs to be probed at a later stage as to how this is going to be
delivered.</div>

the witness to respond because we have run out of time. May I thank the
Minister and his team for giving evidence? He can re-join the
Committee. Before I close the Committee formally, may I just remind
everyone that this afternoon the meeting will be in Committee Room
9?</div>
