<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> On a point of order, Sir David. This morning I promised the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) that I would make a brief statement about the state second pension's rebate structure.
<P>
The hon. Lady will be aware that the consultation process finished as recently as 14 January. We published a paper in November that outlined two possible options, and we have decided to implement the second option, which is contained in paragraph 12 of the consultation paper. I shall not go into detail at this point because it would be inappropriate to do so. However, before the end of this afternoon's sitting I shall make available to Committee members a brief note--it runs to no more than a couple of pages--about the proposal, which I hope will be helpful.
<P>
We expect, but we are not certain, that one or more new clauses will be involved. The parliamentary counsel will receive instructions today to do the drafting, when clearance has been sorted out. I am told that the new clauses will be very complex, but we hope and expect to table them next week. We shall discuss those new clauses near the end of our proceedings. It will be useful for Committee members to know which option the Government are going for before we begin the detailed debates next week.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I thank the Minister for that brief statement. I am sure that the new clauses will be extraordinarily complex. I am also grateful to him for the suggestion, with which I hope you will agree, Sir David, that the new clauses will be debated at the end of the Bill, when we have finished considering the clauses. The thought of having to discuss those new clauses and amendments together is more than a little daunting. I make a plea for the new clauses to be explained to us using high-tech slides, but I suspect that that is too much to ask for.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Inspectors</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 221, in page 12, line 8, after 'inspector', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'shall receive full training and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Mr. Pickles.]<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 222, in page 12, line 13, after 'entry', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'in the presence of the occupier'.
<P>
No. 223, in page 12, line 15, leave out 'as he considers' and insert
<P>
'that is deemed reasonably'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham may be worried about complex matters that are still to come, but I assure her that these amendments are a model of simplicity. I shall not need flick charts or an overhead projector to make my points.
<P>
Before we broke for luncheon, I was discussing amendment No. 221, which would require the inspector to "receive full training". I discussed the nature of that training, explained that inspectors will have to enter into difficult and occasionally daunting environments in which some parties may be partisan to the arrangements, and suggested that some relevant training would not go amiss.
<P>
Amendment No. 222 would protect the rights of the employer, who shares, with institutions, a right of privacy. Those Committee members who are distinguished lawyers--my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) arrives in the Committee Room on cue, but world weary as ever--will know that judges are taking an interest in the concept of institutional privacy. This probing amendment is intended to establish what the Government will do about entry into another person's premises.
<P>
We are a little concerned about the issue that is raised in amendment No. 223. The amendment would take out the words "as he considers" and insert "that is deemed reasonably", which is clearly a difference of emphasis and style, and, more importantly, substance.
<P>
If amendments Nos. 221 or 222 are not accepted, we cannot assume that an inspector will be trained. Why should it be left up to an untrained inspector to decide what is reasonably appropriate in carrying out his inquiries? The Secretary of State or inspector should decide what information is necessary, but not what examination and inquiry is appropriate.
<P>
As we have repeatedly emphasised, we are trying to ensure that the Bill works well. The last thing we want is for the Child Support Agency, which is enjoying an improvement in its image, to return to the old days, and there is a risk that the clause may be used to bring the CSA into disrepute.
<P>
We would like the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to give a robust response to these important amendments.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> I hope that I shall be able to answer hon. Members' questions about clause 13.
<P>
The clause provides new terms of appointment for child support inspectors. The current scheme relies on an enormous amount of information being gathered to enable a maintenance assessment to be made. Where it has not been possible to obtain information from parents, a child support inspector may be sent out to gather the required information.
The Bill will change the current system whereby inspectors are allowed to be appointed only on a case-by-case basis, rather than be generally available and sent off to deal with cases as they are required. That system makes it hard to maintain a dedicated group of inspectors who acquire expertise as well as training so as to get better at their jobs. It is a cumbersome part of the Child Support Act 1991 and has led to great difficulties in ensuring that inspectors can be successful.
<P>
An inspector may visit an employer's premises or the premises from which a non-resident parent conducts his business. He may also visit the premises of a person whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting holds information about a non-resident parent acquired in the course of his own business, such as an accountant. He may question anyone he finds there and ask to see any documents. Obstructing an inspector carries a fine of up to £1,000.
<P>
The amendments would change the way in which inspectors are trained, the way in which their inspections are carried out and the basis on which they can take place. We want to make it easier and less cumbersome for the CSA to use its inspector service, and that is what clause 13 is intended to achieve.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) that no inspectors go out on behalf of the CSA without having had training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): Human rights training.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I shall deal with that in a moment. We do not send untrained people out to do potentially hazardous or difficult jobs. Clearly, inspecting is such a job. Inspectors receive full training. Currently, they are of at least executive officer grade and have a wealth of interviewing experience.
<P>
I shall give Opposition Members a quick flavour of the training that inspectors currently receive. They are trained in basic maintenance assessment calculation, which is clearly a complex issue requiring a fair degree of training, although it is hoped that less will be required once the Bill is on the statute book Inspectors are also trained in the use of lap top computers, which prove useful when they are inspecting. I doubt whether many members of the Committee require assertiveness training, but inspectors attend such courses before they begin working. On a more serious note, they receive potentially aggressive situation awareness training--expertise that we acquire, either informally or formally. They are also trained to deal with good cause situations when people may be upset and worried. They are fully trained to conduct interviews under caution, as per the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Police (Scotland) Act 1967.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> What form does that training take? Is it a residential course that lasts for weeks, or a little chat over tea when they arrive?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Perhaps I should send the hon. Gentleman videos, so that he would have a better idea of what goes on. The training takes various forms, but I can assure him that it does not consist of a chat over a cup of tea. The training that is provided for people who undertake these difficult and potentially arduous jobs is very professional. If the hon. Gentleman wants that degree of detail, I shall write to him.
<P>
The current training programme is considered sufficient for part-time inspectors, but the additional powers needed to appoint full-time inspectors cast it in a different light. I can assure the Committee that, once the Bill is enacted, training requirements will be fully re-evaluated in the light of the evolving role of child support inspectors.
<P>
Amendment No. 222 would ensure that entry into the building that is to be inspected can be obtained only
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in the presence of the occupier".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Inspectors do not possess the power to obtain entry by force, and access to carry out an inspection must be granted. We consider it reasonable that a responsible employee may grant access to the building for an inspection to take place. That will avoid needlessly delaying inspectors while the occupier himself is located.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> On a small point, under the clause, will an inspector notify an employer of his intention to inspect, or will surprise visits be paid?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The intention is not to surprise anyone or to conduct police-style raids, but to make arrangements in advance so that information on, say, earnings can be obtained. Ample warning should be given before the inspector arrives.
<P>
Amendment No. 223 would change the basis on which an inspector could enter buildings and conduct inquiries. Under the clause, he will be allowed to carry out such inspections as he considers "appropriate". If the amendment were accepted, he would carry out only such as inspections as are deemed "reasonably" appropriate.
<P>
The measures in the clause and in the Bill in general form an overall picture. They strike a balance between the need to investigate and detect fraud and error, and the individual's right to privacy. It is important to look at that picture as a whole.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> On another small point, according to my reading of the clause and the explanatory notes, the inspector can enter the premises of a person who is self-employed, and who, say, is the absent parent, or who is directly involved, if not an employer. If that person wished to continue to make life difficult, what powers would the inspector have to enter? Would he or she have to go to the police to get a warrant? How would access to the documents be obtained? That is the purpose of the inspection. Having given notice to that self-employed absent parent, what guarantee is there that the documents will not surprisingly disappear?
<P>
2.45 pm
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Lady should remember that we are taking powers to consult Inland Revenue records, which may be an easier route than playing cat and mouse with someone who continually attempts to avoid  inspection of relevant papers. That is partly why such powers are taken. We have no evidence that inspectors have so far had difficulty obtaining entry to places, or that they have encountered the problems to which the hon. Lady referred. I feel confident about the extra powers to obtain information from the Inland Revenue that are already in the Bill. In addition to the power to examine employer records, which is well established and well used in existing legislation, coupled with new offences of misleading and telling lies to the CSA, which, as criminal offences, carry a fine of up to £1,000, we have strengthened powers appropriately and in the right balance. It is extraordinary but true that, until now, it has not been an offence to tell lies to the CSA. We are correcting that with this Bill. Clearly, the CSA will consider the most effective way of obtaining the more simplified list of information that it will need to make a child maintenance calculation under the new system. I therefore think that it has the powers that it needs.
<P>
The aim of clause 13 is to remove some of the current obstacles in the path of child support inspectors. For example they will be appointed for longer periods to allow them to build up experience, as opposed to the present cumbersome time-limited appointment of inspectors on a case by case basis. The removal of such obstacles is intended to make child support inspectors more effective at securing the flow of maintenance from unco-operative non-resident parents to their children. We believe that our measures strike the right balance between the need to access information and an individual's right to privacy. On that basis, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I have two contradictory reactions to the Under-Secretary's speech. The first was aroused by her remarks and concerns the wide-ranging nature of the inspector's powers. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An inspector has power, at any reasonable time and either alone or accompanied by such other persons as he thinks fit, to enter any premises".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It could be any premises--a car, or, we are told, a hovercraft. Good lord, could it be a balloon? Inspectors could enter such premises, and anyone who may obstruct them would be subject to a substantial fine. What could constitute obstruction? The Under-Secretary has already referred to the need for assertiveness training when undertaking such activities. Imagine the proper reaction of innocent parties in one of those premises, be it a car, a building, a balloon, a bus or whatever, who, by going about their ordinary business, find themselves subject to the inquiries of an inspector who is trained in assertiveness--
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): With a laptop.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> An inspector with a laptop computer who is trained in assertiveness by the CSA. Imagine the reaction of citizens going about their lawful business, and the awkward way in which they deal with such a situation. Whether that constituted obstruction would be a fine judgment to make. The provision raises questions of civil liberties.
<P>
I asked the Under-Secretary--admittedly from a sedentary intervention from which the hon. Lady may not have caught the full thrust of my inquiry--whether the inspectors would be given human rights training. There has been a lot of that about recently. It would be entirely proper to the circumstances covered by the clause. My first reaction--the natural reaction of an Englishman--is to be slightly bolshie about authority and the increasing powers given to authorities to intervene in people's lives. I feel a natural nervousness about our liberties and the extension of state power under the clause.
<P>
However, my other reaction is: "If you won't look after your own, what are you? What rights do you have?" We are discussing people who have fathered children and are seeking to avoid the responsibility of maintaining them. The Bill appears to say that those people have fewer rights, or no rights at all, and that it is proper that draconian powers should be granted to pursue those people because of the nature of their offence--their failure to take account of their children. That is a powerful message, and it plays on the public demand for justice and proper treatment for those who avoid the responsibilities that ordinary families regard as sacred.
<P>
Those are two different reactions to the provision. Are we prepared to accept, as the Bill appears to, the lower standard of civil liberty and protection, which will accompany these draconian powers, for people who have failed to live up to their responsibilities as citizens?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The amendments cover wider issues than protecting the rights of non-resident parents. They are also about protecting the rights of an employer and others in a firm who may have nothing to do with the issue, but whose privacy must not be invaded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Absolutely. Any person who might obstruct the inspectors as they go about their inquiries is roped into the scope of the clause. I understand the thrust of my hon. Friend's remarks. I got carried away from the force of the amendments into a clause stand part debate, for which I apologise, Sir David.
<P>
On whichever side of the divide one finds oneself--whichever of the reactions to the clause that I have described one takes--one can see that our amendments have force because they provide proper protection--even if one accepts that draconian powers need to be granted. The amendments would provide at least a measure of protection for the citizen under those draconian powers.
<P>
To return to my main theme, it strikes me that these powers are entirely consistent with the Benthamite nature of the Bill. Perhaps another Benthamite principle is invoked in this provision--that of less eligibility: those who have abdicated their responsibilities should be less eligible.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I should like to reassure the hon. Gentleman that his view of the powers conferred by the Bill is grossly exaggerated and out of kilter with reality. Then again, the hon. Gentleman's views are often grossly exaggerated and out of kilter with reality. We just have to live with that in Committee.
<P>
The powers are not draconian, as the hon. Gentleman described them, but absolutely consistent with the powers that inspectors already have. They can always be  tested in court, and the definition of "appropriate" is precisely what the court would test. We are talking only about the difference between reasonably appropriate and appropriate, and I suspect that most lawyers would be able to tell the Committee that there is little difference between the two.
<P>
I should like to reassure the hon. Gentleman that Tom Paine will not be turning in his grave at the thought of the inspectors' powers, although perhaps Edmund Burke would do so. The hon. Gentleman painted a picture of someone going about their lawful business and coming across an inspector, as one might come across an inspector on a bus. I have often encountered inspectors on buses, but they usually just want to check that I have a ticket.
<P>
The inspectors will chase only people who have children and are evading their responsibilities by not giving information and deliberately trying to duck out of the inspector's way. We are determined to chase those people, because they have responsibilities for the children that they have fathered. Clause 13 will ensure that we are more effective and efficient in tracking them down, while maintaining the appropriate protections. The hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) should calm down and accept that the measures are reasonable and strike the right balance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I should like to make a few remarks before we vote. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West does not calm down, because he is a robust defender of individual rights on matters of law and order.
<P>
For the sake of debate, we have argued our case in fairly stark terms. However, we have made legitimate points. This is not just a matter of striking a balance in respect of absconding fathers seeking to evade their responsibilities, but of protecting employers and fellow employees who are not seeking, in any way, to avoid their responsibilities, because they do not have any such responsibilities, other than to provide lawful information to the inspector. The Under-Secretary said, in response to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West made with regard to inspectors' sweeping powers of entry to premises, that they would give notice. I am sure that they would. However, an inspector who had missed--or overdone--his assertiveness training might overstep the mark.
<P>
The difference between the Under-Secretary's example of the inspector on the bus and the inspector in the Bill is that the former wears a uniform, and it is therefore obvious who he is. I do not expect that inspectors will be put in some kind of livery--perhaps a pin-striped suit and bowler hat--to do the business of the CSA.
<P>
Amendment No. 223 would ensure that the inspector acts reasonably--in the opinion not of the inspector, but of a reasonable person.

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will my hon, Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I shall be most interested to hear what my hon. Friend has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Under-Secretary's comment about the inspector on the bus was utterly facile and ridiculous? Nobody, apart from a crook, would deny that if people travel on a bus they have to pay, and there is no doubt about how much they are supposed to pay. To make such a comparison between the two kinds of inspector is plain daft.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, although I would not have chosen to use such strong language. I am not sure that St. Ignatius would have done so either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a private joke.

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 12, line 20, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(or a person alleged to be one)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 21 to 23.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I can be brief. Amendments Nos. 20 to 22 will strike out a phrase that appears three times in subsection (4A). In reference to a non-resident parent, they will remove the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(or a person alleged to be one)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase is unnecessary because, by the time an inspection is carried out, the inspector will already be satisfied that the parent is a non-resident parent.
<P>
Amendment No. 23 will amend section 15(6) of the Child Support Act 1991. A duty is laid on persons over the age of 18 who are found on the premises to provide information and/or documents that are reasonably required by the inspector.
<P>
Given the narrowness of the amendments, I hope that that brief explanation is sufficient, although I am happy to go into further detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Having appeared to be critical during the previous debate--in fact, my intention was to be even-handed--I rise briefly to congratulate the Government. I accept the force of the clause and the amendments, which are eminently sensible. The presumption that a man is the father of a child if he is married to its mother at any time between conception and birth, which pertains in Scotland, strikes me as entirely proper and sensible. The clause will extend that principle to England and Wales. That is long overdue and entirely appropriate. It strikes me as odd to have assumed--
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is not for me to say, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman should bide his time until we reach the appropriate amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am tempted to give a one-sentence explanation to the hon. Member for New Forest, West, who earlier tried to speak to the amendment and to agree with its content.
<P>
The amendment will add a comparable reference to the registration of a birth in Scotland to that which is used in England and Wales in case A2, details of which appear on page 13 of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 13, line 18, leave out from beginning to end of line 20 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Where the result of a scientific test (within the meaning of section 27(A) taken by the alleged parent would be relevant to determining that person's parentage, and the alleged parent--
<P>
(a) refuses to take such a test; or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 26, in page 13, line 23, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(2) In that provision, after Case B there shall be inserted--
<P>
"Case B1
<P>
Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the alleged parent is a parent of the child in question by virtue of section 27 or 28 of that Act (meaning of "mother" and of "father" respectively)."'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I suspect that Committee members realise that advances in science have created the need for amendments such as this one. It will allow the Secretary of State to presume parentage when an alleged parent has refused to take a DNA test. The onus will be on the alleged parent to pursue further action in order to refute the assumption. The agency will presume parentage only when there is sufficient information to do so, allowing it to make a maintenance calculation and to start enforcement action if necessary.
<P>
It remains open for the non-resident parent to apply to the court for a formal declaration as to whether or not he is the father of the child. The court's decision will be binding on the agency. If it subsequently turns out that the alleged parent is not the father, any maintenance paid will be refunded.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 will allow the Secretary of State to presume parentage in cases of surrogacy or artificial insemination. In relation to section 27 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, a woman who has carried a child in cases of surrogacy shall be treated as the mother, for child support purposes, unless an adoption order has been made.
<P>
For purposes of section 28 of the 1990 Act, if a woman who has carried a child as a result of artificial insemination or other fertility treatment was married at the time of insemination her husband or, if appropriate, her partner shall be treated as the father of the child, for child support purposes, unless it is shown that he did not consent to the surrogacy or insemination.
<P>
Thankfully, we do not expect many cases to fall within those categories. However, we believe that this helpful amendment will enable the Child Support Agency to calculate a maintenance assessment quickly if parentage is disputed in such cases. If there is any doubt about making a presumption in such cases, the agency will apply to the court for a declaration of parentage.
I ask the Committee to agree to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I shall make a brief contribution. These sensible amendments are a strange reflection on the advances in modern science. I have not been a Member of Parliament for very long: I entered the House in 1992--at the same time, I believe, as the Under-Secretary--but such possibilities seemed incredible even then. In 10 years' time, we may have to consider amendments dealing with cloning. We earlier debated our amendments relating to DNA testing, and should be able to avoid a similar debate in this context.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's response was helpful. However, it will be necessary to ensure that staff have a full appreciation of this matter. The Under-Secretary may say that such circumstances are exceptional, especially with regard to surrogacy, about which I would agree with her. However, I am not sure that I could say that with the same authority if we were to make a projection into the future of 10 to 15 years or more. It would be best to get it right early. The Under-Secretary's sensible and straightforward intentions should apply throughout the CSA.

Clause 14, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
Clause 61
<P>
Tests for determining parentage
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am interested in the issue of laboratories being appointed by the Lord Chancellor or a body appointed by him. I want to tease out what laboratories the Under-Secretary envisages. Who, at the moment, accredits those laboratories? There are a variety of different laboratories--Government laboratories, laboratories attached to hospitals and, I am glad to say, in this day and age, privately owned laboratories offering services to the private and public sectors. There are also research laboratories, the laboratories of pharmaceutical companies and medical product companies and--without wishing to throw too large a stone into the pond--animal testing laboratories. Laboratories are accredited by different bodies. Animal testing laboratories are, I think, accredited by the Home Office. I should imagine that Government laboratories are accredited by whichever Department pays the bills. Pharmaceutical companies, in the process of developing drugs, will need to be sure that their laboratories meet the highest standards, and must be accredited by one or other body, possibly the Department of Health. Hospital laboratories, if they need accreditation, are, I assume, accredited by the Department of Health.
<P>
Unless the Government are to create a whole new range of laboratories, in the public or private sector, which laboratories will be used? Who accredits them at the moment, and what jobs are they doing? Why is the Lord Chancellor responsible for appointing them? Why not the Department of Social Security, which, after all, is responsible for paying the bills? What accreditation process will be followed? Will a laboratory have to be accredited by more than one body or Department? What kind of red tape, or regulatory burden, will be placed on a laboratory that wishes to offer the service? Given the number of people who challenge paternity, which the Under-Secretary acknowledged, how will we be sure that the laboratory has sufficient throughput to ensure that tests are performed to the highest possible standards? After all, one of the problems associated with the increase in health prevention tests is that some laboratories do not do enough tests to meet the highest possible standards.
<P>
I am sure that the Under-Secretary will understand why I raise this point. I hope that she will be able to reassure us that the Lord Chancellor's staff, who will be accrediting the laboratories, will know what they are looking for and what to do. As far as I am aware, the Lord Chancellor's Department is made up primarily of lawyers, not scientists, chemists, or people with medical experience. He may, therefore, find himself under a degree of pressure in providing the people who will accredit the laboratories. I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would reassure me on the matter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I hope that I shall be able to do so. The hon. Lady presumes that the existing law on testing is far more up to date than it is. The clause will bring that legislation up to date.
<P>
The clause makes changes to arrangements for court-ordered blood tests to determine parentage. That is why the Lord Chancellor's Department is the appropriate Department in this case, rather than the CSA. It is obviously a matter of interest to the CSA if a court can determine parentage, but it is a matter for the Lord Chancellor to decide how services such as testing will be supplied for the court's use. This arrangement may seem odd, but clause 61 deals with how the courts, rather than the CSA, will determine parentage.
<P>
The present system, under which we still labour, was established by regulations made under the Family Law Reform Act 1969. I hinted in the debate on clause 12 that those arrangements were cumbersome and increasingly difficult to put into effect. That is because standards for testing and the arrangements for the supply of testing have changed so much since 1969. The Government are trying to introduce increased safeguards to ensure that testing is carried out properly and effectively, in line with newer methods of organisation.
<P>
The present law does not allow standards to be set for the laboratory conditions under which testers work. The Lord Chancellor can regulate individual testers, but not  the laboratories in which they work. That arrangement causes problems, because quality standards do not apply to the laboratory in which the tests are carried out. I emphasise that there has not been a problem with the way in which individual testers do their job. There is no sign that they have fallen below standard. However, it is more appropriate these days to be able to licence a laboratory, rather than individual people, to carry out tests.
<P>
By moving to a system of accredited laboratories, the Lord Chancellor will be able to make regulations to prescribe conditions with which a body must comply to be eligible for accreditation, including ensuring that satisfactory laboratory conditions are in place, and to set minimum qualifications for individual testers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Would a person go to a laboratory to have a test, or would it be carried out in the field?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is done in a laboratory, but the 1969 Act, under which the tests are carried out on behalf of the courts, allows the Lord Chancellor to accredit only individuals to carry out tests, rather than laboratories. As I was eight years old when the law was passed, I cannot enlighten the hon. Gentleman as to the nature of the discussions that led to its introduction.
<P>
However, in the meantime, the way in which testing is supplied, and the methods used, have changed out of all recognition. This measure is a means of updating that legislation to make it more effective and efficient. The Lord Chancellor will then be able to ensure that the courts have access to a properly verifiable process, with standards and quality that can be tested and maintained.
<P>
In addition, the Government intend to bring into force by commencement order, in conjunction with the new system, section 23 of the Family Law Reform Act 1987. That will allow testing to take place on not only blood but other bodily samples. It will also enable tests regarding parentage to be ordered on any other party to the court proceedings, in addition to the child, mother and alleged father.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I do not want to hold up proceedings, but I wonder whether such tests would be carried out in police forensic laboratories. I am worried that laboratories that are perhaps--not currently accredited by the Lord Chancellor could tender for the work. Of course, that is their choice, but such laboratories would be subject to different regulatory regimes, with the attendant regulatory burden and red tape.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> No laboratories are currently licensed to undertake those tests. The 1969 Act allows only individual testers to be licensed, not laboratories. From that point of view, there is a blank slate. [Interruption.] The hon. Lady is chomping at the bit, so I shall allow her to respond.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The Under-Secretary has just created a huge potential. Can she assure me that the provision will apply only to blood tests or DNA tests for CSA purposes? Alternatively, is it an attempt to slide into general legislation accreditation for all laboratories that the Lord Chancellor asks to test samples used by the police or the courts?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> These clauses will change the way in which courts access test results to establish parentage by modernising the existing structure provided by the Family Law Reform Act 1969. Obviously, the CSA has an interest in the matter, but it is the Lord Chancellor's Department that has sought this modernisation. lt will take all decisions on how regulation will proceed, so that the way in which courts establish parentage can be updated. I am told that the Lord Chancellor intends to set up an expert body to advise him on issues relating to accreditation. Once he has the primary power to modernise the system, that work will be on-going. If the hon. Lady is interested in these matters, she must ask questions of the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>
The idea is to update the system. Committee members should take note of section 23 of the Family Law Reform Act 1987, which allows samples other than blood to be tested, and allows relatives other than immediate relatives to be tested in the event that, say, the non-resident parent or the mother has died. Cases have arisen where grandparents' DNA tests have helped to establish parentage.
<P>
These matters are dealt with in the clause. I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that our intention is to establish an easily usable, high-quality system that will ensure that tests ordered by the courts to establish parentage are conducted in a modern way and to the highest standards. In light of that explanation, I hope that Committee members will accept the clause.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I shall give a brief explanation of the arrangements in the clause, which have attracted considerable interest.
<P>
The clause makes changes to the procedure for obtaining a declaration of parentage from the courts, to create a single procedure that is valid for all purposes and available at all levels of courts. Declarations under the Child Support Act 1991 are currently valid only for child support purposes. During the passage of the Child Support Act 1995, an amendment was tabled to extend the validity to cover other purposes. The Government of the time wanted to consider the issue further, and undertook a public consultation to establish whether there was support for the proposed change. There was a consensus for the change, and clause 62 reflects the outcome of that consultation.
<P>
Currently, there are two separate procedures for obtaining a declaration of parentage, under section 56 of the Family Law Act 1986 and under section 27 of the Child Support Act 1991. Declarations of parentage under the Family Law Act are valid for all purposes. However, those made under the Child Support Act are valid for child support purposes only. The new provisions will ensure that declarations made under either Act are valid for all purposes and will remove the possible need for separate applications to be made. The clause will provide a single, clear and consistent system of obtaining declarations of parentage. I commend it to the Committee.

<P>
We are now in our third week of deliberations. You, Sir David, as a senior Member of Parliament, may have noticed a phenomenon that sometimes occurs in Committee in respect of the Opposition's motivation in tabling amendments. It is similar to the Stockholm syndrome, whereby victims of incarceration start to feel sympathy for their captors. In our third week in Committee, having started out as bitter enemies of the Government, we are starting to develop a degree of sympathy with them. We do not want them to look ridiculous, and we tabled the amendment to try to prevent that. If there was ever an example of "We are here to help as a constructive Opposition", this is it.
<P>
It was a matter of deep pain to me that on Second Reading, one Labour Back Bencher after another stood up to say how ridiculous it was to take away driving licences. I agreed with them, because of the lack of measures that are open to the CSA and the courts--there is nothing in between imprisonment and a fine. I suppose that that was the original intention behind the provision. At one time, as was revealed in the press, there was an intention to take away people's passports. However, the subsequent problems at the Passport Office and the Home Office resulted in everybody's passports being taken away--defaulter and non-defaulter alike. It was rather like a grand Mafia scheme, whereby if one cannot work out who the informer is, one kills everybody.
<P>
The amendment refers to community service orders and, in particular, curfew orders. It was inspired--I pay tribute to him--by none other than the Prime Minister. When, bleary-eyed, I watched his interview on "Breakfast with Frost" a few weeks ago, he talked about what a marvellous success electronic tags and curfew orders had been. That is indeed the case. The recipients  of such orders are carefully selected, and consequently there is a high degree of compliance. The Prime Minister said--I quote from The Guardian--

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> A journal of record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Not necessarily for the Conservative party, although the standing of The Guardian is pretty hot in relation to Labour Members. The Prime Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are now considering electronic tagging for domestic violence and stalking cases."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a sensible idea. Earlier, we were talking about the problems of violent partners, usually violent fathers. The purpose of many court orders is to keep people apart, but enforcement is a problem. However, with tagging, it is possible to know immediately if someone is in a forbidden area or has broken a curfew. It seems natural to extend the idea of curfew orders and apply that to the armoury of the CSA.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
An interesting article in Justice of the Peace on 4 September outlined some of the ways in which curfew orders have worked, and some of the article is directly relevant to our consideration of the Bill. The article suggests that sentences should not exceed six months, and should not be for less than two hours, or more than 12 hours, a day. It suggests that an order should not conflict with a person's religious beliefs or with another community service order, and that it definitely should not interfere with someone's employment or educational opportunities. For example, to take away a person's driving licence might interfere with his or her employment prospects. The article states that the consent of the offender is not required, and says that the curfew order is, in fact, a community order. Therefore, the offence must be too serious for a fine or a discharge.
<P>
The Under-Secretary spoke about helping someone to get into the habit of paying, and her remarks received much approval in Committee. That is why the curfew order is ideal. A person who is subject to a curfew order must, of necessity, get into the regular habit of paying and also, one hopes, into the habit of acting as a responsible person within the community.
<P>
The article in Justice of the Peace goes on to consider what other factors should be regarded as relevant. It considers the risk of people committing criminal offences, but that is not relevant to the Committee. However, it asks:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Is it necessary or desirable to keep the offender away from undesirable associates, for example, football matches or rallies or clubs?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We could design curfew orders to say, "There is no Saturday afternoon football for you, my friend, no going off to the club at night and no pouring your earnings down your throat and down the drain. We will ensure that you work, live up to your responsibilities and pay towards your child's maintenance." In the list of relevant factors, the article also asks,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Does the offender indulge in irresponsible leisure activities?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could take many forms.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Bungy jumping.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Indeed, that is a possibility, but bungy jumping is not an activity widely associated with people who seek to avoid their obligations to their children. I was thinking that the offender might say, "Rather than spend money on my child, I will go out clubbing, rallying or drinking." We want a person to have a reasonable social attitude and routine. If a curfew order means that an offender spends more time at home with his family, that may be a good thing.
<P>
There are many possibilities for the CSA. In December last year, the Minister of State, Home Office, the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), talked about extending the powers that permit the electronic monitoring, of offenders who are under a curfew order to increase the sentencing option and to be more flexible. As the Government are thinking of extending electronic monitoring beyond prisoners on parole to stalkers and people who inflict domestic violence, it would be only natural to apply that to CSA cases. For those offences that are not serious enough to warrant prison, other options should be available. The Government should include those options in their armoury to get a person back into the habit of making payments and being responsible, to use the Under-Secretary's words.
<P>
What is the point of taking away a driving licence if it removes a person's ability to earn a living? What is the point of taking someone out of employment and putting them on to benefits? It is self-defeating. The Government recommended the removal of driving licences only because it was deemed inappropriate to deny people their passports. But here we are, like the seventh cavalry, coming over the hill to protect the Government, and I hope that they are grateful. Our amendment offers them a great opportunity to be magnanimous and to ensure that, on Third Reading, I will not have the embarrassment or the pain of watching Labour Back Benchers ridicule their Government. It would hurt a lot to see that. This is the Government's chance to avoid future embarrassment.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It may assist the Committee if I explain the thinking behind the clause. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the persuasive way in which he put his argument. Clause 15 introduces a new civil penalty that disqualifies a non-resident parent from holding or obtaining a driving licence. Magistrates will consider that as an alternative to committal to prison, which is the only option at present. Amendment No. 216 would increase the range of sanctions available to magistrates bv extending the powers to include deduction from benefit, home detention curfews and community service.
<P>
An order for deduction from benefit is unnecessary as clause 20 will increase the range of benefits from which deductions can be made at source. The flat rate of £5 in respect of maintenance will be taken from non-resident parents on most benefits and war pensions. We shall also be able to deduct for arrears. Automatic deduction from benefit ensures that maintenance is paid regularly and on time.
<P>
As drafted, the amendment would not give courts the power to impose a home detention curfew. It would be available only as an early-release option for some groups of prisoner and as an administrative, rather than a judicial, decision. In explaining the amendment, the hon. Member for Gainsborough reinforced my suspicion that Opposition Members intend home detention as an alternative to other penalties.
<P>
The effectiveness of curfew orders and community service orders to encourage payment is currently subject to evaluation by the Home Office in the context of their use for fine defaulters and persistent petty offenders under the Criminal Sentences Act 1997. It would be premature to provide for their use without considering the pilot scheme. A range of sanctions is available to the Child Support Agency to encourage non-resident parents to meet their financial responsibilities to their children. The Bill contains further measures that will be effective and useful in that respect.
<P>
We may not have covered every possibility, and I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's suggestions, which are intriguing. I am unsure about their practicality, however, as the amendments have technical defects, but if the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw his amendment now, we shall consider it in more detail with a view to tabling an amendment on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is an encouraging response. It shows that if one keeps trying, week after week, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar has done, persistence strikes gold. We were set to make long speeches--
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): Do not be put off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No, I shall not; now that we are on a winning streak, we want to keep digging. Clause 15 is the worst in the Bill; it does not make sense. It is kind of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar to save the Government from the stupidity of their actions, although I do not know whether it is wise to do so. My hon. Friend is obviously a statesman, unlike the rest of us who are mere politicians.
<P>
The Government know that they are in deep trouble about the proposal because a punishment must bear some relation to the alleged crime committed. For whatever reason, the fact that a non-resident parent does not pay to support a child has nothing to do with driving a car. The suggestion that the problem can be solved by removing people's driving licences is patently ridiculous and it will almost certainly be ruled out of order by that great institution, which we all revere, the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): I quote from Mr. Nicholas Mostyn's evidence to the Select Committee on Social Services in reply to a question posed by the hon. Member for Gainsborough. He told the hon. Gentleman:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the United States of America it is a specific criminal offence not to pay child support."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"You can be tried by jury ... you can have your driving licence taken away ... Research has shown that where you have draconian measures the rates of compliance have gone up considerably."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In that context, he referred especially to driving licences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am delighted that three weeks into the Committee, the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr Dismore), has repeatedly attacked the distinguished QC, now prays him in aid as soon as he gets into difficulties. Is the hon. Gentleman praising the American criminal justice system? How many people have been executed this year in the United States? How many people are in prison in America?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Not enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The hon. Gentleman should consider what is happening in America's social structure and criminal justice system. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West, if he thinks more carefully and stops trying to win a particular debating point he might pause to feel some concern. In real  life, everybody knows that it is ludicrous to remove somebody' s driving licence in the proposed way.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman should know that the power to disqualify a person from holding a driving licence for non-motoring offences was introduced by the Conservative party as part of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, for which I suspect the hon. Gentleman voted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I do not know whether I voted for it and it does not really matter. We are discussing something very different.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The main thing is to talk about the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I shall not pursue the point, except to say that the provision is another attack on rural areas, as my hon. Friend said. If I had a chocolate æclair in my hand, I would throw it towards the Government Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes </B>(Doncaster, North): There are some in the Tea Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> We are not going to get down to the Tea Room just yet.
<P>
There is no doubt that the Government must provide a solution. How should persistent non-payers be dealt with? I suspect that one influence on the Government is the feeling at the back of some people's minds that the persistent non-payer tends to be young, to drive a fast car, to go to football matches on Saturday afternoons and to do other such things. I suspect, however, that a persistent non-payer is typically an older man who has started a second family, who could be feeling aggrieved about the way in which his first relationship broke up, who is on or near to benefits and who is finding it difficult to pay. The simplistic argument that such people can be dealt with by taking away their driving licences or by imposing another obvious penalty is wishful thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Going back to the hon. Gentleman's response to my earlier intervention, I must say that I would not advocate the introduction of capital penalties for people who do not pay child support. I pray in aid that eminent judge from Australia, Mr. Justice Kay, who stated in his evidence to the Select Committee:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Vigilance and rapid action seem to be me to be the keys to ensuring that arrears are never allowed to accumulate to a point where they cannot be managed. This means frequent and urgent action should be taken once a default occurs."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Somebody who is not paying to run a car will have an  awful lot more money available to pay outstanding child support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a ridiculous intervention. In many areas, whether in rural Lincolnshire, the New Forest or other rural districts, a car is an essential part of life. The village in which I live has one bus a week. One cannot get to work on that basis, especially as the bus arrives in Market Rasen at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon and leaves at five past three.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not appear to have read the clause, which makes specific provision to inquire whether a driving licence is needed to earn a living.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I know, I have read that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 92 relates to that subject, and is the next amendment to be considered. I know that hon. Members will want to keep their speeches tightly focused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I would like to answer that point, but--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There will be time to do so when we discuss the next amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Indeed. My hon. Friend is trying to find a way forward, and I know that it is difficult for the Government to try to think up a penalty. We all know that simply sending people to prison will not work; once people are in prison, they are incapable of providing for themselves. My hon. Friend is right to say that a curfew makes some sort of sense.
<P>
I was impressed with the Minister's assurance that she would consider the amendment, but before she gave it she made a worrying comment. She remarked that the pilot study is still being carried out and that we are in the early days, and appeared to intimate that it would be difficult to include new provision in the Bill now. If the pilot study is shown to be a success--as I assume it will be--it will be too late to include such provisions in the Bill. I did not quite understand the two points made by the Minister. In the early part of her speech, she seemed to dismiss my hon. Friend's remarks by saying that it was all too new, difficult and expensive. In her latter remarks, she seemed to suggest that his proposal was a good idea. that he was getting the Government out of a fix and that she would like to consider the idea. What does she intend to do? When shall we find out whether the proposal will be included?
<P>
It would be useful to know whether, if the Minister is looking at my hon. Friend's proposal in a positive light, she will accept all his arguments for a curfew. A curfew would not keep someone away, from work or from his family, but it is a real punishment. Is she seriously saying that that would not be sufficient punishment? She might respond that keeping someone at home would not deliver the goods.
<P>
A warm glow immediately engulfed the Committee as soon as the Minister started to respond positively to my hon. Friend. However, we should not simply lie back in a warm pleasurable bath, saying that we are all good at agreeing with each other and that everything is marvellous. We need to know why the Minister agrees with him. She has dismissed all his other amendments; now she has suddenly started to agree with him. Why does she think that a curfew order will deliver the goods and that it will be a punishment? She is the Minister, who is supposed to reply for the Government. There is no point in her just sitting there.
<P>
The matters are serious: we must ensure that people pay, and that there is a realistic sanction, which will not send people to prison or stop them working but that will make them pay. Perhaps there is no such sanction and we shall never square the circle. My hon. Friend's proposal might be the only sensible way forward. We should like to know more from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> If it is all right with my hon. Friend, I should like to lounge in that bath of warm agreement for a few moments. I welcome what the Minister said--we are wrestling with a matter that goes to the heart of the problem. In what I thought was an enlightened intervention, the Minister of State painted a picture of men at the bar discussing a matter with bravado. He gave us a taster of a conversation--a man was bragging about not making any payment for the children whom he had fathered. The conversation was entirely imaginary, but it drew attention to an attitude that we must deal with and stamp out. The attitude might be characterised as distinctive of what is euphemistically called the lifestyle press, especially of men's lifestyle magazines--not those to be found in a scaled cellophane apper on the top shelf but those immediately adjacent, which are almost of the same category.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I thought that my hon. Friend was a family man.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let us keep to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I am talking about the attitude that pervades such magazines, which we must stamp out. Again, the Minister drew similarities between that attitude and the attitude that persisted 20 or 25 years ago towards drink driving. That crime was then considered acceptable, someone could brag at the bar about having got away with it. Precisely the revolution in public attitude on drink driving must be achieved in respect of the payment of maintenance for one's children.
<P>
The key question is what might bring about such a revolution in attitudes. One aspect undoubtedly is draconian punishment. We saw in the evidence to the Select Committee that enforcement and compliance were much more successful when punishments were draconian. We should consider whether we might make the jump to applying such a penalty because driving licence removal was appropriate for drinking driving. I am glad that the Minister is prepared to give the suggestion second thoughts, and perhaps to consider the other punishments proposed in the amendments. Evidence was given to the Select Committee on countries that employ systems of publicly naming and shaming. That might be appropriate and useful to consider when she returns with amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): I cannot match my hon. Friend's expertise on top shelf magazines. I assume that he was referring to Gardeners' World Magazine and that kind of thing. I do not want to stray too far on to the subject of driving licences at this point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I support the provision because it gives other options and, having reread it, I am not entirely convinced that we should not have gone further and perhaps struck out altogether the stricter punishments such as jail and taking away driving licences. I am not convinced that those should be available to the court.
<P>
I do not want to go over the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar; the fundamental issue must be what will benefit the child concerned. Does a child benefit from having a parent in prison? Will such a child benefit financially? What about the stigma? How would the parent then begin to reduce the debt? I understand that release will be possible on reduction of the debt, but I would have thought it was difficult to reduce a debt, and manage one's affairs, while in prison--although I have never been in prison.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I have never read one of those magazines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I take my hon. Friend's word for that.
<P>
Will the loss of that parent's driving licence help the child concerned? Losing one's licence can mean losing one's income. Would it help if a child's parent could not drive to see him or her? I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Hendon that in some circumstances parents might not lose their licence, but the matter should be weighed up carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. We must ask ourselves whether any of the proposed punishments--loss of driving licence, curfew, prison or anything else--will help parents to see their children. That is what the Bill is supposed to be about--children and keeping them in touch with their parents. How will a child be helped to maintain contact with his father by such measures? He will not be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I entirely agree.
<P>
The punishments that we are proposing--the home detention curfew and community service order could, if strict enough, act as a punishment, a deterrent and perhaps even a correction. Sentences are supposed to be about those three things. The absent parent could be punished, deterred and corrected by such measures without the child being adversely affected.
<P>
I am heartened by the Minister's open-mindedness and her willingness to take into account what I have said about preventing the child from being harmed by what is done to the parents. The child will already have been harmed by the fact that the parents have split up. Let us not cause further damage.

<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The Minister may appreciate the fact that Opposition Members are, I suspect, all viewing this matter from a slightly different perspective. However, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, whose charm and persuasiveness clearly had an impact on the Minister, since she has agreed to consider his amendment for inclusion in the Bill. That is greatly to be welcomed.
<P>
I have a slightly different perspective on the matter from that of my colleagues. One of the great difficulties that has arisen with the CSA has been the extreme unwillingness of some absent parents to cough up. That simply is unacceptable. Therefore we must be imaginative and think carefully about how the Bill can have an impact on the determined individuals concerned. A great many parents come to constituency surgeries and explain how assiduously the absent parents evade their responsibilities.

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I was expressing a divergent opinion from that of my hon. Friends on the importance of ensuring that absent parents pay their maintenance and the difficulties we have had with those who are totally unwilling to do just that. They have used the lack of penalties in the 1991 Act to evade their responsibilities, and that is unacceptable. I applaud the Government for trying to think of ways in which the money can be extracted, for want of a better word, from them and handed over to their children, which is the aim of the Bill. I do not underestimate the difficulties of achieving that, given that the law must be compliant with human rights legislation, which often seems to be at odds with natural justice for the rest of us. I acknowledge that it is difficult, and I am pleased to hear that the Minister is prepared to consider our amendment to introduce and to use the new tagging procedures, which might deter people from evading their responsibilities.
<P>
It is important to put those responsibilities in context. Absent parents who do not pay towards their children's upkeep create two losers: the taxpayer, whose deep pockets are used and abused, and the children. It is not fair that people on modest incomes have to pay, either through income tax or indirect taxes, of which there have been quite a lot more recently, and they often find it difficult to raise their own families. They have to pay for the pairs of trainers and for their child to go on the school trip when income is a little tight. They rightly expect that absent fathers or mothers should pay a contribution so that the taxpayer's contribution can be lessened.
<P>
A huge number of children are in the care of a single parent. There are about 1 million such families. That is a lot of people, and it adds up to a lot of money, if the taxpayer's interest is not considered. Equally, there are the interests of the children. They have also been a major part of our debate. In many cases we are not talking purely about benefit levels, but about the contribution to the children's maintenance that raises the family above a certain standard of living. Where an absent parent's contribution lifts the family well off income support, it can mean a much better standard of living for the children and things become much easier to cope with for all concerned. Trips to McDonald's are not just at Christmas but can be a more regular treat. The parent with care, usually the mother, does not have to worry how much is left in her purse at the end of the week when she does the family shop.
<P>
Such considerations are a great burden for many people. Ensuring that the money from absent parents gets into the pockets of those families is not just of academic interest. It is hugely and materially important to many families with limited resources, and for whom the contribution from the other parent is extremely important. We should look for ways of ensuring that the absent parent meets that responsibility. Sadly, and for reasons that I find inexplicable, we know that many of them see no reason why they should do so.
<P>
The evidence is that many absent parents do not want to hand the money over. That is just not fair, and we must think of ways to ensure that they do so. I know that we shall be able to debate the matter again on later amendments, and we may be able to consider other ways of dealing with it, but I do not see why good old-fashioned debt collecting should not be used as a sanction against absent parents who consistently refuse to pay up.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The agency collects debts in the usual way. It has just taken on private-sector contractors to help it to do so more effectively. The problem is that 90 per cent. of its time is spent on calculation, and only 10 per cent. on enforcement. That is where the difficulty lies.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I thank the Minister. My ignorance of the fact that debt collection is in place stems from the fact that it is relatively little used. I hope that the Minister is right that the agency will be able to spend more time collecting debts.
<P>
I am pleased that the Government are prepared to consider the amendment, but we must also consider what will happen if the sanction of prison sentences is not effective in forcing absent parents to do right by their children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have enjoyed the debate. It went on longer than I expected, but it is a moment that I want to savour. The Minister's remarks were extremely generous. I do not see a problem in including the provision in the Bill; it could be held back by a commencement order. The Home Secretary described it as a remarkable success, so I am pleased with the Minister's response. I think that she may have seduced me with my own vanity, because I can see a bit of political immortality coming my way. Mr. Belisha has his beacon, Lord Barnett has his formula, Lord Baker has his Baker days. I can foresee absent fathers who get themselves into trouble being Pickled.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I shall keep that image in my mind.
<P>
I want to be sure that Opposition Members understand what I said. I was surprised that they were still arguing for the amendment after I said that we would reconsider the matter. I was not given much incentive to make further concessions when the first concession made no difference to the number of hon. Members who wanted to speak.
<P>
Some hon. Members characterised my concession as an admission that driving licences would not be an effective sanction. Before we move on, I want to say that we are willing to consider the other suggestions made by the Opposition. Indeed, representations have been made by my hon. Friends, especially by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. However, they will not replace existing provisions, but will be an extra provision in our armoury. I wanted to put that on the record in case anyone gets the wrong impression.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The Minister kindly said that she would consider our suggestions--and we are grateful for that--but that she was minded not to put anything in the Bill. If the Government were to introduce an amendment on Report, that would be marvellous, but if nothing is going to go in the Bill, I am concerned that she will have to guarantee a legislative slot when the Home Office and the Department have made up their minds about the efficacy of our suggestions. There will have to be either a compendium Bill that includes child support, or more primary legislation. If the Minister included a provision in this Bill, she could bring it in either by commencement order or by regulation. In this case, we would accept a regulation.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I did not say that we would definitely not put something in the Bill, nor did I say that the proposals definitely could go in the Bill. We must consider their practicality and whether they are compatible with our old friend, the European convention on human rights. That is what I undertook to do. With the support of the Opposition we may, if we can complete the process in time, be able to include something in the Bill, but I make no promises. Their indication that they would look favourably on, for example, commencement orders has been noted and I thank them for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Even after that slight attempt to rain on my parade, I am still basking in what has just happened, and I thank the Minister for that. I repeat that we are willing to help in easing the process, therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 92, in page 13, line 39, leave out from 'he' to end of line 39 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'would suffer exceptional hardship in the event that he was disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 127, in page 13, line 39, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'() whether he needs a driving licence to maintain contact with his child or children:'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am on a roll now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes:</B> Forget it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> What a hurtful remark from the Government Whip.
<P>
We anticipate the arguments that we will hear about whether a driving licence should be taken away--never mind the fact that on Second Reading many Labour Back-Benchers fell about with laughter over this and went out of their way to say how ridiculous it was. Nevertheless, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough suspected all along, it turns out that it is all the Tories' fault, because we did it first.
<P>
I have not had a chance to check on this, but I recall that although it is possible to take away a driving licence from a person committing a non-driving offence, to the best of my knowledge and belief--perhaps the Minister will correct me--the motor vehicle has to be used in connection with the crime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Then take the car away.
<P>
<B> Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Member for Hendon suggests that we take the car away. It is just marvellous to have these senior lawyers around to contribute. I suppose that there could be a crude joke here about the moment of conception, but I know that my Auntie Marjorie will be reading the report of our proceedings, so I shall not go into that.

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> On that point--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Certainly not. I will not give way to my hon. Friend on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> On the previous point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend had better watch his language.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The hon. Member for Hendon said from a sedentary position, "Take the car away". Taking the car away and selling it to pay for the maintenance payments due may be a useful idea, but it is very different from taking away the driving licence.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am not entirely averse to that. In drafting the amendments to this clause we considered a much longer list of measures, including confiscating mobile phones or cars. I have been struck by the experience of the CSA, especially in the courts. The person involved has been made to turn out his pockets, and pretty soon a fine is found.
<P>
All hon. Members will have received correspondence from the RAC Foundation for Motoring Ltd, which, as a motoring organisation, is worried. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It has always been the case that disqualifying a motorist from driving has been a penalty for a motoring offence, such as dangerous or bad driving. Such a penalty is directly related to the offence, and is therefore perfectly justifiable."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that we are on common ground on that point throughout the Committee. The RAC Foundation has expressed anxiety that if the Government provide for such a penalty in the Bill, it could become standard to remove a licence for a non-driving offence, and it suggests that the proposal should not be taken any further. It is important that a person's ability to drive should relate to his driving condition--to the sort of driver he is and how safe he is as a driver.
<P>
Let us suppose that the person involved does not have a driving licence. Will the penalty apply for a period, so that such people cannot apply for a provisional licence? The penalty is intended merely as an alternative to prison, and that may be why it provoked laughter. It may not be such a good idea to publish it in the Bill. It does not have the advantages of the previous amendment, which included a raft of possibilities. We may be prepared to consider whether confiscating driving licences should be one of the options available, although we would take some persuading.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon referred to the sensible provision that allows magistrates to decide whether a driving licence is necessary for the person involved to fulfil employment obligations. However, a person's ability to commute to and from a place of employment has a direct effect on his ability to pay maintenance. Let us suppose that facing the magistrate is someone who lives a short bus ride or walk from his chosen employment, in which case it might be perfectly safe to confiscate his driving licence, at that point. However, let us suppose that, a few days later, that person has an opportunity of better, higher status and more secure employment that offers higher remuneration--and, therefore, more maintenance for the child--but which is conditional on his being able to drive. In such circumstances, what would happen? What would be the point of the provision?
<P>
The clause does not seem to make a ha'p'orth of sense, and may create problems later. This is a probing amendment. It is intended not to be technically exact in terms of the effects on future employment but to provide an opportunity to debate the matter.
<P>
According to Mr. Jonathan Simpson, the Government and Parliamentary Affairs Manager of the RAC Foundation for Motoring Ltd, the Organisation is worried that the penalty might
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"cause people to drive whilst disqualified."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a risk. When we create laws, we must ensure that they have the respect of the British people. As we said in earlier debates, it has been seen as okay to evade the CSA and lie to it. We want the CSA to be regarded with high esteem, and we do not believe that this measure will help to create that regard.
<P>
Much of the criticism that I was going to make has been evaporated by the attitude to the previous amendment. However, we want a justification, a chance for reflection and a better understanding as to where the Government come from in relation to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I want to speak to amendment No. 127, which would add a phrase to the clause. Its intention is to help ensure that both parents are engaged in financial and emotional support of the child, which is in the spirit of what the Government are attempting to achieve.
<P>
I do not think that I can employ the charm and wit used by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar to secure the semi-acceptance of the previous amendment, but I want to draw the Minister's attention to the amendment. Its purpose is to ensure that, before a decision is taken to disqualify the non-resident parent from driving, it is fully considered that the removal of a driving licence might prevent him or her from sustaining contact with a child. We can all imagine circumstances in rural areas in which the non-resident parent would have no means to see his child without access to a car, due to life style and the nature of public transport. I am sure that the Prime Minister, who is going to Cornwall tomorrow to seek support from the countryside and rural areas, would, in order to secure that support, recognise the fact that there is no public transport in many remote rural areas. I appreciate and support the Government's ambition to improve public transport, but such transport is not there and is not likely to be there exept at great expense to the Exchequer.
<P>
Caveats would need to be in place, because it would be inappropriate to employ the measure in circumstances in which the non-resident parent had no contact with or interest in the child before the measure was brought in. I seek a response from the Minister similar to that given to the previous amendment. If she does respond in that way, I assure her that I will not jump to my feet to make further long speeches on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I do not want to repeat the arguments that I made on the previous amendment about gearing the provisions to ensure that the child does not lose out but indeed, benefits from the arrangements.
<P>
I want to raise a legal point. I do so with some trepidation because I am not a lawyer, so I am sure that I shall be shot down and severely embarrassed. If I understand the clause correctly, the disqualification would be handed out by the magistrates court without it having gone into the case. It seems that the CSA would have determined that a disqualification should result, but that, as it would have failed to make it happen, it would be up to the court to mete out the punishment. I may have made a stupid point, but perhaps the Under-Secretary can deal with it.
<P>
What is the connection between failing to maintain one's child and having a driving licence--or not having a driving licence? As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, why not confiscate the CD player, the person's best suit or the house? Why did the Government decide on the driving licence? They said that the previous Government came to that conclusion, but we now have a Labour Government--for better or for worse--and I wonder why they consider a driving licence to be relevant.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I regret that I cannot continue to spread the warrn glow that engulfed members of the Committee earlier. Opposition Members have made contributions as though an innocent, non-resident parent, who may have got into a tiny bit of arrears, but who has been co-operating, will suddenly be descended on from a great height by the vicious CSA and have his driving licence removed. The driving licence punishment will come into play at the end of a process whereby someone who has responsibilities for the upkeep of a child has persistently refused to meet them and has been chased by the CSA for debt collection and all that goes with it. Such a punishment will not be used at the beginning of the process because the person has sneezed and has not put the cheque in the post or has been on holiday for a week. It will be used for persistent, wilfully non-paying, non-resident parents, not for those who have made administrative errors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I understand that such disqualification will not be the first punishment that is handed out, but that it might be used in the last resort. But what is the relevance of the driving licence?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I shall come to that matter in due course. I was just pointing out that Opposition Members were assuming that the driving licence sanction was out of all proportion and that it might be misused. I am trying to reassure the Committee that we see such a step being taken at the end of the list of options that are available, rather than at the beginning.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred to a vehicle having to be used in a crime for the current sanction under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 of taking away a driving licence for non-motoring offences to be used. We followed that precedent when putting the driving licence sanction into the Bill. It is not true that a car has to be used in a crime; it is an alternative punishment for any offence or for a fine default, and the previous Conservative Government put that power into legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Such punishment is the result of a criminal prosecution in the case of someone having been found guilty of committing a criminal act. Is the Under-Secretary equating a civil debt with a criminal act?
<P>
<B> Angela Eagle:</B> I am not equating a civil debt with a criminal act. However, the link between the removal of the driving licence as a sanction and the use of a car in speeding or related offences was broken by the previous Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Can the hon. Lady name any other jurisdiction or part of the law under which a driving licence is taken away as punishment for a civil debt?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B> Angela Eagle:</B> No, there is not one. However, we are discussing one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Is it a brand new thing, then?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is an extension of a sanction put into law by the previous Government. Such a sanction is not unknown in other jurisdictions in relation to child support debt. Indeed, in the United States, for example, it has been demonstrated to be most effective in the collection of such debt. The hon. Gentleman must decide whether he wants to be serious about dealing with the few recalcitrant non-payers who, as the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) said, will not cough up. We are getting serious by including the sanction in the Bill, with the proper protection afforded by the courts.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 92 and 127 relate to the power to introduce a civil penalty, which will enable magistrates to make an order disqualifying a non-resident parent from holding or obtaining a driving licence. That answers the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who asked about those who do not hold driving licences. Such people will be prevented from applying for a provisional licence for a period.
<P>
Our priority is to get maintenance flowing. As I said, seeking the confiscation of driving licences will be used only in circumstances in which that is likely to be the most effective method of enforcing payment after an individual has demonstrated an obvious, sustained pattern of behaviour in seeking to evade payment and responsibility for his children.
<P>
The courts will take all circumstances into consideration when deciding which penalty is appropriate. In doing so, they should rightly inquire into matters such as the liable person's financial circumstances and whether he needs a driving licence to earn a living. That does not mean that a driving licence may never be removed from a liable person who needs it to earn a living, but is one circumstance that the court must take into account before imposing such a penalty. To that extent, it is a safeguard.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 would result in magistrates inquiring about any exceptional hardship which licence withdrawal may cause, not whether the licence is needed to earn a living. The amendment's intention is not clear. We consider that earning a living, together with an inquiry into a person's means, is a clearer, more vigorous provision. Exceptional hardship would be difficult to define and could be interpreted differently by different magistrates.
<P>
I am afraid that I must disappoint the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George)  on amendment No. 127. Hope, however, springs eternal, and he must carry on hoping. The amendment would mean that magistrates would have to inquire whether contact arrangements would be affected by the loss of the licence and consider whether the licence is needed to earn a living.
<P>
As the shared care provisions demonstrate, we want to support contact arrangements, which make it more likely that maintenance will be paid. However, the responsibility to provide financial support and arrangements for contact are entirely separate and should remain so. The sanction does not even appear as a possibility on the radar screen unless the non-resident parent has wilfully neglected to meet his financial responsibilities. It would be wrong to treat such a parent who has contact with his children differently from one who does not. Non-resident parents who are really interested in their children should start paying child maintenance and deal with shared care arrangements subsequently. However, such arrangements must not be used as an excuse for evading responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I appreciate the Under-Secretary's response. However, as a result of information gained from contact with the child, could a non-resident parent not be justifiably concerned that maintenance that he is giving the parent with care is not benefiting the child itself? So there may be a reason for such a form of protest, which may, understandably, be wilful if the non-resident parent is genuinely concerned about the care of the child.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I doubt very much whether many of those circumstances would arise. If appealable facts arose earlier in the process, the non-resident parent could make them known to the CSA in a variety of ways, short of stopping paying child maintenance. The sanction will become a possibility, with the full protection offered by the magistrate's court, only if there were a pattern of the non-resident parent wilfully refusing to pay for his child. I suspect that in the vast majority, if not all, of such cases, the real reason that a non-resident does not pay is that he does not want to do so--it is not that he is worried about his child's well-being. If he were, he would pay maintenance to the child, as a way of demonstrating his care.
<P>
Experience in other countries has shown that the prospect of losing a driving licence can be very effective in encouraging increased compliance. In general, people pay before it gets to the point of the driving licence being taken away. We feel that our proposals strike the right balance between ensuring that maintenance is paid, and recognising the individual circumstances of the non-resident parent in providing appropriate protection in such circumstances. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister was less generous than last time. In being mean to us, she was obviously compensating for the nice things that she said about the previous amendment.
<P>
Many interesting issues have emerged from our debate and I would like to comment on some of them. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said, with his now familiar forensic skills, that we are not going down a natural path, this is a new departure in civil law, for which we are grateful. As I said in the debate on the previous amendment, we might be prepared to accompany the Government some way down that path. After all, we advocate curfew orders, so we might be prepared to consider the measure--although praying in aid America was not particularly helpful. However, given that the Minister's stock is rising fast on the Opposition Benches, and on the basis of what she has been prepared to accept in other amendments, it would be churlish to do anything other than withdraw our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I appreciate the Minister's thoughtful response and understand that we cannot legislate for every exceptional circumstance. Some non-resident parents, particularly in rural areas, are genuinely concerned that they are directly supporting the child in ways other than maintenance, through direct contact with the child--by buying clothes, meals, outings and so on. I know that the Minister will say that in the vast majority of cases non-payment by the non-resident parent is a deliberate, wilful act, but there will be exceptions and the Bill should take account of them. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(6A) No such order as is mentioned in subsection (5) may be made unless the court is satisfied that the liable person will thereafter make in full all payments due from him pursuant to the maintenance calculation which applies to him.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I want particularly to speak to amendment No. 96, the importance of which will increase if amendments similar to those that have been debated are tabled later. We want the court to undertake an important investigation to ensure that non-resident parents are able to pay maintenance. As I said in the previous debate, a person's employment prospects and career progression should be considered.
<P>
The Under-Secretary suggested that the Opposition implied that licences would be applied generally and that harsh measures would be taken, but they will, of course, be used as almost the last resort. However, such matters should be considered carefully, especially as criminal sanctions will be introduced into civil matters. It is important that the courts determine whether non-resident parents can pay maintenance. Why should that important test be included in the Bill? Does not common sense suggest that that will happen? That test must be included in the Bill because of the new venture of bringing criminal sanctions into civil proceedings; it is an extra safeguard.
<P>
On balance, it is probably sensible to consider the possibility of introducing criminal matters into civil proceedings, but if we take that step, we must have an extra safeguard--a firewall to protect individuals. No doubt the Under-Secretary will say that our proposal is not necessary, but I hope that we can continue to enjoy broad agreement in Committee, where there have been few Divisions, despite our worries about the general fairness of the Bill.
<P>
[Mr. Edward Leigh in the Chair]
<P>
I take this opportunity to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Leigh. I am sure that you will preside over our proceedings most fairly and expeditiously, and then leave the Chair reasonably quickly to contribute to the debate. I know that my hon. Friends have much to say about the inclusion of criminal sanctions in civil cases and the legal safeguards that should exist.

<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The order disqualifying a non-resident parent from holding or obtaining a driving licence should be lifted or amended when the debt has been cleared in full or a specified part-payment has been made.
<P>
Although the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar did not discuss amendment No. 95 directly, I shall comment on it. It would restrict the part-payment to cases in which at least 35 per cent. of the amount due had been paid. That would remove the discretion that could be used in cases in which it might be appropriate for the order to be revised or lifted before 35 per cent. of the amount due had been paid. For example, it might be appropriate to lift the order earlier if the non-resident parent had made proper and credible arrangements to pay off the debt by instalments.
<P>
Amendment No. 96 would require magistrates to consider the non-resident parent's willingness to pay all future maintenance, including arrears, before considering whether to lift or to amend a disqualification order. That would tighten a sanction that I thought Opposition Members opposed. Their approach is odd; but there we go.
<P>
The amendment would remove the magistrate's discretion to decide whether an order should be lifted or amended, based on the circumstances of the case at the time of the application. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for the courts completely to satisfy themselves about the reliability of future payments. When disqualification has the intended effect and a non-resident parent makes a genuine effort to clear the debt, there should be a way to get his licence back. It is not right to seek to restrict the way in which the court applies its discretion in such cases or to place on courts a duty that they cannot in practice fulfil. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The clause deals with Scottish law, and it is appropriate briefly to place on record its effects. It amends section 40 of the Child Support Act 1991 in its application to Scotland. It disapplies the existing provisions on civil imprisonment, in relation to a liable person failing to pay under a liability order. In their place, it makes new and separate provisions in the 1991 Act, but only for the purposes of that legislation, with regard to civil imprisonment in Scotland.
<P>
The application for the sheriff to put a liable person in prison for failing to pay child support maintenance is the sanction of last resort, and the Secretary of State would take such a step with the greatest of reluctance and rarely, It will not be an easy matter for the Secretary of State to satisfy a sheriff, but it is appropriate for him to order civil imprisonment. The test of which the sheriff must be satisfied is high and difficult. The 1991 Act established that civil imprisonment would be available as a remedy or sanction in a child support context. The changes proposed by clause 16 are of detail rather than substance, and reflect the current position in England and Wales.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 16, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Financial penalties</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 17, line 37, leave out 'the Consolidated Fund' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'a general fund designated for the relief of hardship from arrears of maintenance suffered by parents with care.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is self-explanatory, probing and non-controversial. In view of that, I simply want to make it clear that the purpose of the amendment is to remove the provision that the penalty should go into the consolidated fund, and replace it with a provision that it should go into a fund to alleviate hardship caused by late payment of maintenance, which is surely what all Committee members would want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall be brief, as the hon. Gentleman said that the amendment was probing. We have heard that amendment No. 126 relates to the provision that enables the Child Support Agency to impose a discretionary financial penalty of up to 25 per cent. of the maintenance owed. We are determined to ensure that non-resident parents meet their responsibilities, and the new schemes will be tough on people who attempt avoidance. That is the thrust of the programme, and the new penalty shows that we are serious about it.
<P>
As with penalties for late payment of tax, the penalty will be used by the agency as a tool in negotiations. The aim will be to persuade non-resident parents to meet their responsibilities to their children in full and on time. The aim of the negotiations, which will not involve the parent with care, will be to ensure that maintenance is paid promptly, rather than to impose a penalty. The aim is to get the money to the parent with care and to the child. It is a simple administrative penalty, which recognises the additional work involved. When payments are received late, or not made at all, the money will not be kept by the agency but will be surrendered to the Treasury. The taxpayer should not have to foot the bill for the extra work that the agency has to do when maintenance is not being paid.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would take that one step further. Penalty payments would be paid into a separate fund and used to help those parents with care suffering hardship because they had not received the maintenance arrears. The idea is to get them money. The penalty is set at the right level to cover the administrative burden of chasing the late payments. It is not right for the taxpayer to bear the extra cost involved in collecting and enforcing arrears. It is not on to ask the CSA to set up another administrative procedure paid for by the taxpayer. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. I appreciate that the purpose of the penalty is to cover the administrative costs of imposing it. That is understandable. But we would choose to monitor the level and volume of penalties. Obviously we would seek to hypothecate the benefit of any excess income from the penalties to those worst affected by the late payment or non-payment of maintenance. Having said that the intention is to be probing and constructive, and to look at a new area where parents with care can be supported, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reduced benefit decisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 18, line 1, leave out from 'having' to 'under' in line 2 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'been treated as having applied for a maintenance calculation'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment improves the drafting of the Bill by removing an unnecessary reference in clause 18. Clause 18 provides a benefit penalty for parents with care on income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who, without good cause, request the agency not to recover child support. The new section 46 to the Child Support Act 1991 amends the current provisions for a reduced benefit direction which may be imposed on lone parents who seek to avoid co-operating with the Child Support Agency. It also provides for benefit to be reduced where a parent refuses to comply with a request to take a scientific test to determine the child's parentage or to provide information.
<P>
However, as currently drafted, Clause 18, in the new section 46(1)(c), provides that a reduced benefit decision can be made in relation to a person who makes a claim for child maintenance under section 4 of the Act, as well as a parent who is treated as making such a claim under section 6. Section 4 relates to claims from people who are not on benefit and reduced benefit decisions cannot apply to such people. The amendment removes the reference to section 4 cases, so that section 46 will apply only to parents on income support, or income-based jobseeker's allowance, as was intended.
<P>
As such it is merely a tidying-up exercise and I ask the Committee to support it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, page 19, line 1, leave out from beginning to end of line 2.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government Amendments Nos. 46 and 55.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The amendment is a drafting change consequential on changes being made elsewhere to the 1991 Act. As currently drafted, clause 18 introduces a new section 46(8) which refers to schedule 4C. But schedule 4C is being repealed and the reference to it therefore needs to be removed. Amendments Nos. 46 and 55 are consolidating amendments so that paragraphs (4), (5) and (6) of schedule 4C of the 1991 Act, which apply to sections 28ZA to 28ZC on reduced benefit decisions, are incorporated into the relevant section. Subsections (8), (9) and (10) consolidate the remaining paragraphs of 4C enabling its repeal. These are tidying-up amendments and do not change the existing policy. I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I want to speak only briefly on this matter. As we know, the clause is controversial. Of course it is right to take appropriate measures to secure the compliance of the parent with care--after all, non-compliance is high--but concerns remain, first, that the provisions do not do enough to protect women who have suffered domestic violence and, secondly, that they would push single parents into unacceptable poverty.
<P>
The Select Committee proposed that the reduced benefit penalty be suspended. Recommendation 26 on page vii of the report states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the application of the reduced benefit penalty should be suspended during the phasing-in period to assess whether the incentives alone are successful in achieving higher compliance".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The question is how adequate the protection methods will be, particularly those in subsection (3). The parent with care often sees the CSA representative as having to hit a target and therefore simply wanting to get money off the non-resident partner. If, as we understand is the case from the debate on clause 13, CSA staff are to be trained in assertiveness, CSA representatives will be seen as the CSA police. Parents with care would not necessarily be advised on their right to claim good cause for not providing the information necessary to track down the non-resident parent. Many women have provided information in the past, unaware of their rights and in the naðve hope that they would not be threatened or attacked, but they have then suffered the consequences. That is a matter of significant concern.
<P>
There are already concerns that the system in general does not adequately protect vulnerable and abused women. I am pursuing with the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Home Office and the Department of Health a case in my constituency where an abusing man attacked and murdered his ex-wife. Through inadequacies in the court system, family law and the Children Act 1989, he was able to obtain sufficient information to track her down and ultimately to murder her. The system was unable properly to protect her. All three Departments have a role. The Children Act is the responsibility of the Department of Health; in family law there are issues around the use of search-and-find orders, which have been abused to obtain sufficient information to track down the whereabouts of a previously abused wife or partner; and then there is court procedure itself.
<P>
We must seriously consider whether it is wise to add another mechanism through the CSA which would put further pressure on a previously abused wife or partner. One hundred responsible organisations, including Penzance Women's Aid in my constituency, supported the motion "Protecting Mothers and Children from Violence". Penzance Women's Aid has deep knowledge of the case that I referred to earlier.
<P>
We should revisit the matter on Report and consider the consequences for women and children. What is the impact of putting them deeper into poverty? The Government should re-examine the Select Committee's recommendation and permit a phase-in period to discover whether benefit disregard is an incentive in cases in which the parent with care is able to provide appropriate information. Will the Under-Secretary acknowledge the serious concerns of many organisations?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, especially in relation to women fleeing violent partners. For obvious reasons, I cannot comment on the horrific case that he mentioned. However, if he is worried about how the CSA handled that case, he should let me know. I am willing to examine what happened in any particular case, especially one as horrific as that, to see if lessons may be learned from the CSA's action.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should acknowledge that the CSA has made big improvements in many aspects of its service, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar did earlier. Its cash compliance has gone up, as has its case compliance. Customer complaints have decreased. There are now 600 staff handling cases face-to-face instead of 80. They gather information discreetly and inform people who come into contact with the CSA of all available options and the consequences of certain courses of action. I trust that that reassures the hon. Gentleman in relation to good cause.
<P>
In 1996, only 1 per cent. of clients got through on the telephone the first time that they tried. That has increased to 76 per cent. Another big improvement was mentioned in our debate on good cause in clause 3: in 1996, 70 per cent. of parents with care on benefit tried to claim good cause or did not contact the agency. As a result of the Benefits Agency working more closely with the CSA on an income support claim, that high percentage has been reduced to 15 per cent. Awareness of good cause and the circumstances in which it can be claimed will increase.
<P>
Clause 18 deals with those who, without good cause, ask the Secretary of State to act to recover child support; fail to provide relevant information; or refuse scientific tests, such as a DNA test. Clearly, as we discussed in relation to earlier clauses, we hope that we have struck the right balance for those who have good cause, so that they know that they can make a decision if they have a violent partner and that that they will be protected from any horrendous consequences of applying for child support.
<P>
The shift from opting in to opting out of child support will enable good cause issues to be identified, and the CSA will deal with them sympathetically. I am happy to listen to the comments of the hon. Member for St. Ives on safeguards. However, I am certain that the Bill contains a good balance of them.
<P>
The clause deals with those who do not have good cause and yet persist in not making an application for child support. We are trying to strike a balance between the responsibility of non-resident parents to look after and provide for their children and, if they are on benefit, their responsibility to apply for child support. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as prospects of violence, child support applications should not be an optional extra. We do not think that parents with care should be able to choose whether the taxpayer or the father looks after the child.
<P>
When a parent with care who makes a claim for benefit decides to opt out of pursuing child support, she will need to provide her reasons within a specified time and, if those reasons are acceptable, no further action will be taken. If not, at the end of a specified period, the Secretary of State will consider imposing a benefit penalty. That penalty will remain at its present level: 40 per cent. of the income support adult personal allowance. There will be a right of appeal to an independent tribunal against a reduced benefit decision, as set out in clause 10. The reduced benefit penalty will also apply where there is failure to provide information or a refusal to take a DNA test. We believe that the reformed scheme will ensure that more children benefit from regular payments of maintenance. By including tough new measures, we will deter parents from seeking to prevent the recovery of child maintenance.
<P>
We do not believe that the new changes will have any effect on vulnerable parents with a good reason for opting out. We believe that we have got that balance right and if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the parent with care or any child living with her would suffer harm or undue distress as a result of pursuing child support, no penalty will be imposed. With those assurances, I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I support the Minister. I have had a limited number of such cases in my constituency surgery over the past few years, all of which were difficult. One thing that has always struck me is that the process of considering whether there is a reasonable excuse is fairly exhaustive. I have experience of at least two cases involving fraud where the excuse offered was not reasonable. We have to remember what hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have frequently said: the legislation is about the support of children and one cannot opt out of that, unless there is an adequate reason why the taxpayer should bear that burden. People have occasionally been content to accept both benefit and a little extra money. It is important to ensure that the CSA is respected. I have never come across a case in which the CSA has gone too far. It has always allowed a decent margin in ensuring that someone vulnerable, with a genuine fear of violence to herself or to the child, is not faced with the dilemma of having to claim for maintenance. I therefore agree totally with the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I am grateful to the Minister; much of what she said was reassuring and I accept the substance of her comments. I shall not press the matter to a vote, but I flag it up because it is a matter of concern. As the Minister rightly said, it is a question of getting the correct balance. We cannot debate the issue too much--although I do not intend to continue to do so here.
<P>
The tragic and horrific case that I mentioned earlier highlighted the failures in the system. I referred to failures in three systems other than the CSA--failures that are the result of inadequate legislation which have allowed a violent former husband to obtain the information needed to track down his former wife and murder her. We must not add a fourth possibility. Before we finally agree to the Bill, we should return to the issue with any evidence that we can gather as responsible Members and ensure that we strike the right balance.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 30.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> This amendment deals with voluntary payments. Hon. Members will realise that voluntary payments are not currently provided for in legislation. The CSA follows its own guidelines on voluntary payments and offsetting arrears against maintenance. We want to ensure that maintenance flows and to get non-resident parents into the habit of paying. That is why, under clause 19, we intend to introduce regulations that will allow payments made before maintenance has been calculated to be offset against any initial arrears. I could regale the Committee with many examples from the early days, as could other members of the Committee. The amendments simply clarify the wording of the clause.

<P>
This amendment will clarify our intention that current maintenance, as well as arrears, may be deducted from benefits. I should be happy to go into further detail, but that is the basic thrust of the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I should like to tell the Committee about the adjustments that we propose to make in support of the changes that will be made under clause 20, in response to inquiries from my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. We propose to change the way in which maintenance is deducted from income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance. We shall introduce regulations to ensure that children come first.
<P>
Currently, any deduction made is considered against a priority order with a range of exemptions. The maximum amount that can be deducted from those benefits in respect of a debt for housing costs, fuel, water or council tax, commitments to pay fines and child support, or a debt to the Department of Social Security caused by the overpayment of a social fund loan is set at £7.80. That is three times 5 per cent. of the adult personal allowance.
<P>
Child support maintenance deductions have a lower priority than many other deductions, which means that they are sometimes squeezed out. It is right that the needs of children take priority over debts and that their needs should be considered first. Therefore, we propose to amend regulations to extend the range of circumstances in which deductions may be made and to remove the minimum payment of child support maintenance from the priority order of deductions. That will ensure that children always come first. Parents on benefits should arrange their financial affairs in the light of their responsibilities to the children for whom they are liable to pay child support, as those with low earnings must do. Of course, non-resident parents who receive income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance, and who have debts for housing costs, utilities, and so on, would continue to be offered the protection of the direct payment scheme, and the overall limit on the deductions would not be changed. We appreciate that, in a few exceptional cases, that will mean that a non-resident parent could have a flat rate of £5 deducted, plus the maximum amount under the direct payment scheme, but we firmly believe that all parents have a responsibility towards their children.
<P>
Clause 20 substitutes new section 43, and in the new scheme non-resident parents on most benefits and war pensions will usually be liable to pay the flat rate of maintenance, which will usually be £5 a week. The clause increases the range of benefits in relation to which regulations can provide for maintenance to be deducted. We believe that all parents have a responsibility towards their children, whatever their income. Non-resident parents who pay maintenance improve their children's chances in life. Deducting maintenance from benefit recognises that responsibility, while taking account of the particular circumstances of people on benefit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Amendments Nos. 33 and 53 simply streamline the child support decision-making process. They remove a separate and unnecessary category of child support decisions. Clause 21 amends section 44 of the 1991 Act and extends child support jurisdiction to include non-resident parents who are not habitually resident in the UK, but who are nevertheless employed by a UK-based employer. Non-resident parents who live and work abroad for a UK employer will pay child support for their children who live in the UK. I can go into further detail if necessary, but with that brief explanation, I urge the Committee to accept the amendments.

<P>
The amendment provides for regulations to ensure that the non-resident parent is left with a proportion of his earnings when a deduction from earnings order for maintenance is in force. A deduction from earnings order requires an employer to recover child support directly from a non-resident parent's earnings. The employer may also have to operate attachment of earnings orders set by a court. Each order has two parts. The first is the amount to be deducted in a given period; the second is a protected earnings rate, which ensures that the non-resident parent is left with a particular level of earnings after deduction of the amount due under the order or orders. The protected earnings rate for deduction from earnings orders is currently the same as that of exempt income in the child maintenance formula. Under the new scheme, there will be no exempt income. The amendment provides for the new protected earnings level to be set at a percentage of earnings, and I urge the Committee to accept it.

<P>

For example, nil liability can apply when a non-resident parent has a net weekly income of below £5 or is a student. We debated those issues earlier.

<P>
The amendment inserts into the clause examples of what may be provided through regulations on transitional and phasing arrangements. One reason why the current scheme failed was that it was over ambitious and was introduced too quickly. We do not want to repeat past mistakes and take on too much, too soon. Existing cases will therefore be transferred to the new scheme only after it has been introduced for new cases and is seen to be operating properly. I therefore ask the Committee to accept the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Given the announcement made yesterday on computer system problems encountered in processing new calculations, it would be helpful for the Minister to tell us what the amendment will mean in practice.
<P>
I accept that it is difficult to introduce a system that applies to everyone immediately and, to use that well-worn phrase, that it will be administratively convenient to take on new cases and gradually to phase them in to the new system. However, despite making considerable progress in the past few weeks, the Committee still has not tackled the problem of having two systems running in parallel. In our early sittings, it was heresy to say it, but the consequence is that Members will regularly face at constituency surgeries the problems that the proposal creates. Some people will say, "Look, why am I being pursued for sums which you said in Committee that I should not pay?" Others will say, "I have been diligently making regular payments for months and years, but the chap who left your surgery a few moments ago has paid nothing. He has walked away scot-free." What are Members supposed to say in such circumstances?
<P>
It is not unreasonable to expect the Minister to say how the systems will work together. It would be unwise to repeat the mistake made in the original measure, when the CSA pursued people who already paid small amounts. Later in our proceedings we might discuss targeting those who pay nothing, not because of their income but because they have deliberately wandered away. Those people must be our priority.
<P>
Members of Parliament know from their constituency experience that some people make all kinds of excuses. I remember a man dragging his daughter into my surgery, telling me that she was about to have a nervous breakdown and saying that he could not possibly cope. The poor child sat there, struck dumb, and I felt enormous sympathy for her. Her father said that they had lost everything. Two days later, I was driving through my constituency and I saw him getting into an exciting-looking sports car, looking extremely happy and far from depressed. The system should sort out that man, who wasted my time and abused the trust that exists between father and daughter by trying to pull the wool over the eyes of a sympathetic Member of Parliament. Folk who go out of their way to avoid paying should be targeted.
<P>
I want the Minister to say how the two schemes will operate together. We want to support the Government but they are not giving us the information that we need. It is no good saying, "Well, we're not going to make the mistakes that were made in the past." I am pleased about that, but I am concerned about future mistakes. If we had had an earlier warning of the proposal, we might have been able to avoid some of the CSA's past problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Gentleman's question requires a response--[Interruption.]--or perhaps not. I cannot give him the details that he asks for because that would re-open earlier debates. I know that it sounds like a mantra, but it is. We shall not repeat the mistakes of the past.
<P>
We have no problems with a computer system because we have not ordered one. We continue to get snippets from the house journal of the Tory party about computer problems; there are no problems with the computer. As we announced the other day, we are planning to fix the date by which the system will be up and running, and able to accept new cases. The date is April 2002.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Would it be fair to say that the Department of Social Security could avoid having a problem with a new computer only by not ordering one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Past problems have partly been due to the way in which computers have been ordered. We are working differently, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary explained in considerable detail.
<P>
The amendment would not alter the clause. I am happy to give further details by sticking to my long speaking note because we are making such good progress. We seek to insert examples of what might be provided through regulations with regard to transitional and phasing arrangements.
<P>
We are being tempted to be precise about dates, but we cannot do that. We shall not build up public expectations only to have them smashed. We must be careful about the way in which the system is phased in and the way in which we transfer cases from scheme 1 to scheme 2.

I shall be brief. The new clause will further streamline the decision-making process. It will allow a child support tribunal decision to be set aside by a tribunal chairman and redetermined by a new tribunal, when the chairman considers the original decision to be wrong in law. A commissioner need not always consider an appeal from such a tribunal if all the relevant parties agree that the tribunal decision was wrong in law. The important point is the need to secure the right child support decision for the appellant with the minimum delay. The new clause will achieve that. I wish to make it absolutely clear that nobody's appeal rights will be affected.

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause relates to the introduction of pilot schemes. During the 18 long years of opposition, most of us--
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Too short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the period was too short. Most of us had no training for being Ministers apart from four days at Templeton college in 1996. My abiding memory of being put through the mill by former permanent secretaries and ex-Ministers was of the damage caused to our fabric by the introduction of legislation and new ideas across the country. The lesson that we learned was to pilot, pilot, pilot. If one can pilot a change, one should. That is what we seek to do. We want the power to establish pilot schemes and to test whether they are performing as Parliament intends. However, we need legislative authority to set up those schemes. That authority has been used in other legislation to good effect in various policy areas. In the light of that, I hope that Committee members will agree to add the clause to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am grateful for the lifting of the veil on new Labour thinking. Pilot schemes have another advantage. For a very small amount of money, one can do a prodigious amount of spinning, while pretending to be achieving a great deal. The problem is that, like the famous cartoon about dropping the pilot, the time comes when the good folk say, "What's happened? What's the difference?" We should accept the need for pilot schemes, but we should also accept that serious problems need to be addressed.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'In the Child Support Act 1991 there shall be inserted the following section--
<P>
"43A. In exercising his powers under sections 29 to 43 of this Act the Secretary of State shall ensure that such powers are exercised with a view to securing the collection and enforcement of child support maintenance from those non-resident parents who have failed to pay any amount of child support maintenance and that this duty is accorded priority over the collection and enforcement of child support maintenance from those non-resident parents who have made some payments of child support maintenance.".'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I shall be brief. This is an opportunity to address the points that I made the last time I spoke. We must ensure that, when the process is phased in, priority is given to those who have paid nothing. The Government have made great play of those who have paid nothing, and, in the "hands across the Committee" spirit that we experienced earlier, I am trying to tempt the Under-Secretary to make the same concession. She may like to think about that and perhaps bring the matter back, or even agree with us.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The new clause seeks to influence the way in which the Child Support Agency will organise its resources on collection and enforcement activities. It seeks to require the agency to prioritise action against those non-resident parents who have made no child support maintenance payments--currently 30 per cent. of the case load--rather than the 23 per cent. who are partially compliant.
<P>
It is well known that the child maintenance formula is so complex that the agency has to devote 90 per cent. of its resources to collecting information and making assessments--only 10 per cent. is left for enforcing maintenance. In the new scheme, we will be tough on those who try to avoid their responsibilities. There will be greater emphasis on compliance and enforcement, including more efficient use of deduction from earnings orders. Our priority, in all cases, will be to get maintenance flowing quickly and regularly.
<P>
The new clause sends out the wrong message to non-resident parents. In effect, it says, "If you pay something, no matter how little, we will leave you alone." The agency will be able to spend more time concentrating on non-compliance, whether partial or total, once the changes to the system have made it more efficient in the calculation and enforcement of maintenance payments. All non-resident parents who owe child support maintenance will be asked to pay. If they do not, enforcement action will continue to be taken to make them pay.
<P>
The new clause is unnecessary. All non-resident parents who do not meet their responsibilities in full can expect to have enforcement action taken against them. We have no intention of introducing a legislative priority for collection and enforcement activities within the day-to-day running of the agency. I ask the Committee to reject the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Under-Secretary was careful to give no indication of what she intends to do. I think that she should have done so. Will the Government give priority to tackling the problem of people who have paid nothing? Will it be done on an alphabetical basis? The hon. Lady said that these are the people that she is after, and she has our full support in that crusade. She said that she did not want to put the new clause into the Bill. Her stock is very high on this side of the Committee, and if she says that she intends to sort the problem out, we shall be happy. If she will give us some indication of how she intends to approach this difficult task, we may well be satisfied.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We have great ambitions in this respect, which I hope are shared by all members of the Committee.
<P>
One of the aims of the Bill is to create a system that will allow quick, simple assessments so that maintenance can be put into effect quickly, and then regularised. That will give the CSA and its staff the time to concentrate on chasing those who have managed successfully to evade their responsibilities through non-compliance or partial compliance. The thrust of the changes that we have discussed today focuses on that aspect.
<P>
I am optimistic that, as a result of the changes, we shall be able to organise the CSA in such a way as to chase all non-compliant non-resident parents. That will be the CSA's task. It would not be helpful to prioritise who should be chased first, either in the Bill or in discussions, as that could be of help to those hoping to adopt a strategic approach to evading their responsibilities. When we have a more effective and efficient system, we will be chasing all non-resident parents who seek to evade their responsibilities. There will be no hiding place for them. Their liabilities and responsibilities will be much clearer, and it will be possible to work them out in 
advance by looking at a table. We expect to improve compliance considerably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I appreciate that the Under-Secretary has gone a little further. I put this point to her, although I do not require a response at this stage--no doubt we shall return to it on another occasion. I understand the worries about people taking a strategic view, and saying, "I'll pay a few bob and that'll get them off my back." That is not what this is about. It is about saying that there will be no hiding place: I approve of that phrase. There is a dividing line between a person who makes a strategic decision to try to get the CSA off his back and a person gets into a regular habit of making a contribution. The Under-Secretary has made frequent reference to such people over the past couple of weeks. She can do no wrong, as far as I am concerned--not only today, but well into the weekend, and perhaps a little beyond. I am a generous person.
