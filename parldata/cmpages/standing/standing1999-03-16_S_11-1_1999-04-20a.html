<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/042/1999042.htm">Immigration and Asylum Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 169, in page 9, line 32, leave out "must" and insert "may".--[Mr. Clappison.].
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock </B>(Wyre Forest): Before I continue my intervention, Mrs. Roe, I welcome you to the Committee. I was slightly confused by the approach of the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) because it remained unclear whether in citing the Commission for Racial Equality he was agreeing that the section 8 provision that the Conservative Government left to the world had caused discriminatory behaviour by employers. If he agrees with the CRE that it has, I trust that he will have a better answer to the question what he would do than simply "not this". I look forward to hearing his policy for dealing with the discriminatory behaviour of employers caused by the provision passed by his Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I join the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Lock) in welcoming you to the Chair, Mrs. Roe. The only thing that is unclear is why the Government have not repealed section 8 having promised that they would do so because they said it would cause racial discrimination. When in Opposition they did not say that they would simply introduce a code of practice to be tacked on to section 8, they said that they would repeal it. They have done nothing of the sort.
<P>
This morning I quoted a letter written in Opposition by one of the Minister's then Front Bench Colleagues to The Daily Telegraph about the burdens that this would cause for small businesses and promising that in office Labour would not operate section 8. Since then I have acquired a press release put out by the Home Secretary when he was shadowing that post. It is a rather ferocious press release entitled "News from Labour" which attacked the Asylum and Immigration Bill. It starts:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No Bill in this Parliament has aroused such widespread and justified opposition as the Asylum and Immigration Bill."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
One of the main reasons it gives in support of that proposition is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The employment checks have been opposed by most loyer organisations--as well as the churches and the trade unions--and are unlikely to catch those seriously intent on fraud. But they will harm race relations, and the employment prospects of many with a black or brown skin or a foreign-sounding surname. We shall not operate these checks."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
It could not be clearer than that. The CRE, looking from its point of view and that of those who may have listened to what Labour told them when in opposition, says that what Labour wants to do is simply not adequate. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest shakes his head. Has he read the submission from the CRE? I do not think that he has. I suggest that he does so because he will see that the Government's course is causing unhappiness among many of those who have been led to believe that they would take a different course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam):</B> I have the following statement from the CRE
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is the view of the CRE that the code proposed in clause 13 will not be effective in preventing discriminatory recruitment practices."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 One cannot be clearer than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The CRE has been consistent on this, whatever view one takes. We take our view and we are not in any way retreating from anything that we said in 1996 when the Asylum and Immigration Bill was before the House. There is no justification for the false indignation of the Minister or for the course that the Government are taking. This looks like a way to get out of a promise. That is all that one can say about it. I cannot for the life of me see why the Government are taking this course. If they really believed all along that section 8 caused discrimination there would be nothing to stop them repealing it. What is the obstacle to repealing section 8? Or is the truth that the Labour party never believed any of it and merely thought that to put out ferocious-sounding press release with no intention of repealing it was a good way to drum up a bit of support? I do not think that the Government's position of entirely tenable. However, having made my point, in the interests of progress I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<H4><center>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 170, in page 10, line 9, after "employers", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"including those representative of small and medium sized enterprises".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 173, in page 10, line 33, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"save where one of the parties to the proceedings employs fewer than 100 employees".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B> Mr. Clappison:</B> I made my case for the amendments earlier. The Labour party, when in Opposition, voiced its concern that section 8 of the Immigration and Asylum Bill would put a burden on businesses. Yet, instead of repealing that burden, they are heaping on more burdens by introducing a code of practice that businesses will be required to follow or risk having their failure to do so taken into account in evidence in any proceedings against them. One more regulation being foisted on business by the Government for which there is no justification.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I join in welcoming you, Mrs. Roe, to the chairmanship of the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) said that we are foisting one more regulation on business. I remind him that section 8 was one more regulation foisted on business by the Conservatives. The hon. 
Gentleman complains, but perhaps he ought to look to himself and remember "Those in glasshouses . . ." and other phrases about such cavalier disregard for the facts as he has displayed.
<P>
Amendment No. 170 will ensure that consultation is broad. We intend to consult properly. On amendment No. 173, subsection (10) of new section 8A when read with subsection (9), simply provides for a code of practice to be admissible in evidence in an employment tribunal, or, in Northern Ireland, an industrial tribunal. We cannot accept the amendment because it would remove from the scope of sanctions provided by the clause any employer with a work force of fewer than 100 employees. That would send a very mixed signal to employers to the effect that a small employer would be less liable to take proper care and responsibility for observing non-discriminatory practices. The Conservatives effectively appear to be giving a green light to small and medium employers to discriminate against ethnic minorities. There can be no other reading of their amendment. I suspect that they would not admit it, but that would be its effect. The Conservative did not try to exclude small businesses from legislation when in Government. Why have they now decided to exclude them from having to ensure that they do not discriminate against ethnic minorities? There is hypocrisy in both their attempt to pander to small businesses, although they were not prepared to deliver to them when in Government, and their claim to want an end to discrimination while at the same time trying to exclude responsibility for preventing discrimination by employers with fewer than 100 employees. We want strong anti-discriminatory provisions in the code of practice. I shall explain in due course why we felt it necessary to retain section 8, but the amendment is not about that. It is an attempt by the Conservative party to undermine the anti-racist provisions of the Bill. I reject that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> But was it not the Labour opposition which complained that section 8 was a burden on businesses? I remind the Minister of what his now ministerial colleague--then shadow spokeswoman--the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), wrote in The Daily Telegraph about the Asylum and Immigration Bill 1996 in December that year. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Yet once again it is British small firms - who don't have extensive personnel and legal departments - who will be hardest hit."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
They were the firms that the Labour party complained would be hardest hit by section 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Does he agree or disagree with that? His comments have not made that clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have made our position absolutely clear throughout. The Government are in a quandary because their position has changed totally. I am not saying that we would repeal section 8 and would not make any such promises. The Government have a problem because they and the present Home Secretary explicitly promised when they were in opposition that they would not operate section 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he would continue to operate section 8, but is not prepared to have strong antidiscriminatory clauses in the Bill to ensure that businesses apply it in a way that does not discriminate against ethnic minorities? Is that the Tory party's position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is getting a little agitated. As we can see from the smile on his face, he knows that he is digging himself into an even bigger hole. He has not even listened to the advice that he was given by the very organisation that he consulted--the Commission for Racial Equality. It has told him that the code of practice will not have the effect that the Government claim and that it will not be successful in preventing racial discrimination.
<P>
The Government are embarking on a policy that they were advised against by the Commission for Racial Equality. The Minister must ask himself whether the CRE has got it all wrong. The answer is no, and the Government have let down those whom it led to believe that section 8 would be repealed. Instead, they are heaping extra regulations on the very small businesses that they were prepared to preach about when they were in opposition.
<P>
The Government have not yet consulted small businesses, and no consultation took place with business before the policy was unveiled in July 1998. By their own admission, up until the end of March, the Government had not bothered to consult businesses even though they had consulted other groups. Will the Minister tell us whether any consultation has taken place since 29 March? When will such consultation take place?
<P>
Unfortunately, we do not have the code of practice in front of us for debate; it would be better if we did. It would also be better to debate it in the light of business being consulted. We would then be able to raise its concerns. We have been deprived of that opportunity and the Government are forcing the measure through. They are heaping more regulations on to business.
<P>
The Government are taking a thoroughly bad course. Once again, they are immune to reason and will not accept any amendments. Although we feel strongly about the burden that is being cast upon business, we hope that the Minister will listen to what we have said about consultation. We will continue to ask questions about consultation with businesses, but, in order to make progress, I shall not press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 10, leave out lines 20 to 25 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(8) No order is to be made under subsection 7 above unless the draft code has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Once again, I may have anticipated the amendment in my earlier contribution. The Government have said that they will introduce a code of practice but, as I have just said, they have not consulted anyone about that. They have not let the Committee have sight of it, so the very least that they could do would be to adopt the positive resolution procedure. That would mean that, at some point in the future, Parliament might have an opportunity to debate the code of practice.
<P>
The provision will be subject to the negative resolution procedure. Therefore, anyone who is concerned about these issues might not have an opportunity to express a view. The Commission for Racial Equality, the people who have been disappointed and small businesses, whom the Government were so assiduous in courting before the election and on whom they have turned their back, will not have the chance to comment. The code of practice will merely be cooked up by the Government.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will at least make a concession on this amendment and that I am pressing on an open door.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman tried to tell us that he is concerned about the burdens on business yet it was his Government who enacted section 8. I noted that, throughout his comments, he did not express concern about discrimination against ethnic minorities. I wish he had, because that would have been in keeping with the undertaking to engage in proper discussion of the Bill that the leader of the Conservative party signed. I suspect that many Conservative Back Benchers, like many Labour Members, are concerned to ensure that employers do not discriminate against ethnic minorities when they make decisions about employment practice.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman says that it is an important issue and that his party is serious about it. We shall see how serious it is, because it will have an opportunity to pray against a negative resolution in due course if it considers that appropriate.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We do not believe that there is a strong case for adopting the affirmative procedure in relation to the code. Guidance on the operation of section 8 has previously been issued and will form the basis of a statutory code. The race relations legislation is effective and we are reviewing it to make sure that it remains effective now that 20 years have elapsed since it was initially passed, but we want to ensure that our legislation on these issues is tough.
<P>
We do not, therefore, consider it necessary to change the way in which the code will be dealt with by the House. If Conservative Members wish to pray against it, they will have their opportunity. In the meantime we feel that this is the best way to deal with an established obligation on employers not to discriminate. We simply want to ensure that the message goes out to them loud and clear that we will have no truck with discriminatory practices when they apply section 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am disappointed, because even though I knew that the Minister clearly would not agree with my main arguments, I thought that he would at least give us a chance to debate the subject in the future, as there has been so much interest in it. However, it seems that, once again, we shall be deprived of that opportunity. I shall have to overcome my disappointment sufficiently to see the need for us to continue to make progress, and in that vein I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider the following: Amendment No. 160, in schedule 14, page 119, line 11, after "7", insert "section 8".
<P>
New clause 3--Repeal of section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 (restrictions on employment) shall cease to have effect.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We can now debate the substance of the issue that we have been fencing around for the last few minutes, because amendment No. 160 in my name seeks to delete clause 13 and new clause 3 seeks to place in the Bill the repeal of section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. That is the only way in which we believe that we can resolve whether there is discrimination in employment practice on immigration status grounds.
<P>
We agree with the analysis of this issue by Labour Members before the election. As I said earlier, we have been assiduous in reading through the interesting Committee proceedings on the 1996 Bill, when Labour Members spent four sittings detailing their criticisms of clause 8, as it was then. I noted that the Minister was careful not to leave hostages to fortune. Perhaps one criterion for being selected as a Home Office Minister to deal with this subject was that he was not a member of that Standing Committee. Anyone who had been on the Labour Front Bench in that Committee who now tried to defend the indefensible--the total reneging on the Labour party's commitment to repeal section 8--would be far too easy a target.
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow) The hon. Gentleman has clarified exactly why I am not a Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am sure that that is the only reason. Except for that, the hon. Gentleman had all the necessary qualities.
<P>
I could spend many happy hours quoting from the proceedings on the 1996 Bill, but I am not sure that that would take us much further. However, one comment that leapt from the page was from the hon. member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), who said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I rise to oppose this obnoxious and dangerous clause. It is obnoxious because it seeks to confer legitimacy on the age-old racist cry 'They are coming for our jobs."--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 1
 February 1996; c.498.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That was a clear statement of why section 8 was offensive. Far more detail was then added about fears of the implications of that.
<P>
Another key point raised at that time was whether sufficient evidence had been taken to establish whether section 8 would be a good or bad provision. The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) then said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I remind you, Sir Michael, that we requested a Special Standing Committee so that we could receive deputations. The Government deny us that opportunity. They appear to want to have their cake and eat it."--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 1 February 1996; c. 445.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I can now throw praise in the Government's direction because they did appoint a Special Standing Committee. The Home Secretary, who on eight occasions during the passage of the 1996 Act called for a Special Standing Committee, did not seek to reverse his position. It is right for us to take advantage of the evidence that we have taken, which can do much to elaborate whether the fears of Labour Members at that time have been realised.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to three contributions, the first from the Immigration Law Practitioners Association. When section 8 was originally debated, ILPA and others warned of its potential for discriminatory practices. The Labour party in Opposition appeared to agree with such concerns and to support its repeal. That remains, in ILPA's view, the right course to take:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There are other offences created by the 1971 Act which are ample to deal with racketeering."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The expert lawyers who have looked into the problem see no reason whatever for the Government to have changed their original position before the election.
<P>
We have already mentioned the CRE, which is at the front line of issues of discrimination in employment practice. The CRE is clear that clause 13 will not prevent discriminatory practices and that section 8 of the 1996 Act should be repealed instead. The CRE told me that there is much evidence of employers misunderstanding section 8, which goes to the heart of the matter. The previous Government--and now the present Government--could defend section 8 on the grounds that it would catch only unlawful employers and that no discrimination would be caused to people with proper immigration status.
<P>
Governments can talk in those terms until the cows come home but the reality remains that the CRE and other organisations receive phone calls every week from employers who clearly misunderstand the law and who make decisions about jobs often on the basis of the colour of people's skin rather than their nationality. Employers are denying jobs to people who can legitimately work in this country because of their misunderstanding of section 8. That is in accordance with reams of guidance sent out by the previous Government. The core of our debate is whether the code of practice will, on the basis of available evidence, make any significant change to previous circumstances in which guidance was sent to employers but they misunderstood it.
<P>
The third Organisation with much to contribute to our debate is the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, also at the front line every week. Up and down the country our constituents go to citizens advice bureaux to ask about employment law. Its advice is straightforward:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The CAB Service believes that Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 is racially discriminatory in effect, and that it is not possible to address this effect through the current Bill's proposal for a code of practice. This view is based on the discrimination experienced by CAB clients since the introduction of employer immigration checks; and more generally on CAB evidence that people with little or no knowledge of immigration regulations cannot be expected to make accurate assesssments of immigration status. The CAB Service therefore believes that section 8 should be repealed."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
NACAB goes on to provide specific examples of people coming through CAB doors who have experienced problems. In Hertfordshire, the CAB reported
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a black client who was well educated and articulate, and had been trying to sign on for work with employment agencies. He was entitled to work, but the agencies informed him that they were required to check with the Home Office."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The briefing continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A CAB in north London reported a Somali asylum seeker who had been granted exceptional leave to remain in the UK, with permission to work. She had obtained work in a hotel, but when her exceptional leave came up for renewal, her papers were misplaced or delayed by the Home Office"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
an exceptional case, of course, of which there could be very few other examples!
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Her manager suspended her without pay, stating that he was afraid to employ an illegal immigrant. The client went to the Home Office, who in turn telephoned her manager to say that her papers would be processed as soon as possible"--<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
that means only a few months.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Her manager nevertheless remained wary of being taken to court himself--on the basis of having read the Home Office booklet, "Employed Illegally" . The client therefore remained suspended.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Finally:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A CAB in Yorkshire reported a Chinese client who had been legally resident in the UK for 28 years. He worked as chef, and his employer had recently demanded to see his passport. The client was shocked and anxious about his security of employment".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
It seems clear that his employer was demanding his passport because of fears raised by section 8. A code of practice may in fact generate a new set of problems when employers see a booklet landing on their doorsteps describing it and the fact that section 8 is still there. Employers simply chase employees about whom they have any suspicions on immigration status.
<P>
I believe that the law is unnecessary. The Immigration Act 1971 provides for the imposition of criminal charges against those employing people illegally. We all want to target those who deliberately racketeer and exploit others. It is as bad for the immigrant as it is for national well-being that such an exploitation racket takes place.
<P>
Section 25(1) of the 1971 Act lists the offence of assisting or facilitating illegal entry, which can carry a sentence of imprisonment on conviction. Section 25(2) makes it an offence to harbour an illegal immigrant, an over-stayer or people in breach of their conditions of leave. We can prosecute under the 1971 Act if the Government are willing to do so. If they believe that the Act is not up to it, they should revise it in a sensible way so that there can be criminal prosecutions against those involved in illegal racketeering, rather than leaving in place the blanket check of section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996.
<P>
I remind the Committee that we have recently finished debating clauses 11 and 12, which place in the Secretary of State's hands the tools for an intelligence-led approach. There was some querying. Section 8 seems an easy way in which to do the job. Rather than trying to find the racketeers, it places a blanket prohibition against all employers and one is reliant on that mechanism, rather than getting intelligence, targeting people and building the pattern of evidence that may be required under the 1971 Act. However, clauses 11 and 12 give the Secretary of State exactly the powers that he will need to gain and exchange the necessary information to successfully prosecute under the 1971 Act.
<P>
I hope that we are going to have an interesting debate. I notice some familiar faces from the Committee stage that approved section 8 of the 1996 Act. I am sure that they will have plenty to say following their experience three years on from the enactment of what was an "obnoxious and dangerous" clause.
<P>
Finally, I would like to comment on a question asked to the chief executive of the Immigration Advisory Service in the evidence-taking sessions of the Committee. We were talking about whether intent should be shown in the case of employment of immigrants. It was made clear in that gentleman's response that intent is looked for in many other areas of the law. Intent is a critical element. One of the problems with section 8 is that it removed the issue of intent and placed the onus on employers to check immigration status as anyone could be prosecuted if they had made a mistake, however unwitting.
<P>
I would like to see the authorities prosecuting those employing people illegally, but I would like to see them doing so having got the intelligence, built their case and done so as they would have done in any other area of criminal law. I do not want to see a general prohibition that requires people to sweep up the problems for the Home Office and their agents, as we have seen outlined in clauses 11 and 12. It would be appropriate for organisations such as the National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service to do that job. They can gain the information and make proper prosecutions, and we can combat the problem of the employment of illegal immigrants without all the downsides of unfair, unnecessary and outrageous discrimination brought about by section 8. It strikes me that the Government, if they are to be consistent with their previous claims, have no alternative but to accept the amendments and move towards repealing section 8 as quickly as possible, rather than the odd compromise of placing a new code of practice on top of section 8. That strikes me as a cowardly way to approach a situation on which they seemed to be clear before winning the election in 1997.

<P>

<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): I am one of the two members of the Committee who served on the Asylum and Immigration Bill in 1995 and 1996. I have refreshed my memory from the Official Report as to what the then shadow spokesperson on home affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) said about what was then clause 8 of that Bill. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The world of work in Britain will face many problems if clause 8 stands."--[Official Report Standing Committee D, 1
 February 1996; c. 466]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
He was right. The atmosphere created by legislation such as section 8 makes it easier for would-be employers who seek to discriminate to justify their discrimination.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere speculated on why the Government have reversed their position on section 8. One of his speculations was that Labour Members never believed that it was detrimental to race relations. I can put my hand up; I believed that all along and I still believe it, which is why I feel obliged to speak on it. That is one of the many reasons--the Whip would be happy to give the Committee the entire charge sheet--why I am not a Minister. The Asylum and Immigration Act was difficult legislation for us to manage in opposition, but my hon. Friend the Home Secretary gave, as the then shadow Home Secretary, the clearcut commitment that we would repeal section 8. I regret that it has not proved possible to carry out that commitment.
<P>
Obviously I support the clause; the code of practice is an improvement on the current position. I do not wish to detain the Committee but it might help hon. Members to understand why Labour Members attacked clause 8 for so long and with such fervour. My hon. Friend the Minister has been described as Prussian in his attitude to race and asylum matters--
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Terrifyingly Prussian.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Terrifyingly Prussian, I apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) was, because of her nationality, concerned about the reference to Prussia.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am only quoting--no offence is meant and I am sure none is taken.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister has been described as terrifyingly Prussian in his attitude to race and immigration, but his predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North was a positive Bismarck on those matters. He was morbidly afraid of being seen as a liberal on race and immigration. However atrocious the race or civil liberties implications of the Act, whenever we, as his Back-Bench colleagues, raised them with him, he would snarl, "We do not want to give in to interest groups"--by which he meant the Refugee Council, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, and all the people whom Opposition Members quote with such alacrity, including Britain's black and immigrant communities. Middle England was never described as an interest group--middle England, for new Labour, is the voice of God.
<P>
Given the reluctance of my hon. Friend for Newcastle upon Tyne, North to be responding to interest groups, the Committee can imagine the alacrity with which he leaped on a section of that Act which he could attack on behalf of small business. How more utterly new Labour can one get? Hon. Members reading the Official Report of that Committee may wonder why I and my hon. Friends the Members for Tottenham, for Streatham and for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) were allowed to go on at such length and with such fervour about section 8, but of the then Bill that is the context in which it occurred. However, although I stand by everything I said then, one is obliged to support the clause.
<P>
I shall deal briefly with the arguments that Ministers will make for refusing to repeal section 8. The truth is that they have fallen prey to the blandishments of immigration officials who hate to lose power once they have finally acquired it. The rationale is that section 8 is needed in order to deal with abuses such as employers who employ sweated illegal immigrant labour. I feel as strongly as any member of the Committee--at least as strongly as the Minister--about illegal immigrants being used as sweated labour, a practice that is more widely spread than is sometimes suggested. If one goes to the City of London at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, one can see many cleaners returning home from their night shift. Many of them originate from the African sub-continent and I suspect that a passport check would show that many of them are also illegal immigrants. I repeat what I said during the 1995-96 debates: it is hypocrisy for Tory Members to talk about the need to clamp down on the employment of illegal labour, when many major employers, who should know better, employ illegal immigrant labour because they are the only people who will work for the wages offered in cleaning and similar sectors.
<P>
The Minister will wring his hands in a charming and disarming manner--
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> In a Prussian manner.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> A charming, disarming and Prussian manner. The Minister will say, "Yes, we understand the problems of section 8, but we need it to bear down on the vicious employers of sweated labour." If the intention of section 8 is to bear down on employers who exploit their employees, it would be better if that matter was addressed more directly. Ministers have told me that the minimum wage legislation cannot deal with the issue because it requires a complaint. If the minimum wage legislation is not sufficient to deal with employers who exploit vulnerable and underpaid labour, it is deficient.
<P>
Sadly, as has been the case throughout consideration of the Bill, Ministers have been swayed by the siren voice of Croydon and its constant search to accrete new powers. If they want to bear down on bad employers, they must liaise with their colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry to construct legislation which has that effect.
<P>
I spoke at length on the issue in the Asylum and Immigration Bill 1996. I believed what I said then and I believe it now. My remarks are not intended to be a frontal assault on Ministers, but in London the unemployment rate among young black males between the ages of 18 and 24 is two thirds. I live with the social and criminal consequences of that level of unemployment; I cannot believe that such high unemployment among young people, most of whom have been born and brought up here, does not result from an element of discrimination among employers. Section 8 will slowly contribute to that climate of discrimination.
<P>
However, clause 13 is an improvement on the status quo; as always, I am glad, not to say rapturous, to support my Government in Committee.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King </B>(Bethnal Green and Bow): I welcome the Government's aims, outlined in a statement by the Minister on 27 October 1998, as being to target organised racketeers, to protect the most vulnerable people and to prevent discrimination under the Race Relations Act 1976. My anxiety is section 8, the vehicle being used to achieve those aims. Members will be aware that the current Home Office guidance issued to employers states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If you try to avoid prosecution by refusing to consider for a job anyone who looks or sounds foreign, you are likely to contravene the Race Relations Act 1976 . . . if a complaint of discrimination is upheld on racial grounds by an industrial tribunal, there is no limit on the compensation which may be ordered."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is a pretty strong threat, yet there are still problems.
<P>
I am less concerned with the putative Prussian nature of the clause than with its precision. If we want to follow the Government's aims to target organised racketeering, we should do precisely that, which means criminalising employers who assist the violation of immigration controls, as opposed to employers who offer employment to individuals who may have contravened or breached immigration controls. That is the critical point. In seeking a constructive solution to the problem, if the Minister is not able or willing to repeal section 8, would it be possible to consider some of the immigration tools currently available, such as that outlined earlier by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), to discover how we can make that distinction and criminalise employers' assisting the violation of immigration regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand the concerns that have been expressed by several colleagues and by the Liberal Democrat spokesman about the way in which section 8 operates. I do not seek to disguise the fact that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, how to deal with the issue has caused us considerable hand-wringing and concern.
<P>
I recently spoke to a woman whose job was at a reputable university. She was one of two people who were appointed as a lecturer. One person was white and one was not--she was not. She had been born and bred in Yorkshire and she was asked to provide a passport and answer various questions about her immigration status. That did not happen to the other person who was white. The excuse used by the university, which should have known much better because it was breaching the Race Relations Act 1976, was that it was acting in accord with section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. Clearly, it did not know that it was in breach of the race relations legislation, nor did it know how the code of practice required it operate. Such guidance instructs such institutions to apply criteria for the granting of a job across the board to all applicants and not to discriminate.
<P>
The university did not receive guidance, so it did not know about it. It is not in legislation. Such guidance should be given the strength, coherence and importance that it deserves. To date, it has not been, which is why the Bill should emphasise the importance of not discriminating and ensure that it fits within the Government's broader policy of campaigning against not only discrimination, but racial equality.
<P>
The way in which discrimination occurs in employment practices is a serious issue for our society. We are a multi-racial society; some people might not like that, but it is true and every Member of parliament would want to make that a success. Some employers discriminate. I suspect that no one would disagree that even if we were to repeal section 8, some employers would still discriminate. They may use section 8 as an excuse for discrimination, but they should not be allowed to even contemplate using it as such, which is why we need clause 13.
<P>
The Government want to ensure that a clear message goes out and the code will do that together with our commitment to extend the Race Relations Act 1976 to cover not only the police, but immigration legislation. It will make it clear that we do not accept that racism can be excused by reason of some facet of immigration control.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington referred to the second mischief. The first is racial discrimination on the part of employers who sometimes use section 8 to excuse it, while the second, which is just as serious, is the racketeers who are increasingly using illegal immigrants as a source of cheap labour. How would the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) deal with employers who are deliberately seeking to undermine wage levels and using illegal immigrants to do other people out of jobs, some of whom may be from ethnic minorities in this country?

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Does not the Minister think that the 1971 Act applies to those who are employing people illegally? Surely it was effective between 1971 and 1996.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The problem was that the Act was not sufficiently effective, which is one of the reasons why we eventually decided to keep section 8 provisions. I shall explain what happens so that the hon. Gentleman understands why we have difficulty in taking the course of action that he advises.
<P>
Unfortunately, I know a factory in which several illegal immigrants from eastern Europe were employed. The immigration service has now dealt with that case, and I shall not give further details because prosecutions may result in due course. The constituency Members of Parliament had been approached and was asked to assist with planning permission, on the basis that the jobs would go to local people. The local council considered the matter and decided to depart from the provisions of the development plan and to ensure that the facility, which would bring jobs for the community, was created.
<P>
It was not a surprise to find that the local jobs to be created were filled by people who were illegally brought into the country in the back of lorries all the way from Poland, Romania and countries further afield, or that the wages paid to those people were extremely low. A conspiracy had been created between the employer and the low-paid illegal immigrants. The employer was not going to say anything, because he was getting cheap labour. The illegal immigrant was not going to say anything, because he would be removed from the United Kingdom. Therefore both parties engaged in the conspiracy to continue to work and to undermine the job opportunities for people in the area, many of whom might have come from ethnic minorities. It was well organised by racketeers, who brought in illegal immigrants on request in order to participate in the work. We have a duty to deal with employers who discriminate against ethnic minorities and to ensure that people do not bring in illegal immigrants to undercut local people's salaries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's point in a moment, if he will bear with me.
<P>
What my colleagues in the Ministery of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food call "gangmasters" operate in east Anglia and the west country, bringing in illegal immigrants from eastern Europe, employing what used to be called a lump labour system, using gangs of illegal immigrants to work on the land during the picking season, again at a very cheap rate. Such rackets are organised and must be dealt with. It is our duty to tackle that problem, just as it is our duty to tackle racial discrimination. Evidence suggests that the problem has been getting worse since 1996. To date, one successful prosecution under section 8 has been made. We have given 40 warnings to employers, and intend to ensure that we can proceed to prosecute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I understand my hon. Friend's argument about the need to deal with organised racketeering. How is his Department talking to other Departments about the problem? It seems almost inevitable that the people who run such rackets will be exactly the same as those who do not file proper tax returns or pay national insurance, and that action can and should be taken against them in other ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We need to co-operate with other Departments to ensure that we deal with people who break other laws. However, dealing with such problems through the national minimum wage or tax legislation will not be sufficient to deal with the particular mischief that we want to tackle. I shall return to that point in a moment, but should like to discuss another issue before I dealing with whether criminal offences would tackle with the problem.
<P>
The Commission for Racial Equality and several refugee organisations have been asked to examine the section 8 provisions to ascertain whether we can amend them to deal with both mischiefs, which all hon. Members want to tackle. As yet, no organisation--ILPA or any other--has come back to us saying that there is a way of amending, repealing or altering section 8, so that we can deal with the racketeers and employers who employ illegal immigrants, nor can we deal with the issue of section 8 being used as an excuse for racial discrimination by some employers.
<P>
We have asked organisations for a solution, and they have considered the matter. I and my officials, as well as senior lawyers have tried too, but there seems to be no real way of resolving the problem. We could suggest face-saving or cosmetic amendments. Some have asked whether, for the sake of appearing to deliver, we could not have a cosmetic exercise. We must face up to such things. We must consider the reality and accept that section 8 has been used by employers for racial discriminatory purposes. We should deal with that issue and the other mischief of the employment of illegal immigrants.
<P>
<P>
We have a dilemma. I am not offering that as a panacea, nor am I saying that the introduction of a code of practice into statute will end discrimination or the use of section 8 as an excuse for discrimination. It would be naive to suggest otherwise, but it will inform employers who might discriminate unintentionally, or emphasise to those who may be tempted to discriminate that they cannot do so because legislation exists. Those who discriminate and who use section 8 as an excuse to do so will know that the code will be used against them in the courts. It provides the extra deterrent against discrimination that we need.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam asks whether we should use the criminal offences provisions. We will when we can, but, until 1996, the old criminal offences required an intention on the part of an employer to employ an illegal immigrant. We do not have the ability to deal with an employer who says, "I didn't know and I didn't ask.". Employers should ask or check. They should not discriminate in the way in which they check, but they should be sure that they are not employing illegal immigrants. If they say that they did not ask, the old legislation before 1996 does not allow that mischief to be addressed.
<P>
I shall explain why to the hon. Member for Nottingham, North before he intervenes. Section 25 of the 1971 Act is not sufficient by itself. It is an offence to facilitate illegal entry whether or not the person is employed, but nothing in section 25 prevents someone from employing and exploiting an illegal entrant whom someone else has brought in. Section 25(2) of that Act makes it an offence to harbour an illegal entrant, an overstayer or a worker in breach. Simply employing someone is not harbouring him, so unless an employer is made to ask the question, he can honestly claim that he did not know that the person whom he has taken on was not allowed to work.
<P>
The old legislation did not deal with the issue. I had to look at the matter afresh as a new Minister. I did not serve on the Standing Committee that considered the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. I did not think that, in all honesty, we could either indulge in making a cosmetic change or tackle the mischief of the deliberately employing employer without retaining section 8 of the 1996 Act. We had to face up to that reality, and I ask the hon. Member for Hallam to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister's candour is appreciated. We must judge whether the damage done will be outweighed by the good achieved. As I have said, the principal good to be achieved is that of tackling the racketeers, but surely section 25(1) of the 1996 Act on facilitating illegal entry, which carries a possible sentence of up to seven years' imprisonment, is a far better way of getting the racketeers than relying on the end point of being in work and prosecuting them under section 8, which carries a fine of up to only £5,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Getting the racketeers is obviously extremely important. However, the racketeer is in business to provide an employer who is prepared to break the law with illegal immigrants. The racketeer would not be in business without the employer, and we must address both. One targets racketeers not only by striking at them directly but by attacking their markets for labour among unscrupulous employers. That is a key point.
<P>
The problem is that it is impossible to prove the requisite knowledge. It would not help immigrants if we could do so, because employers would still want to conduct checks to ensure that they would not be accused of the offence. Under section 8 of the 1996 Act, they are allowed to secure a defence with a few simple checks. Our code will emphasise the fact that they must apply those checks non-discriminatorily. They must not discriminate between people because one person is white and another is black.
<P>
The inability to discriminate on that basis will ensure that employers are deterred from breaking the law. They will be able to read the provision in the Bill. I hope that that is how the measure will operate in practice. We must get our message across to employers. Some employers do not intend to discriminate; they simply do not know how the guidance operates. We have included the measure in the Bill so that they will know about it.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington referred to the national minimum wage legislation, but it will not stop such exploitation, because illegal immigrants will be unlikely to complain; they want to work. Employees will still be liable to denunciation by employers if their status is unclear. Employers will exploit being able to denounce the employees. That makes employers enormously powerful, because they can denounce illegal immigrants. At any stage, employers could use minimum wage legislation or other measures to put pressure on illegal immigrants and their families. That is not an adequate way to deal with such matters. The tax provisions are not adequate to deal with it. We have looked carefully at other legislation, but none of it adequately deals with such mischief.
<P>
I thought that the best approach to take was to be perfectly honest with hon. Members. We were right to say that section 8 of the 1996 Act would produce unacceptable discrimination. The discrimination that employers seek to excuse under section 8 is not acceptable. The approach that we took when in Opposition had much merit. However, now that we are looking at both parts of the problem, we believe that clause 13 will help us deal with the problems created under section 8 of the 1996 Act.
<P>
Conservative Members sought to undermine clause 13 with a series of amendments, but we want a strong code that will prevent discrimination. We want to send out loud and clear the message that, although we are keeping section 8, because it is important to tackle the racketeers, gangmasters, criminals and crooks, we will not tolerate discrimination or the use of section 8 by employers as an excuse to discriminate.
<H4>5.30 pm</H4>
<P>
I ask the Committee to support clause 13 because it will ensure that we can tackle the illegal employers and the racketeers, but also because it will help us to tackle the discrimination caused by section 8--discrimination that we criticised the Conservative Government for allowing. We seek to remedy that with a statutory code, to prevent, or at least substantially reduce, the discrimination that results from employers using section 8 as an excuse.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I appreciate the honesty with which the Minister made his case. It was a compromise between the absolutist provisions of section 8 remaining unamended or there being no section 8. It is useful to have a debate in which a Minister gives us a frank expression of opinion rather than the partisan bashing to which we are occasionally prone.
<P>
I remain concerned about the implications of continuing to use section 8. I am not sure that it will always be operated with the requisite Prussian efficiency, even with the new code of practice, which means that problems will still occur. For example, and following the university example given by the Minister, I have a large university in my constituency, and many of its employees are from overseas. If section 8 remains, such an employer ought to ask the nationality and immigration status of everyone who applies for a post, so as not to discriminate between those who appear to be foreign and those who do not, even though many of those who appear to be foreign are United Kingdom nationals and have been settled here for some time. It will take quite an effort to ensure that employers start doing something that will seem to them to be nonsense.
<P>
The Minister gave an example of someone from Yorkshire. Will employers use an accent as a discriminatory tool or as a way of judging a person, or will they simply say that they want to see passports and nationality details with every application form? The latter seems to be the only truly non-discriminatory way, but I suspect that many employers will say that that is stupid, and ask why, if an applicant has a white face and comes from Yorkshire, they should have to check their immigration status?
<P>
<B> Mr. O'Brien:</B> If employers apply a check against anyone who applies for a job, they must apply it against all applicants; or they can make that check when they make the appointment. At whatever stage of the process it happens--application, interview, second interview or appointment--it must be applied equally to all who come within that category.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is helpful. We certainly would not oppose that as an amelioration of the existing provision, although I am still of the opinion that the damage done by section 8 is not outweighed by the good. However, I shall put that point to better legal brains than mine, perhaps in another place, to see whether they can rise to the Minister's challenge to find a more acceptable way of penalising such employers.
<P>
We want to penalise those employers who intentionally employ people unlawfully, not to impose checks on all employers. However, I understand what the Minister said about how difficult it is to distinguish between the two if not all employers are required to check. I certainly hope that we come up with some way of achieving that, because I remain concerned that we shall not see a level playing field, no matter how much information we provide or how many codes of practice we set up.
<P>
Perhaps some test cases will be brought; I am sure that organisations such as the Commission for Racial Equality would support such cases, if only to make sure that the message does go out loud and clear. However, experience in other areas of employment law suggests that such things can take a long time. During that time, many people's opportunities could he ruined because employers continued to behave in a way that technically they should not.
<P>
We do not oppose clause 13, as it is an improvement on a bad provision, but I hope that, at a later stage, further measures can be taken to remove the discriminatory effect of section 8 of the 1996 Act.

<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B>
 I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 11, line 4, leave out "42(5)" and insert "42(4)".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 28, 37, 41, 45 and 51.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The amendments reflect the need for minor drafting changes in parts I and II of the Bill. Government amendment No. 25 is necessary to correct a drafting error, and will ensure that the entry clearance monitor can oversee certain entry clearance cases in which there is no right of appeal.
<P>
As drafted, clause 15(4)(a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That definition is contained in the Marriage Act 1949. However, clause 1 of the Registration Service Act 1953, which makes provision for such a post, refers to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Registrar General for England and Wales".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Government amendment No. 28 is designed to record the Registrar General's title accurately.
<P>
Government amendment No. 37 deletes a superfluous reference in clause 18(5)(a). Clause 28 contains definitions of the words "owner" and "captain", which make clear that such people are owners or captains of ships or aircraft. It is, therefore, unnecessary for clause 18(5)(a) to refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the owner or captain of the ship or aircraft".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Government amendment No. 41 is a tidying amendment. It deletes the reference in clause 19 (3) to the order by which the code of practice on prevention of carriage of clandestines may be brought into operation. At present, subsection (3) states that such a code may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"come into operation by an order made by statutory instrument".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The words "made by statutory instrument" are unnecessary. Clause 134(1) specifies that all powers conferred by the Bill to make orders, along with rules and regulations, shall be "exercisable by statutory instrument".
<P>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 45 and 51 delete in clauses 23 and 27 respectively erroneous references to schedule 1 being concerned with the detention of transporters. Schedule I is concerned only with the sale of transporters. The title of schedule 1,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Detention and Sale of Transporters",<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
will be corrected when the Bill is reprinted after the Committee has reported. Government amendment No. 45 corrects the error in clause 23(6), and Government amendment No. 51 does the same in clause 27(7).
<P>
I urge the Committee to accept these amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I shall be brief. I wish to raise a couple of points.
<P>
I understand why the clause has been drafted as it has. Appeal rights for visitors were removed by the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993. The then Government set up a monitoring system in response to concerns raised by the removal of such rights. An independent monitor, Dame Elizabeth Anson, was appointed to examine cases in which appeal rights no longer existed and cases which had been refused.
<P>
Clause 14 redefines the role performed by Dame Anson and makes a parallel to the 1993 Act. A consequence of that redefinition is that a considerably smaller number of cases come within the monitor's remit.
<P>
I was sceptical of what would be achieved by the 1993 decision to appoint a monitor. At the time, it seemed--and still does, to some extent--a sop for the removal of appeal rights, which, of course, the Bill will replace.
<P>
It is clear from the reports produced by Dame Anson that some of her work has been quite valuable, especially the fact that she has gone beyond examining narrow questions of refusal. I have a report that she produced in 1998. It includes chapters on facilitating applications, the operation of the migration and visa correspondence unit, suggestions to help Members of Parliament  to deal with refusals, a section on administration, and the standard of interviews, objections and complaints. The report is valuable when considering what has happened in the administration.
<P>
I hope that we will not narrow the scope of monitoring. I do not expect my hon. Friend the Minister to give a commitment now, but perhaps he could re-examine the clause before Report and consider widening rather than narrowing the role of the monitor.
<P>
Earlier we discussed the possibility of a pilot scheme for securities and bonds and ways of monitoring that. That is an obvious role for the independent monitor. She could consider the operation of the pilot scheme and ensure that we receive reports about it. She already reports to Parliament annually. We can use and improve existing mechanisms.
<P>
In the aftermath of the Macpherson report, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a commitment to apply the Race Relations Act 1976 to the Immigration Service in due course. That emphasises the case for monitoring the immigration service.
<P>
I understand the reasons for the way in which the clause is drafted. After the 1993 Act, the independent monitor's role was to concentrate on refusals. Clause 14 redefines that function. However, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider whether we can refine the clause and use the independent monitor for functions such as examining the pilot security scheme, and considering methods of applying the Race Relations Act to the Immigration Service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I support the comments of the hon. Member for Walthamstow. I, too, found Dame Anson's reports useful. I used the same logic as him to interpret the clause.
<P>
Most of us want the scope of independent monitoring to be expanded, not narrowed. However, apart from narrowing that scope, the clause is also inefficient. Much of the monitoring work involves visiting overseas posts and talking to entry clearance officers. It is needlessly inefficient to send someone to Islamabad or New Delhi and tell him to examine only a small set of applications and to ignore the others. The existence of an appeal should not, as a matter of principle, exclude an application for a visa from being independently monitored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Government have sympathy with the views on independent monitoring. I assure the Committee that we shall take account of the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow made, and consider whether the clause needs to be amended. If so, we shall table amendments later in our proceedings.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government amendment No. 27.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 15 places a duty on registration officers throughout the United Kingdom to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office. That will place on a statutory footing the informal arrangements that are already in place, whereby registrars report to the registrars general in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales. Currently, where the registrar general receives a report and is satisfied that the registrar's suspicions are well founded, a report is passed to the Home Office. The informal nature of the existing arrangements results in only a small percentage of sham marriages being reported. That is why we wish to place a statutory duty on registrars to make a report where there are reasonable grounds for doing so.

Amendment No. 26 is designed to ensure that the duty to report suspicious marriages applies to all registration officers in England and Wales who attest a notice of marriage. Subsection (1) contains no express reference to a deputy superintendent register.
<P>
Amendment No. 27 clarifies that, where a registration officer in England and Wales, a registrar or deputy registrar in Northern Ireland or a district registrar in Scotland, has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a marriage is or will be a sham, that person has a duty to report his supicions to the Secretary of State--in practice to the Immigration Service.
<P>
The reference in subsection (3) to "registrar" might have been taken as excluding reference to superintendent registrars or deputy superintendent registrars in England and Wales. The amendments, therefore, make it clear that the important duty to report suspicious marriages applies throughout the United Kingdom to all registration offices to whom notice of marriage has been given and to all registrars in whose presence a marriage is solemnised.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have concerns about the provision in general, because it strikes me as being an indirect way of reintroducing a primary purpose rule. We shall debate the general issues on clause stand part, but the amendments need to be seen in that light.
<P>
The amendments would bring marriages conducted in the Anglican Church--the Church of England or the Church in Wales--within the scope of the provisions. It may seem perverse when one has concerns about a provision in general to seek to widen its scope, but we are trying, as I said earlier, to test the areas of the Bill that we believe to be in breach of the European convention on human rights.
<P>
With the Government, we welcomed the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 into law last year and hope that it will make a significant difference to legislation. We found less than satisfactory the Secretary of State's bland signing off of the Bill, when he said that in his view its provisions were compatible with the convention rights. We still have major concerns, and this is a principal area of concern.
<P>
In particular, we believe that not applying the regulations to marriages conducted in the Anglican Church could be a breach of article 12 on the right to marry and article 8 on the right to a private and family life. If applied in a discriminatory way, as we believe they are at present, the regulations could also be challenged under article 14, which relates to protection from discrimination on, among others, religious grounds.
<P>
The Government have stated that there is no evidence to show that marriages conducted in the Anglican Church are abused for immigration purposes. In other words, they do not believe that there is a problem there. However, in a sense that confirms the discrimination. Discrimination, by definition, makes assumptions about a particular group that are not applied elsewhere. The assumption in the clause, although it is not spelt out, is that a marriage conducted as a Muslim or Roman Catholic ceremony is treated differently in law from one conducted as an Anglican ceremony. That strikes us as discriminatory. There are no grounds to suggest that, in practice, more of a problem would arise with a Rornan Catholic marriage than with, for example, an Anglican marriage.
<P>
The Government's willingness to be in line with the European convention on human rights will be in trouble if they cannot amend this area, although I have tabled the amendments in the context of more general concerns about the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall deal simply with the amendments. If members of the Committee wish to return to more general questions on clause stand part, I shall respond then.
<P>
Evidence suggests that marriage abuse for immigration purposes is confined to civil marriages. Accordingly, the Bill gives additional powers to registrars to help to ensure that couples do not enter into marriage solely to evade immigration control.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> What evidence is there to suggest that abuse is confined to civil marriages?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Essentially, the evidence is in reports to registrars. However, I shall explain why it is less likely for religious services to be used to evade immigration control.
<P>
The Bill extends to religious marriages, other than in the established Church, because all such marriages must follow civil preliminaries. That practice dates back to the Marriage Act 1836 when the registration of non-Anglican marriages was first put on a statutory basis.
<P>
The procedures for marriage in the established Church by religious preliminaries are already more lengthy and more involved than civil preliminaries. Religious preliminaries tend to include a series of meetings with the vicar or minister responsible. That allows a relationship to develop between the minister and the parties to the marriage, which significantly reduces the likelihood of abuse. There is a also a real concern that placing a duty on the clergy to report suspected sham marriages would seriously intrude on their pastoral and religious role. However, if a minister has suspicions that a marriage may be arranged to avoid statutory immigration controls, there is nothing to prevent him or her from reporting those concerns to the immigration service.
<P>
The proposals do not introduce a new fundamental difference between marriages solemnised by religious preliminaries and by civil preliminaries, but build on the differences that already exist. It would have been inappropriate to include in the Bill measures aimed at rationalising the procedures governing the preliminaries to religious marriage.
<P>
I am also satisfied that the exclusion of religious preliminaries from the Bill's provision does not breach the European convention on human rights on religious grounds or on the basis of discrimination between religions. That is because the duty applies equally to all marriages--civil and religious, including Anglican marriages--that follow civil preliminaries. I cannot invite the Committee to support the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was about to assist the Minister by telling him that there is already evidence that there are bogus marriages. Every year, several hundred marriages are reported by the Registrar-General under existing arrangements. The marriages are reported to him and he then passes the information on to the Secretary of State. The proposals in the clause are a bit pointless, but they give the Government something else to talk about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Again, we have received a straightforward assurance from the Minister that he does not believe that the measure is discriminatory. A blanket assumption has been made that people who spend time talking to a Church of England or Church in Wales priest have excluded themselves from entering into a sham marriage whereas others may enter into one. I do not accept that straightforward assumption, but it is not appropriate to press the amendment to a vote now. However, we shall wish to return to the general principle behind it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Department of Finance and Personnel"<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
and insert "Secretary of State".
<P>
Clause 15(4) sets out the arrangements under which regulations will be made in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The amendment deals with the arrangements for Northern Ireland. The Registrar-General does not have regulation-making powers; in Northern Ireland, they rest with the Department of Finance and Personnel. However, as immigration is an excepted matter under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, it is more appropriate for the power to make regulations in relation to Northern Ireland to rest with the Secretary of State.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 12, line 7, leave out from "is" to end of line and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"neither a British citizen nor a national of an EEA State other than the United Kingdom and another person (whether or not such a citizen or such a national); and".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The intention of clause 15 is to tackle the potential abuse of marriage by a person who is subject to immigration control marrying someone who has the right to reside in the United Kingdom. It was pointed out by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association in evidence to the Committee that the definition as originally drafted was too narrow to achieve that aim. The definition did not include marriages between foreign nationals where one is subject to immigration conditions and the other has indefinite leave to remain in the UK nor did it cover sham marriages entered into by certain categories of UK citizen who do not have the right of abode in the UK to gain an immigration advantage. Government amendment No. 30 would correct the deficiency in the definition of sham marriage. Unless members of the Committee wish me to explain the technical provisions, which I can, I will leave the matter there.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B> Mr. Allan:</B> As usual, I want to comment on the clause generally. In common with the previous debate about employers, and section 8 of the 1996 Act, once again we are removing our responsibility for judging immigration status to categories of people other than immigration officers. In section 8, it was employers; in clause 15, we place a duty on registrars to try to decide the purpose of a couple's marriage. We believe that that may prove discriminatory, even if that is not the intention. The effect will again be people who are not necessarily qualified to do so working from guidance that may be less than wholly adequate and making judgements that will have a discriminatory effect on many people in this country. In particular, there may be discimination on grounds of race and colour as registrars apply differing standards to different groups of people.
<P>
We welcome particularly the Government's repeal of the primary purpose rule, but we believe that some of the interview processes that will be introduced will in many respects replicate that rule in trying to establish the purpose of a marriage. Many of us have experience of that not working at the other end in cases where people required a visa to enter the country. It is difficult to understand why the provision will be any more workable when registrars try to establish the reason for a person getting married.
<H4><center>6 pm</center></H4>
<P>
We are also concerned that the draft guidance appears to contain inaccuracies. Paragraph 7 of paper C is one issue that has been raised with me. It attempts to explain to registrars how they should establish British nationality. It was explained to me that people born in the United Kingdom on or after 1 January 1983 are British citizens if either of their parents is British or if one of their parents holds any other nationality but was settled, in other words had indefinite leave to remain, in the UK at the time of their birth. It has been put to me that the guidance is not sufficiently clear. What could be clearer than that explanation of someone's status born on or after 1 January 1983? Those people are now 16 and will come into the category who will be getting married. It is crucial to get these definitions right.
<P>
The immigration rules now run to something like 395 paragraphs. Many of those will apply in this area of establishing a person's status. Clearly the registrars can only bring the clause into effect where they believe that a person will gain an immigration advantage. To do that they must understand not only the complex nationality requirements, but something of the general ranges of immigration status that may lead people to believe that they will gain advantage from a sham marriage.
<P>
Trying to get registrars to understand or digest 395 paragraphs of immigration rules or those relevant sections, we understand that more will be released--as well as their many other duties may place an impossible burden on them; they are bound to fail in terms of interpreting this in a consistent and non-discriminatory way. Our concerns will continue to exist as they did with section 8. If the Bill is enacted with these provisions in it, we hope that what should be a joyous time in their lives will not turn into an ordeal. We hope that people will not have to face a registrar who will call into question their motives at a very sensitive time in their lives and, because he was poorly briefed or had inaccurate guidance, might prevent a marriage that could properly take place.
<P>
Subjecting those who are entering into perfectly legitimate marriages to the prospect of a grilling about their immigration status should not be considered lightly. Catching those few who are entering into marriages for inappropriate reasons should not be at the expense of giving a hard time to the many who are quite legitimately carrying out their ordinary business and right to family life.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to talk on clause 15. Anyone who has anything to do with immigration or asylum matters knows that sham marriages exist and are a means of circumventing immigration legislation. I have listened carefully to what the Minister said in defence of the clause but it really is an atrocious clause.
<P>
As has already been pointed out, it gives people, other than immigration officials, duties in relation to immigration control. Generally speaking, that is quite inappropriate. Such people will not have knowledge of the legislation or the rules, the background or the control of proper immigration officials. More crucial than that--and this is why it is a devious clause--it invites registrars to judge intention. I have waited for the Minister to explain how registrars are supposed to do that. They will not be able to judge intention on the basis of the 30 or 40 minutes that a civil marriage might take.
<P>
Under the clause registrars will be invited to judge on externals--there could be no plainer invitation to discriminate in a wholly subjective way. The clause represents the domestication of the primary purpose rule where wholly arbitrary judgments are made about people's intentions, aims and unspoken thoughts. It is highly regrettable.
<P>
I will support the Government's aim of cracking down on evasion of immigration control, but we must consider the price that is to be paid. People who are seeking to marry in areas where there is not a large population of migrants and refugees will find their special day ruined by an ill-thought out clause which has more to do with responding to scares in the tabloid press than to a thoughtful and considered approach to immigration control.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King:</B> I have already raised my grave concerns with the Minister and his colleagues. I share the anxieties of the CRE that race will inevitably serve as a code in this respect and that mixed race or black and Asian couples will be subjected to invasion of their privacy and a degree of scrutiny that will not apply to others.
<P>
I am anxious that the proposal breaches rights under articles 12, 8 and 14 of the European convention on human rights which refer respectively to the right to marry, the right to a private and family life and the prohibition of discrimination on religious grounds.
<P>
I listened carefully to what my hon. Friends said on the matter and I hope that they can precisely determine what "reasonable grounds" are. They will agree that if this is the route being taken, the least that can be done is to state, in forensic detail, what the grounds are, because people's fundamental rights will be breached.
<P>
The proposals represent a problem for our multicultural society. I was delighted that the Minister reaffirmed the Government's commitment to a multicultural society. He said that some people do not like that; such people would presumably include members of the high command of the white wolves who wrote to me yesterday saying that if I had not left the country by 31 December this year I would be exterminated. No doubt my hon. Friends receive similar mail; we have more than the millennium bug to worry about and I ask Ministers to take our worries seriously.
<P>
It is true that I take these matters personally. I exist because my parents entered into a mixed marriage; my mother is a British citizen, my father is not, and he is black. My parents would have been subjected to these proposals. Had the registrar at their marriage--not an immigration official or someone versed in such matters--had suspicions about them, I might not be here today. It is not just the white wolves I am worried about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It would be a great shame if the hon. Lady were not here today as she makes a valuable contribution. Does she share my anxiety that the matter will be a major issue, not so much in the multi-ethnic, multicultural society in London, but out there in the sticks where there are few mixed marriages and the registrar may take it as a green light to be heavy handed?
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> That is a good point. My hon. Friends, including the Minister, have firm personal commitments to a multiracial society, but that does not exist in many places. It would be dangerous to allow a discretion without reasonable grounds being carefully defined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall attempt to respond to the concerns expressed by hon. Members. First, the statutory provision attempts to place in law the rules that affect existing behaviour. There is already an informal arrangement whereby registrars report their suspicions about marriages that they have conducted. The clause and associated guidance allows hon. Members to question Ministers about its appropriateness, but it is an existing practice; some 500 marriages are reported each year as suspicious. I hope that members of the Committee will welcome the fact that by putting it on a statutory basis, the relevant rules will be entirely transparent. Hon. Members are right to challenge them if they feel uncomfortable about them, but it is better for them to be put in law, and to be transparent, than to continue with the present informal arrangements.
<P>
I want to deal with the point about primary purpose. I emphasise that it is not the same as a primary purpose rule. The mischief in the primary purpose rule was that it involved genuine marriages. Clause 15 relates solely to sham marriages and people seeking to use marriage as a way of avoiding immigration control. That is quite different from primary purpose.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Surely the point on the primary purpose rule was about the testing process. In order to decide the difference between a sham and a genuine marriage, tests are necessary. It is the tests that cause the problem. The primary purpose rule has a test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> All sorts of things have tests but they are not necessarily the same. The primary purpose rule that the Government sought to correct was that affecting perfectly valid and lawful marriages, but the clause deals only with marriages specifically entered into to avoid immigration rules. As I said, that is quite different.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam clearly feels strongly about the issue but he made heavy weather of it. There is not the slightest suggestion that anyone appearing in front of a registrar will be subjected to grilling or questioning. We do not want to place onerous responsibilities on registrars: they will simply consider whether, in the light of what takes place in front of them, they have reason to suspect that a marriage has been entered into for the purpose of avoiding immigration rules.
<P>
I welcome the hon. Member for Hallam's concerns about changes in the draft guidance, which has already been circulated. If changes need to be made, I will consider them carefully and would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would write to us about his anxieties. That was precisely the purpose of circulating the guidance--to allow people to make their representations. However, the draft guidance sets out in paragraph 4 the various factors that could influence the registrar in reporting a suspicion. For example, if parties gave the impression of knowing little about each other, that would raise suspicions. If the parties to a marriage appeared to have only just met, that could also lead the registrar to suspect that it had been entered into for dubious reasons.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsha Singh </B>(Bradford, West): Does the Minister not realise the serious implications for arranged marriages? In the majority of such marriages, the parties may not have met. The Minister's words could be a charter for registrars to clamp down heavily on perfectly genuine marriages that happen to be arranged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Let me make it clear that the registrar will take particular circumstances into account. He will be looking at what takes place in front of him and will not automatically report all arranged marriages. That is only one out of a range of factors that he might take into account in deciding whether to report a marriage on grounds of immigration evasion. I used that only as an illustration, not as a conclusive point that registrars will report all such marriages in all such circumstances. Registrars will have to make judgments on the basis of a range of circumstances.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for making that point because it illustrates the sort of problems that we might run into. I thought that my oldest and best friend was completely mad when she told me that she was getting married after knowing her partner for only five weeks. If people are white and British and want to marry in five weeks they will not be subject to an invasion of privacy; but if they are black or from outside the relevant areas, they will be. That must surely be discrimination.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> My hon. Friend repeated a remark that she made earlier and I intend to deal with it in due course. However, I must make it clear that we are talking about suspicions that a registrar might have as a result of what takes place in front of him or her during the civil ceremony. The provision will not be operated in a discriminatory manner, because registrars will be acutely conscious of the sensitive cultural background of the parties who appear before them and will not take any decision based simply on their ethnic origin or colour.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Clearly registrars in established multicultural areas will be aware of the cultural background of the people before them. However, the clause might have a harsh impact on a mixed-race or ethnic minority couple getting married in an area where registrars are not accustomed to those cultural norms. That is when people might find their big day ruined.
<P>
On the earlier point that my hon. Friend the Minister made about registrars becoming suspicious if people do not appear to know one another well, I hesitate to use French in a Committee of the British Parliament, but has my hon. Friend never heard of a coup de foudre?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I have, but I shall certainly not discuss it in detail. Registrars are sophisticated in such matters as they conduct a large number of marriages on a regular basis. They are aware, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, of cultural backgrounds. They will be conscious of those circumstances, not only in certain areas. Indeed, before the rules come into effect the importance of having regard to these sensitivities will be emphasised to registrars.
<P>
The benefit to the public of having these rules clearly expressed in an Act of Parliament instead of being dependent on the informal practice of registrars cannot be overstated. That benefit allowed members of the Committee to discuss the provisions and allows us, where appropriate, to amend the rules if they are not felt to be operating effectively or properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> My difficulty is that, if there is an informal practice of registrars reporting their suspicions, that is fine; it is informal. However, here we are institutionalising and encouraging that practice and may be urging registrars to be more up-front.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I understand my hon. Friend's concern, and he expresses it effectively. It is perhaps an exercise in judgment. It is better to be able to discuss the matter in a transparent way. If my hon. Friend or any other member of the Committee finds that the rules do not operate fairly or properly, we have the opportunity to point that out and to change the rules. The difficulty about the informal practice is that none of us is aware of the criteria or what happens, and things may not work as effectively and transparently as they should.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): Can the Minister give us some practical examples of the sort of behaviour that the draftsmen have in mind that a registrar should report as symptomatic of a bogus marriage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I got into difficulty on the last occasion that I gave examples, but I have given one illustration. A number of factors might he taken into account--I emphasise the word "might"--but no one factor is likely to be conclusive. A reluctance to give details about a name, an age, an address or a background may indicate that there is something suspicious about the marriage. The parties may be unable to converse in the same language. That may be a factor, but it may not be conclusive. There may be a considerable age difference between the parties. There may be a perfectly innocent explanation. I emphasise that none of those factors 
should be taken in isolation, but must be considered together by a registrar with experience, making a judgment that in his or her view it is a sham marriage.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Faber </B>(Westbury): Perhaps the Minister is not aware that I am probably the most recently married member of the Committee. I was somewhat reluctant to give the registrar details of my occupation when I was asked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman gives a perfect example of why these facts should be used carefully, sparingly and with great responsibility by experienced registrars. We should not rely on any particular factor, but judgments must be made on the totality of the information available.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> In the previous clause, we were trying to assist the Government to keep within the terms of the European convention on human rights. These amendments would assist them in keeping within the terms of the 1951 United Nations convention on refugees.
<P>
We again have general concerns about the clause. As we proceed in attempting to knock out more and more clauses, we can see that the Bill that we would have introduced would have been much smaller. The amendments would ameliorate a difficult provision referring to the imprisonment of those who use deceptions--a provision that appears to be widely drawn. We understand the Government's intention to deter and punish those who string out unfounded processes while trying to stay in the country, but I am thinking of asylum applications, in particular.
<P>
When drafting such legislation, we should always be explicit that the provisions on asylum take primacy. We can foresee circumstances in which comments that have been made may have to be revised later. Someone who has been raped as part of the persecution suffered may not have wanted to give details about that initially. It could be judged that mentioning it later was deception. People may have come into the country with false documentation, which in itself is reprehensible, but it may have been the only means of gaining access to this country or egress from the country where they were being persecuted.
<P>
We do not take an absolutist view that deception should always contradict someone's right to claim asylum. I assume that the Minister will say that the provisions will be used within a commonsense framework, but it would be helpful to include our amendments to ensure that it is explicit that the provisions will not be kicked into force when someone has a valid and recognised claim under the 1951 convention.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> It is our intention to apply the Bill's provisions in a commonsense way. We certainly do not intend that refugees whose claims are accepted under our adopted procedures should be subject to prosecution. Indeed, persons who have obtained entry by deception and who happen to be refugees, will not be prosecuted because of that deception. It could be perfectly justifiable because they were fleeing for their lives. It is understandable that they could have used deception up to the point at which they arrive at a place of safety. They should then tell the truth, of course.
<P>
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North said that some may have been the victims of crime, such as rape, and that they are reluctant to talk about it initially, especially to a male immigration officer. One can understand that, and we are not looking at those sorts of cases. We are looking at people who systematically set out to deceive, who are not genuine refugees and who seek economic opportunity rather than a legitimate purpose for entering the UK.
<P>
Therefore, there will be a built-in system on decisions whether to prosecute. The Crown Prosecution Service and the immigration service will look at appropriate cases and decide whether there is a requirement to prosecute them. We know that most people who obtain their entry by deception are not prosecuted. That will continue to be the case because they will be removed from the UK quickly. It is difficult to see why we should prosecute if simple removal from the UK will deal with the issue.
<P>
There are some people who, because of the way in which they behave, make their removal extremely difficult, but have nevertheless set out systematically to deceive and breach our immigration control. In those cases we need such effective and tough legislation that will deal with people who deliberately set out to break our laws. I cannot accept the amendment, although I have given some assurances to the hon. Gentleman that I hope will enable him to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those assurances, which were quite explicit in referring to what happens to people who have successful claims for asylum. Other Questions were thrown up by the Minister's contribution, and I shall return to them on the clause stand part debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> As I suggested earlier, we have concerns about the clause in general, especially the issue of the penalties--terms in prison--proposed for people found guilty of the offence. The Minister has referred to the fact that it is generally preferable to remove people. We question the public interest of bringing about a prosecution that would result in someone being kept at the UK taxpayer's expense in prison for up to two years under proposed new section 24A(3)(b).
<P>
Aside from the justice issues, there are questions as to the common sense of such a route. Specific areas of concern have already been flagged up. For example, at the moment some people who have sought transit or have been in transit through the UK have been found to be in possession of false travel documents. At present, such people are prosecuted under fraud legislation and are usually sentenced to several months' imprisonment. I understand that there is a route to Canada via the UK whereby people will arrive at Heathrow where document checks may be carried out. They may then be found guilty of deception and sent to prison. It seems as though the clause could be used for that category of offender, who could be said to be usinq deception. We wonder whether the clause will lead to an increase in the imprisonment of people who should simply be removed. It does not seem to be a sensible use of resources to use the threat of imprisonment against people under circumstances in which the key issue is whether they should be in the United Kingdom. To us, removal seems a far more sensible option.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I made it clear in earlier debates that the Government believe that the use of deception to secure leave to enter, remain or avoid enforcement action is a serious matter. Those who have pursued claims involving deception may have gained substantial material advantage while their claims were being considered. If such deceptions are successful, they stand to gain further substantial advantage.
<P>
It is important that the courts have available a higher maximum penalty with which to deal with the most serious offences. The proposed new maximum two years' imprisonment, a fine or both is still less than the maximum penalty available for other deception offences where substantial financial advantage might be obtained. For example, the maximum penalty for obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception under section 16 of the Theft Act 1968 is five years, imprisonment on indictment. The same maximum applies to offences of obtaining services by deception under section 1 of the Theft Act 1978.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We need to send out a clear message that it is unacceptable to use deception if people have no legitimate reason, such as refugee status, to do so. If people are in transit through the United Kingdom and are using deception, that is a legitimate matter for concern. We have arrangements with other countries, and it is hoped that they assist us to ensure that people are not allowed to travel by using deception if they have no proper purpose in doing so.
<P>
If we discover that people are either in transit or seeking to enter the country by deception, it is right that we should have tough and effective remedies to deal with them and to prosecute them if necessary. I make no apology for being prepared to prosecute people who are deliberately breaking our laws and abusing our immigration system. As I have said, if such people can be dealt with by removal, it might not be necessary to prosecute them, but sometimes removal is not possible.
<P>
If people do not have a legitimate asylum claim or a legitimate right to remain under the immigration rules on exceptional or indefinite leave, it is right to have a provision to deal with those who deliberately break our laws. The clause will do that, and it will provide us with tough penalties. it is part of the firmer part of the Bill and we want to ensure that it forms part of the clear message that we want to send out: not only will we be fair and deal with people faster than at present, but when necessary--and it is sometimes necessary--we will impose criminal penalties on those who deliberately break our laws.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
False statements etc
<P>
Question proposed, That the cause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Clause 17 will extend the offence of making false statements under section 26(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1971 which provides that a person is guilty of an offence if, on examination under schedule 2 to the 1971 Act or otherwise, he makes or causes to be made to an immigration officer, or other person lawfully acting, in the application of that Act, a return, statement or representation that he knows to be false or does not believe to be true.
<P>
Clause 17 will extend the provision so that it covers such statements or representations made to people acting in the execution of certain subsequent immigration legislation. It will remain a summary offence punishable by a fine of not more than level 5 on standard scale, imprisonment for not more than six months or both. There will be some overlap in the offence provided for under clause 16, as there has been between section 2 6 (1) (c) and section 24 (1) (aa) which clause 16 replaces. However, we consider that it will remain useful as a less serious offence that does not require proof of the ultimate intention of falsehood.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Penalty for carrying clandestine entrants</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 459, in page 13, line 13, at begining insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Subject to subsection (1A) below.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 461, in page 13, line 25, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) The Secretary of State may specify that the nationals of prescribed countries are not to be regarded as clandestine entrants for the purposes of subsection (1) above.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now move on to part II of the Bill on carriers, liability. As hon. Members will be aware, the clause is a new development of the existing law on carriers, liability; it deals with the liability of carriers who carry clandestine entrants. It is important to bear in mind that we are not discussing the existing liability for airlines or ferry companies that run scheduled services. A liability is imposed on them for carrying passengers who do not have proper documentation. The clause covers liability for carriers, including lorry drivers, who unwittingly carry clandestine entrants to the United Kingdom who have concealed themselves in their vehicles.
<P>
The penalty that the Government propose is deeply unfair on carriers, including lorry drivers. We shall explore and examine that unfairness. On Second Reading, we said that this part of the Bill would require careful consideration. It is an unfair regime that has been put forward as a tough regime. In fact, it is a draconian regime that will be counter-productive.
<P>
The amendment would allow the Secretary of State to specify that certain nationals are not to be regarded as clandestine entrants for the purpose of the new regime of carriers, liability. Its aim is to probe exactly who might be a clandestine entrant for such purposes. The Government's intention is that the national of any country would be a clandestine entrant for the purposes of this part of the Bill. That is a little surprising, given what they said about the existing regime of carriers' liability when they were in opposition. At the time, the Labour party was extremely critical of carriers' liability when it was introduced under the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987 even though, at that time, many other countries including Canada, Australia, West Germany and the United States of America had passed similar legislation in respect of arrivals on scheduled services who did not have the proper documentation.
<P>
Labour Members criticised carriers' liability when it was introduced because it made no distinction between genuine and non-genuine refugees; it affected both alike. That is an important consideration in the context of the amendment. What the Labour party has said about that during the past 10 or 12 years is instructive. When carriers' liability was introduced in 1987, the then Opposition voted against it. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman), who was on the Opposition Front Bench, worked himself into a lather of indignation about the matter and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Ministers will not care. They have abandoned any standards of decency on this matter, at any rate until the general election is over."--[Official Report, 16 March 1987; Vol. 112, c.724.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Carriers' liability was played into the general election campaign by the remarks of the right hon. Member for Gorton, and that was the context in which he saw it. The then hon. Member for Battersea, Lord Dubs, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the House will agree, the key issue in dealing with asylum seekers is deciding who has a genuine claim."--[Official Report, 26 March 1987; Vol. 113, c.628.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
In 1992, on the Second Reading of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, no less a person than the then shadow Home Secretary, our present Prime Minister, dealt with that very point and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Many of my hon. Friends will deal with carriers' liability so I shall allow them to do so, but many people find it objectionable that no distinction is drawn between bogus and genuine claims. The liability remains regardless of whether the claim is bogus or genuine."--[Official Report, 2 November 1992; Vol. 214, c.43.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That brings me to the point of the amendment because, against that background, the present position of the Government is a little curious. Not only are they retaining the existing form of carriers' liability, but they are developing and making changes to it. Furthermore, they are now introducing a new form of carriers' liability that makes no distinction between bogus and genuine refugees at the point of entry and, as the amendment points out, no distinction between nationals of different countries.
<P>
The Government have said that developments in carriers' liability are now a vital ingredient of their policy. In last summer's White Paper, "Fairer, Faster and Firmer--A modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum", the Government said that the previous Government had got it wrong, not for introducing carriers' liability but for not doing enough and that they wanted to examine measures to ensure fuller compliance with the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act.
<P>
The Minister owes us an explanation, and he will have to say more than the Home Secretary did when he appeared before the Special Standing Committee. When I asked him about that, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"you are right to say that we opposed it. In opposition, we tried to learn from one or two of our mistakes"--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 22 March 1999; c. 478.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Minister owes us more of an explanation than that, especially given that as recently as 1992, the then shadow Home Secretary criticised carriers' liability on exactly the same grounds. When and why did the Government change their mind on carriers' liability? What led the Government to put to one side their objection to carriers' liability because it made no distinction between genuine and non-genuine cases? Why have the Government suddenly changed their mind? Did the then shadow Home Secretary, now the Prime Minister, get it wrong in opposition, or has something since been discovered that makes it inappropriate to discuss genuine and non-genuine refugees?
<P>
We have already heard in earlier debates accusations that Opposition Members have brass necks for having the cheek and audacity to discuss the subject. A Labour Member nods in agreement. However, there is an important difference between the existing and the new forms of carriers' liability, on which the amendment turns. The existing form of carriers' liability for scheduled airline services and scheduled ferry company services applies only to arriving foreign nationals for whom certain documents are required, in particular entry clearance. A Government can therefore pick and choose which nationals to bring within the ambit of carriers' liability by deciding which will be subject to visa requirements. At any time a Government can change the position in relation to carriers' liability and nationals of a particular country simply by imposing a visa requirement. When a visa requirement is introduced, carriers' liability applies to the nationals of that country. The previous Government did that in respect of several countries; the present Government did it in the case of Slovakia last year.
<P>
Under the new form of carriers' liability, will a foreign national of any country who is a clandestine entrant be subject to this regime? Does the new form of carriers' liability cover nationals of any country who enter as clandestine entrants under the definition of "clandestine entrant" in subsection (1)? Does the Bill contain a provision to allow the regime to be disapplied in the case of any nationality? Will the Minister reflect on that? Is he content that the Bill does not include a provision to disapply that form of carriers' liability in respect of any nationality? In drafting the provisions, have the Government considered the case--we certainly have a sombre background to this debate at the moment--of sudden, dramatic and terrible upheavals in other parts of Europe? I hardly need say much more about that against the background to the debate, and am sure that I do not need to spell it out any further. If, back in July, when the Government were drafting the Bill, they thought that the days of sudden upheavals in Europe belonged to the 1940s, and that the days of long lines of refugees making their way across countries and borders were gone, perhaps they were being slightly unrealistic about history.
<P>
The Committee may need to consider the evidence from Justice in its written submission. Human rights organisations are extremely critical of the provisions because of their effect on asylum seekers, and--for hauliers--their fairness and compliance with international human rights standards. That, too, must be carefully considered.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On the matter of human rights, Justice refers to the case of Nagy heard on 17 December 1998. In its written submission to the Committee, it states that in that judgement--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Court of Appeal held that asylum-seekers in imminent danger should be able to claim a defence of duress of circumstances to criminal sanctions. The Court pointed out that Anne Frank could have needed such a defence if she had stolen a car in order to escape safely from Amsterdam. By analogy, if she had hidden in a car boot, the driver could be said to have required a similar defence to any charge or penalty."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Government must consider carefully whether they want the Bill to provide blanket coverage, making nationals from every country subject to carriers liability, and whether they are content for the Bill to make no provision to disapply that blanket coverage. If so, whatever the circumstances, whatever fate turns up, whatever changes happen, the Government will have no way of disapplying the provisions of carriers liability.
<P>
The Minister must consider the matter carefully, and tell the Committee whether he has considered all the ramifications and whether he is content for the Bill not to have such a long-stop. It should not be too difficult, given present events, for the Government to focus firmly on what unexpected developments and sudden eruptions could happen in Europe. The Government must consider the carriers liability at the outset.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere has raised an important point. He referred to the situation in Kosovo, where all attention is now focused. A similar situation occurred in Bosnia, although that resulted in a steady stream of refugees rather than the flood of refugees that we have seen recently from Kosovo. Many of those who came from Bosnia took overland routes, which would have come within the scope of carriers, liability, and many of them were properly given asylum. It would be reasonable and sensible for the Government to say that they will not apply carriers, liability under the present circumstances.
<P>
Many of the general concerns about carriers, liability listed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere were to do with its deterrent effect on people properly seeking to claim asylum rights, and its acting as a barrier preventing them claiming asylum. However, that provision would, in some ways, be an improvement if the Government were to take the commonsense view and, if there were particular problems in a country, give a clear signal to the carriers that they did not intend to use the provisions of the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987 against them for so long as those conditions applied.
<P>
Taking such a view would help make what we believe to be a difficult provision slightly better. It would bring in a sort of inverse white list. In 1996, we had a white list of countries that were deemed to be totally safe. We shall be creating another sort of list if the provision comes into force that will list countries that are deemed to be so dangerous that people will be able to claim duress of circumstance, hop on to the back of a lorry to escape a such dreadful situations and claim their 1951 UN convention rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We are presently dealing with difficult issues. The Balkans is one, which is very obvious to us all, and we must bear that in mind when dealing with issues relating to the Bill. However, I shall make clear our view about the clause.
<P>
We do not accept the view now articulated by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, which is entirely different from the view of the Conservative Government in 1987. They did not disapply their provisions for carriers, liability to specific countries then, and did not follow the reasoning that the hon. Gentleman now suggests that we should use.
<P>
Clause 18(1) contains a definition of clandestine entry for which the civil penalty will be used. The definition does not discriminate between different nationalities of clandestine entrant, and the clause does not provide for the Secretary of State to discriminate in that way.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 459 and 461 would grant the Secretary of State a power to discriminate between nationals of different countries so that those from prescribed countries would be not be covered by the definition of a clandestine entrant in subsection (1). The Government do not want such a power. The amendment would provide scope for an arbitrary and divisive application of the civil penalty. It would also diminish its deterrent effect.
<P>
The amendment fatally confuses two important notions: the Government's commitment to maintaining strong controls over entry into the United Kingdom and our commitment to honouring our international obligations to asylum seekers. We intend to maintain firm and effective immigration controls at the United Kingdom's frontiers. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made the commitment in the Amsterdam treaty, which secured our legal basis for doing that. We have made sure that that commitment is recognised in European legislation; the previous Government did not do that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Let us consider the example of refugees from Kosovo. Unique attention has been given to the destruction of their identity documents and passports, which would otherwise enable them to apply for asylum. They are reduced to what my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere described as the "Anne Frank situation". Would not it be advantageous for the Minister to have permissive powers, which he could exercise in such circumstances, but would not be obliged to use if they were not required?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall consider Kosovo shortly. The hon. Gentleman's logic is incorrect; perhaps I shall be able to explain the reason for that.
<P>
The civil penalty that the clause introduces will form an important part of our controls and counter a significant weakness in them. Our obligations under the Geneva convention do not require us to facilitate the arrival of asylum seekers, most of whom have travelled through other European states that are as safe as this country before reaching the United Kingdom. If we decided to admit nationals from a specific country because of its circumstances, for example, Kosovo, we would do that by different means. We would not encourage clandestine entrants. That would be the only effect of the power that amendments Nos. 459 and 461 propose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let me deal with the Kosovan situation. It is important that I give a full answer on that. I shall then give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is currently being interviewed for television. He will announce that we have received a request from representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in London to take 120 women and children from a camp in Macedonia. Those people cannot be cared for adequately because the camps are overcrowded and some refugees have to move out to allow others in. NATO has handed over the camps to local control and refugees are worried about some of the circumstances there, and have asked to come here. Some refugees have relatives among the 10,000 Kosovans who live in the United Kingdom as asylum seekers or genuine refugees. People who are accepted as being genuinely from Kosovo are invariably recognised as refugees.
<P>
It is not right to encourage clandestine entry by Kosovans of anyone else. It is not right to encourage systems that do no good to the individuals concerned. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has asked the United Kingdom to co-operate by having a properly organised and documented system for dealing with refugees from Kosovo.
<P>
Too often it is the case that well-meaning, but perhaps not sensible, voluntary organisations, or well-meaning countries which accept groups of people coming out of Kosovo to facilitate their entry into other countries do not keep proper documentation. That means that when those refugees' children or relatives come out of Kosovo and want to find them they cannot do so because no one knows where they are.
<P>
The UNHCR has asked us to co-operate so that refugees are properly documented when they arrive from Kosovo. The refugees are received in camps and processed properly so that family links can be made, should their children, grandparents or other relatives subsequently arrive from Kosovo. There will be clear documentation of where people are going and the move from the camps to countries in which they will eventually be looked after--which, as I said, will include the United Kingdom--will be systematic and organised. People will be properly documented and the UNHCR and the Red Cross know where they are.
<P>
We have said that we are prepared to accept vulnerable people and those who already have contact with Kosovans already living here, of whom there are 10,000. We do not expect the movement of such people to be substantial in the immediate future, but we want it to be carefully organised by the UNHCR so that it does not cause problems. A provision such as that proposed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere may well be laudable. However, I fear that it would encourage people to seek a disorganised and improper means of entry. Such entry is 
unnecessary because we would obviously consider carefully reasonable requests from the UNHCR to accept certain Kosovans, as we have done by agreeing to accept 120 people seeking to come here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I agree with what the Minister says about the need to protect against clandestine entrants. However, we should not do that in a deeply unfair way. Is the Minister saying that he can cannot conceive of any circumstances in future in which there may be case for disapplying the provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In cases in which people are recognised as refugees under the current carriers liability legislation, the carriers are not fined or the fine is refunded. When the Bill's provisions come into force, we intend to continue to apply much the same policy as we do in relation to the current carriers liability legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister's point about existing carriers liability is completely different from what I said about the Government deciding whether to impose a visa requirement on nationals from a particular country, thereby bringing carriers liability into effect. Carriers liability in the Bill applies to all nationals and will always do so, as there is no provision to disapply it.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We can apply visa criteria to visa nationals. Should it be unnecessary for such people to have a visa, we are happy for them to come here, and we will deal with them at entry control. However, we are never happy for people to come here in the back of lorries, as 8,000 did last year. That is not something that we should encourage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I advise the Minister to be slightly careful about the figure of 8,000, because I heard the Home Secretary and the Foreign Secretary say the other day that Britain had already done its bit by taking 8,000 people from Kosovo.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We have accepted 10,000 people from Kosovo, and I am not sure that we have done our bit yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> No, already.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's--
