							<a name="07032748000351"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 179 and
180, which were tabled by me and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff,
Central, and to amendment No. 153, which was tabled by the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk and to which we have added our
names.</div>
					<a name="07032748000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the
first debate on part 6, so we are making good progress; indeed, I
anticipate that we might make such good progress that we will not be
here at the bitter end of the permitted time. The protection of
cultural objects is an important part of the Bill, even if it is quite
surprising to find it there. As was discussed in the House of Lords, it
is slightly odd to find a part of this Bill that is about museums,
galleries and works of art, but there is a link that justifies such
measures and their accommodation under the long title. It is about
whether people can enforce rights on cultural objects on loan in this
country, so there is a tenuous link to the Bill that allows its
inclusion&#151;the Bill is the next most convenient vehicle for
addressing the issue available to the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport.</div>
					<a name="07032748000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 129 sets
out what objects on loan to UK museums and galleries&#151;this is a
UK-wide provision; it is not just for England and Wales&#151;would
have protection when complying to certain conditions. The clause
contains five conditions that must be met for an object to be
protected, but amendment No. 179 suggests that there should be a sixth
condition.</div>
					<a name="07032748000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
all members of the Committee will be conscious that this part of the
Bill was significantly debated, discussed and, indeed, amended by the
Government in Grand Committee in the House of Lords. I wish to pay
tribute to my party colleagues, as will other hon. Members. Lord Thomas
and Lord Maclennan spoke for the Liberal Democrats in what was a
consensual and well informed debate, and Baroness Ashton was positive
about the representations that they made to get the balance right. I am
conscious that the clause has already been amended as a result of
debates in the House of Lords.
</div>
					<a name="07032748000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make four
short points. First, all hon. Members privileged enough to have great
museums or galleries in their constituencies are aware that they do a
fantastic job and that they have been still more able to do their work
as a result of the Government policy of making premier museums and
galleries free to the public. That will be one of the great legacies of
this Administration, whatever arguments we might have about other
matters. Those of us who go regularly to museums and galleries are very
proud of those jewels in the British cultural crown. We have the
opportunity to say how wonderful the museums and galleries in our
constituencies are, and I certainly wish to take that opportunity now,
as I would have done even if the director general of the Imperial War
museum had not written to me about the subject that we are debating.
The museum is almost within our sight&#151;it is housed in the old
Bethlehem hospital, the original bedlam, on the Lambeth road. It is a
wonderful museum and I commend it to members of the Committee who have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>not been there. I was privileged to be there again last week for the
90th birthday of Dame Vera Lynn and last Saturday for my surgery, which
I am kindly permitted to hold there on a regular
basis.</div>
					<a name="07032748000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
contribution of the great Imperial War museum is HMS Belfast, which is
also in my constituency. It provides a wonderful, well-used opportunity
for people to experience a real vessel that served this country during
the last war. The director general led on such issues on behalf of
museums and galleries until last year. He said, as have others, that he
and his colleagues are happy to comply with the changes made to the
Bill by the Lords, but that we must get the balance right and not have
too onerous a set of obligations that makes the ability to transfer
goods, property and objects of art across national boundaries more
difficult or actually stops it
happening.</div>
					<a name="07032748000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
definition, one of the great opportunities for all museums and
galleries is to show works of art that are not based in their
particular country. What brings in crowds in their greatest numbers,
whether to the Tate Modern or the National Gallery, is when an
exhibition shows the collected works of Velasquez, Rubens, David
Hockney or Gilbert and George. Such collections could comprise works by
one artist, from one period or of one type, or as in the case of the
Imperial War museum, works that demonstrate the effect of the holocaust
or the trenches in world war one. We must encourage the sharing of
cultural objects throughout the
world.</div>
					<a name="07032748000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">My noble Friend
Lord Maclennan of Rogart said that the best context in which to share
cultural objects throughout the world is organisations such as UNESCO,
which is based in Paris. Ideally, we need legislation that is
applicable in all countries rather than one country. Such a measure
needs a common legislative basis. I am not arguing that it should be
done through the European Union or in another way; of course, it should
be done nationally, but by agreement along the lines of the good work
of the Council of Europe and the United
Nations.</div>
					<a name="07032748000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point does not collide with the desire for protection if objects of art
are borrowed from abroad for temporary exhibitions. The wish to make
sure that works of art illegally stolen, looted or taken from their
owners at different times in history can be returned has obviously been
on the agenda here and worldwide. The most commonly argued case
concerns objects of art that were taken as a result of the Nazi
governance of Germany, the invasion of many European countries by
Hitler and the holocaust. It has been argued strongly that works of art
are still being looted from families and homes in Poland and elsewhere
which, if they reappear, must be returned to their rightful owners.
That applies not only to families who lost family members or relatives
in the terrible, terrible holocaust tragedy, but to countries that have
been subject to military invasions and the unauthorised taking of
property.</div>
					<a name="07032748000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments that were accepted by the other place and those before us
today are trying to strike the right balance. I am grateful,
as is my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central, to all those who
have made their views clear. We have taken account of what they said.
The specific condition in amendment No. 179 is that there
should be an ability and a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>requirement that those who import works of art temporarily lodge such
information with the Secretary of State in an official place within 72
hours of the works arriving here. We would therefore know what was on
loan in the United Kingdom, where it came from and</div>
					<a name="07032748000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the details of the object,
including its provenance and
ownership&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032748000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
straightforward effect of amendment No. 180 would be that when that
information was supplied to the Government, it would be published so
that everybody could see what was here at a particular time.
</div>
					<a name="07032748000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 153
applies to clause 131, which deals with &#147;Relevant museums and
galleries&#148; and defines which museums and galleries will be
covered by the requirements. We shall debate later other amendments
that would change that definition slightly. Clause 131 sets out both
how a museum or gallery will be defined and the criteria for approval
of those places as approved institutions. One of the conditions, set
out in clause 131(2)(a), is that there will be approved
procedures</div>
					<a name="07032748000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for
establishing the provenance and ownership of
objects&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032748000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall debate
later whether to keep clause 131(2)(b), which leaves it to the
Secretary of State to set out guidance, or insert something more
specific.</div>
					<a name="07032748000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 153, which is a joint Conservative-Liberal Democrat amendment,
would add the condition
precedent:</div>
					<a name="07032748000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
shall be a condition of such approval that any approved institution has
agreed to apply to each and every protected object the Due Diligence
Guidelines for Museums, Libraries and Archives on Collecting and
Borrowing Cultural Material published from time to time by the
Department of Culture, Media and
Sport.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032748000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">That suggests
that in order to tick the boxes and be an approved institution, a
museum or gallery should need to agree to apply due diligence
guidelines. There was a big debate in the Lords about having those
guidelines, and nobody disagrees that they should exist. The amendment
is about recognising the fact that they
do.</div>
					<a name="07032748000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point on
this group of amendments applies also to the later amendments to clause
129. It is important that we do not impose requirements that are so
impracticable, onerous or financially burdensome that they would make
the exercise of the provisions impossible and make it impossible for
objects of art to be transferred and shown. There is a big legal point
behind that: if somebody carries out due diligence and checks to ensure
that an object is an authentic work and is honestly owned and lent, a
later claim that needs to be pursued may still arise.</div>
					<a name="07032748000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The international community,
private owners, private galleries and people who have lost things that
belonged to them or their families, ancestors or community need as easy
a process as possible in international law for ensuring that they can
get their property back. We need easy legal processes and ways in which
goods can honestly be returned to people. That is a slightly different
exercise&#151;of course, there are links&#151;from ensuring that we
protect the transfer of works of art.</div>
					<a name="07032748000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everybody wants to see the
maximum possible number of works of art. We want them mounted, exposed
and displayed, not hidden away in basements, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>lockers, safes and vaults. We want them in the public domain to be
looked at, not in private houses where nobody can see them. As far as
that is possible, it is fantastic. Of course, we must ensure that if
something is discovered to be in the wrong hands there is as quick,
fair, uncomplicated and inexpensive as possible a process for
recovering it.</div>
					<a name="07032748000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that, at the end of our deliberations in Committee and downstairs, we
will get the balance right. We have been pretty well getting a
consensus and the amendments suggest what might be a final, small set
of adjustments to complete the process. I hope that the Committee is
positive about them, and I look forward to hearing what other hon.
Members have to say.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, Mrs.
Humble. I agree with what the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey said. I shall speak to the amendments standing in my name
and those of my hon.
Friends.</div>
					<a name="07032748000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman explained why it is important for Britain to remain the major
centre for world class exhibitions. He said that those exhibitions are
popular and important to London&#146;s cultural base because they
often draw pictures from around the world. He mentioned the Reubens
exhibition. I was fortunate enough to see the Renoir exhibition at the
National Gallery the other day, in which a number of Renoirs from
around the world had been collected
together.</div>
					<a name="07032748000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that there have been problems over the threat posed to some works of
art. In the debate in the other place and on Second Reading, a number
of examples were alluded to, including the loan of works of art by
Russia to Switzerland. Those works were seized on the basis of the debt
that Russia owed to Switzerland. Russia then made it clear to Britain
that unless immunity provisions were put in place, its museums would be
most unlikely to lend certain works of art to Britain.</div>
					<a name="07032748000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also heard about how a
gallery here was trying to borrow works of art from Taiwan. The works
were tainted, however, because the People&#146;s Republic of China
claimed that they had been given to Taiwan by the former Chinese
leader, Chiang Kai-shek, and therefore were rightly the property of the
People&#146;s Republic and not of
Taiwan.</div>
					<a name="07032748000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns were
therefore expressed, and I think that the Government were right to take
action. I certainly agreed with the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey when he asked whether provisions should be tacked on to the
Bill. In the long title, there is scope for such provision, but we do
not want to get into an argument about that. I would far rather have
had a dedicated Bill considered with real focus in both Chambers. We
could have had longer debates on all the important issues. Indeed, many
legitimate concerns have been expressed about this part of the Bill.
The Commission for Looted Art in Europe, the Board of Deputies of
British Jews and a number of academics have come up with various
comments about what we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>are doing. It is perfectly legitimate to argue that we are putting
Britain in a different position regarding the granting of immunity to a
number of other countries. It may be that other hon. Members would like
to discuss that
point.</div>
					<a name="07032748000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look at
some of the comments made by academics. I would like to quote Professor
Norman Palmer, who is an expert on the subject. He is emeritus
professor of the law of art and cultural property at University college
London and visiting professor of law at King&#146;s college London,
and more importantly, he was chairman of the illicit trade advisory
panel, chairman of a working group on human remains and museum
collections and a member of a spoliation advisory panel. He is still on
that advisory panel. Professor Palmer
said:</div>
					<a name="07032748000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
room for concern that the enhanced security of possession to be
conferred on borrowing museums by an anti-seizure statute could tempt
museums to become less vigilant in the monitoring of loans. Museums
might be inclined to think that, because no legal proceedings can be
taken against them during the loan period, there is no compelling
reason for them to make positive inquiries about the origins and
history of the objects they
borrow.</div>
					<a name="07032748000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">I believe that
such a development would be regrettable. It would subordinate ethics to
law and undo much of the good that has been achieved in recent
years.</div>
					<a name="07032748000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">Many third
party claims against museums involve spoliated objects. To deny a
Holocaust survivor access to justice is an austere and arguably
disproportionate response to the administrative, economic and cultural
concerns of lenders and borrowers, however legitimate those concerns.
The denial may be particularly distressing where the object is the only
tangible reminder of a lost family or home.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032748000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Those are strong words
indeed. Many other leading academics take a similar point of view. What
they are saying is that there is also a strong possibility that the
legislation amounts to a derogation from the UK&#146;s commitment not
to borrow or acquire Nazi-tainted art, as laid down in the 1998
Washington principles on Nazi-confiscated art. Those principles are
endorsed and adopted by the UK and by the 1998 NMDC&#151;National
Museums Directors Conference&#151;statement of principles and
proposed action on the spoliation of works of art during the holocaust
and world war two period.</div>
					<a name="07032748000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have rightly
looked at some of those concerns and made a number of amendments, so
one has to give praise where it is due. The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey pointed out that there had been changes to due
diligence procedures. There are changes in connection with the
publication on a public register of lists of objects to be borrowed
prior to their arrival in the country, and museums will be required to
publish that specified information for a set period. Five or six
amendments were made, but there are still a number of concerns. I
accept entirely that the Government have moved some way to acknowledge
the legitimacy of the concerns raised by a range of groups and
individuals. On the other hand, the amended Bill still leaves potential
claimants without the full protection that we feel they ought to have.
I should like to have a quick look at some of the areas of ongoing
concern, and then discuss specifically what we seek to do in our
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07032748000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
look first at due diligence. The Government have accepted that due
diligence should be carried out by museums, but it is not intended that
that will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>mandatory. That is a real concern, because there will be no continuing
oversight. Neither, in my judgment, is the regime of spot checks likely
to be effective. The Department for Media, Culture and Sport is
focusing on the run-up to the 2012 Olympics, and a huge amount of its
effort is going into ensuring that all aspects of preparation for the
Olympic games go according to plan. Is it going to have the expertise
and resources to ensure that the spot checks are carried out properly?
Would it not be better if due diligence were laid out clearly in the
Bill? I suggest that that would make
sense.</div>
					<a name="07032748000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
concerned about the publication of provenance and ownership
information. Let me explain why. Publication will provide a safeguard
only if it includes comprehensive information on an object&#146;s
history, identity and current ownership, such that a deprived owner is
able to recognise it. Where preliminary due diligence has persuaded a
museum that a loan should not go ahead, that too should be the subject
of full disclosure and proper
publication.</div>
					<a name="07032748000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
notice period, in order for potential claimants to be able to recognise
their property and express concerns, there must be a sufficient period
for them to do so, particularly as many potential claimants are likely
to live in different countries spread far and wide. The Government said
that they are minded to bring in a fairly short period, but we feel
that that is inadequate. The Government have now indicated that they
are looking at a two-month period. Opposition Members would submit,
however, that three months would be an appropriate period, given all
the obstacles and difficulties that any potential claimant is likely to
face and the fact that claimants will almost certainly be in different
far-flung
countries.</div>
					<a name="07032748000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to
identifying a stolen or looted work of art on the register, in order
for publication of a register of prospective loans to be meaningful,
there must be a formal procedure for registering claims and obtaining
further information and assistance regarding any claim from the DCMS
and institutions concerned. We feel strongly about that. It is also
important to bear it in mind that the DCMS has stated that if a serious
objection is raised during the notice period, an object that has
arrived in the UK and been granted immunity is unlikely to be included
in the relevant exhibition. I do not feel that that should be left to
the discretion of the museum. If an object has been the subject of
serious objections, saying &#147;unlikely&#148; is not good enough;
there should be no question of its being included in the
exhibition.</div>
					<a name="07032748000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On approved
status, the Government have addressed some of the problems by agreeing
that only certain museums and galleries will be able to benefit from
the legislation, but we are concerned that the Secretary of State will
not be obliged to withdraw approval if an approved museum falls well
short in its practice of due diligence. If the due diligence exercise
is not mandatory, all that the Government will be required to do is
consider the situation. There is too much flexibility in such an
arrangement, and I suggest that in such circumstances the Secretary of
State should have a duty to withdraw approval in order to ensure
compliance.</div>
					<a name="07032748000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments address many of our concerns. The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>
						has explained his amendments, and I should like
first to look at amendment No. 181, which would insert these
words:</div>
					<a name="07032748000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Due Diligence
Guidelines for Museums, Libraries and Archives on Collecting and
Borrowing Cultural Material published from time to time by the
Department for Culture, Media and
Sport&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032748000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Those
guidelines should be published by the DCMS, and they should appear in
the Bill. That is essential, for reasons that I have given. The spot
check concept will not be anything like strong enough.
Amendment No. 153 is linked to that. Although it applies
to clause 131, it is consequential. It would insert a new
subsection (2A), which again makes our point about due
diligence.</div>
					<a name="07032748000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 182 would insert these words at the end of clause
129(2)(e):</div>
					<a name="07032748000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(including
provenance and, if appropriate, ownership) on a public register for the
purpose of inviting any person who asserts a claim to that object to
raise an objection to its inclusion in the exhibition within a
specified period.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032748000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
that would make substantial sense, and it would go some way towards
correcting the problem that I identified
earlier.</div>
					<a name="07032748000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
187 would take out &#147;may&#148; and insert
&#147;shall&#148;. That, too, is self-explanatory. For the reasons
that I gave earlier, we should be more specific about what can and
cannot be done. Subsection (9) would be a great deal stronger if it
said that the Secretary of State &#147;shall&#148; make
regulations, rather than &#147;may&#148; make them. If the Bill is
to have real impact and bite, and serve the purposes the Government
intend, changing the language from &#147;may&#148; to
&#147;shall&#148; would make substantial
sense.</div>

						<a name="07032748000353"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I am sure that the
Minister thinks that we are being pedantic, but continual use of
&#147;may&#148; lends a sense of ambiguity to the Bill. Putting in
stronger wording reinforces the point and is very much in the spirit of
what the Government are trying to
achieve.</div>
					
					<a name="07032748000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032748000354"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I agree fully with my hon. Friend. As things
stand, we are looking at guidelines being put into regulations and at a
lot of secondary legislation. With much of this part of the Bill being
skeletal, we are looking at a great deal of scope being given to the
Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="07032748000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey pointed out, making
this part of the Bill work successfully is a balancing exercise between
the crucial need to ensure that London retains its eminent status as
the world&#146;s number one centre for culture and exhibitions and,
at the same time, the protection of the rights of individual families
who have suffered unspeakable grief, terror and violence, which are
beyond words. We have to respect and protect their rights as well.
Instead of relying on two Departments to get together cosily, to
liaise, to impose a regime of spot checks and&#151;possibly or
possibly not&#151;to make regulations, we are saying that the Bill
should state that the Secretary of State &#147;shall&#148; make
those
regulations.</div>
					<a name="07032748000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Flowing
from that &#147;shall&#148;, we have tabled amendment No. 188. I
will read out the entire subsection:</div>
					<a name="07032748000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Secretary of State
may&#148;&#151;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>
					<a name="07032748000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">under our proposal, the subsection would
say
&#147;shall&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07032748000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make
regulations requiring a museum or gallery to provide persons with
specified information about an object in specified circumstances (which
may include in particular compliance with conditions imposed by or
under the
regulations).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032748000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then we
would insert</div>
					<a name="07032748000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including
circumstances where a museum or gallery decides not to include an
object in an exhibition or where a lender withdraws
permission.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032748000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">That follows
on from the point that I made a moment ago.</div>
					<a name="07032748000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would also insert proposed
new subsection (9A), which is important and follows on from my earlier
points. It
states:</div>
					<a name="07032748000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State shall make
regulations&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032748000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">and then we
talk again about due diligence, which is vital. Amendment No. 153
brings the due diligence requirements and guidelines into clause
131.</div>
					<a name="07032748000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
I said, we could debate the matter for a long time. I accept that the
debate is partly on clause stand part, because we are talking about
general issues. Many of the amendments touch on a lot of different
aspects of the clause. All the organisations involved, which have been
extremely patient and given generously of their time to brief members
of the Committee, Ministers and shadow Ministers, are grateful to the
Government for the amendments that they have introduced. However, on
reflection, those organisations feel that the Government now need to
make some further concessions.</div>
					<a name="07032748000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						None of our
amendments is in any way going to cause excessive inconvenience to
galleries, museums and exhibitors. We are not in the business of
complicated rules and regulations, or of stifling the innovation or the
verve and panache shown by so many of this country&#146;s exhibitors.
They show that day in and day out, which is why they attract such
amazing exhibitions, not just to London but to other cities and
towns.</div>
					
					<a name="07032748000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032748000355"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> Again, I do not want to labour the point, but it
sounds to me, listening to my hon. Friend, that all he is trying to do
is to give some teeth to the moral and ethical guidelines laid down in
the statement by the National Museum Directors Conference. All we
trying to do is to give some bite, and not to have vagueness in the
language that the Government seem to be obsessed
with.</div>
					
					<a name="07032748000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032748000356"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but I would
not say &#147;bite&#148; or &#147;teeth&#148;, because that
sounds almost too aggressive. We are just trying to apply some clarity.
Everyone agrees that, for the arrangements to work properly and fairly,
they need to be clear and balanced. Our amendments give them that
clarity and balance and I see no reason why the Minister should not
accept them. She should certainly look at them positively and, if she
cannot accept them now, at least take our arguments away and come back
on Report.</div>
					
					<a name="07032748000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07032748000357"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): I find it rather difficult
to approach this subject after the other parts of the Bill. It requires
a bit of an intellectual leap to deal with the enforcement of the debts
of some of the most vulnerable people in society and then with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>works of art of quite staggering value. It is nevertheless important and
I understand why the Government have tacked the clause on to the Bill.
We just want to get it right. It would be a shame if we ended up with
legislation that was more lax than in other countries. It would be
worth while if the Committee took a few moments to consider what
happens in other
countries.</div>
					<a name="07032748000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
countries require full disclosure and publication of all information on
the loan and provide for claims to be made in a notice period prior to
exhibition. Immunity will not be conferred in many countries if a claim
is made within that notice period. In addition, in many cases, immunity
ceases if it is discovered that a work of art has been
stolen.</div>
					<a name="07032748000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In the United
States there is federal and state law. Under federal law there are
stringent conditions requiring full disclosure of all details of the
loan of works of art six months prior to any exhibition, without which
immunity will not apply. Details of that information include a copy of
the lending agreement, full details of the items being imported and a
statement giving information as to why anyone might want to attach the
property. Under state law, all states, except New York, provide for
immunity from civil claims. The protection does not apply where the
theft of the work of art from its owner is alleged and found proven in
court.</div>
					<a name="07032748000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Canada offers a
similar system to that in the US Federal Act and Canadian states
operate a similar system to that in the majority of states in the US.
In France, the Minister of Culture and the Minister of Foreign Affairs
issue a joint decree for each exhibition, listing the cultural objects
protected, determining the duration of a loan, and thus the protection,
and identifying the exhibition organisers. The decree may be challenged
by a third party within a period of two months&#151;we are talking
about a period of three months&#151;from the date of publication in
the <i class="I">Journal Offici</i>
						<i class="I">e</i>
						<i class="I">l</i>. Protection only becomes
effective if no claims are made within that two-month period.</div>
					<a name="07032748000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously in Germany and Israel
there are particular sensitivities which have already been alluded to.
German law provides for immunity from seizures, but prevents the sale
of an object on which immunity has been conferred. The law requires
that the work of art be returned to the place of origin. In Israel,
immunity will be conferred only on public, not on private lenders.
Immunity will not be conferred where there is no legal remedy for a
dispossessed owner in the country from which the loan
originates.</div>
					<a name="07032748000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly,
Switzerland has very strict rules. It requires that loan requests be
published in the federal bulletin, describing the cultural property and
its origin. People are entitled to claim ownership and such claims will
prevent immunity from being conferred on the object in question.
Switzerland also requires that the cultural property will be returned
to the contracting state of origin, following the conclusion of the
exhibition.</div>
					<a name="07032748000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Precise
and clear guidelines therefore exist in other countries. The amendment
tabled by my hon. Friend and the amendment proposed by the hon. Member
for North Southwark and Bermondsey are designed to tighten up certain
aspects of the rules and regulations. I entirely agree with my hon.
Friend. It is important that the guidelines are clear and on the face
of the Bill.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>
					<a name="07032748000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032748000358"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> As always, it is a delight to see you in the
Chair, Mrs. Humble. I shall simply address amendment No. 153
and then perhaps back up a couple of the points made by my hon. Friend
the Member for North-West Norfolk.</div>
					<a name="07032748000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">A rather significant
controversy surrounds this part of the Bill, as it balances the broad
issue of the public interest against personal loss. That is a difficult
balance to strike, and is not made easier by the fact that it is an
emotive subject for the many people who are affected by the looting of
works of art. I recognise the efforts that the Government have made to
meet the criticism that this aspect of the Bill received in the other
place. I support amendment No. 153, however, because there should be no
ambiguity about the requirement for due diligence. The best way to
remove ambiguity is to refer specifically to the guidance that already
exists from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It is
necessary to refer to it, because although the general principles are
in place, there is scope to tighten up on the details. I therefore ask
the Minister for her assurance that her ministerial colleague in the
DCMS will take this opportunity to review the guidelines.</div>
					<a name="07032748000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
injunction in the guidelines that museums should beware of fake
documentation, for example, does not inspire me with confidence in the
process of due diligence. It does not sound rigorous to me. My other
concern is that the threshold for establishing provenance is 1970, I
think, so no works of art that were acquired illicitly before that
date&#151;during the holocaust, for example&#151;will be caught by
the requirement for due diligence. I see the Minister shaking her head,
so perhaps she will correct me on that point. I am aware that the 1970
threshold is in line with the UNESCO convention. Perhaps she will
clarify the situation in respect of due diligence to be carried out on
works of art that were acquired before that date.</div>
					<a name="07032748000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Finally, I
concur with my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk that it is
questionable whether the Bill is compatible with the UK&#146;s
support for the principles that were laid down at the 1998 Washington
conference on holocaust-era assets. Furthermore, it undermines the
moral and ethical guidelines, with which I am particularly concerned.
They were laid down in the National Museum Directors Conference
statement of principle, and proposed action on the spoliation of works
of art during the holocaust and world war two. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07032748000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032748000359"></a>
								The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):
						</b> As everyone has said, the point of this part of
the Bill is to provide immunity against seizure of objects. I shall
come to the availability of other kinds of action, as mentioned by the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, presently. For objects that are
lent to the country from overseas for public display in a temporary
exhibition at an approved&#151;that is important&#151;museum or
gallery, immunity from seizure will apply where it is ordered by the
court in relation to civil proceedings, or by any law enforcement
authority that is seeking evidence in an investigation or to confiscate
the proceeds of crime. The absence of that kind of general immunity for
works of art lent to the country for inclusion in temporary exhibitions
has made museums and private owners increasingly reluctant to lend to
such exhibitions without a guarantee that their work will be
returned.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07032748000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk cited the examples that I would have cited, so I
will not repeat them. It is self-evident that this is a necessary
change. It is obviously desirable that we remain a major world centre
for artistic and cultural exhibitions, as we undoubtedly are. The two
Opposition Front Benchers spoke with feeling about our role in that
respect. They cited exhibitions that they enjoyed, so I shall pick my
favourite, which was the Degas, Sickert and Toulouse-Lautrec exhibition
at the Tate Britain. I thought that it was excellent and a tribute to
the curators, who not only assembled it from a variety of sources, but
arranged it comprehensibly and accessibly.</div>
					<a name="07032748000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have also recently attended
the Tate Modern. I cannot see how the legislation would apply to the
slides, which were the main exhibit, but they were none the less a
great deal of fun. I would also like to refer in passing to having
visited an exhibition of the works of Craigie Aitchison, who is a royal
academician. He is noted for having done a good number of crucifixion
scenes, and also for the fact that he incorporates&#151;he does so
even in those scenes, which is perhaps slightly curious&#151;his
favourite subject: Bedlington terrier dogs. As the proud owner of a
Bedlington terrier&#151;a dog who was Westminster dog of the year
only a few years ago, let me say&#151;it was a delight for me to meet
Craigie Aitchison and discuss the breed with
him.</div>
					<a name="07032748000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want,
any more than did the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey,
to miss an opportunity to mention my local museums in Redcar.
Kirkleatham Old Hall museum has permanent exhibitions relating to our
maritime history; the history of our steel industry; our earlier
history, from salt panning in the Tees estuary; and what I understand
to have been a powerful role played by local people in action linked to
the peasants&#146; revolt. I am very proud indeed that we were
rebellious even then. Redcar also had the first ever lifeboat in the
UK, and it is still in Redcar, exhibited in the Zetland Lifeboat
museum. However, at this time one must express one&#146;s
indebtedness not to the public authorities that run the museum, but to
the excellent volunteers who staff it for the significant benefit of
the citizens of Redcar.</div>
					<a name="07032748000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, this issue is very
important. We all cherish and value the displays that we are privileged
to see and it is a huge tribute to this Government that they are all
now available free of charge. That is very different from when the
Government of the party of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk were
in office, when people from the sort of social classes that I represent
in Redcar were quite unable to take their children to see exhibitions
of the kind that I and others have cited. We have to measure very
considerably the fact that that change has been made and it is fitting
that we should pay tribute in this Committee to that excellent policy
decision.</div>
					<a name="07032748000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make
specific reference to the need for balance. Clearly, we are all lauding
our own ability to enjoy all these works of art and cultural objects.
Equally, there are those who have suffered appallingly the depredations
of others, whose only link to a previous generation that was treated
scandalously and appallingly is through objects that were themselves
taken away, but can be rediscovered with appropriate diligence. It is
therefore clear that we have a major duty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>to ensure a balance in the provision and that we are neither too onerous
on the museums and the collections nor neglectful of the undoubted hurt
that still lies behind the issues that I have referred to. We must not
be the slightest bit neglectful of people&#146;s need to know the
origins of items that they suspect have come from their ancestors. We
must not be neglectful at all of the importance of ensuring that such
people have the information that they need to go through the process
that I have set out.</div>
					<a name="07032748000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that we have now got
the balance right in this legislation. Before going any further, I pay
tribute, as I think other Front Benchers have done, to the role played
in the Lords by Ministers, including Baroness Ashton, and by other
peers from all parties, who clearly applied themselves with great
diligence to addressing the kinds of concerns expressed about the
legislation. This part of the Bill is infinitely better as a result of
the participation of all parties, for which the Government are very
grateful. In particular, I would like to compliment Baroness Ashton,
who has given me a relatively straightforward job to do in this House
in connection with this part of the Bill. I would also like to pay
tribute to the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport,
the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy), who has played a
very important liaison role with all of the interested groups that have
been alluded to.</div>
					<a name="07032748000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk made a passing suggestion&#151;I
do not think that it was seriously persevered with&#151;that there
ought to be more time to debate the issue. Of course, he has the whole
of today to do so; do not let me tempt him, but if he wants to carry
on, there is absolutely nothing to prevent him from doing so. I think
that he was really just having a general prod at something or other,
rather than seriously suggesting that there has not been abundant and
ongoing consultation and debate that can continue on
Report.</div>

for us to focus so exclusively when we were talking about setting up
operations such as tribunals and

								Vera
Baird:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that pointer to what
he was suggesting. There was significant reference to this aspect of
the Bill on Second Reading and much attention has been focused on it by
all relevant interested parties. The Government have, as I have
indicated, been very responsive to all that. It would not have been
sensible to wait for another legislative vehicle when we needed to
ensure that Britain remained important for the exhibition of cultural
and artistic objects. We published a consultation document as long as a
year ago and have worked diligently to ensure that everybody who needed
to be asked and have their views heard has been consulted. I am
grateful for the support of officials from the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport, who have helped me understand and take on the
matter.</div>
					<a name="07032748000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am well
aware that the Board of Deputies of British Jews has been interested in
this topic. Baroness 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>Ashton has met Lord Janner of Braunstone, the primary spokesman for that
body, and I, too, have met him to discuss his concerns. So far have the
Government gone to seek to please and satisfy, and remove all stress
and anxiety expressed from that quarter that we have given a copy of
this speaking note to that body to ensure that it covers all the areas
about which it has hitherto been concerned. We have not heard back to
suggest that it does not cover all appropriate areas, so I feel that
there is a broad element of support for the balance that the Government
have been able to
strike.</div>
					<a name="07032748000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before moving
to the substance of the amendments, the hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk talked about legal proceedings not being available. Of course,
legal proceedings may be brought, notwithstanding the immunity, which
applies only to the item itself. For instance, during the loan period
actions for damages could be brought. No museum will want to be sued
for the value of a looted work of art, so there will be a powerful
driver to ensure that museums observe due diligence as required under
the legislation. We go a step further back in the application of those
due diligence provisions than is proposed by Opposition Members, in
that a museum cannot be approved unless it can demonstrate that it
carries out appropriate due diligence. Those points needed making in
relation to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
speech.</div>
					<a name="07032748000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also spoke about a formal procedure to register claims and
receive further information. We will consider the circumstances in
which further information should be provided by museums. The power
given to the Secretary of State to make regulations under clause 129(9)
would permit such a procedure to be established. We will explore that
point in consultations with museums and all interest groups. I hope
that he has no more fears along those
lines.</div>
					<a name="07032748000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not right
that guidelines need to be published in the Bill. In the same way in
which we attained a balance between the interests of museums and those
of the other interest groups, we have attained an appropriate balance
between what is in the Bill and what, for flexibility&#146;s
sake&#151;including, for example, the need for revision and updating
from time to time&#151;ought to be in delegated
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07032748000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Newbury mentioned other countries&#146; rules. I could
provide a different list of other countries&#146; rules to counter
what he said&#151;alleging, I think, that our rules are a little bit
on the soft side&#151;but I will write to him rather than detain the
Committee with factual
examples.</div>
					<a name="07032748000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Braintree wanted the Government to undertake to review the
guidelines. We appreciate the need to add to the current guidelines,
and that is why we are not referring solely to them. We made it clear
that the principles in the guidelines apply to Nazi-era objects, so the
hon. Member for Braintree need not fear the 1970 threshold.</div>
					<a name="07032748000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am grateful
for the amendments as they allowed us to reconsider the matter, but
they do not strengthen the position of potential claimants in
comparison with our provisions. Clause 129(2) makes it clear that
protection under this part of the Bill will be conditional on museums
and galleries complying with the requirements for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>publication of specified information about the objects that they propose
to borrow, as we will set out in
regulations.</div>
					<a name="07032748000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
engage in full consultation with all relevant interest groups on the
content of the regulations, which we will publish in draft form. We
have already made it clear that subject to consultation we propose to
require museums to publish details about the objects that they intend
to borrow two months before the start of an exhibition. That compares
favourably with other countries; in Switzerland the period is only 30
days and in the United States, under the federal system, it is six
weeks before importation. Amendment No. 179 would mean that the
information did not need to be published until 72 hours after the
object reached the United Kingdom, which would not give potential
claimants any significant opportunity to raise their concerns before
the object reached the
UK.</div>
					<a name="07032748000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulations
will also say how information about an object should be published. It
is clear from clause 129 that the information required from
museums must be published, so amendment No. 180 would add nothing. We
will seek to ensure that the information is made as available as
possible to as many people as
possible.</div>

Mrs. Humble, I will leave my hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, Central to wrap up the debate, because I am required to be on
duty in the abbey at 12 noon. I wanted to wait until the Minister had

					<a name="07032748000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 182 is also
unnecessary; it would not strengthen the provisions. We intend to
require museums to publish sufficient information about an object to
ensure that it can be identified by anyone who might have an interest
in it. That will require the publication of some information about
provenance, but it is unnecessary for the full provenance of an object
to be published in every case. For example, a 17th century painting
acquired by the Metropolitan museum of New York in the 19th century had
remained in the Met&#146;s collection since its original acquisition.
Publication of the full provenance of that painting between the 17th
century and its acquisition by the Met would not assist potential
claimants to objects or art looted or stolen at any other
time.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032748000364"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> My experience of art is that the early
provenance of these paintings is usually very well documented, and
listing full provenance would not be a burden. We are concerned about
items, particularly associated with the Nazi holocaust, that may have
been passed around different parts of Europe in the years after the
last war. Focusing on that part of an object&#146;s provenance is
very important, but I would not have thought that seeing it in the
context of the wider provenance would be a
problem.</div>

To put in place onerous requirements as to provenance, in a situation
of the kind I have just set out, would not be of any assistance to
potential claimants looking for objects looted during the Nazi era or
stolen at any other time within memory. The amendment seems to us to
put the balance too heavily in that direction.</div>
					<a name="07032748000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will also propose to require
publication of the identity of the lender in advance of the exhibition,
where the lender is a public body. More difficult issues arise in
relation to the publication of the identity of private owners. We will
need to discuss with museums and other interest groups whether and how
it will be possible for that information to be made available to
potential
claimants.</div>
					<a name="07032748000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 187 would require&#151;that is the difference&#151;the
Secretary of State to make regulations to oblige museums and galleries
to provide further information about an object in specified
circumstances, but it may be possible to require all relevant
information about a protected object to be published in advance of the
exhibition when it would be most useful to potential claimants.
Obviously, the earlier the better. In that case, the power would not be
necessary. If consultations demonstrate that it is not appropriate for
some information to be given general publication but that it could be
provided to anyone concerned about a particular object on request, the
power will be used in that
way.</div>

						</b> Before the Minister moves on, I do not feel
that she did amendment No. 187 justice. We want to replace
&#147;may&#148; with &#147;shall&#148;, so that the provision
read &#147;shall make regulations&#148;. We are talking about
general regulations here; as I understand it, they are not specific.
Surely it makes sense for the Secretary of State to be forced by the
Bill to make those regulations, rather than having the option of doing
so. Perhaps she can go into more detail.</div>
					
					<a name="07032748000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032748000367"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> I think that I have given the hon. Gentleman a
satisfactory answer. I think I can say without fear of contradiction
from any quarter that the Secretary of State will make regulations in
connection with that matter and I hope that that satisfies him and his
colleagues. The Secretary of State will make regulations&#151;there
is no difficulty about that. It is imperative that he does. We see no
purpose, therefore, in a heavier provision as proposed in
amendment No.
187.</div>
					<a name="07032748000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I turn to
amendment No. 188, which we say is not directly relevant to the Bill?
The only objects that will be protected here are those which come to
this country. Objects that are not included in an exhibition because of
the decision of the borrowing museum or of the lender will not
be protected. Their position is not changed by the Bill. Clause 129
requires at subsection (2)(d) that an item</div>
					<a name="07032748000124"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is brought to the United Kingdom
for public display in a temporary exhibition&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032748000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">and at subsection (7)(a) that an item
continues to be here for the purposes of</div>
					<a name="07032748000126"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;public display in a temporary
exhibition at a museum or gallery&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>
					<a name="07032748000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once it ceases to be here for that
purpose, it will not be protected. It will have exactly the same status
as it had before. The amendment does not help, therefore. The position
is not changed in any way by the Bill and it is not appropriate to make
provision requiring museums to provide information on such items in the
Bill or in regulations made under the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07032748000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let me turn
to the amendments on due diligence, which are to be imposed on approved
museums and galleries. Amendment No. 153 deals with approval but, as
drafted, clause 131(2) already requires the approving authority to take
account of the extent to which the institution applying for approval
already complies with the due diligence guidelines referred to in the
amendment. Museums will also need to show that they comply with that
guidance. I make it clear that no museum and no gallery will be
approved unless it can show that it meets the high standards set in
those guidelines.</div>
					<a name="07032748000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not necessary to provide that the guidelines are applied to each and
every protected object, as under amendment No. 153, or to make the
immunity for a particular object conditional upon compliance with the
guidelines, as under amendment No. 181. It is one of the basic
principles set out in the due diligence guidelines published by the
DCMS, that a museum should not acquire or borrow any item unless it is
satisfied that there are no legal or ethical doubts about that item.
That means that a museum will have to apply the due diligence
guidelines to every item that it wishes to borrow. Failure to do that
will amount to a failure to comply with the guidelines. As clause
131(3)(a) makes clear, that would threaten the approved status of the
museum.</div>
					<a name="07032748000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
189 would require provision to be made for the establishment of a new
statutory body. That is not necessary. Non-statutory bodies such as the
spoliation advisory panel and the reviewing committee for the export of
works of art play a valuable role in carrying out a similar function to
that proposed for the new body.</div>
					<a name="07032748000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DCMS will be working
closely with an independent body, the Museums, Libraries and Archives
Council, to ensure that the Secretary of State has access to
appropriate advice on the due diligence procedures followed by museums
seeking approval and that, following approval, museums' due diligence
procedures and their compliance are subject to appropriate monitoring.
We will be exploring the possibility of seeking advice from independent
experts. </div>
					<a name="07032748000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry
that this has taken a while to set out. However, I think that it was
appropriate, because of the long history of concern, consultation and
negotiation about the provisions, to set out why we think that we now
have the balance right, and the way we have got it right. Although we
are grateful for these probing amendments, they do not strengthen the
provisions, which we feel represent the best balance that can be
attained. With those words, I invite hon. Members not to press their
amendments.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>significantly, but I do not agree that it is unnecessary to strengthen
subsection (9). I am not satisfied with the explanation about that and
we may want to return to the matter on Report.</div>
					<a name="07032748000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We understand
what the Minister said about our other amendments. She explained in
some detail that amendment No. 182 does not add extra strength to the
rights of any claimants. With regard to the provisions on due
diligence, she made the point that clause 131(3)(a) already provides
protection. However, we explained the arguments. We went into a lot of
detail. Due diligence should not be left to the guidelines and the
rather vague wording of that subsection. That is why we feel strongly
that amendment No.153 would give that extra strength. I reserve the
right to come back to that on Report and possibly even have a vote. I
am tempted to have a vote now but the hon. Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey has had to go to Westminster abbey for the service on
the abolition of slavery, and there is no point in having a vote and
losing it very heavily. On Report, I hope that we might persuade a

Baird:</b> Under the current drafting, an object is entitled to
protection if it complies with the conditions when it enters the UK.
Subsection (4) provides for the continuation of that protection if two
further conditions are met. The amendments would add a further
condition to make an object&#146;s ongoing protection conditional on
its continuing to comply with all the conditions in the clause
throughout its stay in the UK. I have a note that says, &#147;This
amendment is confused&#148;&#151;but I am not going to read that
out.</div>
					<a name="07032748000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
conditions that might change over the period of the exhibition are the
ownership of the objects and possibly their usual keeping place.
However, if an object is returned either to a new home or the
owner&#146;s residence in the UK, it will no longer be protected
anyway, and could be seized. I suppose that the underlying concern is
that it is wrong to let objects change ownership when they are in the
UK, but we do not think that it would be practical to monitor that. It
is most likely to affect private lenders&#151;public lenders are
unlikely to dispose of objects in their collection, but a private owner
wishing to sell his property to another owner overseas would not be
obliged to tell the museum anyway and so we would have no way of
discovering such
information.</div>
					<a name="07032748000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legality of importing such objects into the UK is most appropriately
tested when they enter. The fact of whether a museum published the
required information two months in advance will not change during the
exhibition. Of course, as I think that I said on the last group of
amendments, if an object ceases to be in the UK for public display in a
temporary exhibition, its protection ceases as well, unless damage has
been caused in the UK and repairs are needed before it goes
home&#151;as a rule, I think that that would be pretty unlikely. I am
not criticising Opposition Members for the confusion, but I hope that I
have satisfied them that there is no need to add those
amendments.</div>

					<a name="07032748000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A new
period of protection begins each time an object enters the United
Kingdom and the conditions in subsection (2) are
met.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032748000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think it
extremely unlikely that an object will come back into the UK after
coming here for an exhibition. I suppose that it is just possible. For
example, if there were a Monet exhibition in London, the painting in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>question might go back to where it had come from and then perhaps might
return to the UK shortly afterwards. However, that is pretty
unlikely.</div>

noon</div>
					<a name="07032748000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
185 would add to subsection (6). Under the amendment,
there</div>
					<a name="07032748000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must be at least
three months between each period of protection&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032748000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is fair enough. The painting in
question would go back to its owner or the gallery where it was
normally on display, and it would be three months before it could be on
loan again in the UK. It is most unlikely that such a state of affairs
would arise, but let us assume that one such picture was in some way
tainted. That would give the claimants some extra protection. The extra
time is important.</div>
					<a name="07032748000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 186 would add
another proviso,</div>
					<a name="07032748000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the total period of protection shall not exceed 36 months in any period
of five years.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032748000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, it
is most unlikely that such a situation would arise, but legislation
needs to allow for all eventualities, and we would not be diligent or
assiduous in our role as legislators or parliamentarians if we were not
prepared to look for unexpected eventualities. The eventuality provided
for by the amendment would be highly unexpected, but the idea is that
within a period of five years there should not be more than 36
months&#146; protection in total. That is fair and generous and gets
the right balance, which is what the provisions are all
about.</div>
					<a name="07032748000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
discussion on Second Reading about what would happen if a work of art
that was on exhibition in this country were to be sold to a new owner
while it was here. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark
Fisher) raised the point, and there was some to-ing and fro-ing at the
time, but I should be grateful if the Minister made things clear. Is it
100 per cent. clear to her that if a work of art were sold while it
enjoyed the relevant immunity, the immunity would be removed at the
point of sale, when the contract had effect? Alternatively, as some of
the organisations that have advised us believe, would the immunity
continue?</div>

						</b> I understand the intention behind amendments Nos.
185 and 186&#151;that it should not be possible to get protection
under the Bill indefinitely by bringing an object to the UK for the
maximum period of 12 months, taking it away for a day and then bringing
it back. However, the amendments are not necessary. Clause 129(4)
already provides that the protection can continue only for 12 months,
except in the case that I have already explained of an object that,
having been damaged in the UK, is having that damage repaired in the
UK.</div>
					<a name="07032748000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only objects
that will be protected under the provisions&#151;this is a
feet-on-the-ground point, I suppose&#151;are those brought to the UK
for the purpose of a temporary exhibition at an approved museum or
gallery. Museums will want to borrow only objects that are relevant to
the theme of their exhibition. It would not be practical or
possible&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman accepted that it would
not be practical&#151;for an owner to ensure that there was a
succession of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>temporary exhibitions at approved museums on a theme that married up
with the nature of his cultural object, so that those museums would, in
sequence, borrow his work of art and secure its indefinite protection.
Nor would I have thought that any lender would be prepared to subject
his property to constant travel out of the UK to ensure its
protection.</div>
					<a name="07032748000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks, a work of art could not be
taken from exhibition to be sold in the UK; if it were, the protection
would cease. It could be sold by private treaty to a new owner. We
would not necessarily know that it had been sold. The protection would
continue until it was returned from the exhibition to the
owner.</div>

right that immunity would be withdrawn if the sale were

picture, work of art or cultural object in question were auctioned and
a public sale were announced to the Inland Revenue, for

public display in a temporary exhibition. If it is taken away to be
auctioned at Sotheby&#146;s for tax purposes, the fundamental
conditions have been broken. If I find that that is incorrect, and that
there is a loophole of the kind that the hon. Gentleman is anxious

Baird:
						</b> It seems wise to move that the clause should stand
part, as it is an important and heavily debated part of the Bill. It is
also relatively short. Clause 130 clarifies the extent of the
protection that will be given to objects and sets out the single
exception that we propose where immunity will not apply.</div>
					<a name="07032748000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The immunity
that we propose will prevent any order being made in civil proceedings
that would affect the custody or control of the object. It will not be
possible, for example, for a court to order seizure of the object as a
form of interim relief or in execution of a judgment debt. Nor will it
be possible for an object to be seized in criminal proceedings, or as
part of a criminal investigation. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>
						There will, however, be an exception to the immunity
where seizure is required under the UK&#146;s obligations in
international law or in European Union law. Perpetrators of crime will
not be able to hide behind immunity from seizure. As subsection (2)
makes clear, the protection given will only apply to the object and
will not protect people dealing with it from prosecution if they have
committed an offence.</div>
					<a name="07032748000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our proposals will prevent
potential claimants from having a work of art seized in this country
until their claims have been decided. However, that only removes one
form of relief from such claimants. As I have said, it is still
possible for claims of damages to be made against any person or
institution whose dealings with the object have contravened the
claimant&#146;s rights to it, and for a full trial to be held of all
the relevant issues.</div>

					<a name="07032748000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
discussed clause 129 earlier.</div>
					<a name="07032748000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 190 would add to
subsection (3) after the word &#147;particular&#148; the condition
that the authority &#147;must withdraw approval&#148;. In other

					<a name="07032748000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may withdraw approval from an

					<a name="07032748000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">That relates to
procedures that an institution has in place for due diligence and for
exhibiting works of art or cultural objects from abroad. It would apply
if there had been a warning. We did not discuss spot checks carried out
by the DCMS, and my concern about their not being adequate, at any
great length earlier, and the Minister did not comment on them. The
amendment relates to cases in which a warning has been made by the DCMS
and there has been no action on
it.</div>
					<a name="07032748000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 192

					<a name="07032748000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I dare
say that to some extent the amendments would really have come into play
had our amendment No. 153, which was in a previous group, been accepted
and had the Minister accepted that due diligence should be covered in
the Bill. We shall return to that point, but even without amendment No.
153 these amendments would not place onerous burdens on a gallery or
exhibition organiser. We are simply saying that if they have been asked
to improve their procedures and have not done so, if they have been
guilty of a failure in their procedures, and if they have not done what
they said they would do, there should be some tightening up so that it
is possible for approval to be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="07032748000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
allows the Department to withdraw approval from an institution, but we
feel that it is too laxly drafted. The amendments would tighten it up
not hugely but significantly. In the light of representations that have
been made to us, it is not unfair to ask the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>Minister to consider the amendments and, if she does not accept them, at
least to explain why she believes the clause to be
adequate.</div>

to the power that the appropriate authority is given under subsection

specifying in particular whether it thinks that the
institution&#146;s procedures for establishing provenance or
ownership are inadequate because of its failure to comply with the
Secretary of State&#146;s guidance, or for any other reason, or the

failure having received a warning from the appropriate authority
specifying a reasonable time
frame&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032748000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
pause there, because amendment No. 193 is a little different. Again, we
sympathise very much with the amendments, but we do not think that it
is necessary, and possibly not practical, to limit the discretion given
to the appropriate authority in subsection (3) in the way that the
three amendments would do.</div>
					<a name="07032748000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State is
required to act reasonably and proportionately in exercising any
discretionary power, and that applies to the power in subsection (3) as
much as to any other. Removal of approved status in the cases set out
in paragraphs (a) and (b), without sufficient warning, or giving a
reasonable time to a museum to rectify faults that have been identified
but may not have been 100 per cent. rectified, could be regarded as
acting unreasonably in a case where the continuing failure could still
be rectified in relation either to due diligence or the provision of
information.
</div>
					<a name="07032748000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, we will
none the less keep the power to act without notice in any case where it
can be justified, such as where such an action would be reasonable and
proportionate, as we are required to behave. We want museums to know
that, when they have approval under these provisions, and they decide
that it is no longer necessary to carry out due diligence, there is a
risk that their approved status will be removed with little or no
warning. We want them to know that we have that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>
						power. However, we think that there is an element of
over-prescriptiveness here, and that we have to act reasonably and
proportionately in the exercise of the power under subsection (3). We
prefer, overwhelmingly, to leave the subsection as it
is.</div>
					<a name="07032748000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
amendment No. 193, which is a little different. We considered carefully
whether the removal of a museum&#146;s approved status should also
entail the removal of protected status from any object on temporary
exhibition at the museum on that date. We concluded that that was not
practical. There would be considerable scope for dispute as to whether
the decision to borrow a particular item was due to inadequate due
diligence on the part of the museum, and it would not be clear under
the amendment which objects were entitled to immunity and which were
not. Lenders would be reluctant to make loans, as they would see such a
provision weakening the value of the immunity, because they could not
be given a guarantee that their objects would be
returned.</div>
					<a name="07032748000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The efficacy
and effectiveness of spot checks was raised by the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk. We see spot checks as one means, but only one
means, which we will most definitely use to police, as it were, the way
that museums and galleries behave under these provisions. However, we
intend to explore with the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and
others to see how else we might enforce the requirements on due
diligence and information. Spot checks will not be the only way forward
if other realistic proposals are made to the Government during the
consultations that we will hold on regulations. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman is reassured enough not to press the
amendments.</div>

Administrations that it carries out strict due diligence checks on the
objects it proposes to borrow. In assessing museums, the Secretary of
State will look closely at a museum&#146;s procedures for
establishing the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>
						provenance and ownership of objects, and the extent
to which it complies with the guidance on such procedures that will be
published by the DCMS from time to
time.</div>
					<a name="07032748000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we discussed
earlier, subsection (3) will allow the Secretary of State to withdraw
the approved status of a museum at any time if it becomes apparent that
it is not maintaining sufficiently high standards of due diligence.
Subsection (4) ensures that objects in an exhibition that are protected
under the provisions will not lose that protection if an institution
loses its approved status during the period of the
loan.</div>

Bellingham:
						</b> It may be an appropriate time at which to ask
the Minister these two questions. First, the issues of exhibitions,
loans and the granting of immunities are presumably devolved to the
Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland
Assembly, which we very much hope will be given an injection of life in
the coming few weeks. What happens if the devolved institutions do not
introduce legislation? Is there a possibility that that might happen,
and if so, will it create problems?</div>
					<a name="07032748000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, going back to a
matter that we discussed earlier, to what extent will there be ongoing
consultation between the Minister and her colleagues at the DCMS? Is
she satisfied that protocols are in place to ensure that officials from
the two Departments will work together closely? I do not see how this
part of the Bill will fulfil its purposes when enacted, or that it will
be fit for purpose, if the two Departments are unable to work together
closely on an ongoing basis and in a properly resourced way. Perhaps
she will provide some comfort on those
points.</div>

no difficulty between the two Departments. I cannot comment on whether
there is a formal protocol, but it is clear that officials within the

						</b> The amendment would require the Lord Chancellor or
the Secretary of State&#151;it is the same person&#151;to consult
any interested parties before making orders under the clause. In fact,
to return to the question of the Secretary of State and the Lord
Chancellor, when I look more closely, I think that we are referring to
the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. That is why there is
what looks like a double reference, and I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for pointing that out, as I did not grasp the point. That is
the answer to that
problem.</div>
					<a name="07032748000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
a safety net that is intended to ensure that the Bill can be
effectively implemented. It supplements the rest of the provisions and
can be used only alongside one of those provisions, including specific
order-making powers. As hon. Members are well aware, a detailed policy
statement has been published. That explains how the order-making powers
in the Bill would be used and sets out our commitment to extensive
consultation when we use those
powers.</div>

cause for concern. If she did not understand what was in the Bill,
surely the public will not do so, so it would be appropriate
to have some clarification on the point about the Secretary of

						<b class="B"> </b>I appreciate that the Minister has
verbally given that explanation. Perhaps I am a novice who needs these
things explained, but given that the reference to the Secretary of
State is ambiguous, notwithstanding that she has told us to whom it
refers, should there not be a closer definition in the Bill? That is
what I was asking.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032748000403"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> We might change the name, but then we would be
stuck with an inappropriate appellation in the Bill. The real point is
that clause 103 introduces measures on behalf of the Insolvency
Service, which is part of the Department of Trade and Industry. The
purpose of allowing both Secretaries of State the power is to cover
that provision, but it is the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
who is referred to in clause 140.</div>
					<a name="07032748000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The detailed
policy statement that we published sets out how the specific
order-making powers, to which these are ancillary and supplementary,
will be used. It says unambiguously, as I am now doing, that we will
consult extensively when we use the order-making powers. The proposed
amendment would require consultation for literally every consequential
or transitional order made under clause 140. That could be hugely
resource intensive and would not give much positive benefit, so we
could not dream of agreeing to it. There are effective and
proportionate safeguards in the clause to ensure that any order
amending or repealing an Act has to be approved by both
Houses.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>
					<a name="07032748000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that reassurance,
and our unambiguous statement that we will consult where appropriate,
as we have said in the policy document, are sufficient to persuade the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk not to press the
amendment.</div>

Chapter 3 of Part 5, only, the Secretary of

					<a name="07032748000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">We often talk
about the Lord Chancellor or the Secretary of State in the context of
the Department for Constitutional Affairs, because they are one and the
same person. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree raises a
good point, however, and we need clarification in the Bill, although I
take on board the Minister&#146;s point. We keep hearing that, should
the current Chancellor of the Exchequer ever become Prime Minister, one
of his first moves could be to scrap the DTI, so if we inserted a
reference to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, it could be
obsolete pretty quickly. Perhaps we should insert the words &#147;the
relevant Secretary of State&#148;, however, which would immediately
lead anyone reading the Bill to conclude that neither the Lord
Chancellor nor the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs were
being referred to. Will the Minister therefore consider tabling an
amendment on Report to insert the word &#147;relevant&#148; before
&#147;Secretary of
State&#148;?</div>

it is plain enough that, since we are talking only about chapter 3 of
part 5 and the relevant Secretary of State is consequently the head of
the Department of Trade and Industry, that is who we are talking about.
I am helpfully prompted to survey, as I shall indeed do shortly, every
clause in the Bill, as I am told that it always refers to the Lord
Chancellor when we mean the Lord Chancellor, and never calls him the

					<a name="07032748000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
am grateful to you, Mrs. Humble. This is the last time that
I will trouble the Committee this morning and perhaps even today. The
new clause would extend the scope of ombudsmen in various ways. I refer
the Committee to a report published by Lord Justice Woolf in 1996. He
recommended that the relationship between ombudsmen and the courts
should be broadened, enabling issues to be referred by ombudsmen to the
courts and by the courts to the ombudsmen, obviously with the consent
of all those involved. That makes sense. The new clause would remove
some of the impediments that are currently in place. Obviously, the
impediments&#151;the tight rules&#151;were put in place to ensure
that ombudsmen did not trespass on or usurp the jurisdiction of courts
or tribunals. Over time, developing case law has narrowed the
discretion of ombudsmen in a way that has been seen to present them
with severe difficulties and has created some injustice for
complainants. This is quite an arcane point, but it is important. We
have plenty of constituents who come to our surgeries and advice
centres and complain about various matters, either local or national,
and want us to refer them to the ombudsman. When it comes to the
parliamentary ombudsman, the MP has to endorse the complaint before it
can be referred. Many of us have been put in the invidious position of
deciding whether to sign up to a complaint. I think that most of us, to
keep the peace, tend to go along with what the constituent wants on the
basis that if that is what they feel needs doing, we should support
them.</div>
					<a name="07032748000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Very often,
cases go to an ombudsman when a concurrent legal case is under way.
Having looked at the way in which case law has developed&#151;I do
not want to go into a long discussion about it now&#151;I think that
we need to follow Lord Woolf&#146;s suggestion and broaden the
relationship between the ombudsmen and the courts. That means that the
issues can be referred either way.</div>
					<a name="07032748000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause has the support
of the head of the administrative court, Mr. Justice
Collins, and the senior president of tribunals designate, Lord Justice
Carnwath. That is quite an endorsement. In the spirit of good will,
given that lunch is pending and the Minister is in a good
mood&#151;her officials look demob happy&#151;perhaps she could
give us something to take away by accepting the new
clause.</div>

Baird:
						</b> The new clause would give the ombudsman the
discretion to investigate cases in which court proceedings had been
started. I am sympathetic to it, but I do not think that we can take it
forward 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>now. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that the law has developed
significantly since 1967, when the ombudsman legislation was passed.
Much of what was then maladministration and thus without legal remedy
is now potentially a legal failure and subject to judicial review.
Judicial review is subject to tight time limits; complainants who think
that they have that remedy have to move quickly to claim it. The
ombudsman has discretion to pursue cases that have a legal remedy but
no proceedings, but the courts have ruled&#151;inevitably, given the
1967 Act&#151;that there is no discretion if proceedings have been
started, even if the action is effectively moribund. Those cases, which
are better dealt with by the ombudsman, are obstructed by that
mechanism.</div>
					<a name="07032748000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman rightly rehearsed the history of the matter, and more detail
could indeed be sketched in, if time allowed. We considered an
identical proposal made by his noble Friend Lord Newton, which was that
we could make changes now, so that people were not inconvenienced and
cases did not run the risk of injustice because of the 1967
legislation. My noble Friend Baroness Ashton indicated that she would
consider the issue further. She held some round table discussions, in
which it was agreed that there were complex issues that would have to
be resolved before we could go forward. They arise particularly in
judicial review cases; they need to be dealt with quickly, for the sake
of both complainants and public authorities, so that they know what
they need to do to continue administration. Judicial review has tight
time limits, so we have to get the balance right between those who have
a genuine grievance and those who are looking for a reason to prevent
the legitimate outcome of the decision from being put into
effect.</div>
					<a name="07032748000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Commission is undertaking work on remedies in public law. That includes
the relationship between the courts and the ombudsman. Bearing in mind
the wealth of difficulties that arose when my noble Friend, with the
best intentions, tried to resolve the issue sufficiently quickly to put
something in the Bill, we think that the better course is to let the
Law Commission take its customary mature, rounded view and bring
forward a report in due course. Its expertise and independence will
allow the best balance of conclusions to be reached. For those reasons,
my noble Friend did not return to the issue in the other place after
she had indicated that she would try her best. We do not feel that we
are in a position to accept the new clause at present, but work is
ongoing in this area and the Government are well apprised of the
mischief that the hon. Gentleman so pertinently pointed
out.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I think that
one can mark that as six out of 10&#151;a minor victory&#151;given
that the proposal will be taken forward. I would be grateful if she
could keep my noble Friend Lord Kingsland and me informed of the
progress that is made. If there is anything that we can to do assist,
we will most certainly do it. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
motion.</div>

Baird:
						</b> On a point of order, Mrs. Humble. I
thank all parties for the way in which the Bill has been perused,
probed and improved and for how our understanding of its import has
been broadened and deepened by the deliberations of the Committee. I
thank you, Mrs. Humble, and, in his absence, Mr.
Bercow, for the very pleasant and fair way in which you have chaired
our proceedings. I also thank your Clerk. I have served on Committees
on which he has clerked before. His advice is matchless; he is an
immense asset. We would be in great difficulty if we did not have such
an expert person with
us.</div>
					<a name="07032748000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
officials, who have helped me greatly with the Bill. I also thank the
<i class="I">Hansard </i>writers and the officials who have looked after the
doors. Mercifully, they have not been required to go out and shout
&#147;Division&#148; often, because we have been able to agree on a
Bill that had already been substantially improved in the other
place.</div>
					<a name="07032748000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have enjoyed
taking my first Bill through Committee. I have been accused of being
trendy, but it was said that the Bill was not sexy and it was suggested
that I should design a uniform for bailiffs. Presumably it was a case
of giving me any job that stopped me talking about the Bill. I joke, of
course, because the exchanges have been in the main very pleasant and
very helpful.</div>
					<a name="07032748000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
very much the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk for the attention that
he has given to the Bill. It has been good to have the company of the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. I thank all my hon.
Friends for their diligent following of the issues raised in Committee
and I thank Opposition Members for the attention that they have paid to
the issues. It is a better Bill for our deliberations and I am very
grateful indeed to all who have played a
role.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032748000417"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> Further to that point of order,
Mrs. Humble. I endorse the Minister&#146;s thanks,
particularly to you and to Mr. Bercow, and to the senior
Clerk and to his deputy, Dr. Weston, who has also been very helpful. I
thank everyone who has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>involved with the Committee for the very efficient way in which it has
been managed. We all know that such Committees would not run smoothly
if it was not for the officials who lay out the papers and attend to
our every need. I also thank the police, who attend to the doors and
ensure that everything goes
smoothly.</div>
					<a name="07032748000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that
this has been a good-humoured Committee. We have had plenty of time to
debate the issues and I am very grateful to the usual channels for
ensuring that time to debate the issues has been made available. I do
not think that anyone can complain that we have not had that time. I
agree with the Minister that we are now more knowledgeable about the
Bill. Opposition Members are disappointed that we have not secured all
the changes that we would like, but of course we reserve the right to
return to the relevant issues on
Report.</div>
					<a name="07032748000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
grateful to the various organisations outside the House that have kept
Opposition Front Benchers fully briefed and informed. We do not have
the resource and the huge intellectual capacity of the civil service to
brief us, but we are privileged and fortunate to have many outside
organisations that take a great interest in these matters and they take
every opportunity to ensure that we can table amendments and speak to
them. I am grateful to those organisations for that and I look forward
to returning to the Bill on Report. I also look forward to perhaps
serving under your chairmanship again at some stage in the future,
Mrs.
Humble.</div>

Willott:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Mrs.
Humble. I echo all the thanks that have been given. This is the first
such Committee of which I have been a member, and it has been an
interesting induction to the process of Committee work. I thank you,
Mrs. Humble, and Mr. Bercow, for your patience
with those of us who are new to such work. I have learned more this
morning about parliamentary procedure and moving and withdrawing
amendments than I would have thought possible, and I have learned
significantly more about the inner workings of tribunals than I ever
thought I wanted to know. It has been a very interesting experience. I
thank everyone very
much.</div>
