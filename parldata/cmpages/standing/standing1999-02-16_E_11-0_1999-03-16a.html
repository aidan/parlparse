<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 23, line 11, after `small', insert `or'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 236, in page 23, line 16, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(f) existing staff representation, if any.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I welcome you back to the Committee, Mrs. Dunwoody. We have been behaving ourselves in your absence and intend to continue doing so in your presence.
<P>
I have the indelible impression in my mind of our absent and lamented colleague, the Minister of State, who I described recently as small and perfectly formed. The schedule refers to ``small fragmented bargaining units''. The purpose of the small, and even fragmented, amendment is to discuss whether that is the right way in which to draft provisions. The absence of a connecting pronoun, whether ``and'' or ``or'', and a conjunction or disjunctive gives a slightly different impression than if one had been included.
<P>
The phrase ``a small fragmented bargaining unit'' implies that it is a technical term because the unit must meet both tests. The Central Arbitration Committee might wish to interest itself in a bargaining unit that was small and therefore not viable or in one that was fragmented and therefore extremely complicated to administer. However, to draft the two descriptions without a conjunction seems odd&#151;forgive me, under a moment of strain I referred to a pronoun earlier. I should be grateful for the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I welcome you, Mrs. Dunwoody, to the Committee.
<P>
Before dealing with the grammatical analysis of the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), I shall remind the Committee of the background to the provision. If the union and employer cannot agree a bargaining unit, the CAC will have to decide on what the appropriate unit is. Its main criterion for doing that is the need for the unit to be compatible with effective management. The Bill lists other factors that it must take into account in deciding an appropriate unit. They include the desirability of avoiding small, fragmented bargaining units&#151;a description that contains no conjunction. The amendment would change the provision to read: ``small or fragmented bargaining units''.
<P>
I hope that members of the Committee will agree that the phrase ``small fragmented bargaining units'', without a conjunction, would be particularly undesirable from the point of view of the employer. The CAC would probably view them as incompatible with effective management and, thus, inappropriate, so for additional clarity we have expressly made them something to avoid.
<P>
Making ``small or fragmented bargaining units'' undesirable would not be helpful. That would rule out a reasonable request for recognition of a unit of, say, 10 drivers in a firm of 40 drivers. There is nothing wrong with a small bargaining unit as long as it is compatible with effective management. Fragmented bargaining units were once the norm in this country. Fortunately, the common sense of both unions and employers means that they are now rare. If an employer wants bargaining units to follow a traditional, fragmented pattern, he or she is free to organise the business accordingly. It is important to avoid small and fragmented units. Experience tells us that that is the combination most likely to lead to disputes, which is what we want to avoid. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I acted overhastily in trying to make a point and failed to mention my second amendment, an omission to which the Minister drew my attention. If I may, I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 236. I can cheer the Minister by saying that if he says that it is sensible and reasonable instead of sensible or reasonable, as he did on the last amendment, I am minded not to make difficulties and I shall not need to speak again. The amendment is about staff representation. One factor that might be taken into account when determining whether arrangements should be entered into by the CAC is whether proper staff representation already exists.
<P>
I am not wholly convinced about ``small or fragmented'' because I suspect that the conjunctive conjunction ``and'' rather than the disjunctive conjunction ``or'' might fit the bill better for us both. However, there will be more important issues on which to split hairs tonight, so I shall defer on that point, and ask the Minister to be equally positive on my second amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall be extremely positive on amendment No. 236. I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that the CAC will take existing staff representation into account. Paragraph 12(4)(b) requires the CAC to take account of existing bargaining arrangements in determining the bargaining unit. However, if the hon. Member for Daventry is referring to staff councils and the like, I have to tell him that such bodies have no place in the Bill. They are no substitute for genuine collective bargaining. The proposed sub-paragraph (f) would therefore have no positive effect on deciding on an appropriate bargaining unit. As the sole function of paragraph 12 is to determine how the CAC should decide an appropriate bargaining unit, the amendment is redundant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> With the leave of the Committee, I shall suspend my disbelief. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 190, in page 23, line 22, leave out from `application' to end of line 23 and insert

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 23, line 35, after `are', insert `fully paid up'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient for the Committee to consider the following amendments:
<P>
No. 16, in page 23, line 35, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and that their membership has not lapsed owing to resignation, disqualification or the non-payment of dues'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 17, in page 23, line 47, leave out `significant'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for long. Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are closely connected. We believe that people counted in for the purpose of membership should be genuinely members of the union. I say that in the interests of fairness and clarity rather than in pursuit of some vendetta, or Aunt Sally about a practice that might or might not arise. There is undoubted evidence of industrial malpractice from the rather scarred history of the 1960s and 1970s that people were inscribed as members of a union and given a card, but did not pay a subscription, which was no doubt done to rig proceedings. It was not unusual for that sort of thing to happen in university political clubs, which are not unions. The hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) shakes his head. I could quote an example, or even a joke, but I shall not do so. I did not participate in that practice, but I was not unaware of it.
<P>
In another context, hon. Members will remember the mythical workers who signed on for payments. For many years, the printing industry was presumed to have been staffed by people called D. Duck and M. Mouse. Those were the old days. We do not anticipate them returning, but we are anxious to have a proper understanding that people are not signed up as members for the purposes of determining a constituency for collective bargaining.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 would add the words ``fully paid up'' and amendment No. 16 would include only those members whose dues had not been allowed to lapse. Those are not unreasonable tests. Amendment No. 17 has a slightly different implication, referring to the qualifying conditions required before the CAC agrees to a ballot.
<P>
I have tried to be reasonably balanced towards both sides of industry. If anything, this is marginally a pro-union amendment. It refers to the number of union members within the bargaining unit who might inform the CAC that they do not want the union to conduct collective bargaining on their behalf. The amendment would leave out the word ``significant'' because there is no defining characteristic for it. Something may be regarded as significant by only one person or 10 people, the only difference being that 10 times as many people have said that it has significance.
<P>
We have already suggested that paragraph 14(4)(b) may unfortunately reach litigation. A judge may decide that only one union member saying, ``I don't want a union in here'' is significant. I do not believe that the word ``significant'' means anything more than that one person is against the proposal. The Minister may want to use a different term of art, such as ``substantial'' or to add a specific percentage test, such as the one applying to the numbers asking for recognition. It is worth pausing on that point for the Minister's reply.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall be brief, as the amendments look forward. Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 would ensure that when considering what is known as ``automatic recognition''&#151;recognition without a ballot when the union has more than 50 per cent. membership&#151;only genuine and current members should be counted. Union membership is a matter of fact&#151;the rulebooks lay down who is a member. Unions are bound by their rulebooks, which specify that membership is terminated after arrears of subscriptions reach a specified level. They must not try to claim people as members who do not satisfy their own criteria. That would be deceitful.
<P>
The Government has no desire to meddle in the internal affairs of trade unions, which are perfectly capable of dealing properly with their own affairs. However, we accept that in their enthusiasm to recruit new members and gain recognition, unions might&#151;I put it no higher than that&#151;market themselves to people who do not wish a union to bargain on their behalf. It is precisely for that reason that we have included paragraph 14(4)(c), enabling the CAC to take into account membership evidence that may cast doubt on the wish of members of the bargaining unit to be represented by a union. If, for example, the employer can show that a significant number of union members have recently cancelled their check-off authorisations and appear to be leaving the union, that might prompt the CAC to hold a ballot.
<P>
We have already dealt fully with the concerns addressed by amendments Nos. 15 and 16. On amendment No. 17, to help the hon. Member for Daventry, I shall say simply that a ``significant number'' is a number capable of affecting the result. There is no reason for the CAC to take account of a small number of workers who do not wish to be represented if it is clear that a majority do so wish. But if the number who oppose recognition means that the majority is in doubt, then there should be a ballot. That sensible and practical approach underlies the wording of the clause. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Those seem satisfactory assurances. My only slight concern is on circumstances in which there was doubt about the evidence of union membership; apart from the CAC activity laid out in 14(4)(c), to which the Minister referred, or the possibility of the certification officer taking an interest in the proceedings, particularly if a complaint were made about the number of members, what safeguards exist? However, the Minister is obviously looking at the same kind of potential problems as I am and in the light of his response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: 194, in page 24, line 12, after `13', insert `or 13A'.&#151;[Mr. Wills.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 24, leave out line 30.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 19, in page 24, leave out line 32.
<P>
20, in page 24, leave out lines 33 to 38.
<P>
21, in page 24, line 35, leave out from `malpractice' to end of line 36.
<P>
22, in page 25, leave out lines 4 to 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We now move to the conduct of ballots. The amendments probe how ballots will take place and why one action should be preferred to another. It is fair to say that they are not uninformed by the experience of the 1960s and 1970s, when some trade union members prevented democracy by misusing mass meetings&#151;I hasten to say that that did not always happen, but the potential for misuse existed. From what he has just said and from the provisions of paragraph 16(5)(a), it is clear that the Minister is aware that misuse can occur, although we hope that it will not, and can influence the result of a ballot. Nothing would discredit the Bill more, in the Minister's book&#151;and, to put it cynically, make the Opposition's point for him&#151;than a ballot being seen to be overtly influenced by malpractice. We do not want that to happen and want to ensure that the arrangements are sensible.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 would effectively delete the provision for a workplace ballot. That might not be absolutely necessary, but it would be helpful&#151;not least because I am sure that the Minister and his officials are considering an approach to the CAC to establish ground rules on how that should operate. The other amendments are probing; amendment No. 19 would remove the reference to the preference of the CAC, which implies that the CAC will decide how to operate a ballot by tossing a coin. Amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 22 follow from amendments Nos. 18 and 19. It is conceivable that circumstances would arise in which not holding a postal ballot is economical&#151;an important factor&#151;efficient, sensible and unlikely to cause malpractice. I do not mean that the ballot should be held ``down the pub'', but that it might be appropriate to hold a ballot perhaps in a village hall adjacent to the site. I am thinking of a works&#151;sadly, it is about to close&#151;in my constituency, outside of which there are several public locations where it would probably be better to hold a ballot than on the site itself. The Bill might not be too restrictive about that&#151;the Minister might tell me that it is possible to stretch the point&#151;but it is at least worth discussing the safeguards that might be provided to avoid workplace malpractice and the circumstances in which workplace ballots will be preferred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Opposition want to withdraw the option of holding workplace ballots? Does he accept that all balloting procedures, from an open show of hands to secret ballots and postal ballots, have their strengths and weaknesses and that it would be inappropriate to say that one sort is wholly unacceptable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We can debate that in different contexts. We can agree that, at one end of the spectrum, it is unacceptable to have the heavy mob standing at the back, or possibly more typically at the front, trying to rig a meeting and influence the decision, especially when open outcry is involved. I know the hon. Gentleman to be a genuine man, so I suspect that he is concerned about democratic participation. If he were to think that, for example, a better turnout would be achieved if a workplace ballot were held at the end of a shift, he would probably have a good point. I am not arguing absolutely for the ending of workplace ballots, but I know people, whose opinions I respect, who would do so.
<P>
It is for the Minister to show that the Government have considered such matters carefully and that they will give sensible guidance, or have a dialogue with the CAC, on how ballots should be undertaken. Ballots should preferably be carried out with the agreement of both sides of industry and should be appropriate to local conditions. Perhaps&#151;I do not rest on this point; I just fling it out&#151;a workplace ballot would be appropriate if all parties, including the employer, agreed to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> I was seeking to highlight the point that my hon. Friend the Minister made. All the possible systems are implicit within most trade union rule books. The members themselves will determine the most appropriate system in normal circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I largely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I certainly agree with what he says about trade union rule books. However, we are discussing ballots which are a public activity prescribed by statute. That is not quite the same as an internal trade union ballot, although there is some affinity. It is important that ballots retain their credibility with the employer, who must be absolutely satisfied with them; with the CAC, which is an independent quasi-judicial body; and with employees, who might not be union members. In certain cases, the employees might be violently opposed to the union, but they must see that justice is being done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to paragraph 15(2), which clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The CAC must arrange for the holding of a secret ballot''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does he agree that, in certain circumstances, it is impossible to hold a workplace ballot, rather than a postal ballot, which normally means that the ballot papers are sent to the employees' homes? For example, gang labour in the building trade is often transferred around the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Such practical considerations are important. The purpose of the amendment is to flag up the fact that problems could arise, which none of us wants, and to try to persuade the Minister to establish the right modality for delivering an acceptable result. Several players are involved. Like all members of the Committee, he knows that it is a sensitive issue. Nothing would make the Government's subsequent life more difficult than a row about how a ballot was conducted. Nor would a major row about conduct be good for the CAC, especially in the early days. We want to try to avoid that. We want the most practical way of doing it.
<P>
I should probably have supporters on both sides of the Committee if I said that I should also like the highest possible democratic participation. We do not want such decisions to be made by a very small majority either way, with many people abstaining. As we shall debate later, other criteria relating to the hurdles come into play on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I recognise the probing nature of the amendments, and very much appreciate the anxieties that the hon. Member for Daventry has expressed. With your permission, Mrs. Dunwoody, I hope that I can reassure him by taking some time to explain the thinking behind the proposals.
<P>
If a union and an employer cannot agree that the union should be recognised, a ballot may be necessary to determine whether a majority is in favour of the union's conducting collective bargaining. The question of where the ballot should be held is left to the CAC, which has two possible choices, both of which have advantages and disadvantages, as my hon. Friends the Members for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) and for Oldham, East and Saddleworth have pointed out.
<P>
A workplace ballot may be cheaper than a postal ballot, and may lead to a higher turnout, although neither is necessarily the case. In the case of split sites or shift working, a workplace ballot can be more expensive and more difficult to organise than a postal ballot. However, workplace ballots may lead to victimisation of workers who vote against the employer or to intimidation or workers who vote against the union.
<P>
On the other hand, a postal ballot is relatively difficult to interfere with and is less obtrusive than a workplace ballot. It may, therefore, be more appropriate in the case of a highly emotive dispute over recognition. It is said that postal ballots produce lower turnouts than workplace ballots, but, again, that is not always true. Some evidence suggests that turnout is higher in postal ballots if the issue is one that directly affects workers, rather than a national issue such as an election or a political fund.
<P>
The amendments would remove the possibility of holding a workplace ballot, for all its advantages and disadvantages. That would be unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, as a general point, it tends to be better to err on the side of providing more options rather than fewer in statutes. If postal ballots turn out to be the best option, I am sure that the CAC will employ them in preference to workplace ballots. However, it would be foolish to deprive the CAC of the power to choose the more appropriate method in any particular case.
<P>
Secondly, some evidence suggests that workplace ballots can lead to larger turnouts. Other evidence suggests that they may not. I appreciate that from the point of view of those who oppose statutory recognition, preventing workplace ballots might be a good thing. However, it would obviously be a retrograde step in encouraging good industrial relations. As I am sure all members of the Committee agree, the greater the turnout in a ballot, the more convincing the result, even if the result is not in one's favour. A low turnout will tend to foster feelings of dissatisfaction. A union might believe that it could have won in a workplace ballot. A higher turnout would allow an employer to say with greater confidence that workers did not support recognition.
<P>
Thirdly, the same argument applies to derecognition ballots. The chances of achieving derecognition through a ballot may be reduced by not allowing a workplace ballot. Again, a low turnout will tend to foster dissatisfaction.
<P>
I hope that the convincing argument in persuading the hon. Member for Daventry to withdraw the amendment is that we have discussed the balloting provisions with the Electoral Reform Society and Unity Security Balloting Services, which are among the bodies most likely to carry out the ballots. Given that our proposals reflect their views, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the absence from Committee of my hon. Friends the Members for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) and for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) on unavoidable, alternative business, I wish to speak to the amendment. It picks up the concerns about which they spoke with great eloquence and deep sensitivity when referring to the Exclusive Brethren. I am choosing my words carefully so that I do not breach parliamentary convention, but I am aware that members of the Exclusive Brethren continue to take a close interest in our proceedings.
<P>
Whatever view one may take of such matters, members of the Committee want to be as sensitive as possible to persons of conscience. The amendment would exclude employers from the obligation to participate in the ballot when they had particular reasons of conscience for doing so. If that were to happen, the exclusions would need to be tightly secured.
<P>
We must realise that there is genuine conflict between two principles. On the one hand is the Government's wish to extend employment rights collectively through the mechanism of collective recognition while, on the other, is the wish of all members of the Committee to support the conscience of the individual or group of individuals. Parliament has a certain genius for finding a solution, sooner or later, in such situations. It is important that all persons of good will should consider ways to achieve that. I have no particular solution, but perhaps we can find a way to ensure that such rights are confined only to cases when it is clearly the wish of the work force that there should be trade union recognition. Whatever its views might be, I suspect that the Exclusive Brethren would not stand in the way of a work force that was enthusiastic for that.
<P>
Through representation either of the rights of the individual or collectively, it may be possible to redefine the provision to make it helpful to those with such beliefs. For example, in certain instances, members of such communities are willing to make use of lawyers. I accept that they are not trade union officials, but we may be able to find a way round the matter. It was raised with sensitivity and was well responded to previously. I am making a few private inquiries into means of finding a solution and I am glad that my hon. Friends tabled the amendment. Perhaps other members of the Committee who are concerned about matters of conscience will wish to contribute to the debate. I look forward to the Minister's response and, without wanting to claim individual credit, I hope that, one way or another, we can hammer out a mutually acceptable solution.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): I echo the hon. Gentleman's sentiments. There is a clash between the individual's rights to belong to a union, and the religious beliefs and consciences of other individuals with equal rights. It is a difficult issue.
<P>
I stress that members of the Exclusive Brethren hold a genuine view. They have no axe to grind in terms of employer-employee industrial relations, but they have a genuine belief. From representations in my own constituency&#151;I am sure that other hon. Members have had equally strong representations&#151;I know that their convictions are so strong that they will cease to trade if they cannot find a way to satisfy the law and, at the same time, maintain their consciences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have constituency experience of the Brethren. I have recorded no complaint about their conduct as employers in respect of their employees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. There are probably at least 10 trading groups in my constituency, each employing perhaps half a dozen or 50 people&#151;they represent the ultimate small business, in a way&#151;and on no occasion have constitutents raised concerns about conditions of employment in that environment. Workers are not being oppressed by that working arrangement. They voluntarily enter into it, and it seems to be satisfactory in comparison with any other.
<P>
A specific group of people are genuinely expressing their consciences. Those people have equal rights to live by their convictions, and we should be clever enough to accommodate their beliefs within the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): In common with hon. Members who have spoken, I have had representations from members of the Brethren at my constituency surgery. They were not constituents, but they had travelled from a Labour constituency to make their point once they heard that I was serving on the Committee. That does not alter the strength of their convictions.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister is aware of the point that I am about to make, but I would like to put it on the record. In no sense are members of the Brethren exploitative and bad employers&#151;ruthless, top-hatted capitalists&#151;looking for a religious excuse to stamp over the rights of their workers. Quite the contrary is the case.
<P>
I do not think that those members of the Brethren who came to see me would object if I were to state what they said, which was that they believed that the industrial relations balance in previous years in this country was often tilted too far in favour of employers and too far away from employees. However, they have a genuine religious belief, which we should try to accommodate in our deliberations on the Bill.
<P>
I also ask the Minister and his officials to think about the fact that the members of the Brethren expressed to me a great willingness to seek some compromise. They are not taking the absolutist position that, unless they get exactly what they want in exactly the terms that they specify, they will not play ball. They are looking for compromise, and I hope that it can be found.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It might help if Ministers and their officials, following the precedent that was set last year when we debated the difficult issue of charities in proceedings on the National Minimum Wage Bill, would consent to meet interested parties at a professional level. They might also consent to meet Opposition Members to see whether we can find a way through the problem, as the common ground of the Committee is being well established.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> That would be the most productive outcome of what is likely to be a short debate this afternoon. If the Minister and his officials could further attempt to find compromise, we could find a way to reconcile the genuine clash of two equally valid and equally important human rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Pearson </B>(Dudley, South): I shall be brief, as I do not want to repeat the contributions made already, which encapsulate the issue. I do not want to repeat my comments from our debate on the issue with regard to individual employment rights. Given our philosophy of continuous improvement, it should be possible to give comfort to members of the Exclusive Brethren and others who have genuine and religious problems in complying with the Bill. Amendments Nos. 104 and 105 would not do the job. I am a lay person in such matters, but I believe that the amendmens are technically defective. However, I hope that the provision is considered further and that a suitable solution is found on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We debated many such points when discussing amendments Nos. 81 and 90 on 25 February. I hope that we have made it clear that the Government wish to be sensitive to all matters of conscience. Religious conscience is something that we all respect. As members of the Committee know, a balance must be struck. As my right hon. Friend the Minister of State explained, the question is whether one person's religious conscience should be allowed to deprive others of their rights.
<P>
I cannot agree that workers should be deprived of their statutory rights to belong to a trade union because of the religious beliefs of their employers. It is important to keep the problem in perspective. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West said that the Brethren operated 1,200 mainly small businesses that employ about 6,500 people, most of whom are members of the Brethren. About 35 businesses have more than 20 employees and therefore could be subject to applications for recognition. There are likely to be few, if any, Brethren workplaces where a union could pass even the preliminary tests for recognition application, let along win a ballot.
<P>
I recognise that the beliefs of the Brethren are held sincerely and that the Bill could pose serious problems for them. I have listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Daventry, my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson) and other members of the Committee said. We shall continue to consider whether there is anything that we can reasonably do, for example, through the proposed code of practice on access for unions during recognition campaigns to take account of the specific situation of the Brethren, but without undermining the principles of the Bill. I undertake to report back to my right hon. Friend the Minister of State as soon as he is well enough all that has been said today so that he has the opportunity to consider how we can move forward.
<P>
I make no promises, but we shall continue to consider the case sympathetically, bearing in mind that, as my right hon. Friend the Minister of State said, we cannot allow individuals to be deprived of their statutory rights by something over which they have no control&#151;in other words, the religious beliefs of their employers.
<P>
The amendments are well meant and I hope that members of the Committee will take my next remarks in the spirit in which they are intended. We respect the sincerity of the religious beliefs under debate, nevertheless the amendments could unfortunately open the way to claims of supposed religious conscience for employers who were merely trying to escape union recognition. Some employers seem to have an almost superstitious fear of trade unions, but that is not the same as a religious objection. We do not want to open such a loophole&#151;something that we shall bear in mind as we consider the matter further. I hope that I have said enough this afternoon to persuade the hon. Member for Daventry to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and, indeed, to all members of the Committee for the way in which the matter has been handled. I realise the Minister's difficulties, not least because he needs to consult the Minister of State. It is important that we do not make a hasty decision. The Minister signalled his readiness to find a solution to the matter. Two interests are involved, one being that of the participants who may wish to make representations to the Minister. I hope that they will. Indeed, I hope that they will share them with all the interests represented on the Committee. It is important to challenge them to express their views and, if possible, to come up with their preferred solutions.
<P>
Then comes the question of trying to get a reasonable consensus among the parties in Committee. We may end up with some sort of proximity talks, in which those who have an interest talk to the Minister while we wait until they have finished before speaking.
<P>
I do not mind how it is done, but it is important that there should be a common understanding and that we should share the objective of trying to find a solution. I accept the Minister's good will. I am sure that he will not sit on the question and then, without having tried, say, ``Nothing can be done''. I am sure that he will try. It is our job to encourage him to do so, but I judge that the best way to do that is to accept his assurance. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 25, line 10, leave out `generally'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to take amendment No. 239, in page 25, line 42, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `17A. The trade union (or unions) informed by the CAC under paragraph 16(8) must comply with the following duties&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to co-operate generally, in connection with the ballot, with the employer and the person appointed to conduct the ballot; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) to give to the employer such information as is reasonable to enable the employer to inform the workers of the employer's views in respect of the object of the ballot and to seek their support and their opinions on the issues involved'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We now pass to the duties of employers. Amendment No. 23 is purely probing. Under paragraph 17(2), an employer would be required
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to co-operate generally, in connection with the ballot, with the union (or unions)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is what I might call a literal-minded amendment. When I see the word ``generally'', I metaphorically reach for my revolver.
<P>
I am reminded immensely of a former distinguished Member of the House&#151;indeed, he was a Cabinet Minister&#151;who briefly, many years ago, happened to be my next-door neighbour. Having retired from the Cabinet, he thought it entirely appropriate to take up a position on the Aynho village annual fete committee. He announced one year&#151;he was feeling somewhat frail&#151;that he would appoint himself a roving operator. That phrase has subsequently become family slang for doing very little in particular, but doing it extremely elegantly.
<P>
I am worried about such a general obligation simply because it is not specific. In other words, an employer might say&#151;probably not explicitly, but someone might argue on his behalf&#151;``Of course, I co-operated generally, but when push came to shove, and the trade unions really wanted anything, that was a specific issue on which I did not co-operate.'' Would that be a breach of the provision?
<P>
The converse implies that he would be a largo al factotum&#151;a general gofer for whatever the unions wanted in connection with the ballot. He would have to co-operate generally, effusively and without reservation. I do not know which of those is likely to be the result of the wording that the Minister has produced. I am not a parliamentary draftsman and, nor is he, but he has their advice. I hope that he will reflect on that and perhaps help the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 239 is more substantive. It makes the point, which we have made before, that employers have obligations; broadly speaking, the thrust of the bill is to impose a number of additional obligations on employers. However, the Government do not always impose matching obligations on trade unions. Someone was kind enough to draft for me a matching obligation that would required a trade union to co-operate generally&#151;I am not averse to that word in principle&#151;with the employer and the person appointed to conduct the ballot.
<P>
In sub-paragraph (b) of the amendment, a union would have to give an employer such information as was reasonable to enable the employer to inform the workers of the employer's views in respect of the object of the ballot. I realise that we shall tackle the subject of blacklists in a later debate, and that this is not an appropriate time to raise the subject. However, if employers are to be required to co-operate with a ballot, either generally or specifically, the trade unions must surely have an obligation to be reasonably helpful. We must remember that, in order to meet the Minister's specifications, employers and unions will have a common objective in finding out the views of the membership. To put it slightly more vulgarly, there may also be a shared expense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Of course, I understand the hon. Gentleman's thinking&#151;the word ``generally'' may be redundant in this context. However, I do not think that it hurts the legal force of the schedule&#151;it may even do some good. The CAC must have considerable discretion if it is to deal adequately with non-co-operation in a recognition ballot. Rather than having primary legislation describing cunning ways of not co-operating, which, as they have been highlighted, will be circumvented, it is much more satisfactory to give the CAC the power to decide, because it will know non-co-operation when it sees it. An amendment that would circumscribe the CAC's discretion is unhelpful, and I hope that he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall respond briefly to that point. While it may be desirable in principle to say that the CAC must adjudicate as part of its onerous duties, does the Minister concede that there may be cases when the CAC has a bee in its bonnet about certain conduct? It may be that certain employers have not helped themselves in presenting what they have done. What might have been a reasonable attempt to co-operate could be turned into another cause for grievance because an employer is accused of being not only against trade unions generally, but obstructive in the conduct of the ballot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> One could go into it in all sorts of detail, but one must accept that the CAC will promote the cause of good industrial relations. The general point is whether to circumscribe its powers, and we think that it would be better not to do that.
<P>
Amendment No. 239 would require a union to co-operate with the person running the recognition ballot. There is a certain asymmetry, as there is little that a union can do to impede the successful conduct of a ballot. It cannot withhold the addresses of workers from an employer, for example, or frustrate his access to them. A union has very little scope for other forms of non-co-operation, so I cannot see the need for paragraph (a) of the amendment.
<P>
As for paragraph (b), it is a little absurd to suggest that an employer's opinions rely on knowing what the union thinks, unless the two are in closer partnership than the need to hold a recognition ballot implies. Paragraph (b) does not parallel the specific requirements for an employer to allow access to workers by the union, because an employer always has access to them, while the union does not. There is not much that a union can reasonably tell an employer, so there is no reason for paragraph (b) of the amendment either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> The hon. Member for Daventry wants to put a reciprocal obligation on workers. I understand that that would take the form of giving employer-based information to workers, explaining the employer's position. Even under existing balloting procedure, such information is sent out by the Electoral Reform Society or the Unity Security Balloting Services at the same time as the ballot papers, as a matter of practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful and informative intervention. I had come to the end of my remarks trying to persuade the hon. Member for Daventry to withdraw the amendments, so I hope that he will now do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> By a short head, and in the spirit of co-operation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 208, in page 25, line 44, leave out from `may' to end of line 48 and insert

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> With your permission, Mrs. Dunwoody, I shall speak to the Government amendments. I shall then allow the hon. Member for Daventry to speak&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister need not worry. I shall ensure that Opposition Members have the opportunity to speak to their amendments. I am quite tolerant about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody. In your absence this morning, I inadvertently started to preclude them from that opportunity. I was alerting you in case I should again slip into that error.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 208 to 210 alter the effect of an employer's non-co-operation with a ballot that the CAC organises. Under the schedule as drafted, the CAC may either require the employer to take certain steps to co-operate, or award recognition because the employer is frustrating the balloting process. The Government always intended that the award of recognition be a last resort. We therefore want to alter paragraph 18 to reflect that policy.
<P>
Government amendment No. 208 will enable the CAC to order an employer who fails to co-operate with the ballot to take reasonable, specific measures to remedy the failure. If the employer does not act on the order within a reasonable period, and if the CAC judges the employer's non-co-operation to be sufficiently damaging, it may declare the union to be recognised.
<P>
Government amendment No. 209 corrects a cross-reference, and is consequential to Government amendment No. 208.
<P>
Government amendment No. 210 removes paragraph 18(3), which allows the CAC's compliance orders to be enforced in the courts. The provision is not necessary, because the remedy for non-compliance will be an order for recognition.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 211 to 214 alter the effect of an employer's non-co-operation with a derecognition ballot. Under the schedule as drafted, the CAC may either require the employer to take certain steps to co-operate, or reject the application for derecognition.
<P>
Government amendment No. 211 is parallel to Government amendment No. 208. If an employer fails to co-operate, the CAC can order the employer to remedy the non-co-operation. If the employer does not, the CAC may declare that the union continue to be recognised.
<P>
In addition, the amendment introduces a new paragraph 55(3), which will allow a compliance order to be enforced by the county court if&#151;any only if&#151;the application for derecognition was made by workers rather than the employer. It is designed to cover the contingency of workers trying to derecognise a union that the employer wants to remain recognised. If the only sanction for non-compliance were continued recognition, it would obviously be in the employer's interest not to co-operate with the ballot. Forcing the employer to act co-operatively is a necessary sanction. Government amendments Nos. 212 and 213 correct cross-references and are consequential to Government amendment No. 211.
<P>
Government amendment No. 214 introduces a different cross-reference into part V of the schedule, which deals with derecognition of non-independent, so-called sweetheart, unions, and requires an application to be made by workers. As I explained in relation to Government amendment No. 211, the appropriate sanction for non-co-operation is a court order requiring co-operation, rather than continued recognition. Under Government amendment No. 214, therefore, if an employer fails to co-operate with a ballot to derecognise a sweetheart union, the remedy is county court enforcement of the CAC's order to co-operate.
<P>
With the amendments, we are trying to achieve two things that I hope that all hon. Members will welcome. The amendments are more specific about what will happen if an employer does not co-operate with a ballot, and about what the CAC can and should do in such circumstances. I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister tried to help the Committee, and is entitled to a rest after his explanations. It is inevitable&#151;or perhaps unique to me, but I doubt it&#151;that the conjunction of so much carefully prepared briefing material occasionally proves slightly indigestible. I shall reserve my position on the points that he made, at least formally, for another time. Perhaps he did not draw them out as much he might have done in his initial explanation, but he helpfully mentioned them in his conclusion.
<P>
Under amendment No. 24, we want to delete paragraph 18(1)(b) on issuing a declaration. We are concerned that if an employer regrettably failed to comply with the three duties imposed on him, he might effectively put two fingers up to the process. The only effective sanction would then be for the CAC to say, ``The union is recognised. That is the end of it.''
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister explained that, under amendment No. 208&#151;the lead amendment in every respect&#151;the CAC would be allowed to go back for a further round of compliance to the employer. It would be possible to issue a declaration stating that the union must be recognised only if there were a complete dereliction of duty on the part of the employer. That is not inherently unreasonable, if it is what the Minister means, and it would meet some of the spirit of amendment No. 24.
<P>
The only other amendment that I have in the clutch is amendment (a) to Government amendment No. 211. When the Government table amendments at the last minute, I have the slight propensity&#151;it is entirely in the spirit of your helpful remarks in the interests of parliamentary democracy, Mrs. Dunwoody&#151;to put down a marker to show our dissatisfaction with the lack of notice, but I did not table the amendment purely for that purpose. The point that I want to make has probably been subsumed in what the Minister has said. We want to deal with those employers who act in good faith&#151;to use a phrase used in an earlier debate&#151;and try to comply with the three duties but are prevented from doing so by force majeure. In such cases, I hope that the CAC would understand and return for a further round of compliance&#151;to use my phrase&#151;before throwing the book at them. We are feeling towards a reasonable understanding on such matters. The Minister might want to respond to the amendments that I have tabled, and we shall reflect on what he says tonight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> My amendment No. 250 deals with the cost of recognition and derecognition ballots. We want the process to be equitable. If the costs of recognition ballots should be borne by the unions that request them, it is not unreasonable for the costs of derecognition ballots to be borne by the employers who request such ballots. That applies whether or not those ballots go ahead.
<P>
A third example is that of employees who request a ballot to end recognition arrangements. That might not be a frequent occurrence, but if it does happen, it is reasonable for the costs of the ballot to be shared equally by the union and the employer. Amendment No. 250 would provide equity in spreading the cost burden of the derecognition process. I look forward to any observations that the Minister might care to make on that amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that I have gathered correctly from the hon. Member for Daventry that we are moving towards the same goal under amendment No. 24, and that what I have said already will ensure that he does not press it to a Division.
<P>
Having read amendment (a) to Government amendment No. 211, I was not altogether sure what it was designed to achieve. I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's explanation of amendment (a), but I remain unconvinced that it is necessary. Of course, one cannot entirely exclude a ballot being delayed by force majeure&#151;perhaps by floods of the sort that we have seen recently&#151;but I do not see why that should exonerate the employer from the duty to co-operate. I shall study his remarks, but, at least for the time being, I hope that he will not press the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 250, moved by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey), is interesting, but I hope that he will not press it. The provisions in the Bill ensure that the cost of recognition ballots are borne equally by the employer and the union making the application. That is done for good reasons. To maintain a parallel between the recognition and derecognition procedures, the Bill ensures that the cost of the derecognition ballots are borne equally by the employer and the union.
<P>
Amendment No. 250 would not only create an undesirable inconsistency between the procedures, but risk the accusation that the Bill did not provide a balance for both parties. The amendment seeks to require employers to foot the bill completely if they invoke the derecognition procedure, but that if a union invokes it the cost of the ballot should be shared equally. I see no equality, or, to use the hon. Gentleman's phrase, no equity, in that.
<P>
Statutory procedures are intended to be a last resort. We hope that the parties will have sufficient opportunity to reach a voluntary agreement and thus avoid holding a ballot. Indeed, the procedure has been designed to give them as much opportunity to do that as possible. With that in mind, we formulated our proposals to ensure that the cost of the ballot could not alter the behaviour of employers or unions. We hope that it would be an incentive and an encouragement for both parties to reach a voluntary agreement if they were faced with paying ballot costs. We hope that both parties will endeavour to avoid a ballot. I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I feel that we are moving towards consensus. We shall have a second bite of the cherry on costs in the next group of amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Madam Speaker:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that the Government should withdraw their amendments. Perhaps we could allow them to take that decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, I do not wish to subvert the Government into withdrawing their amendments, which I believe are rather helpful.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 26, line 28, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7A) A person appointed to conduct a ballot shall, if required by either party, give an estimate of the likely gross costs of the ballot before it is held, but shall be entitled in the absence of any negligence on his part in the conduct of the ballot, to recover the full gross costs under sub-paragraph (4).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the promised second bite of the cherry on costs. I agree with what the Minister said about the wish to make the procedure a last resort&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Someone has an electronic toy.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): It is not my possession, Mrs. Dunwoody; I am doing my best to comply with the rules of order on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am always happy to hear the hon. Gentleman's interesting remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is reassuring to the Committee to know that my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove can make her presence felt even in her absence&#151;even if it is in a way that distresses some hon. Members. Indeed, it nearly put me off my stroke. However, I shall return to the costs of the ballot.
<P>
The Miniser sensibly said that he wants such procedures to be used as a last resort and that he does not want either party to force a ballot until it has thought long and hard about doing so. He said also that, by inference, such a procedure would be rather expensive. Some members of the Committee will be well-versed in what is done by Unity and others to conduct ballots.
<P>
The amendment was tabled long ago and its purpose is to avoid any suggestion of recrimination about costs. A group of workers that sought trade union recognition might be under a misconception about the likely costs of a ballot. Indeed, employers could be under a misconception about the likely cost of the ballot and resisting recognition. However, given that professionals are involved, it should not be beyond the wit of man for a ballot holder to give a rough estimate of what it is likely to cost.
<P>
It may not be necessary for a ballot holder to do that under statute, but something that could be done privately although its status would be important. However, we do not want a position in which a party says that the ballot cost three times as much and that it still lost, or perhaps that the ballot cost three times as much as the party originally thought and that it was conducted inefficiently and expensively.
<P>
The amendment would require an advance estimate to be given. It would safeguard the position of the ballot holder by prescribing that as long as the ballot had genuinely incurred costs and they had not arisen as a result of negligence or misconduct because of the incompetence of the ballot holder, he or she would be able to recover the real costs and would not be held to the estimate. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> On the face of it, the amendment is not unreasonable&#151;nor, I hope, am I an unreasonable Minister. However, it would not improve the Bill. The difficulty with requiring the scrutineer to provide an estimate of costs is that that would take time and effort, and therefore cost money. It might delay the holding of a ballot and so prolong both the uncertainty and the costs associated with it. We oppose the amendment because its only practical effects would be to delay and render more expensive the holding of a recognition ballot. I hope that, in those circumstances, the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am not wholly convinced by the Minister's argument. To suggest that people cannot be asked for an estimate or that it would delay the ballot smacks slightly of Sir Humphrey. However, he has not been marching too hard in the Committee, so, in the spirit of good will, we shall give him one more licence. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 26, line 36, leave out `40' and insert `50'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 157, in page 38, line 15, leave out `40' and insert `20'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Committee will remember&#151;particularly as the majority of its members were elected on it&#151;that Labour's general election manifesto contained some deliberately ambiguous words about majority support for trade union recognition. The words were crafted carefully to suggest one group of things to the employers and another set of concepts to the unions. That resulted in a continuing controversy over many months and came out&#151;as it were&#151;in the ``Fairness at Work'' White Paper, which took a further eight months to emerge as this Bill. Part of that process was dignified by being called the process of consultation.
<P>
One of the reasons why the Bill is in the mess in which it has been thrown at us is that most of the consultation period was conducted in smoke-filled rooms. Ministers&#151;as with No. 11 buses, we wait for one and then three come along&#151;were all desperately trying, from their slightly different angles, to broker details that would unite Bill Morris and Adair Turner in a solution.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall not talk about it for long as we are not on Second Reading, but we all know that a compromise was reached. The compromise is a majority of those voting and at least 40 per cent. of the workers constituting the bargaining unit. I accept that that is a high hurdle, and I am glad that it is. However, it is still a compromise, and it is arguable that it is not consistent with what was said in Labour's election manifesto. Bearing in mind that the Minister fought the election on those manifesto criteria, he should explain why that figure was chosen, how it is principled, how it is reconcilable with the Labour manifesto and how it will work in practice.
<P>
The other amendment, which I cannot find, would impose a different test on downgrading. We should think about the asymmetry of it. We need&#151;the Government had committed themselves to this&#151;a substantial test of support on recognition, but on derecognition it is reasonable to say that silence gives consent to the process. A large number of people, as a proportion of the work force, are not needed actively to consent to derecognition, because if one does not vote, one cannot, almost by definition, be keen on the union. That is why we proposed a 50 per cent. test on the way up, which is&#151;if I were to put it in political terms, which I would never do&#151;a way of helping the Labour Government to comply with their own election manifesto. We also proposed a 20 per cent. test on the way down&#151;one does not need more than a minimum expression of apathy to justify a derecognition procedure, because no one is much in favour of it.
<P>
I do not need to say more about the matter, although some of my colleagues may want to make brief contributions. The Government have not had their greatest moment of glory while trying to sort the matter out, and I do not think that their final solution is a principled one. It is an expedient&#151;it has got them through so far, but they need to turn on the spit for a moment longer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the convenience of the Committee, I should make it clear that amendment No. 157, which is to be considered with the amendment, is at the bottom of page 293, of the amendment paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Throughout the Committee's sittings, I have been consistently mesmerised by the command of the English language that the hon. Member for Daventry possesses. However, I did not recognise anything in his rather lurid description of the process of partnership, co-operation and consultation on which we have been embarked. He has badly misrepresented us in this instance, but I regard that as a moment of mischief to which he is entitled.
<P>
We have laid out the key principle of statutory recognition as respect for the wish of the majority of workers. It is simple. If a majority favour recognition, the union should be recognised. That is what we promised, and that is what we are delivering. If a majority favour derecognition, the union should be derecognised.
<P>
I cannot accept the assertion that an absolute majority of the bargaining unit need to vote in favour of recognition in order to show sufficient support. That is the issue under debate. Not to vote in a recognition or derecognition ballot is equivalent to a ``Don't care'' vote. As long as a large proportion of the bargaining unit actively support recognition and a majority vote in favour of it, it is reasonable to grant recognition. Strong opposition will lead to losing the ballot and lack of support will fail the 40 per cent. test.
<P>
We have maintained a strong parallel between recognition and derecognition provisions in the Bill. The logical consequence of increasing the recognition threshold to 50 per cent. of the bargaining unit is to raise the derecognition threshold to the same figure&#151;making both recognition and derecognition more difficult.
<P>
There is a balance to be struck&#151;as in everything&#151;between making it too easy and too difficult for unions to be recognised or derecognised. If it is too easy, that calls into question the validity of recognition, and so damages the relationship between employer and union. If it is too difficult, that results in an inflexible system, in which it is hard for a union to gain recognition, even when it has significant support among the workforce and equally hard for an employer to derecognise a union, even if it has little support.
<P>
I believe that we have struck a fair balance between rigour and flexibility in setting the target of 40 per cent. in favour of recognition. The Bill provides a power for the Secretary of State to vary that limit by affirmative resolution, if necessary. We will therefore have the chance to revisit it if it proves&#151;as we do not believe that it will&#151;to be inappropriate. I hope that I have said enough to reassure the hon. Member for Daventry and that he will withdraw the amendment, which is unnecessary and unhelpful.
<P>
Much of what I have said on amendment No. 26 applies to amendment No. 157, which would reduce the proportion of the bargaining unit needing to vote in favour of derecognition from 40 per cent. to 20 per cent. That would make it too easy to derecognise an established union on the basis of a low turnout, possibly leaving a silent majority of contented workers feeling cheated. Even allowing the possibility of that is not good for industrial relations, and I therefore cannot accept the amendment.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was a political tour de force. I keep a list of Ministers&#151;which has not been updated since the change of Government, whom I would like to see declaring the start of world war three at the Dispatch Box. Potential contenters would say, ``Well, they're going to chuck down a few bouncers, but as long as we pad up it'll be all right'' or, in the tones of an extremely expensive lawyer, ``Recent developments have been extremely regrettable.'' I shall give the names privately to any member of the Committee who does not recognise the people I am talking about. Now we have a new contender&#151;someone who on the outbreak of the red revolution could be sent in and, in the blandest of tones, justify the unjustifiable, defend the indefensible and explain the inexplicable&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I warn my hon. Friend that under clause 3, keeping any sort of list&#151;particularly a list of trade union members&#151;will make one vulnerable to contravening the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Seeing the Whips on both sides of the Committee, it occurs to me that they would be out of business if a blacklist, which we will discuss later, were precluded. The Minister has made a marvellous attempt to pour oil on troubled waters, but our underlying concerns remain, particularly that although the Labour party has been unable to fulfil the precise term of its commitment to the electorate&#151;even though it made that provision so deliberately unambiguous&#151;that failure is merely a matter of course. The Minister acts as though we ought to be deeply grateful for the consideration that he has shown the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the claim that 40 per cent. constitutes a majority made by the Minister's silver tongue sets a precedent that could be dangerous in many different contexts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I realise that we could enter the nicer ranges of psephology, and I am not sure that I should do so.
<P>
This Committee has a defining moment, as is always the case. The Minister has advanced the red revolution, albeit in the tones of Islington, or North Swindon. We do not buy that revolution. The provisions are not likely to add to industrial harmony. Far from being in place of strife, they will be an occasion for strife. They will not advance the cause of working people or, ultimately, of trade unions. We shall have to register our dissent with a vote.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 240, in page 29, line 24, after `time', insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after section 1 and this Schedule come into force'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was most considerate of the Committee to take its time; it enabled us to gather our breath and, in my case, to find out that amendment No. 29, among other things, had passed us by in the general turmoil. I shall not attempt to incur your wrath, Mrs. Dunwoody, by speaking to it now, except to say that the Minister might like to study it and that we might want to return to the matter.
<P>
In speaking to amendment No. 240, we begin to go into the important area of voluntary recognition, which the Minister has conceded is generally his preferred option, rather than the statutory procedure. As I mentioned in the debate on clause 1, engineering employers and others have expressed the concern that a voluntary set of agreements that had been concluded before the Bill was contemplated might be somehow dragged into its provisions in a way that would make life more difficult for them.
<P>
For that purpose only, and not for any malign purpose of subverting the Bill, we suggest that the provisions on voluntary recognition at the beginning of part II of the schedule should apply only to agreements entered into after clause 1 and the schedule come into force. In other words, any fresh voluntary agreements that are concluded would be covered by the provisions of part II of the schedule. Old agreements could be revalidated under part II. However, if agreements include provisions that are not appropriate to part II, they should not be dragged into it by accident. The Minister should consider that important, reasonable suggestion, and I hope that his response will be encouraging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Far from conceding anything at all, I have made it clear throughout that we prefer voluntary agreements, so long as they are not used to evade recognition. Indeed, the procedures contain ample opportunities for voluntary agreements to be made for precisely that reason.
<P>
We fully agree that existing bargaining arrangements should not be interfered with under the Bill. One of the Government's aims is to maintain stable bargaining arrangements. Therefore, we should prefer not to interfere with existing arrangements.
<P>
We should have preferred to leave voluntary recognition out of the Bill altogether. However, as we stated in the explanatory notes, that could have created a loophole whereby an employer could claim to recognise a union voluntarily but fail to negotiate with it. The union could then not bring a claim under the procedure because it was already recognised. Part II of the schedule is simply designed to plug that loophole.
<P>
However, I accept that there is more than one way to achieve that aim and that the route that we have chosen, with the present wording of part II, may have more side effects than we and the hon. Member for Daventry would wish. We think that we have found a simpler, more elegant way to deal with the problem that does not interfere with existing voluntary recognition agreements but deals fully, and better than the current wording does, with the risk of evasion. We are still examining the detail to ensure that it is a genuine improvement, but if we are satisfied with it, we shall seek to incorporate it into the Bill.
<P>
I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to be a little patient; I realise how patient he has been so far, in several ways, but I hope that he can continue his fortitude a little longer. We hope that he will let us see whether we can table an amendment on Report that would go in the direction that he wishes without creating the means of circumventing the main provision of the schedule, which, inadvertently, the amendment would do.

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I have just finished. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn, because we still have a lot to get through.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I simply wish to establish whether the Minister was making a commitment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister has resumed his seat. The hon. Gentleman may make a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I thought that I was making a speech. I thought that it was important to establish that the Minister was making a commitment that the Government would table such an amendment on Report. That would be welcome. I was mildly concerned, however, that in what was otherwise a most reasonable statement, the Minister should say that he thought that the Government should see whether it was possible to table such an amendment. That did not seem to amount to a concrete commitment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I will reply, although I had sat down. I would not like the hon. Gentleman to continue in his uncertainty. I know how upsetting he finds such a state. As a connoisseur of language, I shall repeat exactly what I said, because it was very clear. I hope that he will get the message.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It was not very clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If I may repeat what I said, it will be clearer to the hon. Gentleman. I said that we accept that there may be more than one way of achieving our aim. We think that we have found a better way of achieving it; a way that is more elegant that may avoid the side-effects that currently exist. We think that it is a better way, but we are still examining the detail to see whether it is a genuine improvement. If it is, we shall seek to incorporate it in the Bill.
<P>
I have asked for the patience of Opposition Members while we seek, in a spirit of good faith, to ascertain whether it is a genuine improvement. If it is, we shall of course bring it forward. I am sure that Conservative Members would not wish us to table any amendments that were not genuine improvements.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 241, in page 30, line 34, at end insert `procedurally'.
<P>
It will have been worth waiting for this amendment. It is a piece of shorthand. By this stage, so much was raining upon us so thick and fast that, using the Minsters' phrase, I employed the minimalist technique of putting down a word to flag up a concern. We are anxious that in considering what has happened, the CAC should basically confine itself to the procedures involved rather than comment on the merits of the activity. The Minister has conceded that on several occasions.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to flag up a concern in the context of paragraph 37 (2) (b). As amended, it would read ``the parties have agreed such a method but have failed to carry out the agreement procedurally'', rather than suggesting that the parties have failed to carry out the substance of any collective bargaining agreement. That is important because the Committees must be reminded that we are dealing substantially with procedure, just as Ministers in establishing their reasonableness for the purposes of judicial review must show that they have acted correctly. We want trade unions and employers to negotiate, either voluntarily, as we would prefer, or compulsorily in certain circumstances, as the Government was to ensure. We do not want the procedural issue about behaviour mixed up with the substantive issue about pay or holiday conditions. The matter has been raised by several employers' organisations and I should like to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am happy to reassure the hon. Member for Daventry. To ``carry out'' an agreement in the legal sense means to comply with the terms of the agreement. If two parties agree a bargaining procedure, failure to follow it would allow the CAC to accept an application under part II of the schedule. The principle behind paragraph 37 is that the CAC will decide a bargaining method if the parties cannot so decide, or their agreement is not carried out. In that context, ``not carried out'' must remain as broad a term as possible to catch all substantial failures to follow a procedure. We are not requiring parties to agree. We are requiring a method to be followed. I hope that I have reassured him and that he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has reassured me substantially. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 154 in page 31, leave out lines 1 and 2.
<P>
If the Committee did not know it, it must have become evident this afternoon that I am not a lawyer&#151;however, nor is the Minister and we do not hold that against him. Legal terms such as ``specific performance'' are probably difficult for us to explain effectively. However, as lay people we can raise our hackles metaphorically at such a provision and ask the Committee to pause and think about the Government's intentions.
<P>
As a lay person, I am worried that the only way in which to remedy a breach of the procedures seems to be provided in paragraph 37(7) under the term ``specific performance'', meaning that the agreement must be carried out precisely and that there can be no compensation, and no other way or agreement to remedy the failure.
<P>
Perusing the schedule, one picks up references. I noticed that a provision further on refers also to specific performance. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us in words of one syllable exactly what the provision applies to, why it has been chosen and why it is the best way in which to deal with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall do my best, but briefly, to reassure the hon. Gentleman. The amendment deals with the bargaining methods to be decided by the CAC after a voluntarily recognised independent union and an employer have failed to reach an agreement. It would remove the restriction that the legally binding terms of the method could be enforced only by specific performance&#151;that is, by a court ordering specific actions to be taken to comply with the agreement.
<P>
The broader issue is why a bargaining method should, even in the last resort, be imposed on an employer who has voluntarily recognised a union. To put it simply, it is an anti-avoidance measure. Without it, an unscrupulous employer could recognise a union requesting statutory recognition and then fail to agree a bargaining method. It is therefore necessary for the CAC to decide an appropriate bargaining method and for that method to be legally enforceable.
<P>
The CAC's decision on a bargaining method is not final. The union and the employer can vary the method if they so wish. They can even agree that it should not be legally enforceable. If the parties cannot agree, it is important that they should know what will happen. Requiring specific performance removes doubt and it will, therefore, help to focus negotiations.
<P>
I hope that my remarks on amendment No. 240 will be of particular comfort to the hon. Member for Daventry. I remind the Committee that the Government are thinking further about the application of the schedule on voluntary recognition, and I am optimistic that we can improve the Bill still further. I hope that that will assist him and that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am a softie for the Minister's style. He is probably right. My fear is that an improvement will mean another six pages on the schedule&#151;I hope to goodness that it will not. I understand the Minister's helpful explanation and his good will in seeking to meet his objectives by the most effective means. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Committee will be conscious that I have had rather a lot to say this afternoon, so would it be possible to have a recess from now until about, say 6.21 pm, so that we can all catch our breath before considering the substantial Government amendment that awaits us?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 246.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As a result of our continuing consultations, to which I have had many opportunities today to refer, we have been aware for some time that schedule 1 should contain a method for dealing with changes in the bargaining unit. It is a complex topic, and we have tried to cover all eventualities properly. Our aim is to provide a method that is as definitive as possible, but which provides the CAC with discretion to make a sensible decision if the parties cannot agree.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will be patient as I try to explain the need for, and the function of, this new part of schedule 1, which I accept is rather lengthy. The procedure will apply when there are significant changes in a business. It will apply after a change in the nature of the business&#151;for example, a change from producing chickens to eggs. Secondly, it will apply after a genuine change in the structure of the business, such as managing chicken farms centrally, rather than as individual units. Thirdly, it will apply if the number of workers changes substantially and there is a case for changing the bargaining unit.
<P>
In all those cases, old bargaining arrangements may not be appropriated to the changed business. A fair procedure for assessing the necessary changes is required. Part IIA is intended to serve that function. The procedure in Part IIA is not dissimilar to the recognition process. I have taken the helpful advice of the hon. Member for Daventry regarding the flow diagrams that Members of the Committee should have received, showing how the process will operate. The basic structure is the same. The CAC must decide if the parties cannot agree.
<P>
The CAC may rule that the original unit is appropriate, has ceased to exist or is inappropriate, or that a new unit is appropriate. If a new unit is appropriate, that may trigger a procedure for assessing support that closely parallels the procedure for recognition. I appreciate that the devil is in the detail of the provisions, and I shall be grateful for constructive comments from Opposition Members.
<P>
Having described the effect of amendment No. 245, I shall touch on amendment No. 246. That is mostly a direct consequence of the procedure for changing the bargaining unit, which allows the derecognition procedure in part III to deal with bargaining units determined through part IIA. However, we have also taken advantage of the opportunity to remove the defunct paragraph 39, an artefact of earlier drafts of the Bill. I hope that hon. Members will accept the amendments in the constructive spirit in which they were intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Committee would not wish me to repeat my comments on the genesis of the amendments. Consultation is fine, but it is not a good idea to throw the Bill at us in this substantial way.
<P>
That has cramped the style of Opposition Members. In the circumstances, I will speak, stream of consciousness style, about the points that struck me when I studied the amendments over the weekend. If I delay or hesitate, it will be because the copy that I was given did not have line numbers; I will have to do my best with the references that I made.
<P>
I do not argue about the principle. The Minister is right; we need to set down a proper exit procedure from a bargaining unit and to redefine circumstances. He may need to consider what is or is not a substantial change in regard to industrial organisation. The CAC may wish to reflect on that and give guidance in due course. He used the example&#151;no doubt in deference to me&#151;of chickens and eggs; I have not checked, but if he looks at the VAT classifications, he will find that as the balance alters between different kinds of farming, for example, the VAT designation changes. I suspect&#151;I may be wrong&#151;that that does not happen between chickens and eggs, which are closely related. We need to understand what constitutes a substantial change in industrial activity, apart from the other changes that the Minister sensibly mentioned.
<P>
On the text of the amendment&#151;which is 11 pages long, plenty of Bills are considerably shorter&#151;paragraph 37A (3) (b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``anything effective as, or as if contained in, a legally enforceable contract''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I can understand something being effective as a legal contract but, although I appreciate that it is a lawyerly phrase, I am not sure of the distinction between something that is not effective as a legal contract and something that is ``as if contained in'' one. The Minister should clarify that.
<P>
Paragraph 37D(1) states that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``applies if the employer believes or the union believes (or the unions believe) that the original unit is no longer an appropriate bargaining unit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Using the subjective notion of belief is always difficult. As I reflected on the provision, I realised that there was not much point in the employer believing that change was appropriate if he then did nothing about it under paragraph 37D(2). Perhaps the Minister should consider an objective as well as a mental test of the employer's or the union's belief in such cases.
<P>
I am on slightly firmer ground in my next comment on paragraph 37D(2); it contains a misprint. The word used should be ``appropriate'', but there is a typo. That proves that I have read the amendment.
<P>
The word ``substantial'' is used in paragraph 37E(2)(c). We have already debated an amendment on the use of the word ``substantial''. Perhaps the Minister's response to this point will be the same as that which he made in that debtate.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Under paragraph 37E(3)(b), the CAC will be required to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``give notice of its decision to the parties.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Not only should that be done in writing&#151;I am sure that the CAC would wish to do so&#151;but it would be helpful if it would take account of the considerations that I mentioned in the brief exchanges on chickens and eggs and the reasons for taking such decisions.
<P>
Of course, we do not want barrack-room lawyers to be involved in the process. We want change to take place reasonably flexibly, but it must be based on principle and the corpus of practice that is built up. In this and the other contexts that I have mentioned, we must make it clear to those who want to make such applications whether they are likely to succeed because they fall within the normal criteria.
<P>
Paragraph 37F(2)(c) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the method of collective bargaining relating to the original unit shall have effect in relation to the new unit, with any modifications which the CAC considers necessary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is interesting that the bargaining unit will change, but the method will continue. I appreciate the fact that, as there is a provision for modification, then in a sense there may be a distinction without a difference. Perhaps it makes no difference whether something is called a new method&#151;like new Labour&#151;when it is actually the old bargain, or whether it is called the old method with modifications. That may amount to the same thing.
<P>
It is an interesting conceptually to consider whether that is really the same thing, or whether it would have been better to say that a new bargaining unit triggers a new bargain but that it should not necessarily be different, or that the CAC may provide for the same method of collective bargaining as the old one but with any appropriate modification. Perhaps the Minister will understand what I am driving at.
<P>
What will be the legal status of the recognition arrangement? Under paragraph 37G(2)(b), if the CAC decides that the original unit does not continue to be an appropriate bargaining unit, it is faced with a choice&#151;one of our logical trees. It can decide which other bargaining unit is appropriate, or that no other unit is appropriate. I would understand if the CAC were to choose some other bargaining unit, but if it were to decide that no other unit is appropriate, the union, or unions, might be recognised for collective bargaining but they would not have reached stage 2, because no bargaining unit is apparently appropriate. That is a loose end, but perhaps the Minister will convince me otherwise.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Paragraph 37G(5) (d) refers to taking into account ``the characteristics of workers falling within the original unit and of any other employees of the employer whom the CAC considers relevant''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let us suppose that an employer was considering taking on new workers, but they had not been hired when the decision to expand a unit was taken&#151;they were expected, but had not been recruited. Are not the characteristics of those new workers relevant to that decision? It might make a difference.
<P>
For instance, although it is hardly in the centre of our minds, worries about a lack of ethnic minority representation or a gender imbalance might be drawn to the employer's attention and, reasonably enough, he might want to do something about it. It would be odd, in such a case, to take account of the existing work force, including employees who were not in that particular unit, but to take no account of the new workers who might join the firm.
<P>
Paragraph 37L(1) (a) would apply if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the employer believes that the original unit had ceased to exist''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder what would happen if a unit had substantially ceased to exist. I cheer the Minister by using his own word&#151;no I do not; he used the word ``significant'' and I like ``substantial'', but I shall use the word again. I am worried what happens when a unit has in fact come to an end, but not completely. A classic case of that would be of an industry being shut down but with one or two workrs being retained on a care and maintenance basis pending the sale or realisation of the company's assets.
<P>
In such a case, an employer might reasonably believe that the unit had ceased to exist; but something would still be there. The Minister may need to consider making a separate provision to cover circumstances where a unit is not what it was but has been run down to virtually nothing.
<P>
I pass quickly to proposed paragraph 37U, which is headed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Position where CAC decides new unit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Sub-paragraph (2) lists a series of tests for the CAC to meet, one of which may be too rigorous. Sub-paragraph (2) (a) requires that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at least one worker falling within the new unit also falls within another bargaining unit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Would it be possible to arrange for transfers between the old and the new reorganised unit? I am not sure whether I have got it right, but the Minister needs to explain the circumstances in which one unit can turn into the other. It seems a rather odd test that just one employee should have transferred or be treated as having been in both units.
<P>
Under paragraph 37V(1)(a), the CAC has to decide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether the difference between the original unit and the new unit is such that the support of the union (or unions) within the new unit needs to be assessed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not clear whether that is simply a test about union opinion on the matter or whether it is also an objective test that would require the CAC to determine that there was an actual difference. If the latter, it should be explained.
<P>
Paragraph 37X(6)(a) refers to the CAC issuing a declaration, that will have effect in place of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any declaration or agreement that the union is . . . recognised as entitled to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of the original unit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure whether that overrides a legally binding collective agreement that is already in place. The hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth said that not many collective bargaining agreements are legally binding. However, if one were legally binding, does the Bill empower the CAC to overrule it, or would it be precluded from doing so?
<P>
Paragraph 37Z refers to situations when the CAC is notified that it must arrange to hold a ballot. Will the Minister explain who will be paying for the ballot in those circumstances? It is not clear whether the requester would be acting in accordance with the existing framework. I have tried manfully&#151;no doubt you will be relieved to hear, Mrs. Dunwoody that I have failed&#151;to find any comments to make on paragraph 37AA. I am deeply obliged to the Minister, however, because once I got into the amendment I had a little bet with myself on whether it would be necessary to go round the alphabet. The Minister obliged me by doing so.
<P>
I hope that the Minister has gained reinforcement for his argument, but my concluding comments relate to amendment No. 246. It was so closely related to amendment No. 245 in the printed copy that I received originally that they ran together and had to be disentangled. I touched on a point earlier to which the Minister did not respond. Let us suppose that there is a declaration of a transfer or that the original unit is confirmed. I am still not clear about the sanctions on an employer who does not want to have anything to do with the declaration, who may even go through the motions, but who does not conduct collective bargaining in good faith.
<P>
If I were a disagreeable employer and had got through the 27 provisions of the schedule&#151;if my mathematics are right, that is the number of letters in the alphabet plus the letter ``AA''&#151;and had understood them even to a tiny degree, I am not sure whether I would necessarily want to take collective bargaining as seriously as perhaps I should. The Committee should consider a point of substance, which is that we must think not only about what we are setting out to do, but what will end up being done on the ground. That brings me back to the real world, after those excursions that were my preliminary thoughts on a late-delivered amendment to which I hope the Minister will respond in detail.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I shall be brief, perhaps because I have no option to be otherwise, having had little time to absorb the amendment. If my comments are covered somewhere in its text, I apologise in advance to the Minister.
<P>
Paragraph 37D introduces the measures to deal with the position in which either party believes the unit no longer to be appropriate. Paragraph 37E(2) sets out the matters that would reflect a change in the bargaining unit. The Minister may recall that I asked this morning whether the changes in a bargaining unit should be wider. At the moment, the measure deals with changes in the organisational structure of the business, the change in the activities pursued by the employer or a change in the number of workers. We are never sure which comes first&#151;the chickens or the eggs.
<P>
The dynamics of the workplace are such that a substantial change in the number of workers could lead to a change in their wishes with regard to union recognition. Given the great flexibility and mobility of the work force, a significant turnover in the workplace is common&#151;in some cases, it can be 20 or 30 per cent. a year. The trade union movement has also been restructured extensively over the past decade or so, with unions merging and some disappearing altogether. It is not too difficult to envisage circumstances in which a bargaining unit in its wider sense, which involves the recognised union, could after several years completely fail to reflect the work force employed in that bargaining unit.
<P>
In a nutshell, will the Minister let me know whether he has considered that? It is not clear from the amendment, which deals with changes in organisational structure, in activities or in the number of workers. He might like to reflect on the further point of change in the union membership and in the work force, and changes in the concept of the union that should be recognised as the union with collective bargaining rights.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I now fully understand why the hon. Member for Daventry required a six-minute recess to recoup his strength. To borrow a phrase from the distinguished Lord Jenkins, he made a luscious cornucopia of points. I am afraid that my handwriting has not been quick enough to register all of them. With your permission, Mrs. Dunwoody, and that of the hon. Members for Daventry and for Eastleigh, I propose to study them carefully with the aid of the accurate record that Hansard will produce, so that I can be absolutely confident that I shall deal with each one with the care and attention that they all merit. I shall write to each hon. Member with a full and detailed response to their points. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a new technique, but, given the nature of the beast and hon. members' common wish to achieve the best possible legislation, the Minister has implicitly, as well as explicitly in his encomium, to use another lush word, suggested that we are trying to improve things, as we are. He can now consult his lawyers, and tell me that I have got it all wrong, in which case I shall be relieved. However, it has been worth the process, and that is the best way to deal with it in the circumstances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 155, in Page 32, line 2, leave out `3' and insert `2'.
<P>
This is a rather smaller group of amendments than the previous one. We are the minimalists in that respects. The amendments make both a serious point and a probing point. The serious point is that already made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh about the rapid change of industrial organisation. Things change fast, and it is important to enable procedures, especially those prescribed in statute, to take place as swiftly and conveniently as possible.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment was to probe the Minister's intention to allow a three-year old period to elapse before such matters can be reconsidered. It is the only time that we have tabled such an amendment to the Bill, although the point has general application. I understand his desire for stability. We cannot keep changing the bargaining arrangements, whether statutory or voluntary, every 10 minutes at the drop of a hat. On the other hand, as the Minister mentioned, industrial relations are subject to rapid turnover, and we must find a balance. It would be helpful if the Minister were to consider our suggestion of a two-year period as a reasonable period to elapse before changes are contemplated, or defend his choice of a three-year period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, one of the key aspects of our proposals is the desire to promote stability in industrial relations. Both the CBI and the TUC agreed about that in their joint statement, which formed the basis of the proposals in the White Paper. They agreed that once the issue of recognition had been settled, it should not be re-opened for three years. When faced with two such organisations acting as social partners and agreeing, we felt that we should agree that three years was a reasonable period to allow to elapse before an employer could apply for derecognition or a union that had failed to gain recognition might make a new application.
<P>
The problem with the amendment is not merely that it runs counter to the thinking behind the joint CBI and TUC statement, but that it would break the symmetry between applications for derecognition and repeat applications for recognition. The former would be possible after two years, but the latter would have to wait three years. That is an unwelcome asymmetry.
<P>
I understand the thinking behind the amendment and the changing nature of the work force to which hon. Members have referred, but there is no logic in the proposal to address those concerns and it would not help the cause of stable industrial relations, which we all want to promote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister who deployed a good argument and rightly referred the Committee to the agreement. I hope that he will remember that he is in the business of legislating and that social partners, although valuable in such matters, should not be assumed always to be right, from whatever side of industry they come.
<P>
My main concern is the need for flexibility where appropriate, but there is no general filter to enable a change to take place. That may be possible with voluntary changes and if there were a statutory recognition, the parties could switch that off by initiating a new voluntary agreement so long as it did not frustrate the collective decision. They could reconstitute themselves, for example.
<P>
Will the Minister reflect on whether it would be possible to provide a way out, not just for the convenience of one or other party, but if the structure that had been created was inimical to good industrial relations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> When there is a rapid change of circumstances in the workplace, such as a change of unions or employer, there should be scope for voluntary agreements to change the bargaining unit or the union, with the fallback being the statutory period of three years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That might be helpful, but it would be difficult if a statutory arrangement has been concluded. That is one of our arguments in principle against a statutory arrangement. However, if the parites wanted to make a change, which is genuine and not a device to subvert the decision of the Central Arbitration Committee, it is worth considering that as a way out of our concern about the flexibility of the arrangements.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 220, in page 33, line 11, leave out from `within the' to `and' in line 12 and insert `decision period'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 221 and 233.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> This is a large group of amendments, but I shall not speak for long because they are technical amendments to allow the CAC to extend the 10-day decision period if there is good reason for doing so and to extend the 28-day negotiation period with the consent of the parites. That will provide valuable additional flexibility to help to ensure that decisions are not rushed, while keeping the working of the CAC as brisk as possible.
<P>
There is nothing objectionable in the amendments and I hope that the Opposition will accept them in the spirit of constructive improvement that has been evident in the Committee today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perhaps I could say two things, one of which is a message to avert disaster. First, we are content with the amendment. We understand that it is necessary. Secondly, with good will on both sides of the Committee&#151;I find myself in the position of the great unwhipped&#151;we might be able to hack our way through business and conclude a fruitful day.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 33, line 26, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) and states the reasons why the employer seeks to end the bargaining arrangements.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the spirit of general accord, I shall be extremely brief. The amendment relates to the requirement that trade unions which are seeking recognition are required to give their reasons and go through the due process as set out in the Bill. That is fair enough, but it is not unreasonable to require employers who seek derecognition of unions to give their reasons for that. Employers sometimes deliberately try to frustrate the process. They put pressure on collective bargaining procedures and union representatives by using spurious reasons to suggest that there should be derecognition. Will the Minister assure me that there is sufficient protection to prevent that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I have no difficulty with the intention behind this amendment. Indeed, the Government would always encourage explanation and openness between parties. It is likely that in many cases the employer will inform the union and the work force why he or she is seeking to end the arrangements. There is certainly nothing in the Bill to prevent that happening.
<P>
However, I disagree with the hon. Gentleman that such prescription makes a useful addition to the schedule. The purpose of schedule 1 is to set out the procedures for recognition of a trade union to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of a group of workers and the statutory procedures for derecognition. It is not designed to require the parties to set out their reasoning for seeking to invoke either procedure.
<P>
There are risks in the hon. Gentleman's approach. If the employer gave only partial grounds for seeking derecognition or if it emerged that the explanation on the written application was not the real reason, or was slightly misleading, would that invalidate the application? It is better for the parties' motivation to be explored in the informal negotiations which take place, and which we encourage either between the parties alone or with the assistance of ACAS or the CAC. There is no advantage in requiring reasons to be included in the written application.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary and will serve only to complicate further a procedure which is sufficiently complicated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's explanation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 223, in page 34, line 16, leave out `14' and insert `10 working'.&#151;[Mr. Wills.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 248, in page 34, line 33, leave out `10' and insert `20'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 249, in page 35, line 17, leave out `10' and insert `20'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Bill provides that the CAC can decide whether a union should be derecognised where it is satisfied that that is likely to have sufficient support within the bargaining units to make proceeding with the application worthwhile. That is clear and understood. The test is that at least 10 per cent. of the workers in a bargaining unit favour an end to the collective bargaining arrangements and that the majority would be likely to do so. The purpose of these probing amendments is to ask why the threshold is set at 10 per cent. Would it not be safer to set the limit at 20 per cent. of the work force?
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There have recently been disturbing reports about American firms that market themselves as specialists in union busting and advertise the fact that they have great expertise in disrupting bargaining arrangements. Even more disturbing is the fact that we understand that they are gearing up to marketing their services in the United Kingdom. The 10 per cent. threshold could make their work much easier than it should be.
<P>
I look to the Minister to respond to the points that I have raised. Will he explain why he thinks that the 10 per cent. threshold is sufficient to protect well-founded collective bargaining arrangements from what I can only call the predatory practices of the union-busting firms that now see this country as an extension of their market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that, by setting out the Government's intentions, I can reassure the hon. Member for Eastleigh a little. In drafting the Bill, we have maintained a strong parallel, as I have said several times today, between the recognition and derecognition procedures. The amendments would create an undesirable asymmetry between those procedures.
<P>
As the Bill is drafted, for an employer or the workers themselves to make an application for derecognition, they must show that at least 10 per cent. of the bargaining unit favour an end to the collecting bargaining arrangements and that a majority of the workers are likely to do so. That is essentially the same test as for recognition procedures. It is not an easy test. It is arguably harder for a group of workers without a union organisation to obtain that evidence than for a union seeking evidence of support for recognition. Nevertheless, it is equitable for the deregulation procedure to be as far as possible a mirror image of the procedure for recognition.
<P>
The question of union busting has periodically surfaced in the media and I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns about it. This country has no tradition of union-busting consultants, and I believe that any company that adopted union-busting tactics would risk paying a high price. It would possibly do lasting damage to its relationship with its work force and would also damage its public relations. People in this country would not welcome such activities, and companies that carried them out would be likely to find themselves in difficulty. Good employers will not want to use union busters and bad ones will find that they do only harm. I do not think that there is much future for such organisations in this country.
<P>
It is always difficult to strike a balance, but we believe that the Bill provides a fair balance for both parties by using the same test for recognition and derecognition. The hon. Gentleman's amendments, well intentioned as I accept they are, would upset that balance and make it significantly harder for a derecognition application to pass the initial test of support and be able to proceed to a ballot. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response. I understand the Government's thinking on the derecognition process, but I hope that he is right in his assumptions about the potential activities of union-busting consultants. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendments probe the circumstance in which the Central Arbitration Committee needs, according to the provision in paragraph 52, to decide on two points separately. First, paragraph 52(1)(a) states that the CAC must not proceed with an application under paragraph 51 unless it decides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at least 10 per cent. of the workers constituting the bargaining unit favour an end of the bargaining arrangements''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Secondly, paragraph 52(1)(b) states that the CAC must not so proceed unless it decides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there is prima facie evidence that the majority of the workers constituting the bargaining unit would be likely to favour an end of the bargaining arrangements''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I understand it, both tests need to be met. If both amendments were accepted, only one of those tests would need to be met. That would seem sensible in the circumstances, but if the Minister thinks otherwise I shall listen to his explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Once again, we encounter the problem of asymmetry between recognition procedures and derecognition procedures. The amendments would create just such an undesirable asymmetry. When making an application for recognition, a union must show that at least 10 per cent. of the bargaining unit are union members and that a majority of the workers in the proposed bargaining unit is likely to favour recognition. The provision is intended to deter frivolous or unfounded applications for recognition. Similarly, we do not want frivolous or unfounded applications for derecognition, which is why we propose that an application for derecognition should show both that 10 per cent. of those in the bargaining unit favour derecognition and that the majority of the bargaining unit is likely to support derecognition.
<P>
We believe that the Bill strikes a fair balance for both parties by applying the same tests for recognition and derecognition. The amendment would increase the risk&#151;which I am sure that the hon. Member for Daventry would not want to see realised&#151;of hopeless applications being put to a ballot. Neither employers, nor unions, nor Committee members would support that, and I therefore hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We need not be slavish in our pursuit of symmetry. The Minister has made the best case that he can and I shall say no more about it. Given the way that even lawyers sometimes interpret the necessary conjunctions, the provision may not work out quite as the Minister expects.

<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> If I have understood the amendment correctly, under the 10 per cent. provision, would not it be possible for three employees in a plant employing 22 people continuously to ask the CAC to intervene?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 160, in page 43, line 48, after `acted', insert `primarily'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendments relate to an important part of schedule 1, which, at this comparatively late hour, might not receive the attention that it deserves.
<P>
I understand the Minister's point about detriment and dismissal being in the nature of victimisation. That is consistent with the proposal for provisions to deal with that. The concern enshrined in the two parallel amendments is that it is sometimes difficult to disentangle motives, either of the worker or employer. It is important to have a test that will stand up in court and which is reasonably intelligible, especially when it is a legal test that might be used in an employment tribunal and result in a compensation award.
<P>
It is not always entirely clear what people's motives are, and there might be more than one. For example, one might be purely accidental and another might include some malice that has nothing to do with union recognition. We are trying to disentangle something like the primary purpose rule in immigration matters, which does not have a happy history but does, at least, have a legal foundation. According to the primary purpose rule, it would be necessary for someone&#151;I suspect, in this case, the tribunal&#151;to determine whether there was a primary intention to disrupt recognition, or to promote it, or whether the action was a by&#151;product of a situation relating to the workers' general relations with their employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The amendments would significantly weaken employees' protection against victimisation.
<P>
Paragraphs 74 and 79 are carefully drafted to ensure that workers are protected only for reasonable acts. The combined effect of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) in each case is to protect workers against detrimental acts and omissions or dismissal by the employer for the reasons set out in sub-paragraph (2).
<P>
The effect of the amendments would be that, if the employee acted primarily for some purpose other than obtaining or preventing recognition, the protection would not apply. Consider, for example, an employee who sought to persuade other employees to join, or not to join, a trade union. The ulterior purpose might be to secure or prevent recognition, for example by helping the union to reach 10 per cent. membership or more than the 50 per cent. threshold, but the immediate purpose might relate to membership, not recognition. The amendment would remove protection for such activity.
<P>
The amendment would then invite arguments about the primary purpose of the employee. As the hon. Member for Daventry said, it can be extremely difficult to disentangle motivation in such areas, separating out reasons for actions in order to decide which was the most important. As he said, the precedent of the primary purpose rule in immigration matters is an unhappy one, so inviting legal wrangling, as the amendment would do, is not something that we can accept.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry may say&#151;he did not, but he may&#151;that the amendments are nevertheless necessary to ensure that workers are not protected for acts that are damaging to the employer and which have only a distant connection with the issue of recognition. We anticipated that, which is why I am happy to bring the matter to the hon. Gentleman's attention. Acts that are in breach of contract or otherwise unreasonable are excluded from protection by sub-paragraph (3) of each relevant paragraph. That prevents&#151;more effectively than the amendments&#151;abuse of the protection. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. I shall have to declare myself a detriment sceptic, if such a term is allowed. An employee might carry out an unreasonable act, for which an interest in union recognition is prayed in aid&#151;the Minister rightly intuited that point. The provision in sub-paragraph (3) of each relevant paragraph might meet that problem. The Committee should reflect on that, and perhaps return to the matter. I appreciate that the Minister has made some attempt to answer my points. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Member for Eastleigh and I are making the same point. As good democrats, when we see that a provision allows a Minister to change something&#151;through an affirmative resolution&#151;if it is not working as he wants, we metaphorically reach for our revolvers, and say ``Hang on a bit''. Having hired a dog in the shape of the CAC, the Minister&#151;who might not like the way that it barks&#151;might propose to bark in its place. The amendment would tie his decision to the CAC, which would effectively have a veto over his powers. That would complement the Secretary of State's veto. I am sceptical, however, about whether the affirmative resolution procedure is sufficient to curb the ambitions of Ministers.
<P>
The amendment would provide a sensible filter. Clearly, the CAC should make an input, and the Minister should not want any Secretary of State, of any party, in any future circumstances, to run around making changes at whim, unless there were a proven wrong or ill that required remedy. The experts and practitioners of the CAC should make a proper input, the Secretary of State should have ultimate responsibility for conveying that to Parliament, and Parliament should have responsibility for the decision.
<P>
We could debate this matter endlessly; tonight it is sufficient to flag up our concerns.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Following the remarks made by the hon. Member for Daventry, I should like to address amendment No. 251. The hon. Gentleman said that we were all good democrats, but suggested a restrictive approach&#151;which may not be unwarranted&#151;to shackling Ministers. As I am a Liberal Democrat, I would not want to go as far as the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
On automatic recognition, the question is whether the Secretary of State should decide to amend paragraph 14 because the CAC says that it has had an unsatisfactory effect. If the Secretary of State does not alter paragraph 14 in the way proposed, surely it would not be unreasonable to place an obligation on the Secretary of State to give his or her reasons for doing so in writing. The amendment is as simple as that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Again, hon. Members start from the same position with the same ultimate goals but disagree on how to achieve them.
<P>
I shall first address amendment No. 161. It places the CAC and the Secretary of State in conflict and gives the CAC a right of veto over the Secretary of State. In our view the Secretary of State is better placed to take a broad view of the public interest. That is his job. He can act only with the consent of both Houses of Parliament, as the affirmative procedure will apply.
<P>
The logic of the existing wording is simple. It is right that Parliament should scrutinise the Secretary of State's actions, but we do not want to set dangerous precedents here. We have set out clearly in the paragraph what we want to see. The CAC is responsible for the operation of paragraph 14, so it is best placed to judge whether the paragraph is not working satisfactorily. The Secretary of State is responsible for deciding the best way to resolve the problem, taking the CAC's advice into account and then putting a solution before Parliament for approval. To put the CAC in charge of amending the automatic recognition procedure and the Secretary of State in charge of deciding when it needs amending is the wrong way round. I therefore invite the hon. Member for Daventry to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh makes a very reasonable point in amendment No. 251. He wishes to require the Secretary of State to justify to Parliament any decision to amend paragraph 14&#151;the automatic recognition procedure&#151;that is not proposed by the CAC. I think that everyone shares his desire&#151;certainly the Government do&#151;for the Secretary of State to explain his decision to Parliament. Indeed, I would go further: the Secretary of State should have to explain himself if he takes the CAC's advice as well. That is why any change to paragraph 14 must be scrutinised by both Houses of Parliament, as paragraph 14(4) requires. The Secretary of State will have to explain and defend his actions before a professionally critical audience, whose job is to scrutinise what he does.
<P>
The amendment is therefore unnecessary, and I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will be sufficiently reassured to seek to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is probably getting a bit late for scepticism, but I notice that the Minister, albeit unconsciously, cast Secretaries of State for the time being in the role of objective and disinterested public servants who reach great decisions entirely on their merits. Some of us are a touch sceptical about that.
<P>
We also feel that the procedure, particularly as operated by the Government, to consider these matters in regulations is not a deathless procedure for resolving all these issues in the best of all possible worlds.
<P>
I concede that the Government have provided for the input of the CAC by way of advice and the input of Parliament by way of affirmative resolution. I am not sure that that is the perfect solution, not least because the Minister has not committed himself to explanations in writing. He may remember, and may wish to refer to, the provisions in the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 that require the Minister to explain why he might diverge from any recommendation of the Low Pay Commission. I have those in mind because we have recently been considering recommendations where that point arose. He might find that a useful precedent to reflect on. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 45, line 38, leave out `must' and insert `may'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 252, in page 45, line 40, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the CAC shall in each case provide written reasons for its decision'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As we close what has been a fairly constructive day, I want first to disabuse the Committee of any suggestion that the form of the amendment is designed to subvert the CAC's activities. If the Minister has that on his brief, he can chuck that bit away. The amendment is a vehicle for a debate on a general duties clause. That is perhaps not the best thing to undertake at 7.30 pm so I shall not do so in extenso.
<P>
The Minister produces a ringing declaration of the CAC's general duties in the first part of paragraph 87 and then disturbingly withdraws it in the second part. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the CAC must have regard to the object of encouraging and promoting fair and efficient practices and arrangements in the workplace''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We do not disagree with that. It is like motherhood and apple pie, and entirely consistent with the tenor of our debate. What worries me is the way in which the paragraph continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``so far as having regard to that object is consistent with applying other provisions of this Schedule in the case concerned.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The small print of this already rather bloated schedule in effect concedes that there will be cases that will not encourage and promote
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``fair and efficient practices and arrangements in the workplace.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister clearly has that expectation&#151;otherwise, there would be no need to include the saving clause. He needs to justify his approach.
<P>
I have considerable sympathy with what I suspect the hon. Member for Eastleigh is going to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> This is the same old story, I am afraid, but I hope that its significance will not be diminished by repetition. How can we keep a record of the way in which the CAC goes about its business? Its general duties are set out in paragraph 87, which is a catch-all paragraph.
<P>
It is not unreasonable to place a clear requirement on the CAC to provide written reasons for its decisions. Our attitude is not meant to imply a watchdog approach to the CAC's performance; it recognises the fact that the CAC takes decisions that will have a wide and significant impact in the workplace and on the development of industrial relations. The CAC will take important decisions. To establish good practice and give good guidance for industrial relations, it should have a duty to set out in writing the reasons for its decisions. That would help others to understand how it interprets the law and guide the interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. I welcome the Minister's attitude which will encourage that helpful approach to industrial relations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Our view of both of the amendments is essentially the same. Our proposals will help the CAC to conduct its business fairly, efficiently and practically.
<P>
Amendment No. 162 would have a bizarre effect. The Government are committed to ensuring fairness and efficiency at work. However, the amendment would replace the word ``must'' with ``may''. That suggests the hon. Member for Daventry is indifferent about whether the CAC actually promotes fair and efficient practices. I am not sure what the amendment is getting at. We shall place a duty on the CAC to promote fair and efficient practices. The amendment would merely allow it to do so. I suspect that it is a probing amendment and that the hon. Gentleman is worried about the saving clause.
<P>
The schedule's provisions will be applied to the CAC's general duty, but not because we think that anything in the schedule is unfair or inefficient. On the contrary: as I have said on many occasions, we believe that the schedule&#151;and the Bill&#151;will promote fairness and efficiency. The CAC should be able to get on with deciding the best way in which to promote fair and efficient practices without having to consider on every occasion whether the schedule's provisions are met and whether fair and efficient practices are in fact promoted.
<P>
The Government's intention is to ensure that the schedule promotes fair and efficient practices, and it is the Committee's role to facilitate that. The CAC's role will be to implement the relevant provisions to the best effect for workers and employers. To do so, its general duty should be as it is described in the Bill.
<P>
I am afraid that we will find it difficult to accept amendment No. 252. It would interfere with the CAC's performing its duties in a practical way. We expect the CAC to give its decisions and reasons in writing in almost all cases, but it may be desirable for some minor decisions&#151;for example, on minor procedural matters&#151;to be conveyed orally in the interests of speed and efficiency.
<P>
<H5>7.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The CAC will normally give reasons for its decisions, but occasionally it may regard that as unnecessary or undesirable&#151;for example, if it might damage industrial relations or criticise an individual. The CAC increases its risk of judicial review if it decides not to give written decisions with reasons, but it would not be right to oblige it to do so in every case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I find the Minister's explanation and his attempt to deal with the technical deficiencies of the amendment, which I readily conceded, implausible. However, I am conscious of the requirements of the working time directive and the Committee may have pushed itself to its limits today. The Minister has tried hard in the regretted absence of his colleague. We have not got all that we wanted, although we have received some assurances. There will no doubt be opportunities for further discussion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
