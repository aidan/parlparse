<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I welcome you to the Chair for this afternoon's proceedings, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
Before the break, I understand that the my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary—
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. The other Minister—the Economic Secretary—was in the middle of her interesting reply. Why, without explanation, have the Ministers switched? They do not look at all alike.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's assurance on that point.
<P>
I was about to say that it was indeed my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary who spoke to the Committee before the break, but she is unable to join us this afternoon. I shall pick up the threads where she left off. She was explaining why the amendment was not needed and that there was a good reason why the clause was drafted as it is. It is intended to allow the Treasury to make provision for anything relating to the authorised unit trust proposals in chapter III of this part of the Bill. It is not intended that the Treasury should make provision for matters that would, in the case of authorised unit trusts, be covered by FSA rules. Broadly speaking, the general shape of the authorised unit trust and open-ended investment company provisions will be on all fours. Anything covered by FSA rules on authorised unit trusts will also be covered, where appropriate, by FSA rules on OEICs.
<P>
Subsections (2)(k) and (3)(a) make it clear that the Treasury can confer rule-making functions on the FSA in respect of OEICs. Under the amendment, the Treasury would effectively be given the same rule-making powers as the FSA under chapter III, which is not our intention. I hope that in that light, Opposition Members will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I thank the Minister, or I should say Ministers, for their comments. They claim that the issue in the amendment is already answered by the clause as drafted. If so, we will withdraw. However, with the response having been split in the middle, I am not entirely sure that that is what they are saying. Our probing amendment is intended to allow the possibility of establishing companies when capital fluctuates but remains fully open at all times. We request simple confirmation that the clause permits that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We want to achieve consistency between what is happening on this front and with authorised unit trusts. If that meets the hon. Gentleman's point, I can confirm that the answer is yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am still slightly unclear, as it may not be possible to have fluctuating capital with unit trusts. There is also the wider point that the industry is eagerly awaiting clarification on several matters relating to OEICs, which are delaying their development. However, that is a point for the future, not the present. I certainly thought that the Economic Secretary said before the break that our point had been taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My hon. Friend may well have given that assurance, but I think that she probably did so on amendment No. 798, rather than amendment No. 799. Amendment No. 798 refers to fluctuating capital, and I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman picked up the point in the context of that amendment, rather than the present one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I apologise. My mind was focused particularly on the point in question. I am happy with what the Minister has said and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 800, in page 118, line 17, after `Authority' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and their modification or waiver in circumstances prescribed by such rules'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment is similar to the previous one. Clause 233(3)(c) provides for open-ended investment company regulations to authorise the FSA to make rules. The amendment would make it clear that the FSA's rule-making powers included the modification and waiver of such rules, in the same way as is permitted for unit trusts under clause 220. Given that the situation is the same as that for unit trusts, I assume, if I may anticipate the Minister, that the Government are happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We agree that the FSA should be able to grant rule waivers and modifications in relation to open-ended investment companies. However, the hon. Gentleman has perhaps anticipated matters because the amendment is not necessary to achieve his aim. Subsections (2)(k) and (3)(b), together, are adequate to enable the Treasury to give the FSA power to make rule waivers and modifications in relation to OEICs. There is a danger that making specific provision of the kind in the amendment could cast doubt on the width of those powers in other respects. We have expressed our intention that the FSA should be able to waive and modify rules. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am glad to hear the Government's interpretation of subsections (2)(k) and (3)(b). On the basis that they achieve our objective, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Schemes constituted in other EEA States</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 801, in page 119, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`2(A) If, notwithstanding the receipt of a certificate under subsection (3)(a), the Authority is of the opinion that the scheme does not comply with the conditions necessary for it to enjoy the rights conferred by the Community instrument to which the certificate relates, the Authority must within two months of receiving notice under subsection (1) give notice of that opinion and the reasons for it to the authorities mentioned in subsection (2)(b).'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 846, in page 119, line 42, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) A notice given by the Authority under subsection (2A) must be published by the Authority in such a way as it thinks most suitable for bringing it to the attention of the public'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The clause deals with recognised schemes that are constituted in other EU states. Under the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities directive, as implemented by clause 235, such collective investment schemes are required to be recognised if they satisfy various prescribed requirements. One of those is set out in subsection (3)(a), which states that the notice that is given to the FSA must be accompanied by a certificate from the authorities, in the relevant state, that are responsible for the authorisation of collective investment schemes. The certificate must make it clear that the scheme complies with the conditions that are necessary for it to enjoy the rights that are conferred by any relevant community instrument—in practice, the UCITS directive.
<P>
There have been several instances, particularly in relation to the use of subsidiary companies and derivative instruments, where the relevant authorities in Ireland and Luxembourg have interpreted the UCITS directive requirement more liberally than those in the UK and, indeed, differently. For example, a Dublin UCITS could do something that could be freely marketed in the UK, whereas a UK-based scheme doing the same thing could not get recognised here.
<P>
The amendment would require the FSA to notify the relevant authorities of the state in question, should it consider that the scheme does not comply with the conditions necessary to enjoy the rights conferred by the community measure to which the certificate relates. However, that is a double-edged sword On matters on which Dublin and Luxembourg accept certain items and the UK does not, I believe that Dublin and Luxembourg are right and the UK is wrong. However, it is the other way round in relation to acceptance of other items. It is healthy to have such issues resolved out in the open. Therefore, the amendment would not necessarily lean on Dublin, Luxembourg and other EU states to change their rules, but would have differences out in the open so that pressures may resolve them one way or another.
<P>
Amendment No. 846 would further require the FSA notice to be published with a view to bringing it to the public's attention. It would require the FSA to make public those instances in which it believes that an EEA state has interpreted the UCITS directive differently. That gives effect to what I said earlier about amendment No. 801 opening up the matter to public discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The clause is rather important and I support my hon. Friend in his proposed amendment. The clause deals with passporting requirements and conditions. We support that as it obtains reciprocal rights for the British investment services industry in other states in the European economic area. However, it is obviously important that we do not allow into the country schemes and the marketing of such schemes that fall far below are own requirements. Indeed, the clause's objective is to ensure that that does not happen.
<P>
However, we shall rely pretty heavily on regulators in other member states. Not all EEA member countries have a regulatory or administrative system that measures up to our own. The EEA covers the European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong about that. The EEA is a large, diverse area and includes some countries with a much less sophisticated savings and investment structure. Of course, the Bill makes provision for schemes to be disallowed in due course. Nevertheless, the setting up and acceptance of the scheme will be fairly automatic.
<P>
Is the Minister satisfied that existing passporting provisions under the relevant directives are working and that we are not subjecting our own industry to unfair competition or our savers to jeopardy? We would welcome an answer to that. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) explained, our amendment would be an insurance against anything improper or dangerous developing. I hope that the Minister will expand the point slightly in his response as we are dealing with the ebb and flow of savings products which are, in any case, difficult to regulate. Obviously the end consumer is often unsophisticated, which is why we need a regulator in the first place.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are aware of the common complaint that we subject our own industries to a degree of regulation under European directives different in its intensity from practice abroad. It is therefore most important to build all available safeguards into private legislation. We have probably found a deficiency in the provision which we wish to remedy, but obviously we will not press that before hearing the Minister's response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am aware of some of the concerns. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned things that have happened in other EU and EEA countries. The list of EEA countries given by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) is correct.
<P>
The Committee will wish to be cautious in this area because our financial services industry has much to gain from accessing the EEA market. Any steps taken in the United Kingdom which might appear to protect the UK market would be damaging if the effect was to limit our industry's access to other parts of the EEA. There is also a clear legal position, which is that any concerns of this nature about the way in which other countries implement the requirements of the UCITS directive need to be taken up with the Commission. That is where the responsibility resides.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 801 and 846 would not be at all compatible with our obligations under the UCITS directive or with either the underlying premise on which single markets directives are built, or the principle of home state regulation, which we discussed earlier. The UCITS directive, which was agreed in 1985 and implemented in 1989, provides in article 46 effectively for what is already in clause 235, and there is no right under that directive for member states to refuse an incoming passporter unless the scheme will not meet the UK's marketing requirements. That is the only ground for refusal.
<P>
We are broadly happy with the way in which the arrangements work. Obviously we greatly welcome the opportunity for the UK financial services industry to look to the EEA market in a way that was not previously possible. If hon. Members and others outside the Committee have concerns, the place to raise them is the Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment would not breach any Community obligations. It does not confer the ability not to accept the passported UCITS; it merely requires the FSA to make public the fact that there is a different interpretation from one EEA member to another.
<P>
Two examples spring to mind of where, broadly, debate has taken place for almost nine years without becoming public, although it is of some import. In Dublin, the authorities permit the keeping of accounts on money funds on an amortisation basis. This means that money funds can maintain a constant price while investing in financial paper, which will fluctuate in value over time, with interest rates. The same applies to United States money funds. The UK interpretation is that one has to value such financial paper to market daily, therefore the price of the money fund fluctuates.
<P>
People wishing to use money funds expect to have a constant principle. Therefore money funds managers feel that they cannot use financial paper but have simply to invest in deposits. The reality is a mechanism where the industry has kept at bay the competition of money funds, which have been so effective in the United States. If that issue had been brought to light, the debate would have been much more healthy and Mr. Cruickshank would not be so busy.
<P>
As I said earlier, it is a two-way street. It is unsatisfactory that significant differences are not publicly debated. Another such difference is the use of what is known as the Mauritian sandwich, used for funds invested in India. Quite correctly, I believe, Luxembourg and Dublin permit this as falling under the UCITS rules, which allow the use of derivatives as well as structures in order to make a fund more efficient. That is to allow investors to benefit from double taxation agreements between India and Mauritius. The UK authorities take the view that it cannot be done because it is fund-to-fund.
<P>
I have mentioned two quite big issues that have not been resolved by the Securities and Investments Board, the FSA, the Treasury or the Commission; they have just been sitting there, suppressed. It would have been much better if the UK authorities had forced those matters out into the open for debate and resolution. It could, however, be the other way round; we could have stimulated debate about the potential misuse of the UCITS directive by others.
<P>
I repeat that the crucial issue is whether the clause is in breach of EU directives. I believe that the answer is no, because it is not stopping or impeding the local marketing of passported UCITS. It is a method of forcing some degree of pan-EEA rationality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Requiring the FSA to publish a notice calling into question the judgment of another state's regulator would be contrary to the requirements that are placed on us. I understand the frustration expressed by the hon. Gentleman, that some issues of that sort have been dragging on for a long time, and he is right to mention them. However, it is a matter for the Commission. It is not something that the FSA can resolve on behalf of Europe or the Commission. It certainly would not be appropriate to put such a requirement into the Bill, especially not as expressed in amendment No. 846.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The point has been made. I do not accept that publishing a notice would be in contravention. We have checked the point with lawyers specialising in EU law. However, the point may be better taken up elsewhere. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 763, in page 119, line 42, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The operator of a recognised scheme may give written notice to the Authority that he desires the scheme to be no longer recognised by virtue of this section.
<P>
( ) On the giving of notice under subsection (6), the scheme ceases to be a recognised scheme.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause deals with the procedure applying if a UCITS scheme wishes to establish itself in the UK. However, it does not currently deal with the voluntary relinquishment of recognition by a UCITS scheme, and we propose that it should. It is covered in section 86(9) of the Financial Services Act 1986. The amendment provides that, on the operator giving notice to the FSA, the scheme will cease to be a recognised scheme. I hope that the Committee will support it.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Treasury may not make an order designating any country or territory for the purposes of this section unless satisfied that the law and practice under which relevant collective investment schemes are authorised and supervised in that country or territory afford to operators of comparable authorised schemes the entitlement to promote such schemes in that country or territory at least equivalent to that available in the United Kingdom to operators of such relevant collective investment schemes.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 774 and 775.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The clause deals with the obtaining of recognised status in the United Kingdom for collective investment schemes authorised in designated countries or territories outside the United Kingdom. The amendment would introduce a requirement for reciprocity before a particular country or territory could become designated for these purposes. Sections 183 to 186 of the Financial Services Act 1986 contained provisions dealing with reciprocity, but they have not been carried forward into the Bill. It seems to us that it is reasonable and appropriate to continue the principle of reciprocity to the countries or territories under the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I put it to the hon. Gentleman that the strength of our financial services industry depends in large part on the United Kingdom markets being open. I am cautious about using powers under the Bill to put pressure on other Governments in trade negotiations. As long as we are satisfied that the law and practice of the territory or country concerned is adequate from a consumer protection point of view, consumers in the United Kingdom will gain from the additional competition that overseas schemes may bring. Our overriding concern is the interests of consumers. If there is a need—sometimes, there is—to open up markets overseas, that should be pursued separately. Indeed, from 1 March unilateral action of that sort by the United Kingdom against another member of the World Trade Organisation would be illegal under WTO rules. What is proposed under the amendment would be illegal in respect of those countries and it would certainly be contrary to the interests of UK consumers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The designated territories are not huge markets, nor is a huge commercial issue at stake for the United Kingdom. The Minister's reply worries me, because it reveals the mentality that we have feared all along, which is why we want regulations that are conducive to supporting our competitive position internationally to be an objective of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman seems to be saying that the clause is all about consumer protection and that we should forget anything about supporting the UK industry overseas.
<P>
Given the reciprocity that applies under the passporting arrangements between the United Kingdom and other EEA member states, I cannot see any legal reason why reciprocity should not apply between the United Kingdom and what it has chosen to describe as designated territories. That, I might add, gives those territories certain advantages in this country. I question whether what is proposed in the amendment would not be legal in future. The point is not a large one because the market would be there, but it is right in terms of principle and that is why it is in the Act at present.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I have just looked at sections 183 to 185 of the Financial Services Act 1986, which are the three sections that the Financial Secretary effectively wants to remove. He said that the existing law would be rendered illegal, which was interesting. Would that mean that, if for any reason we do not get the Bill on the statute book by March, the existing law—sections 183 to 185 of the existing Act—will then be defective? If so, what will be done about that?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said that we are not talking about lots of markets around the world, but about markets such as Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. I would have thought that the reciprocity clause was a reasonable approach to take with our near neighbours.—[Interruption.] The Government Whip intervened from a sedentary position, as he does on many occasions. I do not know what he said, but it almost certainly had nothing to do with the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household): I am saying that it is a good contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Most unusually, and perhaps with a hint of sarcasm, he suggested that I am making a good contribution to the business of the Committee. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] I am grateful to my hon. Friends for their support.
<P>
I note that section 183 refers to the national interest. At the moment, the reciprocal arrangements can be provided through a narrow window. The Treasury has to consider whether it is in the national interest to provide the reciprocal rights to our near neighbours such as Guernsey and Jersey. We are moving a long way from what was a carefully circumscribed arrangement to give them recognition to something that has no reciprocity at all. I would be grateful for the Financial Secretary's comments on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs has indicated that he will not press his amendment, but I will make the point that it is important that other countries' financial services markets should be open to our industry. However, those matters should be pursued through existing channels such as the WTO rather than using the legislation to attempt to obtain a lever in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. I do not understate the importance of achieving such openness, but I do not think that the Bill is the way to achieve it or that continuing the relevant legislation in the 1986 Act needs to be dealt with separately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Financial Secretary say a little more about the WTO's position? I thought that that was fascinating. We are making undertakings that could render the existing law illegal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My understanding is that, from 1 March action of the kind permitted by the legislation referred to by the hon. Gentleman would be illegal under WTO rules, so a WTO member would not have been able to take such action anyway.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have not spoken in the debate on the amendments to the clause, although I strongly support the principle of reciprocity. I agree in part with the Financial Secretary in that it is in our interests to be an open economy, but in a tough old world, we should use our bargaining position whenever possible and demand access to other jurisdictions in return for access to ours. I understand the point that he makes in that we have to adhere to World Trade Organisation rules that govern such matters, but I remain concerned that they are adopted so readily.
<P>
I think that the Channel Islands are members of the European Economic Area. If they are, the Financial Secretary should stop me now. They are certainly not members of the European Union, but they have an intimate relationship with the United Kingdom. Their connection with the Treasury has become less interesting since the previous Paymaster General lost his job. We used to debate such matters at great length with the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson). The status of the Channel Islands is of great interest to many British citizens and the City, because much of the money deposited in the Channel Islands finds its way into the City. Therefore, the health and vigour of those islands is important.
<P>
The Channel Islands have high regulatory standards. A Treasury official, Andrew Edwards, who is no longer with the Treasury, studied Jersey, and perhaps the other islands, and concluded that their regulatory systems were of a high order. I hope, therefore, that they have an automatic right of reciprocity and that schemes from those islands are granted access as though they were members of the EEA, even if they are not.
<P>
I raise that issue because I suspect that relations between the Channel Islands and the Treasury are not necessarily cordial. Such matters form part of the debate that is taking place on tax harmonisation in the EU. The Committee will know that the Paymaster General chairs an EU ministerial group on tax harmonisation, which is scrutinising many of the tax measures of the dependent and Crown territories, including the Channel Islands. That raises the issue of the extent to which the Government can force those jurisdictions into line on tax measures, because it is an established constitutional fact that they have tax autonomy. However, the United Kingdom has agreed in advance to implement the findings of the tax harmonisation group, so a contradiction or paradox is developing.
<P>
The suspicion in some quarters is that the Government might put pressure on the Channel Islands to bring them into line. The Government could do that by soft peddling on fully recognising their systems and on their receiving the rights that will be accorded under the Bill to products sold from Greece, Iceland and elsewhere. I should be interested to hear the Financial Secretary's comments on the future status of the Channel Islands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I want to add a little to my right hon. Friend's comments. Regulations in the Channel Islands were put in place around the same time as here. They have been updated to some extent. Regulations on major issues were updated in conjunction with the Treasury and with Treasury approval but, for some extraordinary reason, there has been a blockage in engaging the Treasury's attention to updating Channel Island regulations as circumstances have changed. That is not in the interests of the UK.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I was relieved to hear the right hon. Gentleman's support, albeit grudging, for the World Trade Organisation. I had visions of him and his hon. Friends rushing off to the streets of Seattle. It sounds as though that is not going to happen.
<P>
I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman that Jersey and Guernsey are currently designated under clause 239. I understand that they are members of the customs union and that they benefit from the freedom of movement of goods within the EEA. They are not full members, but are dealt with in the Act of Accession. Special provision is made for them in the treaty establishing the European Community in that only certain provisions apply to the Channel Islands and, equally, to the Isle of Man and Bermuda, which are also designated territories under the clause. In particular, treaty provisions on rights of establishment and the freedom to provide services do not apply.
<P>
I hope that that makes the position a little clearer. I am not aware of the difficulties to which the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs drew attention. If there is outstanding concern, it will doubtless be expressed elsewhere.

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 776, in page 122, line 27, leave out subsection (2) and insert—

<P>
I will not speak to the Government amendments now, but I shall seek to catch your eye later on, Mr. O'Brien, to respond to any points made by Opposition Members on amendments Nos. 848 and 849.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following:
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 777 and 778.
<P>
Amendment No. 848, in page 122, line 35, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) If the scheme takes the form of an open-ended investment company it must have a depositary or (if it does not take that form) a trustee or depositary.'.

Government amendment No. 779.
<P>
Amendment No. 849, in page 123, line 6, after `redeemed', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or disposed of'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We do not object to Government amendment No. 779, but it is the most strangely worded amendment that I have seen. The words ``and in other ways'' are extraordinarily broad and could mean all sorts of things. Will the Minister briefly comment?
<P>
The clause contemplates individually recognised overseas schemes becoming recognised schemes, but the provisions are unclear whether such a scheme must have a trustee or depositary. Amendment No. 848 would make it clear that if the scheme takes the form of an OEIC, it must have a depositary or, if not, a trustee or depositary. I would have thought that the Government would agree with that.
<P>
As to amendment No. 849, one of the requirements to obtain a recognised scheme status for individually recognised overseas schemes is that under clause 241(11):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The participants must be entitled to have their units redeemed in accordance with the scheme at a price related to the net value of the property''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the scheme. The clause contemplates the redemption of units, that is re-purchase under the terms of the scheme. However, in some circumstances, it may be preferable for units not to be redeemed but disposed of in some other way, such as acquisition by a third-party purchaser. That is effectively analogous to unit trust practice and is contemplated by clause 241(12), which refers to participants being able to sell their units on an investment exchange. That may not be the only means by which unit holders would be able to realise their units that met asset value. Therefore, our amendment would introduce an element of flexibility without prejudicing the basic protection of unit holders, enabling them to realise their units at net asset value.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not find the wording of amendment No. 779 so extraordinary. Its requirement for co-operating
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by the sharing of information and in other ways''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is not unusual and I trust that the Committee is happy with it.
<P>
On amendment No. 848, the equivalent provision in the 1986 Act refers to the operator and the trustee, if any. In practice, and as is the case with the present legislation, we wish to leave enough flexibility in the Bill for the FSA to recognise individually schemes that may have a different institutional structure when appropriate. On balance, it is right that the existence of a depositary or trustee is not essential. In practice, the FSA will need to satisfy itself with matters referred to in the clause before individually recognising a scheme. It may be only in exceptional cases that it feels that it can properly take the view that adequate protection is provided in relation to a scheme that does not have a separate trustee or depositary. However, we wish to leave that flexibility in the Bill, rather than remove it.
<P>
On amendment No. 849, we are tracking what was in the 1986 Act and applicable provisions in the Bill, such as those relating to unit trusts. I am not aware of any reason or pressure for the existing formulation to be changed, as it has worked reasonably well. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is willing for things to remain as they are and will not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Neither of our amendments is hugely important. However, it is extraordinarily ironic that amendment No. 848 deals with consumer protection as that is the major purpose of the Bill. Having a trustee or depositary means that there is some sound independent person with control of the assets, separate from the manager of the scheme. That is generally accepted as good practice. However, the Government are happy for a flexible position to remain. We like flexibility, but that is one area in which it is better not to have it.
<P>
Amendment No. 849 does not make a major point. It would put recognised status schemes onto the same operative basis as unit trusts. That would mean that investors might do slightly better, as they may find that if there is another buyer when they redeem, they would benefit from not suffering from the bid offer being spread. After what may be termed as lethargy, it is rather strange that the Government should not want to accept our amendments. I am happy not to press them to a vote, as they do not deal with major issues. Nevertheless, from different ends of the spectrum, both are probably correct.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 856, in page 128, line 34, leave out `competent'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is a tidying-up amendment. Clause 255 allows the FSA or the Secretary of State to appoint a person to investigate and report on the affairs of the manager or trustee of a collective investment scheme. Amendment No. 855 reflects the corresponding provisions of clause 140, which also refers to one or more competent persons. Amendment No. 856 tidies up the provisions of subsection (5). Paragraph (a) refers to the FSA appointing

<P>
while paragraph (b) refers to the Secretary of State appointing

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is quite right about the inconsistency. We have had a further look at the provisions, and it might be better if the investigation powers in the clause were included in part X. However, the hon. Gentleman is certainly right, and there needs to be closer alignment with the provisions in that part. We shall, therefore, table amendments, including some that have the effect of the Opposition amendments before us. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Given that assurance, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are happy to withdraw the amendment. I only wish that the Government's responses on clauses 207 and 208 had been similar. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 827, 828, 834 and 845.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We now move to a new section of the Bill which deals with recognised changes and I confess that my knowledge of this territory is less than that of collective investment schemes.
<P>
I have had representations, especially from some of the commodity exchanges, to the effect that under the Bill they will no longer run their exchanges, because not only is the FSA essentially determining the operating rules and dictating what exchanges will do, but in any conflict the Bill gives the authority a kind of power over exchanges so that exchange rules are not binding. I hope that considerable thought went into the way in which the country wants its various exchanges to function. I feel intuitively that emasculation is not a particularly good thing. Although some of the reasons are allegedly to do with better systems, I note that a considerable amount of business is flowing away from some of our exchanges to those elsewhere in the world as these changes occur.
<P>
On amendment No. 861, clause 263 deals with applications for recognised status in overseas investment exchanges and clearing houses. One requirement imposed by clause 263(2) is that the territory of the applicant's head office must impose upon the applicant requirements that are at least equivalent to the recognition requirements that would apply to a United Kingdom applicant. The ``at least equivalent'' requirement could prove unnecessarily stringent. Our amendment would change that to a more subjective approach, with the FSA being required to consider the home territory requirements generally equivalent.
<P>
Government amendment No. 826 deletes clause 263(2) and, while more extensive, the amendment recognises the problem with the ``at least'' wording, as the words have been dropped from the redraft. But we feel that it is desirable to include the word ``generally''.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the effect of this part of the Bill. I see it as a strengthening of the UK industry. On his specific point, I am grateful to him for acknowledging that amendment No. 826 covers the same ground. It provides for the level of protection for investors to be equivalent to that available to a domestic body subject to the recognition requirements. It is important to have equivalent protection for investors. There are many ways of providing equivalent protection so we do not require the overseas body to comply with exact requirements set out in the recognition requirement regulations. They will be regulated under different laws and subject to different supervisory arrangements. But it is important to have effectively a level playing field and for investors to have proper protection. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that amendment No. 826 and the rest of clause 263 provide that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We still feel that the word ``generally'' would be desirable but we will not press the matter to a vote.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following:
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 809 to 814, 817 to 820, 822, 829, 830, 835, 844 and Government new clause 8—
Variation of recognition order in relation to recognised nominee—
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This part of the Bill broadly carries forward the existing recognition and exemption regime for investment exchanges and clearing houses, although we have taken the opportunity to make some improvements to the current arrangements, which we shall discuss later in our proceedings. The existing regime has worked very well and the United Kingdom-recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses enjoy a worldwide reputation as centres of excellence, which will see them continuing to flourish for a long time.
<P>
The clause defines what is meant by a recognised investment exchange and a recognised clearing house. It sets out the scope of the exemption from the general prohibition. Recognised investment exchanges are exempt in respect of any regulated activity that they carry out in their capacity as an investment exchange. Both recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses are exempt in respect of any regulated activity that they carry on in connection with the provision of clearing services.
<P>
We have taken the opportunity in the Bill to break the link between recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses. That is one of the improvements that we are making. Potentially, the change is significant. It makes it possible to reduce risk through the use of clearing services in more areas than in the case at present. The purpose of our amendments is to allow a recognised body to apply for its recognition order and, thus, its exemption to cover another body that carries out a function on its behalf. We are reflecting changes that are happening in out-sourcing, for example. The proposal was the result of consideration of the particular case of ISMA and ISMA Ltd., the International Securities Market Association that sets the rules for the eurobond market.
<P>
The provisions will make a helpful change to the recognition and exemption regime, which will not only help to meet ISMA's particular situation, but will provide a flexible framework to cater for developments in how markets might structure themselves in future. I commend the amendments to the Committee.

</UL></FONT>]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have a question that it is appropriate to ask at this point in our proceedings. It concerns oil trading. The Minister probably knows that much wholesale, foreign trading takes place in London, often between very big companies that are dealing with each other professionally. I am a little worried that that activity may be caught by the Bill and might have to be regulated by the FSA. If so, that will have huge implications not least for the competitive position of London because company-to-company oil trading is not regulated in other parts of the world. Therefore, if British Petroleum and the other big companies have to register and have their traders scrutinised by the FSA, with all the fees and all that flows from that, another form of exchange could simply move elsewhere. Many British companies would not want to do that and, indeed, might not do it. Others would certainly be deterred from putting their business through London, so damage would be caused.
<P>
It is appropriate to raise the matter now. One way through the problem might be if the transactions that I described could constitute an investment exchange or a clearing house. On the other hand, that could exacerbate the problem. The Minister could enlighten the Committee about the basic issue of whether the Bill will catch the wholesale trading that I mentioned and to what extent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not think that the clause changes things in the way that the right hon. Member for Wells suggested. Perhaps he could say a little more about why he thinks that it might.
<P>
The International Petroleum Exchange is one of the recognised investment exchanges. However, the trading of commodities such as oil is not a regulated activity, and buying and selling as principal are not covered. I do not think that we are expanding what is covered in the way that the right hon. Gentleman fears. However, if I have missed something, he will no doubt tell me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I find that reassuring. I am not an expert either, but I understand that some of the trade goes through a recognised exchange. However, some of it is from company to company. There is concern that one or the other will be caught by regulation for the first time or be enmeshed in an additional degree of regulation.
<P>
I accept what the Minister said, but if he wants to add something after taking further advice, I would be interested to hear it and I know that others would be. I raise the issue in the spirit of genuine inquiry, and if I keep talking for a moment longer, I might get the answer without the need for correspondence. The issue is important and perhaps goes beyond the clause. The Minister might want to come back to it at a different point in the Bill or in a note to me at a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am reassured that the clause does not have the effect that the right hon. Gentleman fears. What is caught is determined by secondary legislation under clause 20, on which consultation is in hand. If there are concerns, they will be raised in that consultation rather than here. However, I am certainly happy to write to the right hon. Gentleman if I can add anything further in the light of his concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I realise that this is a scope issue and that it is appropriate to raise it not just under this clause. I await a letter in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I want to say a few words about the effect of the clause on the exchanges, and this is perhaps the right point.
<P>
The Minister said that the provisions strengthened the industry and that it will continue to flourish. I very much hope that that is the case. However, it would be helpful to put on record the grave concerns of many parts of the industry. Rather than going through loads of them, I shall pick out just those of the London Metal Exchange. Its newsletter, AMT Metals Gazette, has a feature on the FSA. Under the heading ``Watchdog or Rottweiler?''—the writer does not use the word ``leviathan'', but goes for a dog—the article says that there is deep concern about the future of exchanges as a result of the Bill. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``some people believe that it is indeed some new nerve gas, quite deadly, and may even have been designed as some diabolical Machiavellian plot to destabilise the City of London.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They say that slightly tongue in cheek, but it gives the atmosphere and sense of their concerns.
<P>
The worry is that it will lose access to the courts. The gazette states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``By entering into these contracts, we give away many of our basic rights, including the right to be heard by a court of the land in any dispute. Instead, we will be heard by an FSA tribunal . . . appointed by—the FSA'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, in the same general tone, it adds ``of course''. Nor will there be any opportunity to recover costs when fighting the FSA in the event of action between the industry and the FSA. It fears that business will go abroad, a fact that is germane to our argument. It is very worried about that and thoroughly unsatisfied with the replies that it has received to its comments on consultation paper 26 on that aspect of the changes.
<P>
It is also feared that the regulation as at present drafted is more likely to catch small offenders—the small fry—at the expense of the big ones. It is important that the Minister should hear about that, because he probably does not have the opportunity to read the AMT Metals Gazette. I would not normally be an avid reader of it, but it is important that the Government should have the chance to hear what people are saying.
<P>
Of course, I have mentioned only one exchange, but there is deep concern among many people about the long-term effects of the Bill on the exchanges. The mood among several exchanges is pessimistic: in the case of the London Metal Exchange there is not only deep pessimism, but some cynicism.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right that I missed that particular issue of the AMT Metals Gazette. It sounds as if it contained a certain amount of hyperbole. We have listened very carefully to the concerns expressed by many parties, including the exchanges in drawing up the Bill. I am aware of the vigorous lobbying from those organisations, but we are building on the existing regime and I am confident that when those changes come into effect, the result will be a stronger industry that will maintain its strong reputation around the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): We heard representatives from the London Metals Exchange give evidence to the Burns Committee. It welcomed the Bill's provisions; indeed, it made constructive suggestions to improve it, which have been incorporated into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He has given an excellent example of the very institution that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. There is no need for alarm. In fact, the contrary is the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I would add one point. The Minister mentioned consultation. The same newsletter—other newsletters make similar points—said it has consulted extensively with the FSA and that the FSA gave it assurances on many of the points of concern such as whether the rules would be interpreted sensibly and liberally, and it went over that ground in some detail. The London Metals Exchange asked for those assurances in writing. The FSA refused to provide in writing any of those assurances that had been given orally; and the exchange is still waiting.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The clause allows the FSA to stipulate further information that it may require in addition to the information provided under clause 259 by applicants for recognised investment exchange and clearing house status. The amendment mirrors the existing provision of clause 259(2)(d), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other information as the Authority may reasonably require for the purpose of determining the application.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, if a reasonableness test is applied to clause 259(2)(d), a parallel test should surely be applied to clause 260.
<P>
Amendment No. 859 relates to clause 261, which deals with the making of recognition orders. Subsection (3) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Authority may have regard to any information which it considers is relevant to the application.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would introduce the reasonableness test, so that the subsection would read:

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 866 relates to clause 266(3), which states that the annual report
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must also contain such information as may be specified in rules made by the Authority.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no qualification as to what information may be specified, and the amendment would limit such rules to information that the FSA may reasonably require for the exercise of its functions under part XVII.
<P>
Amendment No. 868 relates to clause 267(2) and qualifies the FSA's power to direct the body to take specified steps by limiting the steps to those that would be reasonably required for the purpose of securing the body's compliance.
<P>
In short, all the amendments are about appropriate reasonableness in their specific circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman made a fair point about consistency when he started to speak to the amendments a moment ago. In the debate on part X when we considered clause 146, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary told the Committee that we would like to reconsider the question of where reasonableness appears in the Bill to achieve consistency. That is a drafting point rather than a policy point, but it is important that we get it right, and we will consider this part of the Bill when we carry out that review. I hope, on that basis, that the hon. Gentleman is able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It is best not to press the amendments based on what the Financial Secretary has said, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 858, in page 131, line 5, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) An application under section 258 or 259 must be determined by the Authority within the period of six months beginning with the date on which it receives the completion application.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At present, no time limit will be set within which the FSA must consider applications for recognised status from investment exchanges or clearing houses. Under the amendment, the FSA would be required to determine applications within six months—a reasonable period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We need to bear in mind several points. The applications are complex and the procedure for determining them is more complicated than that for applications for permission or authorisation under part IV. Under clause 273, the FSA may not determine an application without the Treasury's approval. The Treasury may not give its approval without being satisfied about the competition matters listed in clause 273(2). Before giving its approval, the Treasury must have regard to any report prepared by the Director General of Fair Trading under clause 275. Those complex and difficult judgments must be made after properly considering all aspects of the applications.
<P>
I agree that a six-month limit on considering applications is desirable if they are submitted in good order. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Treasury will take seriously the need to assist the FSA in taking timely decisions. We shall ensure that the director general is aware of the need to assist in that goal. I caution against including in the Bill a six-month limit, as the amendment would provide, although I recognise the importance of taking such decisions as quickly as possible. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We think that six months is adequate. The Government expect four months to be sufficient to debate the Bill, which covers the whole industry. The evidence shows that not setting time limits encourages procrastination. If the FSA could not get its act together in six months, it would not approve an application and, if that were unreasonable, it would be justifiably criticised. Therefore, I shall press the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 824 and 825.
<P>
Amendment No. 860, in page 131, line 26, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, reckless or negligent'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 860 deals with our old friend, immunity from damages. Under subsection (1), a recognised body—a recognised investment exchange or clearing house—and its officers and staff are immune from liability and damages to its members for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``anything done or omitted in the discharge of regulatory functions unless it is shown that the act or omission was in bad faith.'' 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would add the words ``reckless or negligent'' to the end of the provision. Section 187 of the 1986 Act, which is the existing provision dealing with exemption from liability for damages does not contain exemption from liability for damages for recognised investment exchanges or clearing houses.
<P>
In the Bill, as drafted, the exclusion of liability and damages applies only to members of the recognised body. However, Government amendment No. 824 deletes the words ``to its members'', thus giving immunity from damages in all cases. I assume that the Minister moved the Government amendment formally, knowing that the matter would come in our amendment, as it is quite important. It is believed that recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses have requested such a provision to protect themselves when taking enforcement action in their markets. For example, investment exchanges are nervous that if they suspect wrong-doing and step into the market to prevent dealings from taking place, they may be liable for damages if, in the event, it turns out that there was no wrong-doing. I accept that there is legitimate concern about such matters, but it does not fully justify an exclusion from liability in the case of recklessness or negligence. It would be interesting to know what the FSA would do if an investment exchange did act negligently.
<P>
A further issue concerns how the exclusion of liability will apply in the case of overseas investment exchanges and clearing houses. Although clause 262 is limited to anything done or omitted in the discharge of regulatory functions, those functions may be carried out outside the United Kingdom in jurisdictions where no exclusion from liability is available. How will that issue be dealt with?
<P>
In short, members of the exchanges have pressed for legal immunity. Their argument is that they have really been turned into little more than a creature of the FSA. It is appropriate that they should be treated on the same basis as the FSA. Our general discomfort is that there is too much emasculation, turning exchanges into regulatory creatures. There is evidence of business already going overseas in anticipation of that. It is a pity that the Government do not recognise what is happening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman arguing in favour or against his amendment. We can safely say that the AMT Metals Gazette is not calling for the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Do the Government really think that we would propose amendments that were motivated in the interest of industry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Far be it from me to comment on that.
<P>
The issue was considered by the joint committee when it was argued that recognised bodies and regulatory functions could be inhibited equally by the threat of action by non-members. It was said that that was more likely to be the case. The joint committee accepted those arguments, but it qualified its acceptance by saying that an extension of immunity should be conditional on there being an adequate complaints procedure in place in each body. We carefully considered its recommendation and concluded, on balance, that we should extend the scope of recognised bodies' statutory immunity.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is always a balance to be struck in these matters. Immunity must be sufficiently broad to enable the regulatory body to carry out its functions effectively, without its being inhibited by the threat of litigation. At the same time, it must not unreasonably restrict the ability to seek legal redress of those who feel that they have been adversely affected by its actions. The formula that we propose—allowing actions when the regulator has acted in bad faith, or when the case involves section (6)(1) of the Human Rights Act, or through judicial review—strikes the right balance.
<P>
If a recognised body were to act negligently in a way that caused it to breach recognition requirements, the FSA could take action. The immunity for recognised bodies applies only to what they do in respect of their regulatory functions. If, for commercial reasons, they do things that are not required under the Act, immunity will not apply. Immunity is therefore tightly bounded and we believe, as I said, that we have struck the right balance. It reflects the view of the Joint Committee and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It may be helpful if I illustrate, the sort of case with which we might have to deal. It will arise when an investment exchange believes that someone is doing something seriously wrong—for example, cornering the market—and the exchange has to step in to cancel the relevant set of contracts. Some businesses will lose because they will find themselves with contracts that have been annulled, and hedging or squaring positions might be involved. Some clients will be out of pocket. It is a major step for the authorities to take. It is fine if everything is done right: people cornering the market should lose. The problem arises, and the amendment becomes relevant, if the authority acts in a cavalier fashion—recklessly, unreasonably or negligently. In that case, should the businesses and the clients lose?
<P>
Under the clause as it stands, businesses cannot sue; the members of a recognised body cannot be liable in damages:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Neither a recognised body nor its officers and staff are to be liable in damages to its members''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, clients will be able to sue. The Government amendment will provide total statutory immunity, with no one being able to sue, whereas our amendment moves in the opposite direction.
<P>
I can see both sides of the argument and my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs made that very point when he referred to some of the evidence from the London Metal Exchange. It is possible to make the case both ways. However, my hon. Friend also made an important point when he said that the FSA's involvement in the exchanges was so deep and intrusive that they were becoming its creatures. He may well be right.
<P>
Will the Minister explain what would happen to the losers in the event of total statutory immunity? What would the FSA do about the losers—the people who have lost out as a result of a misguided belief on the part of an exchange that cornering of the market was going on, followed by an intervention and losses? When the situation is studied carefully, everyone might agree that the intervention should not have taken place and that the exchange acted negligently, Losers will want to make a claim, but will be unable to do so. What should the FSA do about that? As far as I can tell, under the Bill, the FSA can do nothing apart from revoking the licence enabling the exchange to operate, provision for which is made in clause 268. The FSA can say, ``OK, we will close you down.'' However, that is a draconian measure to take in response to a single negligent action by an otherwise competent exchange.
<P>
I agree that the position is difficult. The issue is not clear-cut, and arguments can be made for both sides. However, going down the route proposed by the Government will leave us in a position where the FSA is, at the very least, morally responsible for the losses that I have just described. However, as presently drafted, the Bill provides the FSA with no means of making redress for them and no lever to make the exchanges—which will become creatures of the FSA once the Government amendment is accepted—offer compensation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> What exactly does the hon. Gentleman mean by the exchange becoming a creature of the FSA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The more the FSA intrudes directly on decisions taken by the exchanges, the less independent they will become. The issue at stake is what will happen in the event of losses that take place as the result of a negligent action by an exchange. At the moment, those who are losers from such a negligence—even if they are clients—have nowhere to go once the Government amendment is accepted, and the FSA will have no power to find a means of compensating them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> The clause gives no power for the FSA to intrude into the detail or workings of exchanges. It provides statutory immunity which, as the hon. Gentleman knows, is in direct response to Mr. Kit Farrow, a non-executive director of the London Metal Exchange and Mr. Alan Whiting, executive director of that exchange, both of whom represented cases that prevailed in several exchanges. It is not a question of an intrusive bureaucracy meddling: the clause does not relate to that at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> My point about intrusive bureaucracy was a reference to treatment in this part of the Bill, not just the clause. That must be immediately apparent to anyone examining this matter.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I acknowledge the evidence cited by the hon. Gentleman, and the Minister has already made a similar point. I have read appendix 50, which contains the letter from the LME. Once exchanges are semi-dependent on the FSA, it is quite natural for them to take the view that they want to go the whole hog and have the same statutory immunity that is afforded to the FSA. That is entirely understandable and provides a full explanation for the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Several of us were present when the evidence was given. There is no question of semi-dependence leading to such an issue. The measure is a remedy to difficulties that two experienced people had in the past. They were not complaining. They did not say, ``Well, if we are going to go half way, we may as well go the whole hog.'' That was what the hon. Gentleman argued, but it is totally untrue and was not represented at all in the evidence.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The evidence is clear for all of us. I am just giving clear reasons why exchanges should want to give the evidence that they did. It is clearly in their interest to go down the route of full statutory immunity. The hon. Gentleman is slightly at cross-purposes with the main question that I put to the Minister, to which I should be grateful for a reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Perhaps I could have a go at this. My hon. Friend and I were both members of the Burns Committee, and heard Kit Farrow represent the London Investment Bankers Association and the LME, of which he is an unpaid director. Some of us took issue with what he said about being worried about his liability if immunity was not granted. I disagreed with that, and the Committee discussed the matter.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) said that those bodies would be quasi-regulators—and that they will become even more so. They are completely in bed with the FSA, because they go hand in hand. They will soon enjoy the immunity that the Bill is about to confer on them, and they will lose that immunity or suffer damage only if the FSA hammers them or closes them down. The last thing they want to do is to seem an unwilling partner with the FSA in their regulatory zeal. To all intents and purposes, they have become an extension of the FSA.
<P>
I take issue with that, because we are dealing, not with a quasi-Government body or an agency, but with wholly commercial organisations. They exist to facilitate trade for profit in commodities such as metals, ores and other investment vehicles. Why, all of a sudden, do we now have to extend that immunity to those sorts of commercial bodies? Although we would have disagreed, a case could have been made to extend that immunity to the FSA simply because it took the job from the stock exchange, which already had immunity as the competent authority. I do not agree with that. They are wholly commercial and separate organisations; they are not a fully-fledged part of the FSA.
<P>
The Minister did not answer my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, who asked why it was necessary for immunity to be extended now, when there is no mention of it in the 1986 Act. What has happened in the past 13 years to make organisations, such as the London Metal Exchange, so vulnerable that they now need full-blown immunity, which was previously accorded only to the FSA? What has befallen organisations, such as the LME, during the past 13 years that they now require full immunity to enable them to carry our their functions confidently, when that was not accorded to them in the 1986 Act?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester asked what would happen to the victims, if, through the incompetence of the recognised exchange—perhaps it could have sorted out the problem earlier or taken preventive measures to ensure that the market was not damaged—someone loses out from being on the wrong end of a position. Also, false markets may be created by the wrong processing of information, which could give rise to big advances in the prices of certain traded vehicles.
<P>
It has often happened on the stock exchange that false announcements have been made and trading in a company's shares may have resulted in the share price rising or falling. Many people may have been sucked in or out in that way. Yet it may turn out that the announcements were entirely erroneous and misleading—perhaps the result of criminal activity, but more often the result of incompetence that should have been stopped by the responsible body before it got into the public domain. As we know, there will be a comeback only if it can be proved that the exchange had acted in bad faith. We know also that it is nigh on impossible to take such an issue through the legal channels and prove that bad faith.
<P>
Professional indemnity insurance has not been mentioned. Why can immunity not be substituted by proper commercial use of professional indemnity insurance? Many other bodies have that; the legal and medical professions have it to guard against law suits brought against them. We have not heard any calls for statutory immunity to be given to the British Medical Association, the Law Society and other professional bodies. Only this week, I read in the pink pages that there is a big market in developing professional indemnity insurance specifically for IFAs and other investment firms because of the requirements on them. Why is it not possible for recognised investment exchanges to take that on, too?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman </B>(Erewash): Why did the hon. Gentleman not raise such issues with Kit Farrow and Alan Whiting in the Joint Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> With respect to the hon. Lady, I am not sure whether she was present when the matter came up, but I voiced my concerns and had private meetings with Kit Farrow at which we argued the case, after he had given evidence and wanted to scrutinise it. [Hon. Members: ``Ah.''] Other members of the committee who took an interest in such matters would have heard me say that before. The hon. Lady is well aware that members of the Burns Committee did not agree on many things. However, we produced a compromised report. It seems odd that an enormous credence is hanging on what was fairly short evidence from one particular person, a former non-executive director of the London Metal Exchange.
<P>
We have an enormous amount of time for Kit Farrow, but that does not mean that we cannot argue with some of his views. One can see why individuals would want to safeguard some form of immunity, but there is no incentive for recognised exchanges to ensure that they have gone to the absolute final lengths, that they are acting competently, and are giving their members and those who trade on their exchanges a full and competent service. If they are not doing so, there is no come back other than the ultimate sanction when in the highly unlikely event they will be closed down by the FSA. That is nigh on impossible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Is not the hon. Gentleman magnifying the matter out of all proportion? Previously, the exchanges had an effective immunity against being sued for damages by virtue of the contracts of their members. All that the provision will do, as was requested, is extend that immunity to non-members, which is a fairly marginal change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I want the Minister to tell me what has happened in the past 13 years since the Financial Services Act 1986 that requires us to extend immunity, which is a disincentive to good practice, to all those eventualities? I have now set the hon. Gentleman several questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman), I was not present at the hearings. The Bill contains the considered view of the Burns Committee. Did the hon. Gentleman argue against it as a member of that Committee when it was reaching its conclusion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I have said several times already that I was not in favour of the evidence put forward by Kit Farrow. I am still at pains to see why so much emphasis is being put on one individual who argued for statutory immunity. We have not heard the Government repeat in such detail the words of the witnesses that we had from eminent law firms who were against the whole principle of immunity—their names have been cast under the carpet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Burns committee had to operate in short under enormous time pressure and it dealt with only a few of the major issues. I did not serve on that committee, but I have served on several Select Committees that have produced reports. If those involved stood up every time somebody disagreed with something and made sure that it was put on the record, such proceedings would go more and more slowly. I can well imagine that that is why my hon. Friend took the matter up privately with Mr. Farrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I give way again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to make out that we were so overpowered by the evidence and cogency of one person that that decided the matter. However, my recollection—I am sure that the record will demonstrate this—is that the matter was fully discussed subsequently. There was clearly a vast consensus in the committee about the argument that was put by Kit Farrow of the London Metal Exchange. He said that, as a non-executive director, he was liable for damages if he was sued, but that he received no remuneration whatever. If that situation continued, nobody would ever take non-executive posts on such organisations. Likewise, the case of Mr. Whiting against being sued by people in warehouses and other places that were remote from the exchange was strong. It was the strength of the case that convinced us. The issue was not just flipped on one side on a Friday afternoon; there was full discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I do not dispute what the hon. Gentleman says. We are not saying in the amendments that we should remove immunity entirely; we are adding the condition that it should not include ``reckless or negligent'' behaviour.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman repeated the argument that was made by people who were asked to sit on the Securities and Investments Board when it first appeared as a result of the Financial Services Act in 1986. At that time, statutory immunity was not envisaged. However, because certain individuals felt uneasy about that, it had to be introduced to get people to serve on various panels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I recall those discussions vividly. A distinction was made between the immunities that were appropriate in a self-regulatory system that was staffed on the whole by part-time, unpaid people and those that were appropriate in the situation into which we are increasingly moving, which involves regulation by corporate bodies that are staffed by full-time professionals. In the latter case, statutory immunity is less appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I was coming to that point. We are dealing not with self-regulatory organisations, but with highly professional and, I hope, highly competent regulatory bodies with enormous powers. The point at that time was that one could make a case for the statutory immunity of individuals, certainly if they were serving on a non-executive, unpaid or voluntary basis. However, the body itself should not have such extensive immunity from prosecution, particularly when negligence and recklessness are involved.
<P>
We are going down a dangerous route, which can end only with people not being protected from a recognised exchange that is not doing its job properly.

<B>Mr. Beard rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I have been trying to finish for some time. I appreciate hon. Members taking such a close interest in my comments that they want me to remain in my seat, perhaps until we break for supper.
<P>
Surely, it cannot be in the customer's interests that the penalties for a recognised exchange not carrying out its functions competently are virtually non-existent, other than it can lose its authorisation to continue to trade, which we know will not happen.
<P>
The Financial Secretary should answer my questions. How can bad faith be proved? Has any such case been successful? What has changed in the past 13 years to make such wide-ranging immunity necessary? Surely commercial firms are different from the quasi-regulatory agencies involved in the FSA's various functions. Does he think that sufficient penalties can be imposed if the recognised exchanges do not do their job properly? Can they hide behind the cloak of immunity, which will be an incentive for them not to do their job properly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Erewash and for Bexleyheath and Crayford for informing the Committee about what happened in the Burns Committee. That is important because the Bill represents the Burns Committee's considered view arrived at after lengthy discussion. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) suggested that we listened to one person's views, but that is not so. Indeed, Opposition Members have urged us to heed the carefully considered views of the Burns Committee. That is reflected in the Bill, and I hope that all members of the Committee support that fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It was not the view of the Burns Committee. I was not there, but I have read the report carefully. It certainly was not the view of all those who gave evidence. For example, Mr. Herrington, who gave evidence immediately before Mr. Farrow, took exactly the opposite view. He said that a case existed for those bodies having some personal immunity when they were private. However, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is different now with a body which I regard as purely a public body. We are in the realms of a public body here''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He did not think it right for the FSA to have such immunities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman strengthens my case. He has reminded us that the Burns Committee considered all the views, which were strongly expressed, and its considered conclusion is incorporated in the Bill and represents the right way forward. I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman would be reassured by the fact that that Committee was well aware of the views, both for and against the proposals, in reaching its considered view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> In the opinion of the London Investment Bankers Association, as represented by Kit Farrow, immunity should be set aside in cases of recklessness as well as bad faith. The views of the various witnesses were a matter of different horses for different courses. Why have one main witness's views and experiences of the London metal exchange held such sway?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman should ask himself why the Burns Committee reached such a conclusion. I have confidence in the view that it took. That Committee took full account of many views. Having given those views full consideration, it decided on the proposal that is now in the Bill. That is how such matters should be determined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> If the Financial Secretary is saying that the proposals should be in the Bill because the Burns Committee suggested them, why was less than 50 per cent. of its recommendations translated into Government amendments to the Bill? He cannot have his cake and eat it.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The Burns Committee was extremely influential in deciding on the final form of the Bill, especially on this issue. The hon. Gentleman was a member of that Committee. If he had wished to argue against its conclusion on this matter he could have done so. My understanding from conversations with my hon. Friends is that he did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> To help the Committee, will the Minister define what is especially ``influential''—why a certain part of the Burns Committee findings should be particularly ``influential'' in the Bill but others not? Those were his words. Will he define them so that we know whether to bother to quote the Burns Committee report at him on other clauses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My point is simply that what is in the Bill on the topic is the view that the Burns Committee reached after careful deliberation and taking account of a wide range of views. That seems to be a model way to deal with these matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am rather encouraged by the Minister's reply. I believe that he is saying that he wishes to implement in full the Burns Committee recommendations on statutory immunity. They were tied explicitly to the complaints procedure, and they included the three recommendations under the heading of complaints procedure. I look forward to Government amendments that will implement that procedure in full.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for supporting the Burns Committee review—at least I think that he supports it, unlike his hon. Friends. The matter will need to be fully taken into account by the FSA because it is a matter for it, not for amendments to the Bill.
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee much longer. My hon. Friends have made the case extremely well. As with the FSA, exchanges will have to take difficult regulatory decisions. I am rather sad that the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) is not here because he particularly has understood well—in this he differs from his right hon. and hon. Friends—the case for statutory immunity for the FSA. As to the parties who would be affected, a number of his points at our previous sitting also apply to the exchanges.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked what had changed. Well, we live in an extremely litigious age and business done on exchanges and clearing houses is done on a vast scale in a global market. The exchanges, like the FSA, will have to deal with complex issues quickly. In many instances, whichever decision the exchange makes, there will be losers. Exchanges will be faced with threats of being sued if they take action to stop contracts—to use the example that the hon. Gentleman gave a short while ago
{**and**}—and if they do not take action. They will be vulnerable whatever they do because there will be people who lose out either way.
<P>
The Burns Committee got it right. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I have not had an opportunity to find the most apposite quote from the evidence given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire, but he certainly did not support the idea of a general statutory immunity for the FSA, and he qualified heavily his view that there should be statutory immunity. I will take it as read.
<P>
I have posed a serious question about the way in which losers will be treated. What will the FSA do about losers now that it is effectively responsible for them, given that all right to immunity has been removed? What possible action can the FSA take as the Bill is drafted? If the Government insist on this amendment, and the Bill goes forward to Report in this form, will they come back with proposals for addressing this serious issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks a hypothetical question. It will depend on the circumstances of the case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 862, in page 133, line 6, after `is', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`considered by the recognised body concerned as'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 865, in page 133, line 34, after `which', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the investment exchange or clearing house considers'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Under the clause, the FSA may make rules requiring a recognised body—the recognised investment exchange or clearing house—to give it notice and information about particular events. The recognised body must also give notice to the FSA without delay if it alters or revokes any of its rules, makes new rules or issues new guidance. Under subsection (8), the notice
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must include a statement as to whether the alteration, revocation or addition is likely to have any effect on competition.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would modify the requirement to a statement as to whether the alteration, revocation or addition is considered by the recognised body as likely to have any effect on competition.
<P>
Amendment No. 865 relates to clause 266, under which an overseas clearing house must provide an annual report and certain other information to the FSA. Under clause 266(2):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The report must contain a statement as to whether any events have occurred''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that are likely to affect the FSA's assessment of whether the requirements of section 263(2) are satisfied or that will have an effect on competition. As with the previous amendment, it would modify the statement to include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the investment exchange or clearing house considers''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There must be some margin of assessment about the outcome in any particular case. That element of subjective judgment is already reflected in the relevant clauses by the inclusion of the word ``likely''. We agree on what we are aiming for. If there is a difference between the likely effect of the two forms of drafting—between the current provision and what it would be with the amendment—it is that the amended provision would probably cause the body concerned to act with a greater degree of caution in reaching its view, but I would not make too much of that distinction.
<P>
If the body is wrong in its assessment, the risk is that there might be consequences for it if that was interpreted as a breach of the requirement. It is because of this that I believe that the amendment would encourage recognised bodies to err on the side of caution when making their assessments for the purposes of either notification.
<P>
We agree about what is intended, but the amendment would not make much difference. If there were any doubt on the matter, the fact that I have made the point in this debate might help to resolve it. In that respect, the hon. Gentleman's points have perhaps helped, but I hope that he will not feel the need to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That is probably fair comment. The Financial Secretary understands why we feel that it is better to err on the side of caution. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 264, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 265</center></H4>
<H4><center>Modification or waiver of rules</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 863, in page 133, line 12, leave out `264' and insert `264(1)'.
<P>
Clause 265(1) refers to rules made under clause 264. However, clause 264 refers to two types of rules. One type may be made by the FSA under clause 264(1), and the other type may be made by the recognised body under clause 264(5)(b). Our amendment is designed to make it clear that the specific rules referred to are those made under clause 264(1).
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that the amendment would have the effect that the FSA could waive or modify rules that require a recognised body to give it notice of events specified by the FSA—for example, the introduction of a new contract for the relevant exchange, or a change in the body's auditors—and information about those events. However, the FSA would be unable to modify or waive the rules concerning a requirement for the recognised body to give the FSA information about itself, such as a periodic financial report.
<P>
Our view is that it is right that the FSA should be able to make modifications or waivers, subject to the requirements in clause 265(3), in respect of all rules made under this part. If the FSA were unable to do so, it would give up an element of flexibility that is currently to the advantage of recognised bodies.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not choose to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Will the Financial Secretary clarify whether the intent is that both sets of rules should apply? If not, which rules apply?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman point out what choice of rules he is referring to? Is he talking about clause 266?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I pointed out, clause 264(1) refers to rules by the FSA and clause 264(5)(b) refers to rules by the recognised body. I seek clarification about clause 265(1), which refers to rules made under clause 264. Do the Government intend that it should apply to both sets of rules?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The FSA can make rules under subsections (1) and (2) of clause 264, and both sets should be capable of being waived. That is what is achieved by clause 265. The FSA should have the ability to make modifications or waivers.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That was the stated intent of our amendment, which would make clear that the rules are those in clause 264(1) and, by implication, clause 264(2). New rules can be made by the recognised body under clause 264(5)(b). It is not entirely clear whether clause 264(5)(b) or clause 264(1) is intended to apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The waiver applies only to the FSA rules, not the exchange rules. Perhaps that clarifies the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 864, in page 133, line 18, leave out `may not give a direction unless' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall give a direction if '.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under clause 264(5), the FSA may modify or waive rules made under clause 264(1). Under clause 265(3), the FSA may not give a direction—that is, a modification or waiver—unless it is satisfied that the authorised body's compliance with the rules would be unduly burdensome or would not achieve the purpose for which the rules were made and that the direction would not result in undue risk for persons whose interests the rules are intended to protect.
<P>
Our amendment would require the FSA to give a direction in such circumstances. Therefore, the FSA would be obliged to give a modification or rule waiver if compliance by the recognised body was unduly burdensome, would not achieve the purpose for which the rules were made and would not result in undue risk to persons whose interests the rules were intended to protect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The premise is that the FSA is given discretion to make a direction under subsection (1). Subsection (3) then places constraints on that discretion. The FSA may make a direction to modify or waiver rules in clause 264. However, stating that it must make a direction if the relevant conditions are fulfilled does not make sense. As currently phrased, the provision makes clear that the FSA is not to give a direction unless the conditions are fulfilled.
<P>
In circumstances in which the FSA is satisfied that conditions in clause 265(3) are fulfilled—that is, compliance with the rules would be unduly burdensome and the direction would not result in undue risk—it will give a waiver, unless there is good reason not to do so. However, we do not want to remove the element of discretion from the provision by obliging the FSA to grant a waiver whenever the conditions are satisfied, as it is difficult to predict all possible future circumstances. It is important that the FSA retains some flexibility, and that is achieved by the current wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I accept that there is not a huge difference between being obliged and being expected to do something in reasonable circumstances. However, as my hon. Friends and I pointed out, the matter is part of the overall emasculation of the exchanges. The FSA is quite determined to reserve the ultimate decision unto itself and not have its power held and retained by the exchanges. Our slight objection is that the matter is another minor element—
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> Emasculation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Be careful. The matter is another minor element in removing the power of the exchanges, but is not major enough to put to a vote. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Amendment No. 836 is simply a drafting change, which removes the doubt that might be cast over the FSA's power of direction. I shall listen with interest to Opposition Members' comments about amendment No. 867.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Our amendment No. 867 is to clause 267. Under the clause, the FSA may give directions where it appears to it that a recognised body has failed to satisfy the recognition requirements or to comply with any other obligation that the Bill imposes on it. Under subsections (2)(a) and (b), the FSA may direct the body to take specified steps for the purpose of securing its compliance with the recognition requirements or with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any obligation of the kind in question''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would change paragraph (b) so that it referred to ``the relevant obligation''. There is no reason why the FSA's powers should go beyond directing a body to comply with the obligation with which it failed to comply.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I should perhaps explain the relevant requirements. Subsection (l)(a) refers to the recognition requirements, which will be specified in an order to be made under clause 257. The order will set out the characteristics that a body must satisfy if it is to be considered for recognition. If it is unable to meet those requirements, it will be able to carry on regulated activity in the UK only if it obtains permission to do so and becomes an authorised person.
<P>
In February this year, the Treasury issued a draft order for consultation, which set out its proposed recognition requirements. The deadline for responses passed some time ago, and we are now considering the views that were put to us.
<P>
Most of the Bill's provisions do not apply to a body that has achieved recognition. That is a feature of the special regime. This part of the Bill imposes several requirements; we have discussed some of them in detail and have yet to come to others. Those will all be relevant requirements for the purposes of subsection (l)(b). In addition, a few other provisions outside part XVII are relevant to paragraph (b). Two that clearly are relevant relate to market abuse and investigations. The reference in clause 267(2)(b) is to any of those requirements over and above the recognition requirements. I hope that that helps to clarify what is being referred to.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 869, in page 134, line 15, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) In the case of an overseas investment exchange, the Authority may only give a direction under subsection (2) after consulting those responsible in the home territory for the supervision of that investment exchange.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the case of an overseas investment exchange, the amendment would require the FSA to consult those responsible for the supervision of that exchange in its home territory before giving any direction under clause 267(2). On reflection, although the amendment refers only to overseas investment exchanges, the same point can be made in relation to overseas clearing houses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Regulators discuss such matters a great deal. Members of the Committee will no doubt know that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been lobbying hard in several international forums for greater co-operation between international regulators and, in practice, the sort of discussions envisaged by the amendment are likely to take place frequently. The decision whether to consult is one that ultimately only the FSA can take, given the circumstances. It depends on what sort of requirements it is planning to impose. They may be of specific relevance to operations in the United Kingdom.
<P>
It is proper to impose requirements to consult in cases only when it is required under the single market directives. We have adopted that principle. However, nothing in the Bill limits the FSA's ability to consult where it thinks that it is appropriate and useful to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> There is still a reasonable case for beefing up the point, but it is not material enough to put to the vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am impressed by the power of the hon. Gentleman's argument. In the light of that compelling statement, which surpasses even his own high standards, it would be churlish for me to do anything other than to accept the amendment, which I gladly do.

Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 269 sets out procedures before the FSA may give a ``direction under section 267'' or make a revocation order ``under section 268(2)''. The usual warning notice and decision notice procedure has not been included in clause 269. The amendment includes one of the protections provided by that procedure, in that during the period in which representations can be made to the Financial Services Authority, it should give access to the information and documents on which it has relied when deciding on its proposed action. That is spelt out in clause 338(5) in the case of a warning notice given under that clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 872 has been tabled because there is no provision under clause 269 that permits the relevant investment exchange or clearing house to refer any matter to the tribunal. There does not seem to be a particular reason why a reference to the tribunal should not be permitted in such cases, so the amendment would require the FSA to inform the relevant recognised body that it may refer the matter to the tribunal.
