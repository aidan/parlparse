<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000310"></a>The

Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> Good

afternoon, Sir John, and welcome to this afternoon&#146;s sitting.

When we broke for lunch, I was responding to amendments Nos. 106 to

110, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman).

His points on amendment No. 107 related to section 176 of the Taxation

of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, which covers some of the same ground as

clause 69 in that it could be used to combat avoidance involving the

artificial creation of losses. Section 176&#146;s remit, however, is

wider than just avoidance.</div>

<a name="06052413000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 176

covers purely commercial situations that would otherwise produce an

unfair result for tax purposes. For example, if a company pays a

distribution out of pre-acquisition profits prior to being sold,

section 176 ensures that the correct amount of capital loss is

recognised on the sale. To pay the dividend might well be a normal

commercial judgment, but it is still appropriate to apply 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 330</div>section 176. It has no purposive anti-avoidance test; rather, it is an

objective test that is well understood and

respected.</div><a name="06052413000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like

amendment No. 107, amendment No. 108 has nothing to do with the rest of

the clause but touches on something else. It does not touch on the

targeted anti-avoidance rules, but would remove a rule that applies

only to life insurance companies with holdings in unit trusts and

open-ended investment companies. Because they are charged tax on

movements in the value of such holdings and not just on disposals,

there is a unique relieving rule that allows them to carry back losses

to the two previous periods. No other type of company is allowed to

carry back capital losses. When an insurance company changes group, the

current law prevents carry-back except where the losses arose on the

assets that the company held before joining the new group. That is in

line with the general thrust of the loss and gain buying

rules.</div> <a name="06052413000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will

update legislative references and provide a minor relaxation of the

restrictions on carry-back of losses. I am not sure what prompted

amendment No. 108. The hon. Member for Wycombe said that it was probing

and not directly relevant. On that basis, I do not accept it. However,

because the point that he raises could none the less be advanced, I

shall say to him that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has

recently issued a consultation document on taxation of life insurance

companies. That is the right place to raise such issues regarding

future intentions. I do not think that his point is necessarily

relevant

here.</div><a name="06052413000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

110 is strange. It would remove a transitional rule included in the

Bill as a result of representations from companies and their advisers.

It is strange to want to remove that. Subsections (9) and (10) are

intended to provide additional relief for companies that have

undertaken certain transactions prior to the pre-Budget report that do

not involve gain or loss buying but that could have been subject to

restrictions on their use of capital losses. They have been included

because companies asked that the draft legislation include improved

targeting in that specific area. The Government recognised that the

original draft could be improved and responded accordingly. I cannot

see any good reason why the amendment should stand, although I hope

that the hon. Gentleman will accept my explanation. In effect,

amendmentNo. 109 would remove from the scope of the clause

any tax-driven purchase of a company that occurred before the

pre-Budget report. If we were to accept that amendment, the subsection

that it would remove would be unnecessary. However, as I do not believe

that the amendment would have that effect, amendmentNo. 110

should also be rejected.</div>

<a name="06052413000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the hon. Gentleman will

accept those explanations of how the clause works and why this large

group of amendments would not be

necessary.</div><a name="06052413000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06052413000311"></a><b class="B">Stewart

Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): I have listened carefully to

the Paymaster General. Throughout her speech, she made continual

reference to the fact that the provision is designed to tackle specific

tax avoidance measures and schemes. However, as yet, I am not wholly

convinced of that. She has said repeatedly that there was an HMRC

informal procedure in which schemes, deals or trades could be checked

to determine 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 331</div>whether they were legal when companies were buying losses or whether

they would fall foul of the provision. That runs the risk, I think, of

companies being in a de facto starting position for almost every

significant commercial transaction.</div>

<a name="06052413000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a company may acquire

another that has losses, the starting point will be to go to the HMRC

to determine whether it will be a legitimate commercial transaction or

whether it will fall foul of the new rules. That will run the risk of

adding time delays, additional cost and uncertainty to the process of

acquisition. That is

important.</div><a name="06052413000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should

look at the various forms of purchase and the reasons for them in

relation to amendment No.106. Companies may buy to extend their market

share; as part of a pre-agreed growth strategy; to extend their

geographic reach; to extend the development and production of sales

capacity; or to gain new technology, expertise or skills. They may buy

as part of a self-financed growth strategy or as part of planned use of

investment cash from elsewhere&#151;for example, from investors or

one of the markets. They may buy or, indeed sell, as part of a takeover

defence strategy or to position themselves after a disposal to take

over another company. They may do so to avoid breaching monopoly and

other fair trade rules. Companies may buy or sell to maximise

shareholder value and fulfil their fiduciary duty. They may buy simply

to diversify to protect themselves in the case of a business that had

been too narrowly focused for the time being. They may also sell

loss-making parts of the business to shore up the remainder or as part

of a strategy to focus on core activity. They may sell in order to

invest

elsewhere.</div><a name="06052413000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those

companies that buy particularly to extend their geographic reach or

increase turnover may well find that the best value they can achieve is

to buy what are, at the moment, loss-making concerns. A judgment might

be that the savings could, in the future, be made centrally through

enhanced purchasing muscle and so on and so forth. They may feel that

the name of the company and the reputation of its brand could turn what

was a loss-making purchased company into a profit-making arm. All those

decisions are legitimate and

valid.</div><a name="06052413000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">My worry is

that the changes will add uncertainty, delay and cost to what should be

a normal commercial transaction. I will concentrate on the consequences

of the delay and uncertainty. They could be huge. If a company were

unable to buy a loss-making concern, to put on muscle or perhaps reduce

its value as a takeover defence mechanism and if it had to go to the

HMRC to identify in advance if that was a legitimate transaction, it

could be extremely worrying. Companies that sell may find that there is

no longer a market there if they are trying to divest themselves of a

loss-making arm. If there is a delay in doing that and if the cash is

not brought in quickly, they may end up carrying costs that they did

not anticipate, which may put the rest of the business at

risk.</div><a name="06052413000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise the

Paymaster General&#146;s earlier concerns, and amendment No. 106

seems to suggest that if companies purchased a loss in any of the ways

I cited and part of the transaction was defined by the HMRC as

legitimate, they could mask a purchase of the loss for the purpose of

tax avoidance, which she referred to earlier. I am not convinced that I

would vote for the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 332</div>amendment if it were pressed to a vote, but I would like her to address

these legitimate concerns. If we are not satisfied today, we may have

to return to clause 70 and related clauses at a later

stage.</div><a name="06052413000039"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000312"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> To help the hon. Gentleman, we are dealing with

a series of clauses: clauses 69, 70 and 71. I referred to the informal

clearance procedure when we discussed amendments Nos. 105 and 101.

Those were grouped under clause 69, but amendment No. 101 is relevant.

It is the same type of amendment becauseit would include a

statutory clearance procedure in clause 71. It was included in that

group because all the amendments dealt with the same subject

matter.</div> <a name="06052413000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree

absolutely with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s general points, which I

also made, on why a statutory clearance procedure was not desirable for

the reasons he gave. Such a procedure was unsuitable for clause 69

because that clause is specific, clear and targeted, and it is accepted

as such. The informal procedure I referred to in response to amendment

No. 101 relates to clause 71. I went on to say that despite the fact

that it was an anti-avoidance measure, it was far more complex than

that. Additional points were necessary, which is why I raised the

informal clearance procedure, the guidance and other supports that the

HMRC would put in place for companies that sought that certainty. I

concur with the hon. Gentleman regarding the undesirability of

statutory clearance requirements in these

clauses.</div><a name="06052413000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman&#146;s second point relates to clause 70, which introduces

new provisions to deal with capital losses and capital gain buying.

Again, it only applies when the main purpose&#151;or one of the main

purposes&#151;of the arrangements in place was obtaining a tax

advantage. Before the Committee started, you and I reflected on this

matter, Sir John, and on the existing legislation that already dealt

with it, so it is not a new subject or an exclusion that companies

might not be aware of&#151;they are aware of it. The legislation was

designed to stop companies exploiting losses in the ways that we have

discussed.</div>

<a name="06052413000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately, ways have been

found around the legislation, which has been in place for quite a long

time. It pre-dates this Government. Clause 70 will repeal the old bits

of the legislation&#151;the gain buying rules that have been

repealed&#151;and includes the anti-avoidance measures. It leaves the

old loss-buying rules, because they still have a purpose. That was the

point of the exchange between myself and the hon. Member for Wycombe

about the amendments that he tabled.</div>

<a name="06052413000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the fears that the hon.

Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) suggested would not apply at

this point. There is not an informal clearance requirement and the

clause is straightforward. Therefore, I can confidently reassure him

that some of his examples would not occur. I hope that that clarifies

things, because the three clauses

interact.</div>

<a name="06052413000263"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000315"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> I am gratified that the Paymaster General says it

is interesting, because I was not convinced that she would necessarily

think that was the case<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i> At last, a

Government Back Bencher is paying even closer attention to the detail

of the Committee&#146;s procedure than they have to date. They will

turn with interest to what the Paymaster General said about amendment

No. 108. What she said about a consultation in relation to the point

that I raised about life assurance was welcome, because it was put to

me that the rule changes could hurt policyholders and deter life

assurance companies from commercial mergers. If we are talking about

life, that issue will be relevant to the consultation.</div>

<a name="06052413000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment

No. 106, where we have a stab at writing into law a definition of what

the &#147;main purpose&#148; of a company is when that main purpose

is to avoid paying tax, the Paymaster General made the point that the

definition would be a narrow one. I accept that, so I beg to ask leave

44.</div><a name="06052413000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for

that change is as follows: as the Committee will be aware from

listening to the Paymaster General&#146;s response to the amendments

that were tabled to clause 69, clauses 69 and 71 are closely related.

In the debate on clause 69 she dealt with the arguments in the three

amendments that I do not wish to

discuss.</div><a name="06052413000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

amendment No. 100 is discrete. The lines it proposes to delete refer to

an arrangement of notices. It is a probing amendment, seeking to

explore the regime of notices that the clause would write into the

Bill. The clause does not impose a tax system that Her Majesty&#146;s

Revenue and Customs may challenge in the formal manner if it disagrees

with the self-assessment. It would instead allow HMRC to issue a

notice, which arguably represents issuing a notice by diktat. We should

be grateful to hear a reason for the measure, particularly because the

tax planning that would trigger the issue of the notice would probably

have to be disclosed to HMRC under the disclosure of tax avoidance

scheme rules, which are being extended in their remit. So HMRC should

not be ignorant of the planning undertaken. There also seems to be

nothing in the clause that enables a company to appeal against such a

notice. It could be argued that that gives tothe Executive

considerable powers that they shouldnot

have.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000318"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I shall refer to the question of issuing a

notice, which amendment No. 100 covers. Issuing of notices is a general

part of the disclosure requirement regime. HMRC would issue the notice

when it believed that the conditions of the clause were met; however,

companies need not be concerned by the provisions unless they receive a

notice. That is the first step. The notice would be a possibility if

conditions were met. Obviously, HMRC must be consistent when issuing

notices, and such issuing must be based on cases to which it reasonably

believes that the conditions of the legislation apply. The conditions

requirement means the exercise of judgment, but that is inevitable for

what is a purposive test. There is nothing unusual in that, and such

judgment is called for in many other areas of tax law.</div>

<a name="06052413000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC has also

issued guidance, to which I referred when we discussed amendment No.

101 and clause 69. HMRC has issued guidance on how it will exercise

judgment in relation to the legislation. We were discussing the

informal clearance procedure, and HMRC has also offered clearance on an

either pre or post-transaction basis. Clearly, however, if a company

takes its own view during its self-assessment, and ultimately disagrees

with the decision, it will be referred to a special commissioner for

ruling before going through the normal processes. I am not sure that I

made this point this morning, so I should add that having given that

informal clearance, HMRC will be bound by it&#151;as long as all

relevant facts about the arrangement had been disclosed in the first

place. I hope that that explains the procedures. The hon. Member for

Wycombe asked, if a company nevertheless disagrees, can it challenge?

The answer is yes.</div>

Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con):Clause

75 deals with film tax partnerships, and the Opposition broadly support

it. Film tax issues have already been discussed by the Committee at

length, but the avoidance scheme on which the clause focuses is one of

the latest of many that have sought to exploit loopholes in film tax

laws. As I stated in the debate on chapter 3, we have reservations

about certain aspects of the proposed film tax structure, but we

believe that the Government are right to close the loopholes, and we

agree that the complex system of sale and leaseback contracts should

not continue, because it is not yielding sufficient value for money for

the taxpayer.</div><a name="06052413000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems

strange to remark on specific legislation concerning this particular

scheme, given that the regime that makes such schemes possible is about

to be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 335</div>abolished. I have some sympathy with the position of the Law Society,

which has questioned

whether</div><a name="06052413000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is worth

introducing a provision of such complexity and narrowness on the

statute book, particularly when film tax reliefs are being

refocused&#148;.</div><a name="06052413000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I

acknowledge that the particular scheme that we are debating has long

been a target for the Revenue&#151;even from before the decision to

opt for wholesale film tax revision, although I have never understood

why the Government want to focus on it so much. For some years, the

plain vanilla sale of leasebacks had been tolerated by the Revenue if

it resulted only in a deferral of tax. However, the structure we are

discussing goes further&#151;it seeks to achieve tax reduction by

converting taxable income into permanently tax-free income. The scheme

has an opaque and complex structure that involves both a film

partnership and an investment

partnership.</div><a name="06052413000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

clause restricts the amount of tax relief on interest borne by loans

whose purpose is the funding of investment in a film partnership.

Instead of 100 per cent. deduction being permitted, a film partner will

be able to deduct only 40 per cent. of paid interest, which will ensure

that at least some film income ends up being taxable. The Revenue

believes that the 40 per cent. figure will leave the investor in a

similar tax position to that for a plain vanilla sale and leaseback

structure, in which benefits are only deferred. However, the Law

Society pointed out that the 40 per cent. figure seems fairly

arbitrary, so will the Paymaster General indicate how the Treasury made

that calculation? Other than on that point, the Opposition have no

objection to the stand part

motion.</div><a name="06052413000067"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000321"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady that the need for

the provision is regrettable. That is particularly so given that the

Bill also contains tax credit provisions that she has acknowledged are

better suited in directing money to those engaged in production, rather

than to high-value individuals who are not connected to production and

who are simply looking for a tax-saving

scheme.</div><a name="06052413000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change was

needed because the schemes were particularly aggressive: sale and

leaseback occurred over a 15-year period and it was necessary to ensure

that tax was paid over the rest of the period. Her Majesty&#146;s

Revenue and Customs became aware that the schemes were being marketed

aggressively and the likely exposure, had we not taken steps, would

have been substantial. I am sure that the hon. Member for Chipping

Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) can imagine my delight in finding that I had to

have yet another arrangement under the Finance Bill in respect of

films. It has been challenging for all hon. Members who want to assist

particular technological abilities and the developments in the film

industry for such matters to be based in the United Kingdom where we

have great skills. There also comes a point when we must question for

what the tax relief is

pm</div><a name="06052413000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the

question posed by the Law Society, 40 per cent. is not an arbitrary

figure. HMRC approached the matter by undertaking a detailed study of

standard sale and leaseback structures. It gave it a reasonable

approximation of the position that investors would be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 336</div>in had they invested in such structures in a straightforward way. The

figure of 40 per cent. was therefore chosen as a proportionate response

to that particular type of aggressive tax plan. It was simply trying to

squeeze out aggressive tax planning. Such matters will never be an

exact science, but it was an attempt to deal with the avoidance while

not hitting other forms of sale and leaseback. I hope that hon. Members

are satisfied by my clarification of

matters.</div><a name="06052413000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I wish to raise some worries

that the Chartered Institute of Taxation had about the original

paragraph 6 that the amendment would delete and I wish to clarify

whether those worries have been addressed by the amendments tabled by

the Paymaster General. The institute is worried about the way in which

the measures relate to sub-participations in loans and how they are

dealt with. For the sake of clarity, I shall set out how matters work.

What usually happens in respect of a funded sub-participation is that

the originator would derecognise part of its assets for accounting

purposes. Let us suppose that a loan of &#163;100 is originated, of

which 40 per cent. is sub-participated. The originator only shows a

loan of &#163;60 on its balance sheet, the profit and loss account

only shows income of &#163;60 and nothing is recorded for the

remaining 40 per cent. asset or the 40 per cent. liability under the

sub-participation

agreement.</div><a name="06052413000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Chartered Institute of Taxation believed that, under the original

paragraph 6, the proposed new section 85C of the Finance Act 1996 will

now require an originator to recognise income on the full &#163;100

of the loan asset. When the sub-participation agreement is a loan

relationship under proposed new section 85C, the originator will, in

addition to taxing the debits and credits on the whole &#163;100 of

the loan asset, be able to recognise the debits and credits on the loan

liability of &#163;40, so the net result is that it still shows an

asset of&#163;60 and it shows the income of &#163;60 on

its profit and loss

account.</div><a name="06052413000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chartered

Institute of Taxation&#146;s worry about the matter and the

Government&#146;s original proposals was that, when the

sub-participation agreement is not a loan relationship under proposed

new section 85C, the originator seems to be taxed on the income

of&#163;100 from the loan asset, but there is no mechanism

to give relief to the amounts paid away on the sub-participation

agreement. Therefore, it would be taxed on &#163;100 in its profit

and loss account, but it would have no relief on the interest it pays

on the 40 per cent. ithas given away&#151;as it

were&#151;to someone involvedin sub-participation, unless

of course the &#147;fairly represent&#148; provision in section 84

of the FinanceAct 1996 overrides that position. I should be

grateful if the Paymaster General would say whether she believes that

the &#147;fairly represent&#148; provision in section 84 does

override the treatment of the sub-participation where there is not a

loan relationship in accordance with proposed new section

85C.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 338</div><a name="06052413000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a

couple of other issues to do with this relationship that I ought to go

through. Under proposed new section 85C, there are potential

consequences for originators in relation to what might happen where the

underlying asset is impaired. Proposed new section 85C requires the

originator to recognise the entire loss. The originator would also be

entitled to recognise the gain under the sub-participation agreement.

There should be no impact overall in respect of this, unless one of two

conditions are met. Either the section 209 &#147;results

dependent&#148; provision of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act

1988 applies to deny interest deductions, or the sub-participant is a

connected party. Section 209</div>

that where a connected party is involved there may be no relief

impairments. Its belief is that in the original drafting this appears

first relates to basic principles of loan relationship legislation. I

assure the House that the Law Society guidance was not produced by my

the &#147;former&#148;, so I have no financial interest to declare.

According to the Law Society brief,

</div><a name="06052413000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The general

rule is that the items that are brought into account and the timing of

states:</div><a name="06052413000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

effect is that once a company has determined the relevant profits and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000328"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Thank you, Sir John; I shall be brief, then.

First, as the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) identifies, amendment

No. 66 relates to a measure dealing with avoidance schemes that rely on

accounting rules to cause profits on loan relationships to be

de-recognised, and so fall out of tax charges. He is quite right that

concern was expressed about the original drafting, which would have

meant that the measure applied to certain types of normal, commercial

transactions such as hedging arrangements and sub-participations

entered into by banks. The Government listened very carefully to

representations and accepted that the original drafting may have gone

too far. Amendment No. 66 has effectively rewritten the measure so that

it is more narrowly focused on the avoidance scheme at which it is

aimed, and ensures that it does not catch commercial

activities.</div>

<a name="06052413000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the

hon. Gentleman&#146;s two points on certain banking

sub-participations, the measure will not affect the banking

sub-participation market. The complaint was in connection with the

application of the connected party rules on impairment losses, but the

measure will not make banks and their associates any worse off. The

hon. Gentleman made a further point about connected party bad debt

rules. The anti-avoidance measure in the Bill does not actually deal

with that, and if there is a problem, this is not the place in the Bill

in which to try to solve it. I say to the hon. Gentleman and those who

read our deliberations that if banks consider there to be a serious

problem on that issue, I will ensure that my officials discuss those

issues with the banking industry very quickly. I do not believe that

the matter is specifically connected to the clause, but if that subject

is being raised as an issue, the industry needs to come forward

formally with it in discussions. We would be happy to hear what it has

to

say.</div><a name="06052413000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 67 to 70 make small but important changes that modify the shares

as debts rules introduced last year. I think that they are

straightforward, and perhaps I do not need to reflect on them. The hon.

Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) asked about loan

relationships, and I touched on that under

contracts.</div>

pm</div><a name="06052413000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,

having listened carefully, the Government are undertaking in the

amendments to put beyond doubt what they believe the position always

has been in respect of this matter. Most commentators now accept it,

but a few have argued that tax computational laws, which rely on

accounting recognition of profits, override the basic requirement that

amounts brought in to charge for tax are those that fairly represent

profits and gains arising to

companies.</div><a name="06052413000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure

does not undermine the principles of the two regimes&#151;that is the

important message. In fact, it supports them by basing the tax measure

of income on normal commercial accounting, which we would expect fairly

to represent accruals profits and gains arising to the company, so

there is no need for uncertainty. That is the long answer. Basically,

we listened to the points that were made and amended the legislation

accordingly.</div><a name="06052413000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

seems to be one further point in respect of connected party bad debt

rules, which was not part of the submissions from others. It would not

be dealt with in the schedule anyway, as it is not relevant. However,

as I said, if there are particular issues outstanding, I would be more

than happy to ensure that they are passed on, and to arrange for

officials to meet the industry to discuss

them.</div><a name="06052413000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000329"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I wish to raise some issues about schedule 6 that

have been brought to my attention, principally by the Law Society. The

first is a change introduced in the Budget and proposed in paragraph 4

to the rules concerning mandatory convertible securities and the deemed

disposal of those securities on 2 March 2006. There is concern that

intra-group reorganisations or transfers might lead to a tax charge

being payable, despite the fact that the group had not sold the

security.</div>

<a name="06052413000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall go

into more detail. As the Bill stands, a company that holds the benefit

of a mandatory convertible security on 22 March 2006 is treated as

making the disposable security at its market value on that date. The 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 341</div>resulting gain or loss is brought into charge to tax when the company

ceases to hold the security. The provision would bring the deferred

gain or loss into charge to tax on any disposal in paragraph

4(6)&#151;even on an intra-group transfer or reorganisation, when a

company, or group of which it is a member, has not realised any

economic benefit from the disposal.</div>

<a name="06052413000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Paymaster General

confirm that in such circumstances the deferred gain or loss would

actually be deferred, and that no tax would be payable until there was

a real economic disposal of the mandatory convertible security? I

understand that such an approach would be consistent with that adopted

for money debts that were chargeable assets when the loan relationship

rules under the Finance Act 1996 were introduced. That is my first

point.</div><a name="06052413000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 5 is

the subject of my second point, on which my hon. Friend the Member for

South-West Hertfordshire may have touched during the debate on

Government amendment No. 66. Again, the concern is that the paragraph,

which looks relatively innocuous, states that</div>

<a name="06052413000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Section 85A of FA

1996...is amended as follows...In subsection (1) (amounts to

be brought into account are those recognised in determining

company&#146;s profit or loss) after &#147;Subject to the

provisions of this Chapter&#148; insert &#147;(including, in

particular, section

84(1))&#148;.</div><a name="06052413000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Paymaster General touched on the issue during her response on the last

group of amendments. The concern is that the paragraph seems to change

the basis on which interest and other aspects of the loan relationship

are treated. Historically, they have been treated in accordance with

accounting principles. There is concern that paragraph 5 changes that

so that when companies have drawn up their accounts in line with

generally accepted UK accounting practice, they have to work out what

&#147;fairly represent&#148; means, without having the guidance to

enable them to do so. There is concern that if there is such a change,

more guidance ought to be provided to taxpayers to help them understand

what &#147;fairly represent&#148; means in the circumstances and

why it overrides general UK accounting practice.</div>

<a name="06052413000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third

point relates to paragraph 10 of the schedule and to intra-group

lending. I think that my hon. Friend touched on the issue earlier;

perhaps the Paymaster General does not need to refer to that point, but

I should be grateful for her thoughts on the treatment of deemed

disposals on mandatory convertible

securities.</div><a name="06052413000106"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000330"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The transitional rules work in a fair way. When

a mandatory convertible is first brought within the loans relationship

regime, a capital gain is calculated by reference to fair value at that

time. However, that gain is not taxed until the company disposes of the

convertible. Any amount of tax under the loan relationship rules cannot

be brought into accounting in any other way, so it cannot be included

in the working out of capital gain; it is not clear how it is thought

that there would be a problem.</div>

<a name="06052413000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">As most

mandatory convertibles appear to be used for tax avoidance purposes,

there is unlikely to be any commercial reason why they should need to

be subject to a group reorganisation and there is no reason for a more

generous regime than is in the Bill. I dealt with the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 342</div>hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point in answering his hon. Friend the

hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. It is the Government&#146;s

view that the measures before us are a fair representation of what we

always believed was the case. However, some commentators argued to the

contrary, so the change will put the matter beyond doubt. The measures

will reassert the Government&#146;s view on how the rules should

work.</div> <a name="06052413000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the

hon. Member for Fareham that we are trying to deal with avoidance. A

great deal of care has been taken to consider specifically how to

target and deter avoidance without causing problems for legitimate

commercial relationships. I hope that he will accept

that.</div><a name="06052413000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000331"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I hope that the Committee

will bear with me as I introduce clause 78. It is important that I put

some points on the record to assist everybody using our deliberations

and the Government&#146;s

clarifications.</div><a name="06052413000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause

78 deals with controlled foreign company legislation and is designed to

prevent UK companies from diverting profits to low-tax regimes. It is

important to remember that the only companies that face a charge under

CFC legislation are those that divert profits from the UK to avoid UK

tax. Unfortunately, CFC legislation is constantly under attack from

those who seek to avoid Parliament&#146;s intentions. This Government

and previous Governments have had to add additional anti-avoidance

rules to ensure that it remains fit for purpose.</div>

<a name="06052413000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 78 will block a loophole

in one such piece of anti-avoidance legislation, section 90 of the

Finance Act 2002. The particular mischief that concerned the Government

then and now was that companies can artificially migrate to another

country simply to avoid the effect of the CFC rules by using the

provisions of a double taxation treaty.</div>

<a name="06052413000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was widely

accepted at the time that such migrations might have become possible as

a consequence of the exemption from corporation tax of

companies&#146; chargeable gains from substantial shareholdings,

which came into effect on 1 April 2002. The exemption was welcomed by

business, which was also fully involved in developing section 90.

Companies that migrated before 1 April 2002 were excluded from section

90, not least because they did not have the benefit of the substantial

shareholdings exemption when they migrated.</div>

<a name="06052413000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have since

become aware that some excluded companies are being used in tax

avoidance schemes, and clause 78 seeks to counter such schemes. We have

targeted the clause as tightly as possible to avoid leaving open

unacceptable risks of continued avoidance on one hand and, on the

other, to continue 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 343</div>to exclude companies not involved in tax avoidance. The clause does so

by focusing mainly on the type of company used in marketed tax

avoidance schemes.</div>

<a name="06052413000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Condition A focuses on

companies that have never owned any subsidiaries and are available to

use as special purpose vehicles in avoidance schemes. If we left it

there, we suspect that, such is the ingenuity of tax planners&#146;

imaginations, it would not be long before companies that happened to

own a subsidiary or two were used instead, so condition B aims to

forestall all such manipulation.</div>

<a name="06052413000266"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

pm</div><a name="06052413000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Condition B is

designed specifically not to catch migrated companies that are already

the parent of multinational groups and continue to act as the parent of

the same group. Such companies are outside the scope of the clause and

will not be affected by it when the group makes acquisitions, including

sizeable acquisitions, within its own sector in the normal course of

its business. Any company that is in doubt as to how the clause will

apply should seek clarification from HMRC, but I hope that I have put

clearly on the record what is outside the scope of the clause and that

no further clarification will be

required.</div><a name="06052413000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes

introduced in the clause ensure that from 22 March 2006 the position is

returned to that intended in 2002. The clause will prevent tax

avoidance and ensure greater consistency between companies that became

non-resident at any date. I commend the clause to the

Committee.</div><a name="06052413000121"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000332"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I am grateful for the Paymaster General&#146;s

comments and particularly her comment that the controlled foreign

companies law is constantly under attack from those seeking to

undermine Parliament&#146;s will. She will be aware of an attack on

that law in the current Cadbury Schweppes case, which is proceeding

through the European Court of Justice. The Advocate-General has already

determined against the Government. I merely ask whether anything in the

clause anticipates a judgment in that case and, if not, what is the

likelihood of the legislation having to be reformed next year or the

year after in consequence of an adverse judgment from the ECJ. Has the

Treasury reached an estimate of the likely cost of the Cadbury

Schweppes case if the ECJ finds against the

Government?</div><a name="06052413000122"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">The

Chairman: </b>Order. I do not think an estimate of the cost of the

Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I was interested to note that

the Paymaster General referred specifically to acquisitions abroad

within the sector of operation of the UK resident company or parent

entity. I shall be grateful if she could clarify whether she is ruling

out international diversification as a means of tax avoidance when

there may be a bona fide reason for a UK-based company to acquire a

company in a different sector but with some similarities. Is that

intended to be caught by the measure?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 344</div><a name="06052413000125"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000335"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I shall briefly make one or two points. I am

grateful to the Paymaster General for her clarification of the clause.

I know that people outside the House will appreciate her comments and

clarity. I want to be clear about one point. She suggested that

companies should seek advice before entering into one of those

transactions, but I was not clear whether that was a form of

pre-clearance mechanism or a form of guidance that they could receive

from the HMRC prior to entering into a transaction. I would be grateful

for clarification from her on that.</div>

<a name="06052413000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster General referred

to examples, and although I do not wish to ask for specific examples,

will she state how many companies migrated offshore prior to 1 April

2002? That will tell us whether she is addressing a small problem or

trying to close a large loophole.</div>

<a name="06052413000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.

Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, we are conscious

of the issue relating to the threat posed to CFC legislation by

European Court judgments. He referred to the Cadbury Schweppes case.

There appears potentially to be an issue when the UK-incorporated

company has migrated to within the European economic area: the loophole

that the Paymaster General is trying to plug will not be plugged if the

judgment goes against the UK Government, whereas companies outside the

EEA will find the loophole being closed down. I would be grateful if

she would address the issues relating to the ECJ and its thoughts on

the CFC legislation. To what extent can protection be gained to prevent

more companies from trying to avoid tax by locating outside the

EEA?</div><a name="06052413000128"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000336"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I shall deal first with the question on the

Advocate-General&#146;s opinion. As the hon. Gentleman knows better

than I do, it is an opinion; it advises the Court and it is not a final

judgment. I am sure that he would not expect me to go any further. He

will have seen from the Advocate-General&#146;s opinion that CFC

rules were considered to be compatible with the treaty freedoms and

that compliance with such regimes does not represent, in the

Advocate-General&#146;s view, an unacceptable burden on companies.

However, I have made it clear that that is his opinion and it would be

unwise for me to go any further until we have a judgment from the

Court.</div> <a name="06052413000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

specific points, I do not have a figure in respect of migrated

companies&#151;I am unsure whether one exists. It would be

substantial, and we can see that in the flows. I wonder whether the

hon. Gentleman would find it acceptable for me to write to him, members

of the Committee and to you, Sir John, to outline the scope of the

problem. We believed that it was not insignificant and a potentially

difficult issue.</div><a name="06052413000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Gentleman made a point about clearance. I was not suggesting a

statutory clearance procedure in my opening remarks on the clause: I

was saying exactly what we thought was outside. If companies wished

still to seek clarification from the HMRC on a case in this area, they

could do so and the HMRC would consider itself bound, as is normal, by

what it then advised.</div>

<a name="06052413000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn to the other

questions. Bona fide acquisitions are not caught. Diversifications are

not ruled out, but they can be complex. The hon. Member for Fareham

will understand from my opening remarks 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 345</div>the specific points that we are trying to address. I do not want this to

be a cumbersome process, because it is no good for the companies

either. They are taking decisions on this matter and need to do so at a

relatively fast rate. However, if a company were in any doubt, the

offer relating to the seeking of clearance and advice in the informal

procedures, to which I referred, would be open and the same points

would stand with regard to the advice given.</div>

<a name="06052413000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have tried to return the

legislation to the 2002 intent. It is difficult, given the ingenuity of

tax planners, but at every opportunity we must recognise legitimate

activities and place them outside the scope of the clause. When that is

not clearly done, I suggest that companies speak directly to the HMRC

to get its response to their particular

case.</div><a name="06052413000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

transfer of assets abroad. I have no time for those who transfer their

assets abroad with a view to avoiding tax and I welcome the initiatives

that the Government are taking in the Bill to stop that practice.

However, there are legitimate reasons why assets might be transferred

abroad&#151;the establishment of a business, for example. The bit

that caught my eye is in paragraph 3, where we come across conditions A

and B. The provision is referred to in the explanatory notes as a

revised purpose test, designed to discover the motive behind the

transaction. I would be grateful if the Paymaster General would let me

know whether the conditions appear in other tests of tax

avoidance.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 346</div><a name="06052413000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I

understand it, if there is a dispute between the Revenue and an

individual as to whether a certain activity is taxable, it goes before

the courts at the end of the day, and they would consider all the

circumstances of the case and come down on one side or the other. If

one goes down the condition A and condition B route, the taxpayer would

not just have to show that, on balance, his interpretation was correct,

but that the interpretation the Inland Revenue had put on it was

unreasonable. It would be interesting if the Revenue planned to

introduce this test in schedule 7, but extended it broadly to apply to

other cases in which there was a dispute between the individual and the

Revenue. If it did, the terms of trade between the Revenue and the

individual would be tilted towards the Revenue.</div>

<a name="06052413000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some questions for the

Paymaster General when she winds up the debate. Is there any precedent

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000338"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I shall raise several concerns, particularly from

the Law Society, about the operation of schedule 7. Some of them touch

on the points that my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West

Hampshire (Sir George Young) made. The Institute of Chartered

Accountants in England and Wales has also expressed some concerns about

the operation of schedule 7.</div>

<a name="06052413000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 7

amends the exemptions for bona fide transactions from sections 739 and

740 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. However,

representations from the Law Society suggest that in several respects

the schedule goes too far, narrowing unnecessarily the scope of the

exemption and imputing on to the taxpayer the motives of the tax

adviser.</div>

<a name="06052413000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.

Friend referred to the two tests&#151;conditions A and B. The

Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales would welcome

some guidance on the circumstances in which HM Revenue

andCustoms believes that condition A would be satisfied.

Paragraph 60 of the consultation document, &#147;Transfer of Assets

Abroad&#151;Technical Notes on Draft Clause&#148;, sets out the

Revenue&#146;s view that the new provisions will require all relevant

circumstances of the case to be considered, including

the</div><a name="06052413000149"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;actual objective

outcome of the transactions&#148;.</div>

<a name="06052413000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the amendments is to move

away from a subjective test of what happens when assets are transferred

abroad, to a more objective test of the motives behind it.</div>

<a name="06052413000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the objective outcome of the

transactions is no reduction in the amount of UK tax payable, arguably

there will be no need for the Revenue to invokethe provisions

in section 739 of the 1988 Act, thus rendering the exemption of

proposed new section 741A redundant. The ICAEW requests clarification

about whether the Revenue envisages any scenarios in which the

objective outcome of the transaction results inthe reduction

of UK tax, but the exemption under proposed new section 741A(1)(a) is

still allowed, by virtue of condition A being satisfied.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 347</div><a name="06052413000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Condition B is a broader test of

the transactions. It requires all transactions to be commercially

valid, and requires that the steps in the transaction are no more than

incidentally designed to avoid the liability for tax. Subsections (5)

and (6) of this schedule then give further details of the definition of

commercial transactions.</div>

<a name="06052413000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society believes that

transactions by individuals are unlikely to benefit from the exemption

in condition B. In a clear example, it shows that if a transferor

transfers assets into a trust for investment, the transfer will not be

at arm&#146;s length, and it will therefore fall outside the

exemption. Indeed, that would be true if an individual invested

directly into an overseas fund, since although the fund would meet the

conditions of subsection (5), the personal investor would

not.</div> <a name="06052413000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, the

Law Society is concerned that subsection (6) is overly focused on the

structure of the transaction. It provides

that</div><a name="06052413000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the making and

purpose, independent means that the persons concerned are not connected

within the meaning of section 839 of the 1988 Act. The provision puts

to one side whether transactions are done on an arm&#146;s length

basis, and it focuses on whether the people involved are

connected.</div> <a name="06052413000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The person

for whom the investment is done can be the transferor or the person who

receives the benefit of the investment, or the offshore entity, or the

fund itself, because the investment manager will often be contracted by

or on behalf of the fund rather than the investment. One can imagine a

situation, particularly in a corporate structure, in which the

investment manager could be connected with the offshore

fund.</div><a name="06052413000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society

believes that it would be difficult for a transaction to satisfy the

independence element of subsection (6) of this schedule. It suggests

that the real test should not be about the structure of the

transaction, because that is likely to result in subsection (6) not

applying in a huge range of circumstances. Instead, it suggests asking

whether the transaction between investor and manager is at arm&#146;s

length. Will the Paymaster General comment on that? Because if the

criterion is one of structure rather than an arm&#146;s length test,

the exemption may be

redundant.</div><a name="06052413000158"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000339"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I should like to give an example to elaborate on

that point. It would be helpful if the Paymaster General would clarify

whether the provision is intended to catch investment managers who seed

a hedge fund offshore. Somebody may set up a hedge fund based in the UK

that seeks to have its centre of operations in a jurisdiction such as

the Cayman Islands, or another offshore jurisdiction attractive to

other foreign investors who are looking to invest in that fund and who

would not be subject to UK taxation. To get the fund off the ground the

individual&#151;possibly a sole trader&#151;could make an

investment in a special-purpose vehicle that would be set up in an

offshore jurisdiction. That might be classified as a connected 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 348</div>trade, because there would be no third party and it might take some time

for the individual to establish the business&#151;it often takes

months if not years to get such investment vehicles running. It surely

cannot be intended that such a situation be

caught.</div><a name="06052413000159"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000340"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s point leads me to a similar

one made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants about setting up a

new business. An individual resident in the UK may establish a foreign

company to trade outside the UK&#151;possibly in a country with

higher corporation tax rates than the UK&#151;and he may decide that

it is commercially sound to provide finance or assets to the company on

favourable terms from his own resources, because he may consider it

worthwhile to subsidise his company to enable it to generate revenue.

The institute is concerned that that situation might be

caught.</div><a name="06052413000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those

situations concern different types of business, but the issue remains

how to demonstrate the value of assets that have been transferred

overseas, and whether they were transferred at a commercial rate, and

in both situations there could be an impact on the business economics.

A more equitable approach in both situations may therefore be to

consider the commerciality of a transaction as a factor to be taken

into account in determining whether it was more than incidentally

designed for the purpose of avoiding tax

liability.</div><a name="06052413000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection

(4) of the schedule concerns the imputation of tax advisers&#146;

motives to their clients. It

says:</div><a name="06052413000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

intentions and purposes of any person who, whether or not for

consideration,&#151;</div><a name="06052413000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)

designs or effects the relevant transactions or any of them,

or</div><a name="06052413000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) provides advice

in relation to the relevant transactions or any of

them</div><a name="06052413000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">are to be taken into

account in determining the purposes for which those transactions or any

of them were effected.&#148;</div><a name="06052413000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

am concerned that a tax adviser may decide to structure a particular

transaction in a way that minimises tax but the taxpayer might not be

aware of that. The clause would mean that taxpayers, even if they did

not know, ought to have borne in mind the fact that the tax adviser may

have tried to structure the transaction in a particular way.</div>

<a name="06052413000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that the Paymaster

General will say&#151;as she did on an earlier clause when we were

debating an amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for

Wycombe&#151;that we are talking about legislation targeted at

particular schemes that have been marketed to individuals in an

aggressive fashion, and cases in which both the taxpayer and the

adviser know the exact purpose of the scheme, which is to reduce tax.

Could the Paymaster General comment a little further on subsection (4),

and say whether she thinks thatthe terms have been drawn so

widely that there may be situations in which innocent

taxpayers&#151;someone setting up a business overseas, for

example&#151;are inadvertently caught by that

subsection?</div><a name="06052413000164"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000341"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I do have some sympathy with

thehon. Gentleman&#146;s point, and I think that it has

also been made by the Law Society of England and Wales, of which I am a

member, but I caution him about picking up other people&#146;s

briefs, because I am almost 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 349</div>certain from what he has read that he is referring to subsection (4) of

proposed new section 741A, which is to be inserted into the Act. That

is at the bottom of page 193. It is not a subsection (4) to the

schedule. If I have got it wrong, and he is not referring to the final

two lines on page 193 and the first lines on page 194, perhaps he will

tell us so, but if he is referring to those lines, I caution him about

the way in which he takes his

briefs.</div><a name="06052413000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06052413000342"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Andy Reed</b> (Loughborough) (Lab/Co-op): There is no answer

to

that.</div><a name="06052413000166"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000343"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> There is indeed no answer to that, and it is indeed

proposed new section 741A that relates to subsection (4) on line 39,

page 193. One of the issues in dealing with a Bill such as this one is

that outside bodies are interested in it, and raise concerns about the

scope of the changes and their impact on lawyers, accountants,

taxpayers and so on.</div>

<a name="06052413000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society also has

concerns about whether the provisions would allow inquiries into the

purposes of the adviser, and it also raises issues around legal

privilege and the confidentiality of clients&#146; information. I am

not a member of the Law Society of England and Wales&#151;and I am,

at times, profoundly grateful for that. My hon. Friends and the hon.

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West may wish to comment on that aspect

of the Law Society&#146;s brief, but that is a concern that it has,

and it is important that the issues that it raises are aired on its

behalf, as there are so few solicitors in this House who can speak up

in its defence.</div><a name="06052413000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I

just comment on subsection (9) on page 194? It

says:</div><a name="06052413000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

jurisdiction of the Special Commissioners on any appeal includes

jurisdiction to review any decision taken by an officer of the Board in

exercise of the officer&#146;s functions under this

section.&#148;</div><a name="06052413000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be

grateful to hear from the Paymaster General whether that gives the

special commissioners the power to amend or vary the decisions taken; I

suspect that it probably does, but I should be grateful for that

clarification.</div><a name="06052413000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

also want to raise the thorny issue of clearance, which has popped up

in debates along the way. As I understand it, any application for

exemption under section 741 is dealt with under a self-assessment

system, so that a company entering into a transaction such as

establishing a foreign company&#151;something that my hon. Friend the

Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) referred to&#151;would claim the

exemption in its 2007 tax return. Assuming that the taxpayer were to

submit his return before the 31 January 2008 deadline and full

disclosure were made, HMRC would have until 31 January 2009 to open an

inquiry into the tax return. In effect, the taxpayer would not know for

certain whether he has a UK tax liability in respect of the

company&#146;s income until almost three years after the company was

established. That will create uncertainty in the minds of

taxpayers.</div><a name="06052413000268"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

pm</div><a name="06052413000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We discussed

how exemptions could put into question some transactions. One solution

that would deal with the uncertainty and provide a clearer picture 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 350</div>for the taxpayer earlier than up to three years after he establishes the

business would be a formal clearance procedure. An alternative is the

informal route that the Paymaster General referred to under clause 78,

whereby a taxpayer could seek guidance from HMRC which would then be

binding.</div><a name="06052413000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

understand that advisers and professional bodies have been in

discussion with HMRC about the issue and that at present the Government

are not proposing a clearance system but are prepared to consider, in

the light of further evidence, whether such assistance might be

necessary. I understand that people are trying to determine whether

there is sufficient evidence to justify taking the matter back to the

Treasury. I should be grateful for the Paymaster General&#146;s views

on whether any informal clearance will be offered to people who wish to

set up such

transactions.</div><a name="06052413000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">This

is not a straightforward schedule&#151;I have ploughed through

it&#151;and people outside this House are interested in following

through some important issues around the extent of the exemptions.

Theywant to ensure that bona fide, genuine commercial

transactions will not inadvertently fall within the scope of the Bill,

and they are particularly concerned about how conditions A and B and

subsections (5) and (6) will

operate.</div><a name="06052413000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06052413000344"></a><b class="B">Jeremy

Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I have three concerns

about what is proposed in subsection (4) of proposed new section 741A

of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. As we have already

discussed, the proposed new subsection deals with the intentions and

purposes of the designers of transactions, and of tax

advisers.</div><a name="06052413000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first

concern arises because of a potential difficulty with legal privilege.

I should make it clear that I am a lawyer but not a member of the Law

Society. It is right, of course, that some of the advisers that the

schedule refers to will be tax lawyers&#151;any member of the Gauke

family, for example&#151;and under such circumstances a difficulty

with legal privilege may arise. I wonder whether the Paymaster General

can comment on

that.</div><a name="06052413000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

second difficulty is a practical one. Transactions will be permissible

although they avoid tax liability if they were incidentally designed to

avoid tax. It is difficult to envisage circumstances in which it will

be possible clearly to establish how an adviser explained to his client

that a particular transaction would only incidentally avoid tax, rather

than primarily avoid

it.</div><a name="06052413000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the

Member for Fareham referred to the third difficulty, which seems to be

the key problem. Surely it is the intention of the taxpayer, not the

adviser, that the Government are keen to explore. Those two things are

not necessarily the same. It is right and logical that the

client&#151;the taxpayer&#151;goes to an adviser because the

adviser has more knowledge of such matters than the client does;

otherwise, the advice would scarcely be necessary. It is therefore

conceivable that the adviser understands far more about the avoidance

of tax than the client does, and only if that intention to avoid tax is

communicated to a client does a problem

arise.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 351</div><a name="06052413000178"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000345"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that

if a professional adviser knowingly advises on tax avoidance and the

client simply does not ask because they are happy to take the money,

there is no

responsibility?</div><a name="06052413000179"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000346"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> No. I am suggesting that a tax adviser might

advise a client on a sensible measure to take to order his financial

affairs, which that tax adviser understands far better than the client.

If that measure were taken incidentally to avoid tax, it would be

perfectly acceptable under the Government&#146;s proposed

legislation, but if it were taken primarily to avoid tax, it would not

be. That distinction might in some circumstances cause clients

difficulty.</div><a name="06052413000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

measures are entirely superfluous. If the Government are seeking to

penalise those taxpayers who understand that they are avoiding tax,

surely the taxpayer&#146;s intention and not the tax adviser&#146;s

is significant. If a taxpayer came to understand from his tax adviser

that what he was going to sign off on was tax avoidance, he would

rightly be penalised for it. But why is it necessary to include in

consideration the intention of the tax adviser rather than what he has

communicated to his client? That seems to be the difficulty created by

the

clause.</div><a name="06052413000181"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000347"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Clause 79 and schedule 7 will amend legislation

on the transfer of assets abroad. They are important anti-avoidance

provisions that were enacted in 1936, an important date in our

understanding of how the rules should

operate.</div><a name="06052413000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rules

introduced in 1936 aimed to prevent UK-resident individuals from

avoiding UK income tax by putting assets in offshore structures in such

a way that they retain control of the income arising from those assets.

The changes announced in the pre-Budget report closed a loophole

exploited by tax planners to avoid tax.</div>

<a name="06052413000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions in schedule 7

will recast the exemption test for post-PBR transactions. All relevant

circumstances, including the objective outcome of the transaction, must

be taken into account when deciding whether there was a tax avoidance

purpose. The intention of advisers must also be considered. I shall

return to that

point.</div><a name="06052413000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire asked whether the question

of purpose and reasonableness was new. The straightforward answer is

no. It is elsewhere in the legislation&#151;in section 741 of the

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, for example. Will the proposed

measures shift the balance toward HMRC? No. That is how HMRC operates

currently.</div>

<a name="06052413000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I

should give a slightly longer answer. The provisions are based on the

existing purpose test in section 741 of the 1998 Act. The

Government&#146;s view is that section 741A strikes a fair balance.

Its aim is a reasonable conclusion test to ensure that all

circumstances are taken into account when deciding whether an

individual had avoidance purpose. It is right to take all relevant

factors into account and draw a reasonable conclusion.</div>

<a name="06052413000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts

and commissioners have full power to consider HMRC decisions and

replace them if they decide that the taxpayer met the terms for

exemption under the reasonableness test. There is no doubt that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 352</div>special commissioners&#146; jurisdiction under the provisions will

necessarily include a power to vary or set aside HMRC&#146;s

decisions, not just to review them. That has always been the case under

current legislation, which has virtually the same

wording.</div><a name="06052413000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

question of legal professional privilege, I disagree with the point

that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) made. The

aim of subsection (4) is to ensure that the professional advice

obtained is taken into account as one of the circumstances of the case

and not disregarded as irrelevant. If an individual asserts that they

did not have the subjective purpose of avoiding tax, it is reasonable

to see whether the advice they were acting on was consistent with that

claim. That is all that is being required.</div>

<a name="06052413000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new provision does not

override advisers&#146; legal privilege. There is no compulsion under

subsection (4) to disclose advice given to clients. However, in

practice, using the example that the hon. Gentleman gave, it may be in

the taxpayer&#146;s interest if advisers do provide advice and waive

that privilege, assuming that the advice given is consistent with the

claim that there is no subjective purpose of avoiding tax. Otherwise,

there is a complete mismatch; people would say, &#147;I didn&#146;t

have the knowledge, they just happened to get a good deal for

me.&#148; That is ridiculous and that connection has to be

made.</div><a name="06052413000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no

reason why transactions involving innocent offshore structures, such as

family trusts, could not qualify under condition A; likewise for

ordinary investment transactions on arm&#146;s length terms in

commercially run offshore entities. In such cases, conditions for a

section 739 charge might apply. However, the taxpayer could potentially

show that an exemption was

due.</div><a name="06052413000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach for

condition B mirrors that of the old purpose test in section 741. It

strikes a reasonable balance in allowing some element of avoidance in

commercial cases, provided that they are no more than incidental, but

that is an essential part of the test and the case must be genuinely

commercial and not driven by tax avoidance.</div>

<a name="06052413000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I disagree with the idea that

subsection (5) is too restrictive. It is needed to prevent the abuse of

non-resident personal trusts for avoidance purposes by UK residents.

Generally, in cases where individuals make ordinary investment

transactions in entities independently managed by commercial concerns

on arm&#146;s length terms, condition A in section 741A will be

satisfied. There may be exceptional cases in which it is appropriate to

use section 739 against particular marketed retail investment

projects.</div> <a name="06052413000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not

even attempt to answer the point made by the hon. Member for Ludlow;

what he says shows the complexity of the issues. Given that the

legislation has been in place for rather a long time&#151;over 70

years&#151;it would be foolish to respond specifically to his point.

I am sure that he would not expect me to, without the full facts before

me, and a summary of what might happen to hedge funds is not

sufficient. Nor&#151;before the hon. Gentleman rises to repeat his

question&#151;shall I indulge in giving tax advice. I am not a

solicitor. I am not an accountant. There is a vast Department called

HMRC that provides that advice, and it is the appropriate point for

advice.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000349"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> No, I shall conclude my points; then the hon.

Gentleman can make

his.</div><a name="06052413000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the guidance

that HMRC could give on the operation of the legislation and in

response to the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman, I should say that

a drafting of guidance is in hand. HMRC aims to show that guidance to

representative bodies so that the agreed version can be published at

about the time of Royal Assent. The guidance will have examples of how

the rules will work in a number of different cases.</div>

<a name="06052413000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final point

was about the pre-transaction clearance system. I shall make clear what

is going on in discussions with HMRC. HMRC has already written to the

representative bodies explaining Government decisions in respect of the

schedule and why it thinks that a clearance is not necessary.

Nevertheless, as one would expect, the Department has indicated a

willingness to consider, without commitment, any further supporting

evidence showing why a clearance system is necessary.</div>

<a name="06052413000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 739 has

existed for 70 years without clearance. The changes under the Bill

should make the law clearer and remove doubt about how the purpose test

is intended to apply. There is now potentially less, not more, need for

a clearance system. As I said, HMRC will provide guidance on the new

provision. The representative bodies will need to get over a rather

high hurdle, given that something that has existed for 70 years and did

not need clearance apparently cannot be understood now and needs it. As

I said, there is no commitment, but if those bodies come forward to say

why the system should change, the Department will be prepared to

consider

that.</div><a name="06052413000198"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000350"></a>Jeremy

about intention? I did not hear her deal with that. My point was that,

on section 741A(4), I would entirely understand if the

Government&#146;s case was that it is important to know what advice a

taxpayer has received in deciding whether that taxpayer intended to

avoid tax. The difficulty is that subsection (4) does not say that; it

deals with the &#147;intentions and purposes&#148; of the adviser,

not the advice

given.</div><a name="06052413000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06052413000351"></a><b class="B">Helen

Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): I am interested in the

hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. Will he try to reconcile this? Many

of us have listened to the shadow Attorney-General use up hours of time

on the Floor of the House discussing intention in respect of terrorism

legislation. He said that maintaining intention in that legislation was

vital.</div><a name="06052413000200"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000352"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> I shall try to assist the hon. Lady. I am worried

not about the fact of intention, but whose intention we are talking

about. I am talking about the intention of the taxpayer. When it comes

to the avoidance of tax, the Government ought at the very least be

concerned about whether the taxpayer intends to avoid tax. My concern

is that, although I understand the logic of wanting to know what advice

a taxpayer 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 354</div>has received, I am not clear about why the legislation deals with the

&#147;intentions and purposes&#148; of the adviser rather than with

the advice given. I invite the Paymaster General to deal with that

specific point.</div>

<a name="06052413000201"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000353"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I dealt with that point. I made it clear that

if an individual asserted in their defence that they did not have the

subjective purpose of avoiding tax&#151;that their intention was not

to avoid tax&#151;the Government would not consider it unreasonable,

if the specific avoidance that HMRC seeks to close off was indicated,

to see whether the advice on which the individual was acting was

consistent with that claim. This is a responsibility of the

taxpayer.</div><a name="06052413000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,

as I have said, I do not believe that any taxpayer would not understand

their intention or the type of advice they had been given, or that

their legal advice or professional advice in any other way would have

left them ignorant of the purpose. This is another test to discover

whether the claim made by a taxpayer is sustained by the professional

advice that they then acted on&#151;they signed forms, they acted on

it.</div><a name="06052413000203"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000354"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I thank the Paymaster General for what she has said

in response to the points I and my colleagues made on this schedule.

She has set out clearly the Government&#146;s position on a range of

issues, and she has added some welcome clarity, particularly on the

operations of condition A and condition B, for which we are grateful.

Given that this legislation seems to have remained relatively untouched

for 70 years, I would like to think that we will not revisit it in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000355"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> The Opposition have considerable sympathy with

the Government&#146;s efforts to target the particular type of

reverter to settlor double trust arrangements that are the primary

focus of the clause. However, we have certain reservations about the

clause, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 355</div>which I should express in the context of our views on the pre-owned

assets regime as a whole. If I take the Committee through a couple of

those general points on the regime, I can then go on to deal with

clause 80 with some

rapidity.</div><a name="06052413000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far back

as 1986, rules have existed to prevent people from opting out of

inheritance tax by transferring title to their homes to their adult

children while continuing to live in them. These have been colloquially

described to me by some experts as</div>

<a name="06052413000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having your cake and eating it

arrangements&#148;.</div><a name="06052413000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">From 1986

onwards, the gift-with-reservation rules looked through such transfers

and treated the house as part of the estate of the parent on death for

inheritance tax purposes; hence, a Conservative Government made the

first move against such arrangements. Therefore, there is clearly a

degree of common ground in all parts of the House in respect of seeking

to prevent people from avoiding inheritance tax using this type of

scheme.</div>

<a name="06052413000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the

Government&#146;s pre-owned assets rules, which were an addition to

the gift-with-reservation rules and which came into effect in April

2005, have provoked considerable controversy and anxiety amongst those

affected by them. As veterans of the Committee may recall, in both 2004

and 2005 the Opposition expressed serious concerns about the pre-owned

assets regime on the grounds that there was a risk that it would lead

to double taxation and that the rules were drafted in such a way as to

penalise a number of innocent transactions between family members. In

respect of the first point on double taxation the key anxiety was that

the arrangements that had to be dismantled as a result of the new

pre-owned asset rules might be hit with a double inheritance tax

charge. I acknowledge that the Government have heeded the warnings

given on the matter by the Opposition and professionals, and I am

grateful that they have moved to deal with the double taxation problem

via secondary legislation. However, it is worth drawing to the

attention of the Paymaster General and the Committee the fact that

there are serious concerns whether the regulations published in

December can deal effectively with the problem. Taking into account the

impact of schedule 20, the Government appear to have provided in the

regulations a relief that nobody can use. I illustrate that as

follows.</div><a name="06052413000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most

serious double taxation problem under the pre-owned assets regime

concerned the so-called home loan schemes, which involved an IOU held

by the second of the two trusts that made up the scheme. Members who

were on the Committee last year will recall that more than 30,000

people have entered such schemes, so it was and remains a significant

issue for many. To unravel such a scheme in order not to fall into the

POA regime or go back into inheritance tax&#151;the Paymaster General

acknowledged that that was entirely in order, even desirable, for those

who have entered a trust&#151;the second trust must release the IOU,

the debt that was part of the original avoidance schemes targeted by

the POA legislation.</div>

<a name="06052413000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">After various representations,

the Paymaster General agreed that there was a problem of double

taxation in such cases. The December regulations specifically provide

that double charges relief will be available for inheritance tax

purposes if the debt is released. The aim of the regulations was to

ensure that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 356</div>if someone died within seven years of having entered a home loan scheme,

the IHT charge would not be levied on the same economic value

twice.</div> <a name="06052413000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem

occurs as a result of schedule 20 to the Bill. If the schedule is

accepted unamended&#151;I hope that it will not be&#151;it will

treat the release of the debt as an addition to the trust and an

immediate 20 per cent. inheritance tax charge will be levied if the

debt exceeds the inheritance tax nil rate band, which I am told it will

in many cases. So people are getting relief from one inheritance tax

charge as a result of the Paymaster General&#146;s welcome December

regulations, but it seems that they run into another because of

schedule 20. We must bear in mind that many people did not unwind their

schemes before the Budget because they had been waiting for the double

charges regulations that came out in late December, and not all their

arrangements and paperwork had been completed by March.</div>

<a name="06052413000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be welcome if the

Paymaster General were prepared to look into the matter to see whether

schedule 20 will have the impact that I have described. It seems odd

that, having issued regulations to prevent double charging as a result

of the release of the debt in a home loan scheme, the Treasury now

seeks to impose an additional charge on the release of that debt. I

hope that, having stated clearly that double taxation should not occur

in the cases in question, the Paymaster General might consider amending

either schedule 20 or the December regulations to ensure that they have

the effect that I believe she

wants.</div><a name="06052413000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Opposition&#146;s second reservation with the pre-owned assets rules

is that there are a number of situations in which the ownership of

property is transferred between family members without tax being the

motivation. Those transfers could be caught by the pre-owned asset

rules, which were so widely drafted as to cover all disposals of land

and could therefore penalise such innocent transactions. Examples that

have been brought to my attention include a situation in which one

cohabitant gives money to her partner, who uses it to pay for the

purchase of the house in which they both live. Even if they later

marry, the donor cohabitant is caught by the pre-owned assets charge.

Cohabitants would be well advised to re-examine all such transactions

as far back as 1986, in case there is a danger of an unexpected

pre-owned assets

charge.</div><a name="06052413000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge

the Revenue&#146;s willingness to move on the matter when

representations have been made to it in the past to try to exclude such

innocent transactions, but problems remain. A particular difficulty is

caused if family members make arrangements that fall foul of the rules

without having any idea of the tax consequences. They might require the

informal arrangements that do not involve taking specialist tax advice

on the pre-owned assets

regime.</div>

<a name="06052413000270"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

pm</div><a name="06052413000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an age in

which pensioners are increasingly asset rich and cash poor, we must

bear in mind that their children might well want to help them to

realise some of their wealth by buying a share of the equity in their

parents&#146; homes. If such arrangements are entered into by a

parent and a bank, there is no problem, but if that kind of

equity-release arrangement is set up between family members, it

triggers the POAT rules. It does not 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 357</div>matter if the sale was at a commercial price, because the pre-owned

asset tax still applies on the cash element, even if it will attract

inheritance tax on the parent's death.</div>

<a name="06052413000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government wish to stop

people from giving away cash raised by equity release, they could

easily provide for that. It seems odd that where two members of a

family live together and one gives the other a share in the house, the

donor is not caught by the reservation of benefit rules or the POAT

rules. However, if the donor has insufficient resources to make the

gift and instead sells the interest to the other person living there,

whether or not at full value, the transaction is subject to the

pre-owned asset rules. Those are our reservations about the framework

as a whole.</div> <a name="06052413000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to

the clause itself. I can see why the Revenue would want to target the

double trust reverter to settlor trusts that are the focus of clause

80, as such schemes were clearly aimed at getting around the IHT rules.

I certainly prefer the more targeted approach in the clause to the

broad-ranging attack in schedule 20 on a whole range of trusts, most of

which have nothing to do with tax. As I made plain in my opening for

the official Opposition on Second Reading, we are prepared to work

constructively with the Government in their efforts to target

artificial schemes that may use trusts to avoid tax, as long as the

legislation is specifically targeted on such artificial

schemes.</div> <a name="06052413000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The majority

of trusts hit by the clause seem to fall into that category, so we

approach it with a degree of sympathy, but we have some concerns.

First, the clause has a retrospective effect in that it applies to

existing arrangements. That point is not as serious in this case as it

is in relation to schedule 20, because one would think that those

entering into such schemes probably had an idea that they were likely

to attract the attention of the Revenue at some point. None the less,

it is still a concern that this will be one of a number of occasions on

which the Government have introduced legislation that is, in effect,

retrospective.</div> <a name="06052413000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our

second and more serious concern is about the scope of the provision. As

with the overall pre-owned asset regime structure, there seems to be at

least some evidence that the width of the drafting could catch some

innocent transactions. I would be grateful if the Paymaster General

considered the point made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants,

which

states:</div><a name="06052413000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

mischief at which the clause is aimed is where property is part of an

individual&#146;s estate as a result of section 49 IHTA 1984 but will

revert to a settlor when that interest comes to an end on

death.&#148;</div><a name="06052413000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institute

goes on to recommend that the clause should be more specifically aimed

because it currently

denies</div><a name="06052413000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the benefit of

the relief where an individual has the relevant property in his estate

even where the revertor to settlor exemption is not

available.&#148;</div><a name="06052413000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Chartered Institute of Taxation has expressed similar concerns. Having

spoken to its representatives, I know that, in essence, its worry is as

follows. Let us take an example in which H sets up a trust for his wife

for life, into which he puts an interest in a house. He might have done

that some years ago&#151;perhaps in the late 1980s&#151;for various

reasons, some of which might involve tax and some of which might not.

It might have been part of an arrangement to make provision for the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 358</div>wife as part of a matrimonial settlement. So, the wife initially has an

interest in possession. Subsequently, she dies and the property reverts

back to H. No IHT would be payable at that point because of the spouse

exemption. H takes a qualifying interest in possession and the property

is part of his estate for the purposes of section 49 of the Inheritance

Tax Act 1984. On his death, IHT would be payable in the normal way,

because there is no double trust arrangement that gives rise to the

reverter to settlor exemption in section 54.</div>

<a name="06052413000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The settlement was set up by H

and no one else, so no loophole is being used. In essence, the value of

the house is subject to normal inheritance tax charges. However, under

clause 80, H would, from 5 December, be liable to the pre-owned assets

tax, because the new paragraph 11(11) to schedule 15 of the

FinanceAct 2004 has been breached. This property was once

part of his estate and he now has an interest in possession in it

again. The net result of this rather complicated arrangement is that

both the pre-owned assets regime and inheritance tax apply and we have

a double taxation situation.</div>

<a name="06052413000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have enough empirical

knowledge to know how common these trusts might be, but I hope that the

Paymaster General will agree to look at this area as it is clearly not

the Government&#146;s intention to inflict both the pre-owned assets

tax and inheritance tax on the same arrangement. I hope that the

Government will consider amending the clause or looking at it again to

ensure that it targets only the double trust reverterto

settler arrangements, which are specifically designed to exploit the

loophole in section 54, and not the type of situations that I have

described. Certainly as the Chartered Institute of Taxation points out,

the scope of the clause seems to go rather beyond the press release in

the Budget report. Perhaps it would be possible to tighten up the

drafting in order to ensure that it focuses on the artificial schemes

that I believe the Paymaster General has in

mind.</div><a name="06052413000228"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000356"></a>The

Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>At this point, may I say to hon. Members

that I hope that this will not turn into a debate on schedule 20? It

would be rather premature to have that

debate.</div>

<a name="06052413000229"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000357"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Indeed, Sir John. I should point out to the

hon. Lady that, whatever she might think, the changes contained in the

clause are completely unrelated to the issue she referred to. This is a

free-standing clause directed at artificial trust arrangements that are

designed to get round both IHT gift with reservation rules and the

pre-owned asset income tax charge. The problem when professional bodies

write complex examples is that it is difficult to know whether they are

giving real examples or are seeking to punch a hole in the legislation

by describing a theoretical position. I have seen little evidence that

her examples refer to common behaviour.</div>

<a name="06052413000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take the example of the

person who provided cash so that his mother could buy a house. The

mother dies and leaves the house, interest and possession to her son

who is then caught by the income tax charge. Let us look at how

unlikely that would be. It would require the person in question to make

a significant gift to somebody else to purchase an asset, only to have

it resettled upon them under the person&#146;s will within 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 359</div>seven years and then take up occupation and receive an imputed benefit

of more than the de minimis limit of &#163;5,000 per annum. The

amendments that we have made to the election provision would enable the

person to elect out of the income tax charge. The relationships that

have been suggested seem somewhat unlikely, but even so the answer is

for the person to elect out of the income tax charge if their interest

also forms part of their estate for IHT purposes.</div>

<a name="06052413000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady gave a further

example and I am aware that representations have been made to the HMRC

about it. It is in connection with elderly parents being caught if they

do not have enough property to be liable for IHT. They sell their house

and give money to their children to convert part of their house into a

granny flat. I believe that that was discussed during the debates on

pre-owned assets. I have asked the HMRC, under those circumstances, to

monitor the situation so that we can see whether that is an issue and

whether it will create difficulties with the pre-owned assets. Should

that be the case, I would be prepared to reconsider the

matter.</div> <a name="06052413000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the

Committee, however, that the pre-owned asset rules are targeted at

those who use contrived structures to avoid paying inheritance

tax&#151;that still stands. I was amazed at some of the examples in

defence of the individuals who claimed that they were not trying to

avoid inheritance tax. Often that paves the way to a clear indication

that that is exactly what they were trying to

do.</div><a name="06052413000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady also

said that innocent cases could be caught by the provisions. With the

exception of the case that I flagged up in which there is discussion

with representative bodies and which I am asking the HMRC to monitor

carefully&#151;the legislation was not intended to apply to such a

case&#151;the truth is that it is incredibly unlikely&#151;it still

has not been asserted&#151;that innocent cases will be affected by

the pre-owned assets regulations, even in the cases that she

mentioned.</div><a name="06052413000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Great care

is always necessary in such matters, but the fact is that the reason

for the exemptions, and hence for the clause, is to ensure that

individuals do not sidestep income tax or the IHT charges and do not

avoid income tax charged to the pre-owned assets or the inheritance

tax. I see you smiling, Sir John, but given the arguments that were

advanced in the introduction of the pre-owned assets, I am sure that

you understand that I am not particularly attracted to such

action.</div><a name="06052413000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that

we will have a lot of time to discuss the matter during consideration

of later clauses, but I can assure the hon. Lady that care is taken

over the interaction of the legislation. If she is seeking an assurance

from me that I shall continue to do that in the course of this Finance

Bill, I can give her that assurance. However, perhaps some of the

points that she made today would be more appropriately explored at a

later stage.</div>

<a name="06052413000236"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000358"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I acknowledge that that issue

is separate from schedule 20, which is why I did not seek to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 360</div>advance issues on schedule 20 apart from where I felt that there might

be a difficulty with its interaction with some of the pre-owned asset

regimes. I refute the suggestion that I was seeking to punch a hole in

the legislation. I made it plain that I was not seeking to defend the

double trusts reverter to settlor

arrangements.</div><a name="06052413000237"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000359"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I was not suggesting for a minute that the hon.

Lady was seeking to punch a hole in the legislation. If I thought that

that was the case, I would have been much clearer and said it to her

directly. I was referring to the examples constructed, which often

inadvertently have that effect. So unless she dreamed them up herself,

I am not accusing her of such a thing.

</div><a name="06052413000271"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

pm</div><a name="06052413000238"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052413000360"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Turning to those examples, I think that the

Paymaster General referred to one given by the professional bodies to

which I do not think that I referred. I did not refer to any of the

examples in which a parent passed a property to a child and the child

then sets up a trust. I referred to one example in which an individual

sets up a trust for his spouse. Again, I emphasise that I acknowledge

that there are significant problems when a property is transferred to a

child and a trust is set up. They seem to be at the heart of the double

trust situations, which the clause is targeting. As I have said on

several occasions, I can understand why the Government want to target

them. The situation that I described is subtly different. There is no

double trust and no attempt to exploit the loophole that is provided by

section 54. That can be done by setting up a double trust. It would be

useful for the Paymaster General to bear that in mind.</div>

<a name="06052413000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, I welcome the Paymaster

General&#146;s indication that she is prepared to monitor situations

where, for example, an elderly parent sells a share in the equity of

their home. As I said, she and the Revenue have shown a welcome degree

of flexibility in trying to remove innocent transactions from the scope

of these proceedings. I know that there was a particular concern about

loans between family members triggering the pre-owned assets regime. I

gather that, through extra statutory mechanisms, it looks like that

anxiety is being averted. I am pleased to hear that that approach,

which tries to ensure that innocent transactions stay out of a very

penal pre-owned asset regime, is continuing in relation to some of the

examples that I mentioned.</div>

<a name="06052413000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I sign off by saying that, in

the complicated example I raised, the real problem was the double

taxation charge. Regardless of what one thinks about the motivation for

setting up a trust, I hope that the Paymaster General would agree that

one of the things we do not want to come out of this measure is that

people end up in the pre-owned assets regime and pay inheritance tax.

It should be one or the

other.</div><a name="06052413000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put
