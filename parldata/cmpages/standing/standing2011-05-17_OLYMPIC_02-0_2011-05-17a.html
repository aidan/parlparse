afternoon. My name is Garrett Emmerson. I am the chief operating

am here today to give evidence in support of various amendments,
particularly relating to traffic regulation orders, which are contained
in the Bill. We think that they are sensible amendments that will
enable us to be more flexible in responding to real-life situations on
the road network during games time, in terms of being able to make
temporary traffic orders, to improve our ability to manage special
events and to ensure that we can carry out effective enforcement,
particularly of the games lanes on the Olympic route network during the
games. That is our general position. I am sure you want to go into
particular
aspects.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000012">&#160;</a>

at one point discuss on the Olympic Board was the feasibility not only
of modelling but of

			Column number: 34<a class="bkMark" name="Column34">&#160;</a>
                           </div>some kind of trial run. For instance, getting everyone to the stadium
for the opening ceremony: most will come not by road, but by rail and
other means. But I think that after the millennium we are all aware of
how fragile these well worked-out plans can be under pressure if they
have not been stress tested. What confidence can you give us that it

the nature of the Olympic games and events going on will be unique in
terms of anything we have dealt with in London, or are likely to deal
with again in the future, so perhaps it is not possible to simulate
completely in a live situation everything we know that we will have to
deal with. Having said that, we have a lot of experience of managing
events over a long period of time—the ones you have just
mentioned and more recent ones, up to as recently as the royal wedding
a couple of weeks ago, as well as more mundane ones, such as the TUC
march last month, which was a very big event, the biggest for some
years in London in terms of managing crowds and the traffic
around.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All
those things contribute to our knowledge and understanding of how we
need to manage such events, as indeed do things like major changes on
the road network. For instance, just after Christmas, the Mayor took
the decision to remove the western extension of the congestion charging
zone which, overnight, introduced a different set of traffic flows
across the network. We were able to test out in a live situation the
very same modelling work that we used to understand what is likely to
happen to traffic at games time—it was being used there in a
live
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000018">&#160;</a>

have a lot of experience of understanding all the component parts that
make up the games and the things we will have to do. The biggest
challenge will be repeating the level of attention and of activity
daily. We deal with a lot of these events—they are fairly
regular occurrences—but we do not deal with them for 30 days in
a row. There is a serious question about capacity and ensuring that we
have the capacity to manage over a long period when dealing with those
events. That is something we are giving a lot of attention to, and
making sure that we have sufficient resources and that the public
understand that. It is one thing to get the message out around a
particular day and a particular event, but to be able to repeat that
and to maintain that interest over a relatively long period is a
significant
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000019">&#160;</a>

That is work that we are still working through to understand what we

ask how does that impact on commercial activity? How does that impact
on people trying to get to work? How does that impact on general
commuting? It will not necessarily be the same for everybody on every

                           </span> This morning, Mr
Emmerson, we heard from a witness from the ODA, who talked about the
suspension of all streetworks in London on the Olympic route network,
the alternative route network and the A and B roads in the boroughs. I
have to say that that was very welcome. May I press you on a couple of
points, about which you might have more
detail?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
when we say that streetworks will be suspended, does that mean not just
that the works will be stopped, but that roads will be reinstated for
the period of time of the Olympics? If works are going on, suspending
them would still keep the blockages in place. We need reinstatement, so
that there is a clear flow of traffic. Secondly, there will clearly be
emergencies. If there is a burst water main, it will have to be dealt
with. Is TfL insisting on lane-rental-type penalties or night-time
working to ensure that emergency works are done as fast as
possible?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

Emmerson:</strong>
                           </em> Those are two very significant
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
first thing to say is that you are absolutely correct: we are looking
for reinstatement; we will not be looking for road works to be
suspended with cones and nobody working, which would defeat the object
of what we are trying to do. The project to deliver that, which is
called ClearWay 2012, has been in existence for quite some time. To a
large extent, it is a planning activity that started a number of years
ago to ensure that all the major utility and, indeed, highway planned
works that might affect the road network at the time of the games were
phased either to occur and be finished before the Olympics or to wait
until
afterwards.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
key lengths of road network will be clear, and that has been in place
for some time in the form of the Olympic route network and, latterly,
the alternative Olympic route network. On those roads, that will come
into force earlier than the period of the games, simply to allow us the
space on the road network to construct the Olympic route network and
the physical measures associated with it. That will be ongoing through
the spring of next year, to be ready in time for the firing up of the
ORN at the beginning of the games period. It has become increasingly
obvious to us, however, that effectively managing the ORN—and
the alternative ORN for days when it is being used for road events and
so on—is an important part of what we have to do, but it is not
the only part of what we do. There will be games-related journeys right
across the city. If you take into account 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 38<a class="bkMark" name="Column38">&#160;</a>
                           </div>all the non-competition venues, such as hotels and all the other venues,
we are talking about more than 200 individual locations across the city
for which games traffic will be moving about, on and off the
ORN.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly, we
have two key priorities at games time. First, we must ensure that the
Olympic Family—the athletes, officials and so on—can get
about to where they need to be, when they need to be there, to enable
the events to run smoothly. Secondly, we must make sure that London
itself continues to run as smoothly as possible. We are as exercised
about the second as we are about the first. Ensuring that we achieve
both is what will make it a success.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One way we
can do that is to ensure that as far as possible the major strategic
roads across the city are free of roadworks and disruption. That is why
we have taken the view that our starting point should be that we should
not expect to see any planned roadworks on the A and B road network
across the city. As we get nearer the time and as it becomes obvious
that some roads are not likely to be of any significance for
games-related traffic—either diverting as result of the ORN
being in place or being used by the games families—we may be
able to make some exceptions to that. Our starting point is very much
that that is where we want to be. Although the utilities recognise that
that will be a major impediment to programmes, they understand its
significance and they have been working closely with us throughout the
development period.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the second
point about emergencies, again, I think you are absolutely right. We
certainly hope that there will not be too many emergencies, and the
summer is not peak season for something like burst water mains anyway,
but it is inevitable that somewhere, at some time, there will be some
sort of emergency. We and the utilities need to be in a position to
respond as quickly as possible. That is one of the key functions of the
London Streets traffic control centre, which is the key facility that
we use to manage the traffic network across London, from where we
control the traffic signals and monitor all our CCTV cameras.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need to
ensure that when incidents occur we are able to see them and spot them
as quickly as possible, and task resources—whether that is
utilities or, in the case of things such as road collisions, the police
and the emergency response services—to go and respond to them as
quickly as possible and to clear them up as quickly as possible. In the
case of utilities, we need to ensure that the physical road
reinstatements are done, and we are in the process of talking to
utilities to see if it is possible to use our own resources to come
straight in behind them and do the road reinstatements, rather than
waiting for utility contractors to do likewise. Again, there is a lot
of very co-operative working there.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think there
is a general understanding that London will be on show, and the
totality of what we do in managing the road network will be very much
on show. We are determined to ensure that the games run as smoothly as
possible as far as our involvement is
concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000052">&#160;</a>

want to ask a few questions about public transport. I know you said
that with regard to the roads there can be a reduction during August of
up to 30%, because people are not at work, but is the same true for

			Column number: 39<a class="bkMark" name="Column39">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the numbers on the tubes and the buses? My experience is often that the
tubes can be busier, because we have tourists from all over the
country—if not the world—here during a regular August
anyway. I am interested in the normal reduction for August, if there is
one, on the buses and the tubes. Can you go on to talk about your plans
for the huge numbers of extra people who will be on the buses and tubes
travelling to and from the Olympics? A further question is the effect
on regular Londoners who are trying to get to and from work using the
tube in the normal way.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000053">&#160;</a>

Emmerson:</strong>
                           </em> As I say, my responsibility is
predominantly for the road network rather than the public transport
network. If I may correct you, I said that the reduction on the road
network is in the order of up to 10% in the summer, rather than 30%.
The reductions on public transport networks tend to be greater, but the
key issue of course is not the total volume of road use or public
transport use; it is peak traffic volumes. In the morning peak
particularly, but also in the afternoon peak, those volumes are
considerably down. Although we have significant influxes of visitors to
London during that period, and there are very busy times, they do not
necessarily coincide with the busy commuting
hours.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a good analogy as to how the transport networks will look different
during games time generally in that we will have very unusual patterns
of movement across the network. There will be different flow regimes,
because many people will want to get to the key Olympic venues in the
centre or other parts of London, particularly the east where the main
venues are. Those flows will be a lot higher and a lot different from
what they usually are. The key challenge on both the road network and
the public transport network will be understanding and managing those
different
flows.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000055">&#160;</a>

Chairman. Mr Emmerson, I want to ask you about the impact of the
legislation on non-games-related traffic. As you said, it is important
to make sure that London continues to run as smoothly as possible.
Having a London constituency makes me focus on that part of it. Will
you talk about whether you think the Bill covers and provides enough
support for any challenges or emergencies that we may face?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000065">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, have
we involved enough local people in understanding the impact on them? If
I take as an example Chiswick where I am in west London, Chiswick high
road is a nightmare during rush hours at the best of times, and with
some of the alterations for the Olympics it will no doubt be even
worse. A great solution would be to let the Piccadilly line stop at
Turnham Green, because that would solve a lot of the problems, but as
you are a specialist on roads, I want to make sure that we have done
the background research to understand the impact by using enough local
people. They are the ones on the ground who know how the system works
on a daily
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000066">&#160;</a>

Emmerson:</strong>
                           </em> The most obvious thing is the work that we
are doing to develop the detailed design of the ORN, which is going out
to public engagement and consultation throughout this year on the
detailed design. There is a phased approach across the city, and we
will contact all residents who live within 400 metres of those
roads—that is upwards of 1 million letters through the
year—to invite people directly to engagement sessions and
consultation so that they understand what it is proposed will happen at
games time, and have the opportunity to have an input before the plans
are finalised and implemented on the ground. That is the major
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
make sure that that happens properly, the decision was taken a long
time ago to use the full permanent traffic regulation order process,
even though the measures will be in place only temporarily. We are
going through the full process, which requires full consultation and
engagement with people. But, as I said at the outset, it is inevitable
that however well you plan, things will need to be done and changed at
the last minute, for which an efficient process is required. That is
what the Bill gives. That is the bit that was
missing.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
relation to special events, the Bill gives more flexibility to take
account of local views and needs. At the moment, the powers are limited
to simple road closure for special events. The Bill will give you the
ability to include less draconian things, such as enforcing waiting
restrictions, right-turn bans and limiting different classes of
vehicle. As we go forward and get nearer the games, local communities
will inevitably want to hold events and so on. We must co-ordinate with
those and ensure that we can, as far as possible, accommodate the needs
of the public and minimise disruption to people who are travelling
through events and Olympic events. The more we can do that, the better
the experience will be for Londoners as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000069">&#160;</a>

Emmerson:</strong>
                           </em> The evidence was on exactly that point. We
have identified a major concern about the ability of freight operators
to service the business community at key times during the games.
Obviously, with the creation of the ORN, the restrictions that it
imposes, the wider limitations that there will be in central London
around the mobility management area, and the sheer volume of activity
right here in the heart of London, businesses will need to change how
they service their businesses. A single-day event, such as the royal
wedding, is a very different proposition from three weeks of a
continuous event. For a single day, it is not a particularly huge
challenge to say, “Well, actually, we can’t make a
delivery on Friday; it will have to come on Thursday or
Saturday.” But the sustained duration of this event creates a
very different proposition for businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have done
a lot of work already with larger businesses to ensure that they are
aware of the implications of the event. There is a lot more work yet to
do with smaller businesses around London. We are concerned that
some—or potentially many—businesses may not respond to or
understand the need to change their delivery patterns until a very late
stage and that freight operators will not be able to respond in
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some freight
operators have restrictions on their premises, such as environmental
constraints that prevent them from operating at night and so on. At
present, those can only be changed through a fairly long
consultation-based process via the traffic commissioners. We suggested
to the Department for Transport, and in our evidence to the Committee,
that the Bill is an opportunity to change that situation to allow the
traffic commissioners to shorten the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000080">&#160;</a>

opportunity, particularly in terms of people travelling to the games
and the fact that they will have, as part of their tickets, the
opportunity to travel on the public transport network in particular.
That is the potential of using the programme—the travel demand
management programme—that sits around this, in terms of
highlighting the fact that people have different travel options, using
journey planners and things like that. In my experience, the best
advert for people to try to travel differently or to make different
travel choices is to get them to try it. The Olympic games is a huge
opportunity to get people who do not normally use public transport
modes to try them out. We will certainly be doing all we can to avail
them of those benefits, but of course we have to provide an efficient,
effective, reliable and high-quality service to enable them to have a
good experience when they do that, or else those benefits are unlikely
to be achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000090">&#160;</a>

scheme will be an important part of the journey choices available,
particularly in central London, and plans to expand it out towards the
east of the city will be in place by the time of the games, so it will
certainly play its part. In terms of safety, cycle safety is something
that TfL and the Mayor have been particularly concerned about, and we
have put a lot of effort into ensuring that we deliver improvements.
That will not change through the Olympics; that work will continue, to
ensure that not only cycling but the roads themselves, for all travel,
are as safe as they can possibly be. I think that we have a pretty good
track record in London as a whole of delivering improvements in safety
over the past 10 years. There has been something like a 57%
reduction in casualties. That work will continue, and cycling will be
an important part of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000102">&#160;</a>

Allison:</strong>
                           </em> Chair, thank you very much. Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen. My name is Chris Allison. I am an assistant
commissioner in the Metropolitan Police Service, and I am privileged to
be something called the national Olympic security co-ordinator. A bit
of background as to what that is: as you are aware, 70% of the Olympics
is taking place in London, but 30% is taking place elsewhere in the
country. The Olympics will also impact on every force in the country.
The torch is clearly running for 70 days up and down the country, there
will be the impact of the parallel events taking place and, to deliver
the games in both London and Dorset, we will require officers from
across the country.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My role as
the national Olympic security co-ordinator is, in effect, to lead for
the police service and co-ordinate planning up and down the country.
Both in the planning stages up until the games and during games
delivery time, I will be co-ordinating the national policing response
from a newly created national Olympic co-ordination centre based at
Scotland Yard.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The reason
why I think I am here today is to support the proposed increase in the
fine for ticket touting from £5,000 to £20,000. There is
a significant link between ticket touting, serious organised crime,
ticket fraud and counterfeit tickets. The Olympics will attract those.
I know from personal experience; I was privileged to get out to
Vancouver with a small number of my team to see the winter Olympics,
and one of my abiding memories is fighting my way through a sea of
ticket touts who were all trying to take anything off me that they
could. The Home Office official whom I deal with, Robert Raine, and I
were determined that we were not going to allow that to happen in
London, for a variety of reasons.

			Column number: 45<a class="bkMark" name="Column45">&#160;</a>
                           </div>It makes it look lawless, it makes it feel lawless, it gives the
opportunity for individuals to rip off members of the public and it
sends the wrong
message.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
know that at the Olympics, there will be a massive demand for tickets.
We are already seeing that in relation to applications through the
London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.
Therefore, there is a lot of money to be made by those who want to do
so. Serious and organised crime are already talking about it. Operation
Podium, which is targeting this sort of activity, has been running
since June of last year. It has already made a significant number of
arrests for a variety of offences, but we have been targeting ticket
touts. Therefore, our view is that this is an important measure, but it
is one of a number of things that we will be doing. It is not only
about increasing the fine, but also about us applying the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002 to individuals, which we will do wherever we possibly
can. It is about putting the fear of crime back on to the criminals,
rather than on to the innocent
victims.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are very supportive of the proposal. We have to deal with ticket touts
day in, day out, as part of our routine business around football, and I
can say to the Committee that, anecdotally, we have heard from some
touts that the Home Secretary’s announcement of this proposal
has already made some of them say, “I’m not interested in
a fine of 20 grand. I’ll go away and do something
different.” If that is helping in some way, that has to be a
good thing, because I do not want to see what I saw in Vancouver happen
during
2012.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000110">&#160;</a>

questions on
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will begin by thanking Chris Allison for the really excellent
leadership that you are providing for the Olympic team. We all
appreciate that very much indeed. I wondered if I could just focus on
serious and organised crime, of which ticket touting is obviously a
manifestation. Like Chris Allison, I was also in Vancouver, looking
specifically at the risks of trafficking and the sexual exploitation of
young men and women at a large sporting event. I must say that, having
concluded some 10 meetings during my time there, I was impressed by the
rigour with which they approached this. Given that we want to ensure
that any serious organised crime, such as ticket touting, is not part
of our Olympics, I wonder, Mr Amess, whether I could tax your patience
a little bit by first asking Mr Allison what he thinks the
lessons of Vancouver were. I would be happy to share with him the quite
detailed research that I did. Secondly, I want to ask what he judges
the risk to be. Thirdly, what is the capacity of the preventive teams
to provide an early alert to an increase in the proliferation of sex
workers or, indeed, any evidence of
trafficking?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000112">&#160;</a>

Allison:</strong>
                           </em> If I could cover the generality, we were
very lucky in relation to Vancouver. We got fantastic access courtesy
of Bud Mercer—my counterpart out there—who was the
assistant commissioner who ran the operation, and I was able to embed a
number of my command team alongside his command team during the games,
so we got fantastic access and a lot of learning about various bits of
business.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Trafficking
for sexual exploitation is something that we have talked about on a
number of occasions. There is a team called Specialist Crime Department
9 that is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 46<a class="bkMark" name="Column46">&#160;</a>
                           </div>looking at that activity, and there is work monitoring what is going on
in the east end of London. We have to date seen no increase whatsoever
in that sort of activity, but we are clearly keeping an eye on it to
ensure that something does not happen. I am satisfied that we have the
necessary links with all the various non-governmental organisations,
and Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Martin, who runs that unit,
has got a very good reputation with them and is drawing whatever he can
from them. At the moment, there is no evidence that we are seeing any
increase and no evidence that there will be any increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In Vancouver,
having spoken to Bud both during and post the games, they did not
actually see any increase. There was considerable concern that it was
going to happen, but, again, it did not actually manifest itself. That
does not mean that we are resting on our laurels. That is why we are
still doing the work that we are in the east end to ensure that we
understand what is going on over there. Yes, there has been an increase
in a bit of sex worker activity around there, but this is a very large
building site and, therefore, people may be attracted to it. In terms
of trafficking, however, we have seen nothing relating to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000115">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Those are very much the conclusions that have been
shared with me by the various NGOs, and there are two important points.
One is that we do not want to create a problem, or appear to create a
problem, for which there is not evidence. Also, it was the level of
vigilance, and the anticipation that there could be a problem, that
meant that Vancouver passed off in the way that it did. Of course we
hope that our games also will.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000116">&#160;</a>

about in a number of areas, and the media regularly bring it up, and we
are at pains to explain it. What we do not want to do is create that
unnecessary fear of crime. Equally, we do not want to ignore it if it
is starting to happen. That is why I am reassured that the work that
has been done in that area by SCD9—one of the specialist crime
departments—is keeping that monitoring going, to make sure that
something does not come up on the wire that we are not aware
of.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000117">&#160;</a>

want to put it down that there is no evidence of an increase at the
current time—certainly, there has not been an increase. Lots of
the research that we have done has shown that this has been talked
about in many previous games, but we have been unable to find the
evidence of it. It is one of those myths that seems to have built up
and everybody talks about it, and we are trying to put it back into its
right place, so that we do not create fear.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000118">&#160;</a>

the courts on conviction choose to impose the maximum fine, that is
£100,000 between

                           </div>the five of them. We think that is a significant deterrent, given that
we are going very public, and that we will use every other piece of
legislation that is available to us. If we have evidence that enables
us to seize money under the Proceeds of Crime Act, then we will make
applications to court to do that as well. Therefore, this is one of a
number of measures that we are using. We are saying to criminals:
“The fine is going up, we are targeting you. We are actively
targeting you as touts between now and the games time.” We are
targeting them at football events, because we know it is the same
people who do it, and it is also an offence at football events. They
get to know that the police service are looking at them, and that we
are using all the legislation that is available to us. In our view it
is an appropriate increase, it acts as an appropriate deterrent, and
anecdotally, we are already hearing from the people we are dealing with
that it is working for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There will be
those—because there is massive money to be made here—who
want to try to do something about it. The Operation Podium team has
been working very closely for some time with LOCOG on how to reduce the
opportunities for people to be scammed by the internet. We regularly
trawl the internet for false domains, and for people who are offering
tickets for sale, and we will continue to do so. Wherever we can, we
will work with the service providers to take those internet sites down.
A key message to the public—we are supported by Seb Coe and
LOCOG and others here—is that you only get a ticket by going to
the authorised site, the LOCOG website. If you think you have found a
miracle website somewhere where you can get the final Olympic ticket
for only £10, you are being ripped off. Do not believe that
something is a free lunch, because it is not, it is a rip-off. This is
about an education programme, and that is why we are doing lots of
media jointly with LOCOG about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000121">&#160;</a>

operation of about 9,000 police officers on peak days. If we put that
into context, at Notting Hill carnival—which is the biggest
policing operation we normally do—on the Sunday we deploy 5,000
police officers, and on the Monday we deploy 6,000 officers. Any major
event in London always requires all the boroughs to provide a
percentage of aid. But there is a recognition that the Met cannot
deliver that alone. So during 2012, we will be calling on something
called mutual aid, with colleagues from across the country. As we work
through our plans, we are working extremely closely with Ian McPherson,
the assistant commissioner from territorial policing, to make sure that
he can still deliver the business as usual that is required by
communities

anything we require above that we get from mutual aid. On the
percentages, we are talking in the region of a 2% potential impact on
the average borough over a whole year—the 2012
year—because we will spread out the impact by reducing annual
leave, reducing days off and cancelling

                           </em> I cannot give you the exact figures. Part of
the reason for that is the levers that we are going pull to reduce the
impact. By pulling a lever and saying that in an average summer we may
have 10% of our officers on annual leave and, during the 17-day period
of the Olympic games, the maximum we will allow is 7%, that immediately
adds an extra 3% or 4% to your work force that you would not normally
have during that period. The same with training and weekly leave. Those
are the sorts of levers we will pull.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000128">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is not
just the outer boroughs; every borough across London will be impacted.
We will use something called the public order aid formula, which is the
formula they have used on a daily basis to manage every big event in
London. If you think about the student protests towards the back end of
last year, the protest on 9 December used in the region of
3,600 police officers. The royal wedding just a few weeks ago required
5,500 police officers to be deployed. Each borough has a number of
officers allocated to it. As you will be aware, each borough is a
different size, but we take the same percentage from each borough, so
that the impact on each borough is exactly the same when we pull
together major events. We try to ensure that no one borough is more
affected than any other borough as a result of the central London major
events that we have to deal
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000129">&#160;</a>

will be helpful in considering the wider issues surrounding ticket
touting. In your opinion, who are the potential touts? You say that
Operation Podium has already seen some of those touts arrested. Are
they people who have just set up in business with an eye on the
Olympics or are they already criminal organised gangs? I will leave you

                           </em> There clearly will be opportunists looking
to make a quick buck who will manage to get two or three tickets for
themselves and think, “I can sell this ticket for twice the face
value by turning up.” You may see that at a range of sporting
events. There are those who are just selling off a spare ticket at face
value, and there are those who will try to double or treble the
price.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our bigger
worry and what we will certainly see with the Olympics is the organised
criminal networks working this. Certainly, the people who are making

                           </div>country—anything from a music event to a sporting
event—are involved in serious and organised criminality. Some
organised criminal networks dabble in a number of things. It is not
just touting; they are also involved in counterfeiting wherever they
can. If you imagine that you have a market where it is seen as
acceptable that you can be outside a place selling tickets at
£100 when they are only worth £10, people will quite
easily put counterfeit tickets there as well. Because people expect to
pay that amount, they will not realise the difference between a real
ticket and a counterfeit ticket.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is lots
of money to be made by these organised criminal networks. They
recognise the demand for tickets. I have no doubt that the 9 million
tickets for the Olympics will be significantly oversubscribed,
especially for the major events. As a result, ticket touts will look to
make many, many thousands of pounds on each ticket if they possibly
can. There will be a network behind them. I want to create an
environment in which it is not possible for those touts to operate on
the ground. If it were not possible to operate on the ground, it would
be harder for them, first, to make the money that they should be making
and, secondly, to sell the counterfeit tickets. We must again, through
our publicity, get the message out to the general public not to buy a
ticket for which they are paying over the odds because there is a good
chance that it is a counterfeit ticket and, secondly, not to go to any
website apart from the authorised websites because, again, they are
likely to be ripped off. Hopefully, we will then save
everyone.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000133">&#160;</a>

am talking about the UK’s reputation. Many people from
throughout the world will go on to any internet site and think,
“Oh, this is my ticket. Not only does it get me entry to the 100
metres final, but it gives me five nights at the Savoy for
£220.” They will buy it, come here and clearly get none
of it. That will damage our reputation, so our job is to make sure that
it does not happen. I see the major threat from serious and organised
criminality, because such people see that they are easily into seven
figures and it is money that they will then use for other illegal
acts.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000134">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Mr Allison, thank you for your detailed
responses. I was also going to ask about whether the £20,000 for
ticket touting was enough, but you have confirmed that, with all the
other legislation available for you to use, you think that that will
suffice.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall ask two quick questions, given that others probably want to
speak. First, on terrorism, do you think that there may be an increased
threat and, if so, is the Bill sufficient to ensure that we are
covered? It might be that our current measures for terrorism are
sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
in terms of traffic and road usage, and the enforcement of traffic
conventions—the Metropolitan police tend to get pulled into
that—is the Bill sufficient to support that over the Olympic
time
period?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000163">&#160;</a>

Allison:</strong>
                           </em> May I cover the terrorism point first? We
have been planning our response to the Olympics on the basis of a
severe threat from terrorism. Sadly, as I said before, I do not believe
that there will be an outbreak of world peace between now and the
games. It would be foolish if we did not plan at that severe threat
level—that is the level against which we are policing the
capital today. All our plans are there. We deliver current events
against that severe threat—the royal wedding was delivered
against that sort of threat level—and I am satisfied that, at
the moment, we have the necessary powers that we need.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Obviously we
are still working through our policing plans and the operations. There
are 438 days before the start of the games—that number goes down
very quickly—and we are still working our way through and making
sure that we have sufficient asset in the right
place. We are constantly reviewing the terrorist attack methodologies
across the world to ensure that our plans deal with those
methodologies. It is something that we are going to keep an eye on. We
clearly have to because of the growth in what is sadly happening in
Northern Ireland at the moment, which my colleagues in the Police
Service of Northern Ireland are having to deal with on a daily basis.
Thankfully, we always considered Irish attack methodologies in all our
plans, so that has already been built in. I suppose what I am saying is
that we are not resting on our laurels—we cannot afford to do
that. My job is to make sure we deliver a safe and secure games, and
that is what we are going to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
road use, I am glad that you said that we get drawn into it—it
is the responsibility of others. I know that a lot of work is being
done by the ODA transport team and Transport for London. There are
significant challenges there, as the Committee talked about with TfL
earlier. Peter Hendy has taken on the role of delivering that side, and
if anyone can deliver it, he can.

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are supportive of what is in the Bill. There are two key bits to
ensuring that this works. One is about ensuring that the public
messaging is right about everything: not only about roads, but about
what you should do, what transport you should use, what you should
carry and what you should look out for. A lot of work is being done
across all the domains, including locally and with TfL, to try to
ensure that those general messages are right. The other bit is ensuring
that there is swift compliance activity so that people understand that
if they choose to break the law, they will know swiftly that they have
to deal with the penalty for it. The decision on what level that will
be is being made by the Secretary of State.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Hopefully,
that will be sufficient in itself so that an individual says, “I
know not only that I will get caught, but that I will get caught
swiftly,” and feels that there is a deterrent. We cannot afford
to have a whole load of fixed penalty notices appearing on
people’s doorsteps in October 2012 that tell them that they went
on the Olympic road network. If that happens, we will not ensure
compliance at the time. People need to understand that the system will
be in place and will be
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000168">&#160;</a>

case that raising the penalty for ticket touting would act as a
deterrent for not only ticket touting, but other forms of organised

general serious and organised crime, our focus since Podium has been

questions, you have already said that that is appropriate and
proportionate. On Thursday, we will consider an amendment that would
raise it to the much higher figure of £50,000. Is that

sufficient to achieve what we want to achieve. On the briefing that I
have had, moving it to £50,000 brings with it other challenges,
because it potentially moves the matter out of the magistrates court
and up to the Crown court. There might be challenges around that, and I
am satisfied that for the purposes for which I think it is required,
the £20,000 fine is sufficient to act as a
deterrent.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000175">&#160;</a>

sporting events every week and I run the gauntlet of the ticket touts.
When I get home to my normal station at Wembley Park, if there is a
concert on at the arena or the stadium, I run the gauntlet of ticket
touts, even though I have no interest in attending the event. What will
be different about the Olympics and how you will police it, because all
that takes place when the police are within yards of the
touts?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000176">&#160;</a>

Allison:</strong>
                           </em> For the vast majority of events there is no
legislation. The only legislation that enables us to take action
against ticket touts is that relating to football, and that is because
of the segregation requirements. History tells us that if you do not
segregate the crowd, problems will occur. I am aware that although we
have powers covering football, there are still ticket touts operating
at football matches. Our goal at the moment, recognising that we have
the games coming, is to use those football matches to start enforcing
the messages whenever we possibly can.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What will be
different at the time of the games? My hope is that the publicity we
have generated, the pre-work that we have done and the commitment
of the Operation Podium team who are working on
this, and who I can target at this sort of activity, will have sent the
very clear message to these individuals that if they come out on the
streets near an Olympic venue, there will be police officers out there
in significant numbers who will take action against them, so there is a
massive risk for them because we will catch them and go for the maximum
fine. Hopefully, the courts will support us and we will use the
Proceeds of Crime Act, so there is a combination of points. I think I
said in my introduction that this is about putting the fear back on to
them. I then have to back that up with words, and I have to make sure
that the officers are properly briefed, which will be part and parcel
of the activity in which we will engage with all the officers who come
from across the country into feeding, muster and briefing points every
day. The key activities will be briefed to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000178">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the things that we will be targeting is ticket touting. If we see a
ticket tout, we will want them arrested. This will be a significant
focus for us because, as I said in my opening, they make the place look
unlawful and like it is not the place that we want it to be. What do I
want the Olympics to be from a safety and security point of view? I
want it to be a fantastic sporting event where the focus should be on
the sport and spectators. The focus should be not on the security
operation or the criminals who are getting in the way of people
enjoying the sport. That is the briefing that I will give to my
officers, and that briefing will hopefully deliver what we
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000179">&#160;</a>

colleagues up and down the country—certainly in London—to
do whatever they can to send out the message that touting in certain
circumstances is unlawful. Can we start taking action now? Again, there
are competing pressures. On some occasions, a police officer will not
take action against an individual tout because they have to deal with
something else—I have to recognise that. However, certainly in
relation to the activity in which we are engaged through Podium, and in
which we will be engaged during games time, there will be significant
activity around ticket
touts.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000181">&#160;</a>

pleased about the proposals in the Bill to relieve you of the

concerns raised this morning was that organised crime might become
involved in counterfeiting goods, and might organise activity across
London selling illegal or illicit goods that could need to be seized by
trading standards officers or whoever is doing enforcement. How will
the police get involved in that process as a result of the changes that
are
proposed?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000182">&#160;</a>

counterfeiting tickets or counterfeiting goods. Whenever we have a
link, the Podium team—it is growing as we run closer to the
games—will target. We have very good links with trading
standards teams across London and we will work closely with them. When
we can establish a link between something that is happening on the
street and the serious and organised criminal network, the Podium team
will become involved and do the further investigation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000183">&#160;</a>

that that is why the Podium team has been so successful recently. That

things to trading standards. We will not walk away and say,

where will the priority be? One of my concerns is that we will see
people setting up street stalls outside tube stations across London and
selling illicit goods, which might need prompt action to prevent people
from being ripped off. Police resources will be stretched. What
assurance can you give us that resources will be available to deal with
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000185">&#160;</a>

me to give you a guarantee that we will be able to deal with every
single stall set up across London. That is why we welcome the fact that
others—trading standards, which is expert in dealing with that
sort of activity day in, day out, on Oxford street and places like
that—can take on that burden. You are entirely right that the
police service will be very stretched in 2012. There are not only the
Olympic events but the parallel events that people want to put on in
place. If we can spread the enforcement burden on to others who are
good at doing it and used to doing it, we welcome that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000186">&#160;</a>

where there is top-end crime and criminality, I would look to deploy

infinite resource. We still have to deliver policing as usual not only

officers to come here. We are limited in the numbers that we can get.
We will do the best that we possibly can with our resources; we will
target them in the right places; we will make sure that we make the
most impact with what we have; and we will do it with partner agencies.
That is what I welcome about the Bill. It will allow partner agencies

comparatively minor and technical Bill. It basically takes the original
provisions in the 2006 Act and looks at areas where subsequent
legislation bringing the Act’s principles into effect has not
taken place or where something else has arisen, as in the case of
ticket touting, to change what happened in
2006.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000193">&#160;</a>

they had to do this four times over, and the Australian Government had
to pay the Australian Olympic committee about 80 million Australian
dollars for failing to transfer the image rights over correctly in the
first place. Actually, the fact that this is a minor, small, technical
amending Bill is a considerable testimony to the work done in the

                           </em> I hope very much that this will be the
final hurdle. One of the things that we did before introducing this
amending Bill was to look across the entirety of the London 2012
project, to look at what had changed, to benchmark that against the
experience of other games and what we have learned since 2005 and 2006
and to see whether anything else was
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000197">&#160;</a>

one outstanding issue at the moment of which I am aware is this
business about changing the regulations to allow freight to be
delivered to businesses, and opening up the period over which that may
be done. Our initial prognosis—the Department for Transport, as
I said earlier, is looking at it very closely at the moment—is
that it is not absolutely certain that primary legislation would be
required and, even if so, not absolutely certain that this Bill would
be
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000198">&#160;</a>

                           </em> It is a good question. I think that part
of the reason why so many people—the witnesses you have seen
today—have been in favour of what we are doing is because we
cauterised much of the opposition back in 2005-06. Listening to the
evidence this morning, I was struck by how much the position of the
advertising industry had shifted since 2005-06—it had a number
of concerns about the original Bill—and I think that that is
because the original Bill was enacted in a sensible and proportionate
way. The powers contained in the 2006 Act have been used
sensibly and proportionately, which has given people an enormous amount
of confidence in the whole
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
question of benchmarking against previous Olympics is a good one. When
the original Act was put on the statute book, the benchmark was the
2000 Sydney games. There are some similarities between the winter games
and the summer games, obviously, but they are very different beasts and
on a very different scale. Without being too indelicate about it, the
2008 Beijing games are not always the easiest benchmark, not least
because it is actually quite difficult to find out exactly what went on
in some detail. They were a very different sort of games, because the
whole apparatus of the Chinese state was thrown at making them work.
There are reasons why Athens in 2004 was a different sort of games, so
you really go back to Sydney in
2000.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000202">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Sydney
in 2000 were the first games of the modern cycle, because the Atlanta
1996 games were the ones that ground to a halt completely because there
was no Olympic route network of any sort. Athletes were late for their
qualifying heats, there were not officials at the relevant events and
ambush marketing took place around many of the big brands, as discussed
this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
benchmark, therefore, is Australia 2000 which is the one that we have
used. There are some things in that which should be immensely
reassuring to the Committee. If one is worried about proportionality,
and we all ought to be, there was only one person who was fined in
Australia as a result of this sort of measure. It was a fast food
salesman on Bondi beach, I think, who put an Olympic logo on his kebab
van—he went down for about £30 after three warnings,
which he had stroppily refused to take. It is not as if the Bill will
give rise to a huge trail of people going around the block at the
courts on Monday
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000204">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The subject of ticket touting. During those
exchanges, I found one of your answers to be very helpful. You said
that it was a prerequisite to get the games that we did something to
control ticket touting. I am very pleased that we are doing something 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 58<a class="bkMark" name="Column58">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to control it. It was in the original Act, and after hearing evidence
from the Metropolitan police you have brought forward the legislation
to increase the fine for ticket touting. I just want to add that I hope
that trend will continue when we move into other areas during what will
no doubt be our future debates on ticket touting.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The one point
that I want to tease out a bit further concerns selling tickets on to
family and friends at face value. I know that that is probably the
small fry end of touting and not the serious and organised crime end,
which obviously the legislation is there to tackle. However, I have
concerns that people who will not have realised that this legislation
was even on the statute book at the level of a £5,000 fine, or
who do not realise that the fine is now up to £20,000, will
currently be in the process of buying their tickets, which they
probably thought they were going to sell on at inflated prices. There
will probably be people who have bought tickets thinking, “Oh
well, I’ll sell them to my mates down the pub,” without
realising that there was any criminality or wrong-doing in that,
because they currently do it when they buy tickets to whatever event
they might go to and their friends are always very happy that they have
done so, because they put the money up front, pay perhaps six months in
advance and their friends buy the tickets at the last minute if they
want to go to the event. That goes
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
those people, they will obviously be allowed to sell tickets supposedly
at face value. I suppose that the only way that anybody would know is
if somebody tells the police. I wonder whether you think that that will
be a problem. So, somebody has bought a ticket for £300 and they
go down the pub and they say to their mate, “You can have this
for £400,” then somebody else says, “Actually,
I’ll give you £500,” and somebody else says,
“Opening ceremony? I’ll give you £2,000”.
Do you know what I mean? It becomes a little bidding war in the pub
that the person never intended, but they have therefore fallen foul of
the law totally unintentionally and somebody could overhear that
conversation, get in touch with the police and that person could be
hauled in. Do you think that that will be a problem, or should we not
worry about it?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000211">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I think that sports events are probably
marginally different from music events, in that at most big sports
events around the world—most global sports events—ticket
touting is now illegal. If you go to a cricket world cup, it is illegal
to tout tickets and so on and so forth. So the first point is that
among the sporting public there is probably a greater awareness that
this is illegal for these key global events and there is that awareness
in the market as a whole. Secondly, for anybody buying a ticket, if
they read through the small print on the internet when they ordered
their tickets the small print makes it perfectly clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Do I think
that this legislation today will mean that there is absolutely no
chance of anybody carrying out the activity that you described? No. Do
I think that this is the best and proportionate way of stopping
organised criminals targeting these games? All that I can do is to
defer to the evidence given by the assistant commissioner a moment ago.
I must say that I thought that his evidence was fantastic, actually. He
gave us exactly the same briefing and said that there is a very
particular threat that we need to address here around increased

£20,000 to tackle it—hence the provisions in the Bill.

Bill, so I hope you will not mind if I ask you an incredibly minor,
technical question that arises from evidence we heard earlier today. We
are told that by transferring responsibility for both storing and
dealing with confiscated items, there will be a net saving of
£55,000 to the public purse and a very precise £22,000
additional cost to the ODA. Please will you explain how that figure was
arrived at, and does it include both storage and the handing back of
items under the legislation, or only one or neither of those
matters?<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000216">&#160;</a>

that because, as they say, you have kindly given me notice of the
question. The initial estimate was that the cost of the police storing
that material would be £77,000. If the storage is undertaken by
the ODA, using their enforcement officers, that would cost only
£22,000, therefore there is a net saving of
£55,000—if my maths is right. That is the answer to the
first part. You are absolutely right that, according to my briefing,
those figures refer entirely to storage, and not to the associated
costs of handling those goods. I will find out what answer is and, as
they say, I will write to

laid out in some detail in the 2006 Act, after it had been the subject
of considerable debate. Clearly, we are now adding an animal to that

2006, there has been an ongoing process. The organising committee, as
soon as it hears of any form of infringement or potential violation,
writes to people and gets into a process with them. That has been
incredibly successful. There were a considerable number of such cases
in the early stages; there are many fewer, as people have begun to
understand the Act much better. I suspect that, as we get closer to the
games, we will probably see another spike, which will be dealt with in
the same way. The intention is always to work with people, to advise
them that they have made a mistake, to correct their ways and to use
the powers contained in the Act only as a last and final resort. I hope
that by a process of education, and by the process of communication
that is going on day by day and week by week, that will not prove to be

                           </strong> I would like to follow that up and to support the
Minister in what he has said. I confess to the Committee that I have
been guilty of a breach of that very legislation in respect of
advertising. I assure the Committee that it was handled very
sensitively. I was politely told off and told not to do it again,
and  I have not subsequently done so. Those things are handled
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11051810000222">&#160;</a>
