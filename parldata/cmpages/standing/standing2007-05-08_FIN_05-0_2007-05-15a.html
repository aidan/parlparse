to members of the Committee to ensure that everybody has the
information that they need. Copies of my letter of 9 May are also being
sent. It included information on the regulation-making powers in
schedule 3, which we shall debate this afternoon. I shall ensure that
all future letters on secondary legislation are sent to you,
Mr. Illsley, and copied not only to the shadow spokespeople
but to all Committee members. I apologise to all Committee members for
the inconvenience that they were caused this
morning.</div>

Mr. Illsley. I welcome you to the Chair.</div>
					<a name="07051580000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had just started to address
the position of staffing and recruitment companies and employment
agencies in the schedule. The purpose of the Opposition&#146;s
amendments to the definition of a managed service company provider is
to focus on those people</div>
					<a name="07051580000516"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whose sole or main business
relates to the provision and facilitation
of&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						use
of service companies. If the amendments were agreed to, they would
remove the threat of liability from staffing and recruitment and
employment companies, because they would be only incidentally involved
with managed service companies. Their main business would be related to
placing individuals, which would be different.</div>
					<a name="07051580000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Proposed new
section 61B(4) of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003
provides some protection for staffing companies, but its ambit is
unclear, and I hope that Government amendment No. 97 will provide
further assurance to the recruitment sector. It is vital that we
clarify the position of recruitment companies in the schedule, because
damaging the recruitment industry could have a negative impact on the
flexibility of the UK labour market.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>
					<a name="07051580000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key concern is that if a
recruitment company has any influence over the choice of service
company or the professional adviser through the workers with whom it is
involved, the company could be liable for &#147;promoting or
influencing&#148; within the meaning of new section 61B. That is a
particularly strong concern when staffing companies have contractual
control over the freelance worker, as many do. Furthermore, many
staffing and recruitment companies influence the way in which payments
are made to the worker, and again, such influence might trigger the MSC
provider status that we were discussing before the Committee
adjourned.</div>
					<a name="07051580000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make it
clear that the Government&#146;s response to the recruitment
industry&#146;s concerns is welcome; many of its representatives are
pleased by their movement on that issue. However, we still need more
clarity and we need to asses what risk mitigation steps the recruitment
industry can take to avoid inadvertently falling within the scope of
proposed new section 61B. The feedback that I have had is that the
recruitment industry wants to be compliant, but it does not know what
compliance looks like.</div>
					<a name="07051580000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It would be
useful, for example, if the Chief Secretary could confirm whether
holding a list of approved company suppliers and advisers is sufficient
to amount to &#147;promoting and influencing&#148; within the
meaning of paragraph (d). It would be unfortunate if the changes that
we are considering under schedule 3 were to encourage staffing and
recruitment companies to take no interest in the contracting
arrangements of their contractors and workers, as that would remove an
important quality control that is currently exercised. The absence of a
tax status review by staffing or recruitment companies could increase
the likelihood that less reputable operators&#151;the kind of people
about whom Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs is
concerned&#151;have more, not less, scope to supply their
services.</div>
					<a name="07051580000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendments
Nos. 42 to 44 concern the problem of tainting, about which I have
received a number of representations. The anxiety is that if an adviser
has a sufficiently close relationship with a client to be deemed to be
&#147;promoting or facilitating&#148; under paragraph (d), it will
become an MSC provider in relation to any client and any company with
which it is involved. The Bill does not specify that the promotion or
facilitation must relate to one particular company. Provision of
services within the meaning of paragraph (d) could taint all the
companies with which the adviser deals. The upshot will be that a
freelancer will be faced with the hassle not only of ensuring that the
relationship between her company and her professional advisers is
compliant and does fall not within paragraph (d), but that her adviser
does not provide any non-compliant services to other clients. Frankly,
that will be difficult in practice.</div>
					<a name="07051580000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will also be difficult for
end clients and staffing companies that are anxious to comply with the
legislation to ensure that they are not brought within third-party debt
rules, via an indirect connection to a company that has a non-compliant
relationship with another adviser or client. There is a real danger of
litigation if someone finds their tax bill suddenly increasing because
their adviser entered into a non-compliant relationship with other
clients.</div>
					<a name="07051580000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendments are intended to deal with such tainting. Amendment No. 42
proposes a new subsection (1A) to make it clear that one should
consider only the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>relationship between the scheme provider and the company whose tax
affairs are under consideration. It is important to bear in mind that
this is a serious problem, which could have a significant impact on how
the proposals are enforced. If HMRC believes that a particular company
falls within the MSC provider definition, for example, it will
presumably inform not only that company, but all its clients. They will
immediately leave, because they will be worried about being tainted by
the activities of that particular scheme provider. That could trigger
an instant cash-flow crisis and, quite possibly, put the provider out
of business instantaneously. We therefore need to deal with the issue
of tainting. The Bill might not be intended to have that effect, but I
fear that that is the effect that it might have. It could cause
significant inconvenience for freelance
workers.</div>

						Amendments
Nos. 38 and 39 are essentially tidying-up points that were suggested by
the Law Society in its useful briefing on the Bill for the Committee.
They would amend proposed new section 61B(c), which specifies one of
the triggering factors for a situation to be categorised as one
involving a managed service company. A situation would be considered as
such if the way in which payments are made to the worker would result
in her receiving payments that exceed those amounts that she would
receive, even if every payment made in respect of the services provided
were employment
income.</div>
					<a name="07051580000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Committee
members will see from the briefing that the Law Society welcomes
paragraph (c) as helpful, because it prevents the mere provision of
services of individuals from giving rise to MSC status even when
employee tax is paid. It makes the sensible point that the Bill does
not specify the period for which test is to be applied, however. The
amendments would makeit clear that the relevant period is the
year of assessment.</div>
					<a name="07051580000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
47 was also a useful suggestion by the Law Society. It is designed to
remove a possible loophole in the framework. The provisions seem to be
somewhat unclear as to how they impact on partnerships. The amendment
is intended to go with the grain of the Government&#146;s proposals
and ensure that they operate effectively in relation to partnerships
and also to ensure that a partnership structure cannot be used as a
loophole. So the amendment would extend the reach of the proposals to
make them bite in a situation where the scheme provider is a partner in
a partnership, which amounts to the MSC. The Government&#146;s
drafting seems to be largely based on a corporate model and it does not
seem to work exactly in relation to partnerships. The amendment might
help to achieve greater clarity and ensure that the measure operates
more clearly in relation to partnerships.</div>
					<a name="07051580000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
48 is another tidying-up amendment. It is essentially a technical point
to ensure that any payment taken into account for the extra MSC taxes
does not include payments that have already been taxed as earnings
elsewhere. The consequence of the application of the MSC legislation is
that various payments are treated as if they were the earnings of an
employeefor tax purposes, and therefore they are subject to
PAYE and national insurance. Where the Bill applies, these payments
become part of what is referred to as the deemed employment payment.
That is calculated using a series of steps set out in the
proposed new section 61E(1). Step 1
defines</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000517"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the amount of the payment or
benefit mentioned in 61D(1)(b).&#148; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>
					</div>
					<a name="07051580000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, new section 61D(1)(b)
covers all payments received by the worker, including those that have
already been taxed as employment earnings. Therefore, if that measure
is left unamended, there is a danger that extra taxes would be applied
to earnings thathave already been taxed as employment
earnings. By adding, as this amendment would, a reference to new
section 61D(1)(c), payments already taxed as earnings are excluded from
the scope of the deemed employment payment.</div>
					<a name="07051580000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to turn to
amendment No. 49, which focuses on a concern raised by the Private
Contractors Group.</div>

wrong.</div>
					<a name="07051580000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In conclusion
on this group of amendments, the Committee has listened patiently,
which I appreciate, to my lengthy submission on the potential problems
caused by schedule 3 and the best way, in our view, to deal with those
potential problems. I have spoken at length about the position of the
professional advisers. I have done so partly out of concern for the
position of those professionals, but my main reason for doing so
concerns their clients&#151;hard-working, hard-pressed freelance
workers, who are just trying to make an honest living. It is their
relationship with their professional advisers that the Government have
chosen to focus on in determining how much tax those people will pay
and whether their company is treated as a MSC. That is why I have dwelt
on the relationship with advisers.</div>
					<a name="07051580000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise that being a
freelance worker does not make someone a tax dodger. Yes, the tax
system for freelancers is different to that for employees, but one must
factor in the fact that those workers get no sickness pay, no holiday
pay and no employer-funded pension schemes. With IR35, the Government
have hit those people with hassle and huge compliance costs. The hon.
Member for Wirral, West may not be worried about IR35, but thousands of
contractors are. The Opposition are proud of the stance that we took on
IR35. If the hon. Gentleman has not had many e-mails so far, I suspect
that he might get a few more in the future. Now the Government, to add
insult to injury, are not only imposing the hassle of IR35, but they
want to prevent contractors from getting professional help with
navigating the bureaucracy caused by IR35 and other regulations
produced by the
Government.</div>

					<a name="07051580000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I close by reading an e-mail
that I received from an IT contractor, Steve Birchall, which sets out
just how disruptive schedule 3 is proving to be even before it is on
the statute book. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07051580000518"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I used
to use a MSC simply because they made sure that all required tax, VAT
and legal requirements were met. In particular they ensured that I had
a clear and full understanding of how much of the money my company had
in its accounts was mine 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>and how much needed to be paid to the various government bodies, VAT,
NI, Income tax. Corporation tax etc.
etc.</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000519"></a><div class="hs_brev">I
DID NOT use this as a vehicle to avoid
tax.</div>
					<a name="07051580000520"></a><div class="hs_brev">If I wanted to do
this a normal Ltd company option provided more tax savings due to the
ability to reclaim more VAT and claim certain additional expenses. I
simply wanted someone to look after the finances of the company so that
I did not personally spend any money that should have been put aside
for taxes etc. I just wanted a clear indication of what was MY money to
spend and what had to be paid over or put
aside.</div>
					<a name="07051580000521"></a><div class="hs_brev">Due to the
recent changes relating to MSCs, I have now been robbed of that option.
I have tried to find a company that would help with the financial
running of the business, but in every case they have stated that they
cannot now do this, for fear of being seen as having some control of my
company and in so doing, incur risks and
penalties.</div>
					<a name="07051580000522"></a><div class="hs_brev">So I now
find myself being responsible for running a company (that I don't want
to run) and having full responsibility for the tax, NI, VAT etc, bills,
with no help from anyone. I have the use of my accountant, but they can
only do so much to help because they fear that they might be held
responsible for any tax claims from HMRC should that situation
arise.</div>
					<a name="07051580000523"></a><div class="hs_brev">It does seem
crazy to me that I now cannot use a professional body to help me
control my finances, this would seem to be a responsible thing for me
to do and yet I risk financial penalty just for trying to act
responsibly.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">On behalf of Mr.
Birchall and the thousandslike him, I urge the Minister to
think again about schedule 3 and accept the Opposition&#146;s

							<b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP):
						I support
the principles behind the schedule. It is right and proper that the
Government seek to stamp out the misuse of managed service companies,
particularly when employees are unaware of the situation, by
self-employed contractors and organisations that are, to some extent,
no more than posh gangmasters. It is right and proper that such misuse
is sorted out. In the light of my own experiences, however, I do not
think that some of the provisions in the schedule will work. I think
that its impact will be much wider and broader than the Government
intend.</div>
					<a name="07051580000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was a
self-employed contractor working with recruitment companies and using
an accounting service company, although I suspect that they were not
called that in those days. I have been a departmental manager, a
project manager and an operations manager in large private and public
well-funded start-up companies and have employed contracting companies
and individual contractors, both directly through those companies and
through recruitment agencies. I know that many of them, and many others
in various sectors at the moment, manage their affairs through
accounting and managed service companies for the very reasons that the
hon. Lady described in the e-mail that she
quoted.</div>
					<a name="07051580000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my
experience and that of those with whom I have spoken, I find it
difficult to understand how the legislation would not have an
unintended impact on any of the professional bodies currently assisting
those people. I would like, therefore, to go through the Conservative
amendments and make a few points about some flaws in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07051580000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Lady said, amendments Nos. 30 and 39 would simply clarify the year in
which calculations are to be made. That is a tidying-up matter.
Amendment No. 40 would replace the words in the schedule
with:</div>
					<a name="07051580000524"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whose sole or
main business is the provision and facilitation of&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>
					<a name="07051580000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a key amendment, because it
narrows the scope of the provisions in relation to third-party
companies carrying out their business, and excludes thosewho
might facilitate an MSC as a consequence of almost any relationship,
even those that might be unintentional.</div>
					<a name="07051580000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 41 would replace
&#147;involved with the company&#148; with the words:</div>
					<a name="07051580000525"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regularly involved with all or
most aspects of running the company on an ongoing
basis&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
&#147;ongoing basis&#148; element of the amendment is incredibly
important. Someone beginning a contracting career or starting a new
contract significantly different from their last one might have a huge
amount of additional requirements&#151;for accountancy, legal and
financial advice, recruitment, new invoicing formats and time scales,
new requirements for different tax returns and the practical advice
that I mentioned earlier. If it is an overseas contract, assistance
might be needed with accommodation and visas. Whether the recruitment
agency or managed service company is a preferred supplier to the
employing company or not, it might be retained to provide additional
services over and above the services that might be allowable under the
schedule or with the Government&#146;s
amendments.</div>

good points that are deeply relevant. Does he share my concern that, as
highlighted by the e-mail that my hon. Friend read a moment ago, people
with learning difficulties, such as dyslexia, and all sorts of other
difficulties would choose the route that he sets out because it is an
easier way for them to navigate through the tax system, rather than
having a separate accountant and legal adviser and trying to do it all
themselves?</div>

Hosie:
						</b> I have been in the self-employed sector, too, and
retained an accountant to do that work, and it is much easier to use a
managed service company or an accounting service company. It is worth
reflecting on the point that the self-employed contracting route is
taken by many individuals to get into proper business when they do not
want to&#151;or cannot&#151;raise the funds to recruit people
initially. If it succeeds, they prosper and the money that they
make&#151;the rewards can be higher if they have taken the
risks&#151;is a good route into becoming a proper business that
employs people. People go down that route for many reasons, most of
which are honest and fair.</div>
					<a name="07051580000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
42 suggests that MSC definitions must exclude reference to any other
companies that an MSC might be involved with. My reading of that, and
of the Bill, is that that must apply or else proposed new section
61B(2)(a) would catch legitimate recruitment companies if they were an
associate of the MSC provider. They might also be caught by the
influence clauses in proposed new section 61B(2)(b) and (c),
particularly that which regards influence over the provision of
services. If a recruitment firm is a preferred supplier to a company
and that company requires a particularly skilled individual, the
recruitment agency might say, &#147;Well, we have this person for you
but we cannot provide him for two or three weeks a month for two
months.&#148; In that sense, it would be directly influencing the
provision of the service. It could also influence how payments were
made, under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>instruction from the contractor or by offering advice to the contractor,
by saying that it was better to invoice and be paid weekly,
fortnightly, monthly, three-monthly or whatever. That is a direct
influence on the way in which payments are made and would allow the
companies to be caught under proposed new section 61B(2)(c). The
influence clauses are far too wide.</div>
					<a name="07051580000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There is an
exemption in proposed new section 61B(4). However, it applies only if a
company&#146;s business consists &#147;only of placing
individuals.&#148; However, if advice is offered to a contractor in
addition, such as, &#147;Go to company A rather than company B
because they always pay well and they pay on time&#148;, or
&#147;Go to company C rather than company D because our experience is
that the contract is likely to be extended&#148;, the provision of
that advice would breach the definition of only placing individuals
with a third-party company and those companies would be caught. Let us
think about the consequences, on which I hope the Minister will
comment. An individual contractor might have a relationship, possibly
with a prime adviser or principal adviser, and certainly with his or
her bank, and as they were not providing legal and accountancy services
and were certainly not providing a recruitment service or the service
of only placing an individual, they might also be caught.</div>
					<a name="07051580000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 43 refers to a
new subsection and amendment No. 44 excludes legitimate recruitment
firms by exempting them from falling into the facilitating trap of
proposed new section 61B(1)(d), which I have described. Amendment No.
45 extends the description of support activities, which is a useful
description of professional services and so on. That may have to go a
little further, but the amendment at least extends the protection to
some extent. Amendment No. 46 describes the key activities that one
would expect in new subsection (3A) but it, too, may need to go a
little further. I hope that the hon. Lady will explain a little further
the issue addressed in amendment No. 47, which is on partnerships. I
did not see a particular issue in that regard, but I may well have
missed it.</div>
					<a name="07051580000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 48 deals with the calculation of the deemed employment payment.
Should I have this wrong, I would be open to correction, but I
understand that it would change the calculation of the money that a
worker receives; it would involve proposed new section 61D(1)(b) but
would exclude proposed new section 61D(1)(c), other than in respect of
the commission fee that an agency would receive. It would not take into
consideration any of the elements of the real earnings of the
contractor, which is what I believe it is meant to do and which strikes
me as correct. Amendment No. 49 is in the next group, and I shall not
discuss that.</div>
					<a name="07051580000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are a number of weaknesses. The first part that we are
discussing&#151;the definition of MSCs, the exemptions and how people
might be caught&#151;is too wide. I have examined Government
amendmentNo. 97. If I read it correctly, it will remove some
of the safeguards offered by proposed new section 61B(4), because
should an individual do anything in relation to 61B(2), which relates
to influencing the provision of services, they may be caught.
Government amendment No. 97 reduces and weakens the safeguards in an
unintentional way.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): It is a privilege
to follow the hon. Gentleman, who clearly brings a wealth of personal
experience to a complex area of policy. The Liberals support the
principles behind clause 25 and schedule 3, but share many of the
concerns expressed. The amendments are valiant attempts to address some
of those concerns, but perhaps they do not go as far as will be
necessary to allay fears that are shared by a considerable number of
people both inside and outside the House.</div>
					<a name="07051580000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments principally
address the employed/self-employed area, which has become much blurred
in recent times. I must profess a certain d√(c)j√  vu because
of the exchanges that we had on IR35 in previous Finance Bill debates.
When IR35 came out, I, perhaps like a number of hon. Members, had a few
constituents writing and telephoning me, although that has gone away in
recent years. It may be that the professionals have found other ways of
addressing some of the concerns, which is perhaps why we are in this
situation. </div>
					<a name="07051580000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider whether or not IR35 was successful. Presumably it has not been
so successful&#151;why else would we be confronting some of the
proposals in schedule 3? Many hon. Members have mentioned that in any
anti-avoidance legislation it is essential to try to target the
proposals properly, so as to reduce the number of people or businesses
that might be included despite their being perfectly respectable and
honest in their transactions and despite their managing their
businesses perfectly properly. It seems to us that there is a distinct
danger of the measure drawing the net so wide as to include a
considerable number of businesses and people whom we would not wish to
catch.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07051580000568"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="07051580000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the
problems seem to relate to the definitions and tests. Surely one of the
most important aspects of legislation is to try to ensure that the
definitions, terminology and tests are as exact as they can be.
However, I am afraid that some of the terminology and proposed wording
does not provide that directness and
clarity.</div>
					<a name="07051580000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is also important not to create excessive administrative costs or
disproportionate penalties. The unintended consequence of much in
schedule 3 could be excessive administrative costs for people who,
frankly, should not have to face them and businesses having to make
considerable changes to their administrative procedures. The penalties
that can be exacted upon businesses could sometimes be disproportionate
to both the amount of business that they do and the degree of actual
control that they have over their clients&#146;
businesses.</div>
					<a name="07051580000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
some sympathy for the Government in trying to tackle a difficult issue.
The amendments that the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet and
Conservative Members have tabled have been helpful, in the main, in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>trying to narrow down how we tackle the problem, as have the
Government&#146;s amendments, although I take what the hon. Member
for Dundee, East said about the possibility of their doing the reverse.
That perhaps serves to demonstrate the complexity of the situation. Is
the wording adequate to bring into being something that will address
exactly what we all want to address, or will its openness to different
interpretation create only
confusion?</div>
					<a name="07051580000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to be clear about the exclusions and exemptions. I find that
a difficult area, because some of the businesses affected are hybrid
businesses, offering a range of services. The experiences of business
people, even at this early stage, give a powerful demonstration of the
effects on businesses. Indeed, I suspect that there will be an effect
on many other businesses throughout the
country.</div>
					<a name="07051580000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
most unclear area, as well as the one with the greatest potential to
cause disputes, is that of the unpaid liabilities rules. When I first
read the provisions, I almost could not believe what I was reading. The
idea of businesses being responsible for unclaimed and unpaid tax seems
quite incredible in its potential reach. Although I accept that far too
many businesses and organisations organise themselves so as to avoid
tax and then to make it unclaimable, trying to move the process into
other areas is fraught with dangers. The proposals are far too widely
drawn. Many innocent people could find themselves caught up in
something that the Government did not intend, yet the courts might
decide otherwise.</div>
					<a name="07051580000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As I have
said, there are great difficulties and dangers in the future. I suspect
that there will be great anger if the proposals go through as drafted
with no further amendments. I can foresee many difficult situations and
discussions between HMRC, and businesses and other organisations. It is
right, of course, for the Government to tackle avoidance. However, the
provisions need to be properly targeted to ensure that we do not impose
excessive administrative costs. We need somehow to provide clarity of
operation for something that I suspect will be strongly opposed by
certain elements, particularly those who have perhaps already benefited
from organising their businesses so as to avoid paying tax and national
insurance.</div>
					<a name="07051580000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We on these
Benches support the principles behind the proposals, but I remain to be
convinced that sufficient time or care has been taken to address the
obvious deficiencies and inadequacies, such as the ability of those
affected to amend their payroll procedures and change their paperwork.
Only time will tell whether schedule 3 will be a success or as much of
a failure as the ill-fated IR35. I feel that we may be in for another
bout of d√(c)j√  vu in one year&#146;s time, and the year
between now and then may be a period of considerable misery for many
people.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000630"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):
						</b> We have
had a detailed debate, and concerns have been reflected from a range of
interest groups and individual companies that either may be or feel
that they may be affected by the proposals. The hon. Members for
Chipping Barnet, for Dundee, East and for South-East Cornwall
consistently urged us to aim for clarity and certainty, as the
provisions intend to, and to minimise the unintended impacts as far as
we can.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>
					<a name="07051580000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the spirit of the detailed
points that have been put to the Committee, I hope to provide a
detailed exposition that will reassure the hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet and other hon. Members who have contributed. I appreciate the
hon. Member for South-East Cornwall saying that he had &#147;some
sympathy&#148; with the Government over the task that we face, and I
welcome his saying that we are right to tackle that area.
</div>
					<a name="07051580000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments relate
to the schedule, which introduces measures to deal with the problem of
managed services companies. When the Committee of the whole House
debated clause 25, I described in detail the problem that we face, but
it is worth reminding Committee members why action is necessary. I hope
the Committee agrees that the Government are right to be concerned and
to take action in that area, even if we may differ on whether the
provisions are quite right and quite clear
enough.</div>
					<a name="07051580000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our problem is
that managed service companies are corporate structures through which
workers provide their labour services. Those mass-marketed schemes are
promoted on the basis that the worker will pay less tax. As a
shareholder in the company, the worker is normally paid a combination
of salary, at the level of the national minimum wage, and dividends, on
which a lower rate of income tax applies and on which no national
insurance is paid.</div>
					<a name="07051580000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the vast majority of cases, as HMRC&#146;s compliance work has
confirmed, the nature of the worker&#146;s engagement with the end
client is equivalent to one of employment. The hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet alluded to the current rules&#151;the intermediaries
legislation, more commonly known as IR35. They mean that the amounts of
tax and national insurance that should be paid on income from such
engagements are computed on the basis that they are employment income.
However, in most cases, the rules are not followed, and there is a
considerable loss to the public purse. The action that we propose,
however, is not just about the loss of
revenue.</div>

just said about the old IR35 rules is his statement that they are not
enforced properly. What evidence does he have for that
statement?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000632"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I did not say that they were not being enforced; I
said that they were not being followed. I also said that we are
confronting mass-marketed schemes for which the IR35 legislation proves
inappropriate and inadequate.</div>
					<a name="07051580000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members will accept that the
Treasury is right to be concerned about lost revenue, the impact on the
public purse and the shortfall that must be made up in other ways.
However, the issue is not simply about lost revenue. The measures aim
to deal with the unfairness that, as businesses have told us, those who
follow the rules and pay the required tax and national insurance
contributions are being undercut by those who do not apply the rules
correctly. There are concerns&#151;Committee members on this side
will be conscious of them&#151;that some workers are encouraged or
even forced to use managed service companies without understanding that
they might, at the same time, be losing some of their employment
rights. Although this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>legislation does not deal with employment rights, by removing the tax
incentive for using MSCs and, therefore, reducing the likelihood of
mass-marketed schemes, it makes it less likely that employees will
enter such schemes without understanding the implications for their
employment status and their employment
rights.</div>
					<a name="07051580000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Chipping Barnet suggested in the Committee of the whole
House and again this afternoon that IR35 had somehow failed. That is
not true. However, it is true that the IR35 legislation was not
designed to deal with mass-marketed schemes on the present scale. The
contract-by-contract approach of the legislative test makes it very
resource intensive for HMRC to police, so this Bill introduces targeted
action to tackle the wider
problem.</div>
					<a name="07051580000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation defines MSCs and applies income tax on the basis of the
amounts of employment income of MSC workers. In due course, national
insurance contributions will also be charged on that income, although
that cannot happen until the Bill has Royal Assent. It also tackles the
problem of MSCs escaping payment of PAYE
debts.</div>
					<a name="07051580000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is worth pausing and stressing&#151;in case Committee members have
not been following the matter very closely since the pre-Budget
announcements in December last year&#151;that consultation on the
legislation began last December. Many of the responses at that time
recognised the problem of MSCs and the need for the Government to act
to deal with them. It is clear that it will be a challenge to achieve
what is, I hope, a common goal&#151;protecting the Exchequer from
those who want to bypass the rules for paying income tax and national
insurance, while ensuring that the legislation is focused specifically
at the abuse that it aims to tackle. I hope that the Committee will
accept that, with the constructive input of those involved in the
consultation throughout, we are going to achieve that goal with
schedule 3, and that the amendments proposed by the hon. Lady are
either unnecessary or would undermine the intent or application of the
provisions that we want to
introduce.</div>
					<a name="07051580000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure
the Committee that we are doing all that we can to deal with the
legitimate concerns that have been raised with us. No one would dispute
that the consultation has been thorough, that it has involved a wide
range of industry experts and interested parties or that the Government
have listened to the concerns and suggestions. We have made appropriate
amendments, where we think them right. The legislation has been
significantly revised since it was published for consultation in
December.</div>
					<a name="07051580000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Since
the publication of the Finance Bill, dialogue, consultation and
discussion with industry has continued. Officials continue to meet the
representatives of accountants, tax advisers, businesses and employment
agencies, among others. The comments of Marcia Roberts, chief executive
officer of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, help to
underline the consultation process that we have been trying to conduct.
In response to the Budget announcements, she
said:</div>
					<a name="07051580000526"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Treasury is right to tackle abuse within the MSC market...We
welcome the new definition of an MSC, which we have worked closely with
the Treasury on...there were very real concerns that the
legislation would adversely affect the flexibility of the UK labour
market...We are delighted that the Treasury has taken our concerns
on
board.&#148;</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07051580000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is precisely
because the Treasury and the Government are keen to consult fully that
the regulations that will flow from the schedule are not provided to
accompany the debate. The draft regulations on the PAYE debt transfer
were published for consultation on 8 February, and the consultation
closed on 30 April. I think that hon. Members will agree that we should
consider the comments fully and in detail before proceeding. As was
explained in the letter of 9 May that the Chief Secretary wrote to you,
Mr. Illsley, your co-Chair, Mr. Gale, and
Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen, copies of which have been made
available to the Committee, we have committed to publish the PAYE and
national insurance regulations next month, which we will lay before the
House when the Bill has Royal
Assent.</div>
					<a name="07051580000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I turn
to the detail of the amendments, I want to reiterate to the Committee
the significant amounts of tax and national insurance that are at
stake, and the scale of the threat to the public purse. Given the sharp
growth of MSC schemes in recent years, we estimate that the measures in
the schedule and its associated clause could take revenue of
&#163;350 million in this year alone.</div>
					<a name="07051580000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Our starting
point, which has formed the core of much of the debate today and in the
Committee of the whole House, is the definition of an MSC. There is,
understandably, much concern that there could be collateral damage to
those who are genuinely in business on their own account, and that
there might be increased burdens on them. There are also concerns that
people to whom the proposed legislation is not intended to apply will
be caught by the measures. I hope that we can remove some of the many
misunderstandings and that I can provide some certainty for members of
the Committee and the businesses that have made representations. I give
the undertaking that further guidance on the legislation will be
produced by HMRC next month, and HMRC will consult informally with
interested parties to ensure that the guidance gives the necessary
clarity that those groups
seek.</div>
					<a name="07051580000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
definition of an MSC in the draft legislation published in December
focused on who controls the company. As was discussed in the Committee
of the whole House, not least by the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne, the subsequent response from MSC providers made it clear that
they were determined to get around the new definition. They rapidly
made MSC workers the directors of new companies to give the impression
that those workers were in control of those companies. Many people who
responded to the consultation pointed that problem out to us, and it
became clear that a tougher, clearer and stronger definition was
needed. The definition in schedule 3 is a response to those calls in
the consultation and to the actions of MSC providers who tried to get
around the definition that we proposed in
December.</div>
					<a name="07051580000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Proposed
section 61B(1) sets out the four conditions that must be met for a
company to be defined as an MSC. They are, in summary: that the
business consists wholly or mainly of providing the services of an
individual to others; that payments made to the individual are equal to
the greater part or all of the consideration for the provision of the
services; that the way in which those payments are made would result in
them receiving, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>net of tax and national insurance, an amount exceeding that which they
would have received if the payment were employment income; and that an
MSC provider is involved with the company.</div>
					<a name="07051580000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 seek
to change the third of these conditions. We have deliberately framed
the provisions in a way that is not time specific or time related so
that each payment must be considered as and when it is made. These
amendments seek to apply the criterion on an annual basis, which would
have the effect that consideration of whether a company is or is not an
MSC could only be made on an annual basis at the end of a tax
year.</div>
					<a name="07051580000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
justification for these amendments and I hope to explain why they would
be detrimental to the intent of the legislation. The hon. Member for
Chipping Barnet may have adopted this from the intermediaries
legislation, but the approach that we are taking in this Bill is
deliberately different. Under IR35, the terms of engagements are
considered after the end of the year on the basis that many may not be
within IR35. By contrast, the Bill deems all income received by a
worker by means of an MSC to be employment income. As such it is liable
to the deduction of PAYE when received. There is no reason to wait
until after the end of the tax year to make that judgment. If the
amendments were adopted, there is a risk that the flow of PAYE to the
Exchequer could be impeded.</div>
					<a name="07051580000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the fourth of the
conditions in proposed new section 61B(1), it is essential that this
subsection is read carefully and in its entirety. It may be that we
keep coming back to the point that I wish to make now. Proposed new
subsection (1)(d) states that a company is an MSC provider if</div>
					<a name="07051580000527"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person who carries on a
business of promoting or facilitating the use of companies to provide
the services of individuals...is involved with the
company.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The first element that
must be satisfied is that a person is carrying on a business of
promoting or facilitating companies to provide the services of
individuals, not a business to promote or facilitate companies
generally. For that reason, those promoting or facilitating companies
generally&#151;for example, company formation agents&#151;are not
MSC providers. The same would be true of training providers and a
number of companies that may provide
advice.</div>
					<a name="07051580000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some have
asked whether a person who promotes their business and who provides
services to those working through service companies is an MSC provider.
The answer is no. There is a clear distinction between a person who
promotes themselves or their business and someone who is, as a
business, promoting the use of companies to provide the services of
individuals. Even if a person fulfils the criterion of being an MSC
provider, it does not automatically follow that their client companies
are MSCs. That depends on the nature of their relationship with their
client companies&#151;namely, whether they are involved with the
client companies. The word &#147;involved&#148; is separately
defined in the legislation and I will say more about that in a moment
as it was another
concern.</div>
					<a name="07051580000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 40 and 41 relate to the fourth condition set out in proposed new
subsection (1)(d). If they became part of the Bill they would undermine
its effectiveness by giving MSC providers the opportunity to sidestep
the definition of an MSC provider while 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>providing no additional safeguards for those merely providing
accountancy services. Amendment No. 40 would bring into the definition
of MSC provider the condition that the activity was their &#147;sole
or main business&#148;. Our legal advice is that the Courts may well
interpret the term &#147;main business&#148; as more than 50 per
cent.</div>
					<a name="07051580000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
determined to sidestep the definition&#151;we have seen ample
evidence of that since we published our draft proposals in
December&#151;it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that an MSC
provider would seek to run a dual business of which the provider
element consisted perhaps of only 49 per cent. For the same reason,
therefore, the word &#147;sole&#148; would provide even greater
scope for circumvention. Similarly, substituting &#147;promoting and
facilitating&#148; for &#147;promoting or facilitating&#148;
would enable MSC providers to circumvent the definition of an MSC
provider by splitting the two constituent elements of their business.
The association rule, as some might describe proposed new section
61C(4), which seeks to counter the splitting of a business, would not
be effective in that situation because in order for it to apply there
needs to be an MSC provider before there can be an
associate.</div>
					<a name="07051580000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid
that amendment No. 41 would also undermine the effectiveness of the
legislation. First, it would include in proposed new section 61B(1)(d)
a description of an MSC provider&#146;s relationship with a client
company, which is set out already in proposed new section 61B(2). I
think hon. Members can appreciate that that structural change would
simply confuse those attempting to interpret the legislation and,
potentially, could mislead courts when they come to construe
it.</div>
					<a name="07051580000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, and
perhaps more importantly, we are looking for greater certainty and
clarity, but the amendment would introduce what I am sure most hon.
Members would accept is a rather vague concept of</div>
					<a name="07051580000528"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;most aspects of running the
company&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those terms,
allied to the proposed inclusion of the word &#147;regularly&#148;,
again would give MSC providers ample scope to challenge a claim that
they did not fit the criteria or to sidestep them in the first
place.</div>
					<a name="07051580000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
raised a serious concern about tainting, as she put it. I think that
that is what led to amendment No. 42, as she explained to the
Committee. My concern is that the amendment is not necessary or helpful
and could undermine the intent of the legislation. I understand from
what she said that it would ensure that an MSC provider&#146;s other
client companies with which it is involved are disregarded when
determining whether an individual company is an MSC. To a large extent,
the legislation does that already by virtue of proposed new section
61B(1). Specifically, proposed new subsection (1)(d) refers to the MSC
provider being &#147;involved with the company&#148;. That links
directly to the opening words in proposed new section 61B(1), which
reads:</div>
					<a name="07051580000529"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
company is a &#147;managed service company&#148;
if&#151;&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are aware, however, that MSC providers seeking to circumvent the
legislation will claim that each relationship with their thousands of
client companies is unique and does not constitute being involved. Let
me try and be clear about how HMRC will approach this. First and
foremost, it will look at the nature of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>product provided by an MSC provider. Where it is clearly a standardised
product constituting the MSC being involved with client companies, it
will take the starting view that all client companies are MSCs. The
onus will then be on the individual companies to demonstrate no
involvement.</div>
					<a name="07051580000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
amendment were adopted, it would risk undermining the legislation
because in determining whether a person is an MSC provider it is
necessary to look at the nature of their business. Clearly, to do that
it is necessary to look at the services provided by the clients more
widely. There is the risk that an MSC provider would seek to challenge
the assertion that it is carrying on a business of &#147;promoting or
facilitating&#148; by arguing that in determining the nature of its
business, HMRC could not consider the nature of the services offered
widely. Clearly, that could constrain HMRC unduly and could undermine
the effectiveness of the
legislation.</div>

						</b> Amendment No. 42 is about tainting and the
provision that one should not have regard to the scheme
provider&#146;s relationship with other companies. If the amendment
were adopted, it would not stop HMRC from examining the general
business of the scheme provider, assuming that other amendments were
not accepted. It would still be open to HMRC to examine whether the
scheme provider was in the business of promoting or facilitating the
use of companies. It would be possible to examine the general nature of
the product offered by the scheme provider under proposed section
61B(1)(d), even if my amendment, which would solve the tainting
problem, were to be adopted.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000638"></a>John
Healey:
						</b>
						That is not the view that we
take of the impact of amendment No. 42. As I think that I have
explained to the Committee, the risk is twofold: first, the amendment
would give grounds for the MSC provider to sidestep or challenge the
assertion that it was carrying on the business of promoting or
facilitating; secondly, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>in determining the nature of the business, which is clearly one of the
factors that HMRC would have to take into account, the amendment may
prevent HMRC from considering the nature of the services that are
offered more widely, because it may constrain HMRC simply to examining
the specific company.</div>
					<a name="07051580000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the question of
involvement, proposed section 61B(2) sets out five tests of
involvement. If one of these tests is met, the company is an MSC. It is
important to emphasise that this measure needs to be considered only if
there is an MSC provider. For example, a tax adviser providing tax
advice is not an MSC provider and therefore the tests set out in
proposed section 61B(2) are not considered.</div>
					<a name="07051580000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The five activities defining
&#147;involved&#148; go beyond the services provided by
accountants. Some have suggested that the word
&#147;influences&#148; in proposed section 61B(2) captures all the
advice given by accountants and advisers, but there is a distinct
difference&#151;I think that hon. Members would accept that there is
a difference&#151;between a person who provides independent, tailored
advice to a client, who is then able to consider that advice before
accepting it or rejecting it, and the person who simply supplies a
client with a standard solution or product that the client accepts. It
is not the intention that the former situation&#151;the provision of
advice&#151;be considered to be influencing in this context. However,
the latter situation&#151;supplying a standard solution or
product&#151;is regarded as influencing.</div>
					<a name="07051580000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my statement on

majority of situations where concerns have been expressed to us, this
measure becomes relevant only if the company is an MSC provider. In
other words, as I tried to explain, it is only if an MSC provider is
established that the provisions and questions around the word
&#147;involved&#148; apply. In the vast majority of examples, that
will not be the case.</div>
					<a name="07051580000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let me turn
to new section 61B(3) and reinforce the fact that a person who merely
provides legal or accountancy services in a professional capacity is
not an MSC provider involved with their client. There is a specific
exclusion&#151;this is the point about which the hon. Lady is
concerned&#151;from subsection (1)(d) for those who provide such
services. Let me try to make this absolutely clear: even when the
specific exclusion does not apply, the purpose of the legislation is
not to include within the definition of MSC provider accountants, tax
advisers, lawyers and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>company secretaries who provide advice or other professional services to
companies in general. Those persons are not in the business of
promoting or facilitating the use of companies to provide the services
of individuals, nor are they regarded as involved with the company in

might help the hon. Lady. When an individual asks a tax adviser for
help or advice in setting up a business to provide that
individual&#146;s services to end users, the tax adviser considers
the individual&#146;s position and might recommend a corporate
structure that includes the payment of dividends to the individual as a
shareholder worker. The tax adviser is not acting as an MSC
provider.</div>

take a different example, where an accountant specialises in giving
advice to freelance workers and contractors. Day in, day out,
contractors come to that accountant to get advice on the best way in
which to run their business. The accountant regularly sets up companies
and carries out services in relation to them. Do they not fall within
the scope of paragraph (d), so that there is a danger that they might
be construed as being in the business of promoting or facilitating the

						</b> On that point&#151;it is my main
concern&#151;when one considers new section 61B, which defines the
meaning of a managed service company, one could easily come to the
conclusion that a normal recruiting company or accounting services
company with a recruitment element would fulfil all the criteria in
subsection (1), whether it was wholly or mainly providing people or
whether payments were made in a certain way or were of a certain size.
It would certainly be promoting the business as if it were an MSC,
particularly in its involvement with companies, as I have described. I
am still not sure that the safeguards will be there for legitimate
recruitment companies. I have not heard anything to tell me that they
will not fall into this category and be punished in a way that I think
is unintentional.</div>

						Amendments
Nos. 43 to 46 appear to intend that the exclusion for the provision of
accountancy and legal services should apply to the tests of involvement
under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>proposed section 61B(2) as well as the definition of an MSC provider. It
is the Government&#146;s view that they are not necessary. As I have
said, the tests of involvement are considered only if proposed section
61B(1)(d) applies in its entirety, so only in the case of</div>
					<a name="07051580000531"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person who carries on a
business of promoting or facilitating the use of companies to provide
the services of individuals&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 45 and 46
attempt to expand and clarify the scope of the exemption for the
provision of accountancy and legal services in a professional capacity.
The difficulty with amendment No. 45 is that it would undermine the
legislation. Far from providing clarity, the terms that it would add,
such as &#147;services of a nature&#148; and
&#147;including&#148;, would simply render proposed new section
61B(3) of the 2003 Act so ambiguous that many MSC providers would
arguably claim that it exempted them. The reference to company
secretarial services is also unnecessary, since generic services such
as those and company formation do not fulfil the criteria that we have
set out in proposed new section 61B(1)(d), as they are not in the
business of</div>
					<a name="07051580000532"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoting
or facilitating the use of companies to provide the services of
individuals&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 46 sets out a list of what accounting services might include and
provides for the Treasury further to provide a list of such services by
affirmative resolution. My judgment is that the services listed will
not help to tackle what we are trying to tackle and would not be
necessary. The reason for coming to that conclusion is as follows. To
reiterate, proposed new section 61B(3) explicitly excludes certain
categories of persons providing certain services from the scope of
proposed new section 61B(1)(d). Those providing the type of services
listed in amendmentNo. 46 would already be excluded, either
explicitly, by virtue of proposed new section 61B(3), or because they
are not in the business of an MSC provider as set out in proposed new
section 61B(1)(d).</div>
					<a name="07051580000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise to the Committee for a mistake in the explanatory notes,
which we published on 29 March. The note on clause 25 and schedule 3
contained an error in paragraph 24, which provides the explanation of
proposed new section 61B(3). The error was helpfully pointed out to us
by a lawyer from one of the representative bodies&#151;not by my hon.
Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, although I am sure
that he would have spotted it and been on his feet anticipating my
remarks if he was in Committee this afternoon. Unfortunately, the
original note misquoted the text, by referring to the</div>
					<a name="07051580000533"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;business of promoting and
facilitating&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07051580000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">rather
than the</div>
					<a name="07051580000534"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;business of
promoting or
facilitating&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly
the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet also spotted that. Just to reassure
the Committee, we have amended the explanatory notes on our website,
although we have not published a new printed
version.</div>
					<a name="07051580000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Before
turning to some other points, I should like briefly to mention
Government amendment No. 97. I said in the Committee of the whole House
that employment agencies and businesses have an important and
legitimate role to play in the temporary labour market and we would not
want to disrupt that. To ensure that employment agencies are not caught
by the definition of MSC provider, we have provided an exclusion in
proposed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>new section 61B(4). However, given the potential for MSC providers
simply to re-badge themselves as employment businesses or agencies, the
exclusion in proposed new section 61B(4) was restricted, to the extent
that employment businesses and agencies do no more than would be
expected from such businesses.</div>
					<a name="07051580000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment No. 97 corrects a
technical flaw in the legislation, which, if left unchanged, would have
resulted in the exclusion being too narrow and therefore bringing
employment businesses back within the scope of the definition, which
was clearly not our intention. Our amendment will allow an employment
business or agency to influence a worker&#146;s company or its
finances to the extent that that relates to the placing of the
individual with an end client. That will mean that such businesses can
carry on their normal activities, as
intended.</div>
					<a name="07051580000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have been able to make it clear to the Committee that the measures
have been subject to detailed and constructive consultation.
Underpinning our work has been a clear consensus that action is needed
to tackle the problems identified. The Committee has been indulgent
this afternoon. I hope that what I have said is helpful and will bring
a degree of certainty and clarity about who falls within the scope of
the legislation, which I recognise is important to businesses involved
in the sector.</div>
					<a name="07051580000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I hope that I
have also explained why the amendments and arguments put forward by the
Opposition would not improve the certainty of the legislation in most
cases, and in some cases would cause greater confusion and more scope
for circumvention. I hope that the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet will
not press the amendment, but if she does, I shall have to ask my hon.
Friends to oppose
it.</div>

								Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I remain concerned about the proposals. As I
said from the outset of the debate on schedule 3, the Opposition would
support appropriately targeted attempts to deal with what is a genuine
problem. Regrettably, the Financial Secretary is not prepared to accept
any of our amendments. I am not convinced that what he said about the
restrictive scope of paragraph (d) will be reflected in a court
decision in two or three years&#146; time, for example.</div>
					<a name="07051580000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that there is
sufficient certainty, as we still have not heard enough of an
explanation of what &#147;promoting and facilitating&#148;
involves. All we have heard is that someone producing a standardised
product for the use of freelancers and contractors is likely to be
caught by the provisions, but people whose services are more tailored
are not. I remain concerned about tainting; I do not believe that the
amendment that I tabled would have the negative consequences that the
Financial Secretary suggested it would. I wish to press amendments Nos.
40 and 41 to a Division. I do not propose to press amendment No. 38. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> I apologise for trying to get to this a little
prematurely a few minutes ago.</div>
					<a name="07051580000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments in this group
are broadly focused on proposed new section 688A and the third party
debt transfer provisions in schedule 3. There is a concern that they
could be used to target the innocent, ranging from end users of
contractors to employment business and their advisers. The Committee
should be aware that the proposals are powerful. They are more
far-reaching, by some measure, than the rules that rendered company
directors liable for the debts of their company.</div>
					<a name="07051580000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this regard, I should cite
Blake Lapthorn Tarlo Lyons, a firm of solicitors to which I have
referred before. It has said:</div>
					<a name="07051580000536"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This is a fairly
revolutionary principle...People are now going to be liable for
the tax affairs of their suppliers (i.e contractors) even where those
suppliers are clearly self-employed but just happen to fall within the
new MSC regime...It is clear that ultimately staffing companies
and others who are some way from the day to day affairs of the MSC and
not directly interested (in terms of shareholding or profit share) in
the MSC, may become liable for the MSC&#146;s unpaid tax and
NICs.&#148;</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>
					<a name="07051580000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">More worrying, it points
out:</div>
					<a name="07051580000537"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Conceivably
a staffing company which fails to take appropriate steps may find
itself hit by an unprovided for tax bill for as much as 20 to 30 per
cent. of its turn-over&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ann Swain, the chief executive
of the Association of Technology Staffing Companies, described the
current situation bluntly,
saying:</div>
					<a name="07051580000538"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is too much risk...It&#146;s
ridiculous.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
continued by saying that the
Chancellor</div>
					<a name="07051580000539"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is cutting
back on the flexibility of the workforce in a huge
way.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not an
answer for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to say that it will
only enforce the provisions responsibly and will not target the
innocent. If the legislation is too widely drafted, it must be
restricted by statute. It would be unconstitutional to leave the
problems identified in relation to proposed newsection 688A to
be resolved at the discretion of HMRC.</div>
					<a name="07051580000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have told the Committee,
some legitimate consultants and contractors are finding that their work
is drying up because people are so anxious about these provisions that
they are becoming increasingly reluctant to deal with any small service
companies. The Opposition&#146;s amendments in this group therefore
seek to achieve three important goals: to clarify the third-party debt
rules; to prevent their being used against innocent third parties who
are unaware that they are dealing with an MSC; and to provide important
safeguards in the way in which the rules are administered and
enforced.</div>
					<a name="07051580000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
like to deal with the timing of the introduction of these proposals.
They have proved to be so controversial that their implementation has
been postponed from the start date of 6 April that applies to the rest
of the legislation. The HMRC website states that the debt transfer
provisions come into effect for MSCs and MSC providers from 6 August
and for other third party parties on 6 January 2008. As those dates do
not appear in the Bill, it would be useful if the Financial Secretary
would confirm, as I believe that he did earlier, that those are the
appropriate dates. It would also be useful if he would confirm whether
or not the clock is already running on tax debts that have accumulated
since 6 April? Given what he has said, I do not think that that is
likely to be the case, but I know that some people believe that it
might well be and clarification would be useful. It would be very
unfair if these penal liabilities could be building up now, even though
the legislation has not been finalised.</div>
					<a name="07051580000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even assuming that debts can
build up only from August or January, the timetable is a short
one&#151;it is much shorter than the lengthy run-up to IR35.
Unpopular though that measure was, at least people who were affected by
it were given a chance to understand what it meant and to adapt their
systems to ensure that they were compliant with the new rules that the
Government were introducing.</div>
					<a name="07051580000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The liabilities will kick in in
just two months, yet a major part of the relevant rules&#151;the
final draft of the secondary legislation&#151;has not even been
published, although we have the initial draft, which appeared in the
consultation. It is a matter for concern that the Committee does not
have sight of the final draft of the secondary legislation. It would be
inappropriate to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>finalise the secondary legislation before considering the consultation
responses, but it would have been useful if the Government had timed
the consultation in such a way that it had closed earlier with
sufficient time not only for the Government to consider the responses,
but to produce the legislation in time for the Committee to consider
it.</div>
					<a name="07051580000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 49 focuses on a point of concern raised with me by the Professional
Contractors Group, and is linked to amendments Nos. 50 and 51. They are
probing amendments to give the Committee the opportunity to discuss the
approach that might be taken by tax inspectors with limited expertise
or experience in this technical and specialist area. They seek to
ensure that the managed service company provisions are enforced and
administered by specialist units at HMRC. I understand that HMRC has
indicated that that will be the case, and I think it is important to
ensure that those involved with enforcement of the provisions have
appropriate training and understanding.</div>
					<a name="07051580000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The PCG has made
representations that the enforcement of IR35 has often been problematic
and that cases have often been withdrawn by HMRC after lengthy
wrangling when they were passed from local inspectors to specialist
units. It seems to be under the impression that it is fairly common for
non-specialist local inspectors to make errors in the difficult task of
implementing IR35, and it has justifiable concerns that that might
happen with the new legislation, which, as we have heard from this side
of the House, is difficult to understand. PCG members certainly feel
that local inspectors have not always understood IR35 correctly, and
giving statutory backing to the commitment to use specialist
enforcement in this area could reduce errors, as well doing something
to promote confidence in the new
measure.</div>
					<a name="07051580000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
82 relates to the term &#147;HMRC considers&#148;. We will no doubt
come back to the matter, but it essentially raises the same concerns
that many have raised in relation to the term &#147;HMRC
thinks&#148; in other parts of the Bill. New section 688A permits
sums to be recovered under the third party debt provisions when HMRC
considers they should have been deducted by the MSC from payments to
workers.</div>
					<a name="07051580000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My concern is
that either the law required the sums to be deducted by the MSC, or it
did not. The mental processes, views and opinions of what &#147;HMRC
considers&#148; should have been done should not be relevant in
determining the amount of tax to be paid. I hope that the Minister will
consider supporting the amendment to delete &#147;HMRC
considers&#148; or at least inform the Committee why the wording in
new section 688A(1) is necessary. How will a determination be made of
what &#147;HMRC considers&#148; to be the case, and how can that be
challenged? Does the Revenue&#146;s opinion have to be based on
reasonable grounds, and are there any circumstances in which the tax
that HMRC considers to be due is not required to be paid under
statute?</div>
					<a name="07051580000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
82 reflects serious worries raised by the Institute of Directors, which
states in its briefing on the
Bill:</div>
					<a name="07051580000540"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have
a general concern about the underlying attitude, which we see as being
one of &#145;trust me, I&#146;m a Government
official&#146;...It is not easy to square such legislative
recognition of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>the significance of officials&#146; opinions with the spirit of the
Bill of Rights of 1689 or of the standard preamble to a Finance Act,
both of which make clear that decisions on who pays what taxes rest
with Parliament rather than with the
Crown.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister will think again about the terms &#147;HMRC
considers&#148; and &#147;HMRC thinks&#148; later in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07051580000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
move to amendments Nos. 52 and 53 and Government amendment No. 98,
which address the heart of concerns surrounding the third-party debt
provisions that we are considering. The Opposition amendments seek to
restrict the wide reach of subsection (2)(c) of proposed section 688A,
which imposes liability on any
person</div>
					<a name="07051580000541"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who (directly or
indirectly) has encouraged, facilitated or otherwise been actively
involved in the provision by the MSC of the services of the
individual&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Although
the relevant issues here are similar to those that we discussed
regarding proposed section 61B(2)(d), paragraph (c) of subsection (2)
is even
broader.</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000572"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="07051580000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 52 and 53 are designed to answer some of the many concerns that
have been expressed about the wide-ranging scope of paragraph (c), and
should be read alongside amendments Nos. 54, 55,60 and 61,
which would provide clarity about the liability of specific groups.
Those groups are: the ordinary employees of the scheme provider; the
worker in the MSC; the end-client who engages the services of the
worker; and staffing and recruitment companies.</div>
					<a name="07051580000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Before I
discuss our amendments in detail, Ishould like to make it
clear that I welcome Government amendment No. 98 to delete the word
&#147;facilitated&#148; from paragraph (c). I am pleased that they
have responded to the concerns that I expressed on Second Reading
andin the Committee of the whole House about the scope of the
third-party debt rules. The Committee has already considered the
problems with the concept of facilitation in relation to proposed
section 61B, and the issues here are similar. Accountants, company
formation agents and even insurance companies might be caught by the
third-party debt rules because their activities can undoubtedly
facilitate the use of companies to provide the services of
individuals.</div>
					<a name="07051580000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In amendment
No. 52, I sought to qualify and restrict the scope of the word
&#147;facilitated&#148; by requiring active conduct before
liability could be established under paragraph (c). It is preferable
that the word should be deleted altogether, but that would not solve
the problems with the paragraph. The word &#147;encouragement&#148;
is still retained in the paragraph, and is, as the Law Society has
pointed out, very broad. Its briefing states:</div>
					<a name="07051580000542"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The focus of the
secondary liability rules should be persons who are involved in the
management of the activities of the MSC and who make money from those
activities. A person who encourages is someone who is on the sidelines
rather than someone who is involved in the
activity.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even with the
removal of the word &#147;facilitated&#148;, the Opposition believe
that more needs to be done to introduce an element of culpability
before liability can be established.</div>
					<a name="07051580000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 53, which would
insert a new subsection (2A), would remove from the scope of the
third-party debt rules people who did not know or could not reasonably
be expected to know that they were dealing with a managed service
company. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div>amendment is designed to remove from risk people who have unwittingly
been involved with an MSC by requiring deliberate conduct or complicity
with the MSC scheme. The Institute of Directors put this point well in
its submission, when it said:</div>
					<a name="07051580000543"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsection (2)(c)
encompasses too wide a range of people. It means that people could have
tax debts passed on to them even without culpability. This is a major
departure from the normal principle that people can only be penalised
when there is some fault on their part. We regard the failure to
include some culpability test as wholly unacceptable, and as reflecting
a desire to design a system to suit the convenience of officials. The
reference to active involvement does not amount to a culpability test,
and no permanent reliance should be placed on any Ministerial or
official expression of intent that it will be interpreted as a
culpability
test.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
final point is particularly telling. The word &#147;active&#148;
did not appear in the draft section 688A in the consultation document.
HMRC added the word &#147;actively&#148; to section (c) to turn
&#147;or otherwise been involved&#148; into</div>
					<a name="07051580000544"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or otherwise been actively
involved&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07051580000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">and seemed to
think that that sorted out the culpability problems.</div>
					<a name="07051580000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC also seems to believe that
it has provided for the element of conscious wrongdoing that was
hitherto missing from the measures. I agree that the insertion of the
word &#147;actively&#148; is useful&#151;indeed, my amendment No.
52 also uses that concept to qualify not only involvement but
encouragement and facilitation&#151;but it is insufficient to inject
the element of culpability that is needed if we are not to catch people
who are innocent and unaware of their connection with an MSC in the net
of the debt transfer rules. That is why proposed new subsection (2A) is
necessary. The Committee should note that it would not protect people
who deliberately shut their eyes to what is going on, or those who,
given the facts that they knew, ought reasonably to have known what was
going on.</div>
					<a name="07051580000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
anticipate some of the concerns that I think that the Minister might
express. He might say that importing a knowledge requirement explicitly
into the statute could give rise to evidential problems. In response I
point out the reference in amendmentNo. 53 to:</div>
					<a name="07051580000545"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should have reasonably been
expected to
know&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">To a
large extent that will deal with such evidential concerns. If a person
knew facts that would lead an ordinary person to conclude that they
were dealing with an MSC, that will suffice. I point out also that very
similar wording appears in other contexts in the law, particularly in
section 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in relation to directors&#146;
liability for debts of their company. If the courts can cope with that
concept elsewhere, they should be able to cope with it in schedule
3.</div>
				
					<a name="07051580000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second response to
resistance to the amendment comes from the Treasury&#146;s own
consultation paper, which states
that,</div>
					<a name="07051580000546"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the scope of the
provision is limited so the legislation is not intended to include
anyone who didn&#146;t know or could not reasonably be expected to
know that they are dealing with an MSC&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was repeated by the Financial
Secretary in a letter to me dated 10 May. If that is the
Treasury&#146;s intention, why not make it clear in the statute? If
he will not accept that amendment, it is critical that he clarify in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>Committee what led him to believe that proposed new section 688A as it
stands produces the result set out in his letter and the consultation
paper. We need a further explanation of the meaning of the statement in
the consultation paper and of how the principle that it will establish
will operate in
practice.</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
shall turn to amendment No. 54, the first of the amendments on
different groups affected by the third-party debt rules. As drafted,
the ordinary non-director and non-shareholding employees of an MSC
provider could be caught by proposed new section 688A(2) as someone who
has</div>
					<a name="07051580000547"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;encouraged,

					<a name="07051580000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
a payroll clerk or secretary might well have facilitated or been
actively involved, but it seems pretty harsh to hold those people
liable for significant sums of money. The amendment is focused on
imposing the liability on the controlling minds of the MSC providers,
rather than just its junior staff. It would focus the statute and
liability on staff members who were

No. 55 raises slightly more difficult issues. It is a probing amendment
designed to highlight issues concerning workers operating through the
MSC and to get a clearer idea of the circumstances in which a worker
might be pursued under proposed new section 688A. The PCG is concerned
about that point. It is clear that workers could fall within the scope
of the third-party debt rules; they do so explicitly under new section
688A(2)(a) if they are a director or office holder. However, even if
they are not, presumably carrying out the work itself would bring them
within the remit of paragraph (c) as actively involved in the provision
of services via the MSC; providing those services must amount to active
involvement.</div>
					<a name="07051580000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">A concern
needs to be cleared up about whether a worker could end up with the tax
liability for all the other workers in the MSC. That point was raised
with me by the London Society of Chartered Accountants, which is
concerned that the provision would enable HMRC to claim PAYE and then
NICs from a contractor who had worked for an MSC in relation to all the
other co-workers in the MSC. That could lead to significant liabilities
for workers, and the society advocates steps to be taken to amend the
situation.</div>
					<a name="07051580000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that the answer the problem might be partly provided in new section
688A(2)(d), where it is required that acts of encouragement and
facilitation focus on the activities of &#147;the individual&#148;,
not &#147;individuals&#148; or &#147;an individual&#148;, so
the liability for a co-worker&#146;s tax debts would come only with
encouragement in relation to the provision of their services. However,
if one contractor gets other contractors into a particular project, the
criteria might be satisfied. So there is a risk, and if the Financial
Secretary can eliminate it today, it would be
useful.</div>
					<a name="07051580000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if new
paragraph (c) does not mean inevitably that a worker is liable for the
tax debts of other workers in the MSC, might the liability be imposed
if they were an associate of the company under paragraph (a)? The
meaning of &#147;associate&#148; is set out in new section 61I(3)
as</div>
					<a name="07051580000549"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person connected
with the company&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>
					<a name="07051580000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">and is defined in section 839 of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 as someone who has control over
the company. A worker can certainly be said to have control over the
company in a case in which just one worker is entitled to all the
dividends. However, catching the worker on the grounds that he controls
the MSC rather contradicts the Government&#146;s assertions that
workers in MSCs do not control their own companies. That lack of
control and independent operation by the worker is what the Government
say that they want to target and stamp out, so it would be useful if
the Minister could confirm that workers in MSCs are unlikely to be
liable as associates of the company.</div>
					<a name="07051580000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 60 is critical.
It concerns the end client&#151;the company that engages the services
of the contractor. The end client should not be at risk as a result of
new section 688A merely by virtue of having hired people who happen to
be operating via MSCs. Amendment No. 60 would make that crystal clear
by inserting a new subsection (2)(d) with a safe harbour for those who
engage the services of contractors. It provides that the end client
will not be liable merely because it hires a contractor who is
operating via an MSC. Without clarification, it might seem that that
conduct is enough to amount to encouragement of the provision of
services via an MSC. What could be clearer encouragement to provide
services via an MSC than paying the MSC to provide the
worker?</div>
					<a name="07051580000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The end
client should not have to check details of contract workers&#146;
relationships with their service companies or their professional
advisers. Any requirement to do so would significantly disrupt
outsourcing in this country and would have a damaging impact on the
flexibility of the labour market. There was an extensive debate on that
under IR35, and the Government eventually conceded that end clients
should not be targeted.</div>
					<a name="07051580000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that HMRC believes
that inserting the word &#147;actively&#148; in relation to
&#147;or otherwise involved&#148; would remove the threat from
innocent end clients. However, that would provide very uncertain
protection and could be interpreted in a number of different ways by
the courts. Given the large liabilities involved, it is vital that the
issue be cleared up, preferably by an amendment. Certainly, any
clarification that the Minister can give this afternoon will be very
much welcomed by those who are affected.</div>
					<a name="07051580000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
61 is designed to clarify the operation of the framework in relation to
staff in recruitment companies. We have heard a number of concerns
expressed about that. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has raised
the point that recruitment agencies could be exposed to liability under
new section 688A. Again, I welcome the Government&#146;s attempt to
tackle the issue through amendments Nos. 99 and 100. It is a matter of
concern that the Bill contains a degree of protection for the
recruitment industry in relation to new section 61B, but that that is
not repeated in relation to new section 688A. The amendment would
address the problem by lifting the wording from proposed new section
61B and inserting it in proposed new section 688A. We have already
discussed the concerns raised by the recruitment sector and it is
critical that those be addressed.</div>
					<a name="07051580000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 55 and 56 track
the identical amendments tabled in relation to the safe harbour for
professionals. We have already discussed those at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>length, so there is no need to look at them again in detail. However, I
would like to raise one point. Can the Minister clarify the difference
between the wording here and that in new subsection 61B(3)? Why does
the Bill refer to services there but to advice in new section 688A?
Advice seems to be a narrower concept than services. Does the Minister
anticipate that the safe harbour in new section 688A would have a
narrower remit than that in new section 61B? If so, what is the
justification for that?</div>
					<a name="07051580000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 58 provides for a
number of important safeguards in relation to the operation of the
third party debt provisions, and amendment No. 59 is consequential. As
we have discussed, these are serious and powerful provisions. We
therefore need to ensure that they are operated and enforced in a
responsible and efficient way by HMRC. We are concerned about the
selection of people who could be pursued for the same debt. HMRC might
be tempted to go for the low-hanging fruit&#151;the easiest target.
The amendment suggests a number of new subsections to deal with that
concern.</div>
					<a name="07051580000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
subsection (3C) seeks to make it clear that there is an obligation on
HMRC to take a proportionate approach when using the third party debt
provisions. It should be explicitly acknowledged that not all parties
potentially in the frame under the Bill are equally culpable. It is to
combat the deliberate winding-up of companies to prevent recovery by
HMRC that these provisions have been drafted. This type of deliberate
conduct should be taken into account in making decisions on
enforcement. Those who are unwittingly caught by the legislation should
not necessarily receive the same treatment as these deliberate
evaders.</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000573"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07051580000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New
subsection (3D) provides that if someone is being pursued for a debt
under section 688A, they should know the other parties from whom HMRC
is taking steps to recover the debt. That seems to me a matter of
fairness. If HMRC wish to go for a scattergun approach and pursue
several people, it seems only fair that their targets should be made
aware of the other relevant parties and the sequence in which they are
being pursued.</div>
					<a name="07051580000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Turning to
new subsections (3E) and (3F), again I have received representations
from the PCG on the matters covered and the sequence in which parties
will be pursued under section 688A. The informal indications from HMRC
seem to be that the MSC will be approached first, then its directors or
office holders, then the scheme provider and finally others who are
actively involved in the provision of services via an MSC within
paragraph (c). The amendment is designed to draw out the Minister to
make some formal comment on the approach that HMRC will take and the
order it will adopt. Will there be any formal sequence? If so, what
will it
be?</div>
					<a name="07051580000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Rule
97B(6) of the draft secondary legislation provides for a restriction
along the lines set out in paragraph (3F). Third parties liable under
paragraph (c) will be pursued only if the debt proves irrecoverable
from the MSC provider or its directors. However, the draft secondary
legislation would override this sensible restriction on HMRC by adding
a get-out clause that the sequence set out can be set aside if the
protection of the Exchequer would be prejudiced. The amendment provides
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>opportunity to hear from the Minister what this restriction would
involve and why he feels it is necessary to include it in the secondary
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07051580000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Last
of all I should like to comment on amendment No. 101, which deletes the
Treasury&#146;s power to amend section 668A by secondary legislation.
In a number of amendments I have suggested that the Treasury should
have the power to look at particular aspects of the legislation that we
are discussing, but it is a matter of concern, given the seriousness of
these provisions, that HMT can have the unfettered power to amend
primary legislation using secondary legislation. Given the significant
liabilities and harsh nature of the provisions, I believe that if the
Government wish to amend section 688A, they should bring forward
primary legislation to bring that about.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000707"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> This is a large group of amendments. I will
concentrate most of my remarks on those that reflect the greatest
concern and are therefore central to the Committee&#146;s
consideration. I hope that I can offer some further reassurance and
clarity to the Committee and to those with an interest in the Bill
about how it will operate in relation to
MSCs.</div>
					<a name="07051580000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
first with amendments Nos. 49 to 51, which deal with the
implementation, investigation and enforcement of the provisions. These
amendments seek to require that the measures we set out in schedule 3
should be administered and enforced only by officers of HMRC, acting
with the authority of commissioners for HMRC, and that a certificate
from the commissioners stating that the officer has this authority
wouldbe evidence of that. It is important to understand that
all officers of HMRC in exercising their statutory functions act with
the authority and under the direction of the HMRC commissioners and
that they do so after the appropriate training and in accordance with
the legislation and published guidance. Schedule 3 means that MSCs must
comply with existing PAYE legislation, including the resultant monthly
payments to HMRC and the filing of returns. To require the
administration of the PAYE system for MSCs to be dealt with by
different HMRC officers from those who deal with employers in general
seems an extraordinary proposition, which is rather impractical and
therefore not appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07051580000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In terms of
the debt transfer provisions under proposed section 688A, the draft
regulations published for consultation in February make it quite clear
that an MSC debt can arise only by virtue of one of the provisions
within the PAYE legislation. If the amendments were adopted, that would
result in a wholly anomalous situation whereby employer debts that are
established generally would be dealt with by the trained staff in
whichever part of HMRC was most appropriate, but identical functions
related to MSCs would be vested in specially authorised officers who
would fulfil precisely the same role as their non-authorised
colleagues. The Committee should think carefully if it is urged to
consider those amendments.</div>
					<a name="07051580000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let me
reassure the Committee on the transfer of debt. Given that the transfer
notices are expected to be issued infrequently, HMRC intends to vest
such work in a central, specialised team that undertakes work of a
similar nature. I hope that the hon. Lady will recognise and welcome
that confirmation, but I should emphasise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>that it is my belief the decision should remain operational and should
be made by HMRC, and should not be specified in legislation.</div>
					<a name="07051580000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn to the core of the
concerns about the transfer of the PAYE debts. We have included the
provision because we have encountered a specific problem with MSCs. We
have found that when a PAYE or national insurance contributions debt is
established, the MSCs frequently escape from making payment by winding
up or ceasing to trade and moving workers into a new company, and
because MSCs are simply a vehicle through which workers&#146; income
is routed,they often have no assets and so HMRC is unable to
recover the unpaid tax and national insurance contributions.</div>
					<a name="07051580000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new section 688A
contains provisions to enable regulations to transfer PAYE debts to
appropriate third parties when the MSC does not pay. It sets out, of
course, who those third parties are. As respondents to the consultation
confirmed, the provision for the transfer of debts is essential to
ensure that the wider aims of the legislation are achieved. Without it,
those promoting and benefiting from the schemes could carry on without
any financial risk.</div>
					<a name="07051580000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As the hon.
Lady recognised, we made changes as a result of the consultation.
However, I am aware that concerns remain about the scope of the
transfer provisions, so the three remaining Government amendments
represent our considered response to dealing with those concerns. To a
large extent, they overtake some of the Opposition&#146;s
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07051580000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Government
amendment No. 98 will remove the word &#147;facilitated&#148; from
proposed new section 688A(2)(c) so that only those who have encouraged
or been actively involved in the provision by the MSC of the services
of the individual will fall within its scope. Both tests require the
third party to have an active role, so those who simply use MSC workers
will not be caught. If an end client did more than simply use MSC
labour, for example by telling those who it employed that they must
move to an MSC, it would fall within the scope of the measure as that
would be regarded as encouragement&#151;the hon. Lady asked about
that point. That was the reason why we included the word
&#147;actively&#148;, which I am glad she welcomed. She asked for
clarification of whether the tax clock is ticking from April. I confirm
that debts can be transferred only for PAYE or national insurance
contributions from August or January, depending on which third party is
considered, not from April.</div>
					<a name="07051580000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady also voiced her
concern about the notion of the power given to an officer who
&#147;considers&#148; being rather broad. It is not as broad as it
appears; it simply reflects that fact that under existing PAYE
legislation, debts may arise both as a result of an employer failing to
pay a sum declared as due, and on a sum estimated to be due by HMRC.
Proposed new section 688A does not provide for HMRC to create a PAYE
debt, but for regulations to enable the transfer of debts that have
been created by virtue of existing legislation.</div>
					<a name="07051580000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendments Nos. 99
and 100 reflect the consideration that we have given to concerns that
employment businesses or agencies might be within the scope of the debt
transfer provision, simply as a result of carrying on their normal
business of placing individuals. We have considered the risk that such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>activity might be regarded as &#147;actively involved&#148; under
proposed new section 688A(2)(c), and have decided to remove that risk
by expanding the exclusion, as set out in proposed new section 688A(3),
so that the mere placing of individuals with clients is not within the
scope of the provisions. An employment business will be within that
scope where it is involved beyond such activity, perhaps by advising
workers to use an
MSC.</div>

							<a name="07051580000708"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> If a recruitment company holds a list of
approved suppliers and advisers that it makes available to the
contractors with which it works, such as a list of approved suppliers
of corporate structures, would that bring it within the scope of the

rules?</div>

							<a name="07051580000709"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I cannot be specific about the judgment to which
an HMRC officer might come in those circumstances, but they would
increase the potential for a company to fall within the scope of the
rules. The Government amendments address the Opposition&#146;s intent
and concerns in amendments Nos. 52, 60 and 61.
</div>
					<a name="07051580000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
amendments Nos. 53 and 55, which the hon. Lady stressed. Amendment No.
53 seeks to include as a condition of the transfer of debt to other
parties, or to workers providing their services, the concept that the
person</div>
					<a name="07051580000550"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;knew or should
have reasonably been expected to know that the services...were
being provided by a managed service
company.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">My fear about
the amendment is that it does not deal with the evidential concerns, as
she argued, but may create them. She is right that dealing with those
concerns is the objective of the legislation, but including her wording
would open the door to abuse, as it would inevitably lead to legally
based claims of ignorance as a
defence.</div>
					<a name="07051580000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
was rightly concerned about the position of those she termed
&#147;ordinary employees&#148; of MSCs. Let me make it clear that
we do not intend ordinary employees of MSCs or third parties to be
caught by the debt transfer provision. Defining an ordinary employee
would be difficult, however, and her attempt to do so made that point
for me. Except for MSC directors, providers and associates, the debt
transfer provisions cover only those who have encouraged or been
actively involved with the supply of labour services through MSCs. It
is important to recognise that the transfer of debt regulations include
a specific right of appeal on the grounds that</div>
					<a name="07051580000551"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the amount specified in the
transfer notice does not have regard to the degree and extent to which
the transferee...has encouraged...or been
involved.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">On those
grounds, the special commissioners may reduce the amount specified in
the transfer notice to a level that, in their opinion, is just and
reasonable.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07051580000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
58 is an attempt to pre-empt a provision that is more appropriate for
the regulations. We set out in the draft legislation matters such as
the order in which debts may be transferred, the circumstances in which
they may be transferred and the rights of appeal against such
transfers. In response to the representations made through the
consultation, it is our intention to amend the draft regulations to
provide further safeguards. I can assure the hon. Lady and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>members of the Committee that, as part of the process of preparing the
regulations for publication next month, I shall consider carefully the
point that she made this

improve certainty. I also hope that she will accept that the Government
amendments take account of concerns that have been raised in
discussions and that they will make the legislation work as intended. I

described some as probing amendments, but if she does divide the

						</b> I shall withdraw amendment No. 49, but I would
like to press amendments Nos. 53 and 60 to a vote. I am particularly
concerned that the Financial Secretary has not responded positively on
amendment No. 53. He is concerned about the possibility of legally
based claims and defences based on lack of knowledge. As I said, our
law deals with that kind of situation in other contexts&#151;in
particular, the Insolvency Act 1986&#151;without any problem, as I
understand it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000766"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> As I have just said, we have grave concerns
about schedule 4. The amendment would delete proposed new section 103C
of the IncomeTax Act 2007, which is proposed in paragraph 1 of
schedule 4. In so doing, the amendment would remove the
Government&#146;s restriction on sideways loss relief for non-active
partners, as proposed in the schedule. Sideways loss relief allows a
partner to set off partnership losses against other income. I
understand that it has been part of our tax system for more
than50 years. Sideways loss relief is designed to give relief
in the early years of a partnership, when losses might be high, as they
often are with a start-up business.</div>
					<a name="07051580000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">In schedule 4, the Government
propose a two-stage restriction on sideways loss relief. Proposed
newsection 113A of the 2007 Act would disallow any sideways
loss relief for arrangements, where one of the main purposes of
entering the transaction was tax avoidance. That might not have caused
an enormous amount of controversy. There would have been issues to
explore around the purpose test and the scope of the proposals, but
they would not have caused huge concerns. However, the Treasury
proposes to go much further with new section 103C. That will impose
significant restrictions on ordinary commercial ventures that are not
motivated by tax avoidance. To obtain full sideways loss relief under
the proposals in schedule 4, a partner will have to spend 10 hours a
week working personally on the partnership&#146;s business. For those
partners who do not devote 10 hours a week to the venture, the sideways
loss relief that they can claim is limited by the schedule to
&#163;25,000.</div>
					<a name="07051580000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Institute of Chartered Accountants has pointed
out:</div>
					<a name="07051580000552"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
measure is not targeted solely at tax avoidance schemes...The
result is that the measure will impact upon many small businesses being
set up with substantial investment in the early
years.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The London
Society of Chartered Accountants has expressed concern that schedule 4
means that many deserving investment projects will now never see the
light of day. It urges the Government to reconsider, and so do the
Opposition.</div>
					<a name="07051580000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
why I tabled amendment No. 62 to delete the 10-hour condition and the
&#163;25,000 cap. Amendment No. 63, to which I shall come at the end
of my remarks, is proposed as a compromise alternative to raise the cap
from &#163;25,000 to &#163;100,000, although in our view it would
be preferable to opt for amendment No. 62 and the complete deletion of
proposed new section
103C.</div>
					<a name="07051580000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I point out also
that the Committee will soon have the opportunity to consider
amendments Nos. 64 and 65, which form a key part of a package of
proposals that the Opposition suggest in relation to schedule 4. They
would restrict sideways loss relief to those ventures that can pass a
demanding threshold designed to show that they are commercially
motivated ventures, not artificial tax-avoidance schemes. We recognise
that some of the schemes that have utilised sideways loss relief have
caused problems in terms of revenue leakage from the Treasury. We do
not oppose efforts by the Government to shut down abusive and
artificial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>schemes that are motivated only by tax avoidance and that do not involve
genuine commercial risk. However, we are worried that vital commercial
ventures will be hammered by the Government&#146;s attempts to shut
down problematic tax-avoidance
schemes.</div>
					<a name="07051580000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The package
comprising amendments Nos. 62,64 and 65 is aimed at giving Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs the power to shut down abusive
schemes, but without clobbering genuine enterprise and investment. The
Opposition fear that, unless those amendments are adopted, schedule 4
will have a very damaging effect on high-risk investment and small
business
start-ups.</div>
					<a name="07051580000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
point to make about schedule 4 centres on the way in which the changes
were announced on Friday 2 March this year. They were rushed out right
at the end of the financial year, when many people had made their plans
on the basis that the reliefs would be available. The changes will
impact on many ventures in respect of which investments have already
been committed on the basis of the existing tax system. Now, investors
have had the rug pulled from under their feet, and they find themselves
at risk for large amounts of money with no prospect of relieving
potential losses in the way in which they had
envisaged.</div>
					<a name="07051580000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
received protests on that point from many people, including
Mr. Wood of Morgans Independent Advisers, Jeff Moores of
Moores Warren, and Richard Grant of Pantheon Financial Management. They
point out that the legislation impacts unfairly in treating partners in
the same arrangement differently according to whether they contributed
earlier or later in the tax year, even if both investments were made
before these provisions came into effect. That might not be such a huge
problem if the only arrangements hit by the changes were dubious and
artificial tax-avoidance schemes, but as I have said, that is not the
case. The retroactive nature of schedule 4 adds to the concern of the
Opposition about the measures and their impact on ventures and
contracts agreed on the basis that sideways loss relief was
available.</div>
					<a name="07051580000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee may be aware that there was a rapid U-turn when the proposals
were initially announced. They were initially due to cover film tax
reliefsunder section 42 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 and
section 48 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1997. Within, I think, three
working days, there was a rapid about-turn, and the Treasury decided
that section 42 and section 48 reliefs would not be restricted. That
certainly seemed to make sense, because only a few weeks before that
the Treasury had announced a temporary extension of those reliefs. The
assumption seems to be that, the section 42 and section 48 problem
having been solved, this sorts out the film industry, but that is not
the case.</div>
					<a name="07051580000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">No doubt the
Minister will quote back at me statements that suggest that not
everyone in the film industry is worried about the remaining provisions
in the Bill on sideways loss relief, but I have received a number of
very concerned representations on that issue. The film industry has
found sideways loss relief so important because of the high degree of
risk involved in a film project. It is very difficult to predict in
advance whether a film will be successful. Hence, investment proposals
are often based around investing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>in a number of films. The assumption is that, if one backs 20 films,
there is a chance that one of them might make money and offset some of
the losses from the others. That becomes impossible with the abolition
of sideways loss
relief.</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000575"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07051580000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sebastian
Speight of Ingenious Media has told me that two high-profile UK films,
&#147;St. Trinian&#146;s&#148; and &#147;Brideshead
Revisited&#148;, had seen their private investment withdrawn as a
result of the announcement in schedule 4. These films were relying for
up to a third of their funds on investors expecting to be able to
reduce the risk of the investment by using sideways relief. Those films
were rescued by the Film Council, but it remains a concern as to how
other films will find funding in the absence of sideways relief.
Mr. Speight put the problem as
follows:</div>
					<a name="07051580000553"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
new film tax credit will provide 20 per cent. of the cost of making a
film. However, for larger projects, it is difficult to see where the
remaining finance will come from beyond a few national and local
grants. Big films need a critical mass of investment before they can be
undertaken and this restriction makes it much harder to
get.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue here is that part of film funding which is not covered by the
film tax credit. Sideways loss relief reduces the high risks for
investors who are asked to provide the 80 per cent. of funds that are
not covered by the tax credit. The Government&#146;s film tax credit
will not work if projects find it impossible to raise the other 80 per
cent. of funds that they need. Restricting sideways relief makes that
much more
difficult.</div>
					<a name="07051580000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">Variety</i>
magazine said that scrapping sideways loss relief would &#147;gut
British film production&#148;. Patrick McKenna, a film investment
expert, has pointed out that films such as &#147;Vera Drake&#148;
or &#147;Girl with a Pearl Earring&#148; would not have been made
without sideways loss relief. He told me that many films that are
already in production or about to go into production may not now be
made. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07051580000554"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Revenue have taken a very blunt instrument to deal with this. It has
not discriminated between bona fide investment and tax
abuse.&#148;</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000767"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I have listened to the hon. Lady&#146;s argument
with interest. She has acknowledged that the new film tax relief will
provide 20 per cent. of funding for films, but she is saying that that
is not enough. I presume that she is saying that the public purse
should provide a still higher proportion. What proportion does she
think should come from the public purse towards the cost of producing a
film?</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000768"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I am saying that the Government should not
abolish sideways loss relief, because that relief is reducing the risk
that investors face when they go into a film project.</div>
					<a name="07051580000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coupled with restrictions on
venture capital trusts, these measures could cause significant problems
for the film industry, and the problems for the film sector are
replicated in other areas of the creative industries. As with a film
project, predicting how the public will respond to a new computer game,
for example, is much more difficult than, say, developing a new soap
powder or shampoo. Again, sideways relief allowed investors to take a
punt on risky proposals for new games, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>knowing that at least they had the protection of being able to set
losses off against other income. I would like to ask the Minister if
the Treasury has conducted any research whatsoever on the impact that
schedule 4 would have on the hugely important computer games
industry.</div>
					<a name="07051580000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
wrong, however, to think of this issue as a film tax issue, or to think
that the creative industries are the only ones that will be affected.
The Chancellor has often referred to the &#147;funding gap&#148;,
in other words the difficulty that many start-ups have with raising
finance. We have always been a nation of inventors and innovators, but
far too often we have had difficulty turning those ideas into
commercial reality. Sideways loss relief has been one of the few useful
mechanisms for bridging that funding gap, and now the Treasury wants to
scrap it.</div>
					<a name="07051580000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						A number of
distinguished academics have indicated serious concern about the impact
of schedule 4 on scientific research, which is also something that the
Chancellor has repeatedly said that he wants to encourage. Professor
Ian Swingland, founder of the Durrell Institute of Conservation and
Ecology and Emeritus Chair in Conservation Biology at the University of
Kent, has said:</div>
					<a name="07051580000555"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At least 10 per cent.
of high-risk research will be destroyed by this aggressive move against
collective investment, and probably more. Many investors will be
dissuaded from funding key environmental projects rather than use other
existing highly bureaucratic mechanisms. If environmental research and
development is to grow in the UK, it is essential that sideways loss
relief continues to be available for high-risk and innovative
ventures.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">He expanded on
those concerns in a letter published in the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> this
morning.</div>
					<a name="07051580000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact
of schedule 4 on crucial emerging markets for environmental technology
has been raised with me by a number of people. Martin King, who leads
the Silver Planet consortium of investors in environmental technology,
told me:</div>
					<a name="07051580000556"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I and
a number of colleagues have organised high risk venture funding via
Business Angels using the sideways relief that was available to offset
failed investments...The changes proposed...in the draft
Finance Bill mean that partnerships will not now invest in high risk
ventures and in particular research which has been particularly
targeted by Treasury. Already we have had to turn down over 20 projects
that were of a very high risk nature...Obviously we have informed
all those organisations that they cannot be funded in this traditional
way and I assume they will have to look overseas for their
funding...HMRC have suggested that funding could be switched to
State approved schemes such as EIS and VCT but most business angels
find the bureaucracy and severe limitations these schemes have to be a
real deterrent... Equally the HMRC suggestion that Banks will
replace this kind of funding is
ludicrous.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Tony
Blakey, founder of Ethical Trading and Marketing, contacted me to
express his grave concern about the impact of schedule 4 on projects to
develop technology that is effective in tackling climate change. He is
involved with a number of revolutionary projects in areas such as tidal
energy, applied accelerated tree-growth technology, accelerated
community biomass technology and environmentally-friendly biodiesel
production. He believes that if such projects prove successful, the
technology that they harness could produce low-cost renewable ways to
cover a significant proportion of the world&#146;s energy needs. He
tells me that up until 2 March, the UK had a very significant share of
that developing market, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>but now all the projects are likely to go offshore as a result of
schedule 4 to Germany, Pakistan, Brazil and other countries. Funds
dried up as soon as the 2 March announcement on sideways relief was
made.</div>
					<a name="07051580000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr Blakey told
me:</div>
					<a name="07051580000557"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;The
abolition of sideways loss relief has significantly reduced the number
of investors willing to risk early stage research
funding...Partnerships currently fund vital environmental projects like
tidal energy, biodiesel, and accelerated tree growth...These
projects cannot now be completed using partnership
funding...Foreign investors will benefit as the projects will no
longer be controlled or owned by the
UK.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that no one knows which research will yield results. Of 50
projects to accelerate tree growth to produce cheap
environmentally-friendly energy, 49 might fail. Before now, investors
at least had the cushion of sideways relief to soften the impact of the
losses. The Government propose to remove that cushion, so the risk
becomes higher and the funds more difficult to obtain.</div>
					<a name="07051580000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Chris Dodson
of Torftech Ltd has also written to me about a range of environmental
energy projects that are being shifted overseas as a result of the
changes proposed in the Bill. The Chartered Institute of Taxation has
told me that schedule 4 is jeopardising projects to make use of the
special capital allowances introduced by the Chancellor himself in 2003
to encourage environmental technology.</div>
					<a name="07051580000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rupert Lywood, to whom I
referred on Second Reading, is an investor in a partnership pursuing
research and development work on lung and bowel cancer vaccines. He is
concerned about the impact of schedule 4 on existing and future medical
research projects. He commented:</div>
					<a name="07051580000558"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Investment in private
medical research is very high risk, projects such as cancer vaccines
research and development couldn&#146;t be contemplated without the
availability sideways loss relief...These proposals have a
retroactive effect on existing projects and will undoubtedly jeopardise
potentially life-saving medical research and the opportunity for UK
businesses to lead in important fields of research and profit from
international exploitation of newly developed
technologies.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Lywood tells me that important existing projects on cancer, HIV and
multiple sclerosis have already been put in jeopardy by schedule
4.</div>
					<a name="07051580000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
10-hour limit is fundamentally unsuited to this kind of project. Many
of the business angels hit by schedule 4 will have investments in a
wide spread of high-risk projects. They need to take that approach to
spread their risk, and they cannot possibly find 10 hours in every week
to devote to each project. The restriction simply misunderstands how
such investment projects
work.</div>
					<a name="07051580000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nor can
HMRC&#146;s approved investment schemes plug the gap left by the
abolition of sideways loss relief. HMRC&#146;s response to the
concerns expressed about schedule 4 is that those affected should use
one of the Government&#146;s state-approved arrangements, such as the
enterprise investment scheme or venture capital trusts. Such schemes
simply will not take up the slack, because the amounts that can be put
into them are limited and, in many ways, they can be bureaucratic,
inflexible and expensive to
run.</div>
					<a name="07051580000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rupert Lywood has
said:</div>
					<a name="07051580000559"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Everyone
supports measures to counteract tax avoidance, but that&#146;s not
what these proposals do. What they do, is to create 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>powerful disincentives for individuals wishing to invest in bona fide
commercial enterprises which would enhance the UK&#146;s
competitiveness and wealth-creation. The Government has reneged on its
promise not to use these provisions to disadvantage business. The
incentives delivered through the Enterprise Investment Schemes and
Venture Capital Trusts have been steadily eroded over recent years to
the point where they are now, in practical terms, almost irrelevant as
a source of serious capital for new or developing businesses. Sideways
loss relief was the last real practical incentive available to
encourage private investment is growing enterprises, its removal is
completelyat odds with the Government&#146;s objective to
encourageenterprise&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Institute of Chartered Accountants has expressed concern about the
impact of schedule 4 on start-up businesses that source finance from
family and friends who become non-active or sleeping partners, and it
has given a number of examples of micro-business start-ups involving
family members that could be hit. Those micro-businesses already face
increasing corporation tax rates and possibly problems with the MSC
regime, and they are thumped again by the loss of sideways relief that
would have provided assistance in the difficult early years of any
enterprise.</div>
					<a name="07051580000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 63 would increase the cap on sideways relief from &#163;25,000 to
&#163;100,000. Of course, if amendment No. 62 were adopted, the need
for that change would fall away with the deletion of the cap. I tabled
amendment No. 63 for two reasons. First, it is a compromise. If the
Government were not able to accept the complete deletion, they might
mitigate the damage of section 103 by raising the cap. Secondly, it
allows the Committee to probe the Government&#146;s rationale for the
&#163;25,000 cap. In making a similar request, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants points out that no justification has been given
for the imposition of the &#163;25,000 limit&#151;the figure seems
to have been plucked out of the air, so I should like the Minister to
explain why that figure was
chosen.</div>
					<a name="07051580000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
the Chancellor says that he wants to plug the funding gap, but he is
ripping away one of the few measures that helped to do that. In his
Budget statement, he said that he wanted the UK to be a world leader in
the discovery and development of new energy technologies, yet in the
very same Budget, he was proposing to abolish a key tool in driving
forward that discovery and development. Schedule 4 would damage the
film industry, damage enterprise and investment and damage many
projects vital to tackling climate change. I urge the Chief Secretary
to think again about schedule 4 and to consider accepting the
amendments that I have put
forward.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con):
						At the risk
of trying your patience, Mr. Ilsley, and that of other
members of the Committee, I wish to contribute at this late hour to the
debate on this amendment, because of all the aspects of the Bill, this
schedule is the one that will cause most damage to the structure of
enterprise in this country and to innovative investment. It is the
measure on which I have received the most comments from outside this
place, and the one on which I urge the Chief Secretary, whom I know to
be a reasonable man, to take note of the arguments that have been so
well put by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet. He should
think again about its impact and what it will do to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>growing entrepreneurial and innovative investment climate that has been
cultivated in part under his Government&#151;let me give credit where
it is due.</div>
					<a name="07051580000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
will have a major impact in driving investment offshore and shutting
down a large proportion of high-risk investment in this country. I
should remind the Committee that I am a partner in two partnerships, a
farming partnership and an investment partnership. Although they have
been going for a long time&#151;they are not new partnerships, so the
measure would not directly apply to them&#151;I have experience of
investing in partnerships. I know that they provide a valuable
structure, not for tax avoidance but for suitable flexible equity
involvement in a business by both active partners and those who retire
or become less active, as I did when I came into this place. We are at
risk of diverting investment activity out of a good structure that
exists for positive reasons into sole trading or individual investment,
or into a corporate structure in which the ability to offset losses
against other kinds of income is not currently threatened. The measure
will divert business activity in an entirely unintended
way.</div>

					<a name="07051580000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ministerial
statement of 2 March from the Paymaster General sought to clarify why
the clause was being introduced. She
stated:</div>
					<a name="07051580000560"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
capital contributions to be excluded will be those paid by non-active

main purposes, for contributing the capital to the partnership is for
the partner to obtain a reduction in tax liability by means of sideways
loss relief.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 2 March 2007; Vol.
457, c. 105WS.]</div>
					<a name="07051580000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
appropriate measure to deal with tax avoidance, and the Conservative
amendments seek to achieve the Government&#146;s precise objective.
Their measures will restrict all sorts of other bona fide commercial
activity.</div>
					<a name="07051580000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let me pick
up on one other point. Thought has clearly been given to what types of
activity will be affected. The ministerial statement specifically
carved out high-risk underwriting at Lloyds as an activity that should
be exempted from the clause, and it is exempt under proposed new
section 103C(8). As my hon. Friend said, there was a U-turn over the
film industry, as a special exemption was sought for qualifying
expenditure for films, which can now be found in proposed new section
103C(6). However, the ministerial statement referred to professional
firms as exempt, but that does not appear in the Bill. Why has the
Chief Secretary had a change of heart? Where is the logic behind that
decision? If special pleading by a particular industry has found favour
in the Treasury and in the Chief Secretary&#146;s deliberations, will
he think too about the special pleading on behalf of
investors&#151;business angels of the type described by my hon.
Friend?</div>
					<a name="07051580000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">Time is
pressing and hon. Members will wish to move on, but I have two more
questions. The measure is designed to get at losses generated from the
early stages of a partnership. When the Chief Secretary sums up, will
he confirm that the provisions will not apply to partnerships that have
existed for some time but where losses might legitimately arise as a
result of the business getting into difficulty a year or two later?
That is not clear from the explanatory notes.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>
					<a name="07051580000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the two limits on
working hours and the amount of money that can be invested are
concerned, it seems extraordinary that the drafting should apply in
such a way that in order to qualify for sideways relief, individuals
will be compelled to spend 10 hours a week&#151;presumably the
Government will not encourage them to breach the working time
directive, so that is25 per cent. of their working
time&#151;committed to a project. Most people who invest in high-risk
projects and wish to benefit from sideways loss relief are doing so
because they are entrepreneurial investors with other activities. They
do not necessarily have the relevant skills to work for 10 hours a week
in the business.</div>
					<a name="07051580000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend referred to individuals who had engaged in biotech
research. They might well be entrepreneurs with a commitment to
developing new vaccines or environmental energy projects, but they
might not necessarily be scientific boffins who could spend the time
doing so, and, because of their other activities, they might not have
the time to promote the business. There is a lack of logic to the
10-hour limit and an equal lack of logic to the &#163;25,000 limit.
If the amendment is put to a vote and not accepted, I urge the Chief
Secretary to go away and come back on Report with a more considered
clause.</div>

						<a name="07051580000770"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I should
like briefly to pursue one of the points that my hon. Friend the Member
for Chipping Barnet made about film tax relief. She described how the
Treasury&#146;s original proposals appeared to rule out section 42
and section 48 film tax relief.</div>
					<a name="07051580000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my limited experience of
the Committee this year and last year, as well as from my experience of
a Committee on a statutory instrument, the Treasury devotes a fair
amount of attention to film tax. In passing a lot of legislation in
such an important and sensitive area, it has no doubt developed a
highly skilled team, with much expertise in the field. I should
therefore be grateful if the Chief Secretary could tell the Committee
whether the Treasury&#146;s film tax experts were consulted on the
original proposals on sideways loss relief, and if not, why not. If
they were, did they spot the difficulties that became apparent after
the original proposals were announced? The Treasury appeared to do a
U-turn in three working days, which is fairly quick. I have some
experience of seeing the Treasury do U-turns on film tax, but they
usually take a matter of months, not days.</div>
					<a name="07051580000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Treasury seems to be
particularly sensitive to film tax and to ensuring that the burden does
not drive films offshore. I assume that the reason for that is that the
film industry is highly mobile, as well as highly innovative and high
risk, as my hon. Friend mentioned. If the tax burden were greater,
fewer films would be made and the Treasury&#146;s tax revenue would
therefore be reduced. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for
Braintree would describe that as a perfect example of the Laffer curve
in operation.</div>
					<a name="07051580000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, could the same
principle apply to other sectors? My hon. Friend the Member for
Chipping Barnet gave some examples of sectors that perhaps do not have
such a well-developed lobbying capability and to which the Government
are perhaps not always as sympathetic as they appear to be to the film
industry. In the light of the difficulties that emerged with the film 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>industry, as a consequence of the abolition of sideways loss relief, has
the Treasury given any consideration to whether any other sectors would
be adversely affected by the
proposals?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000771"></a>Mr.
Breed:
						</b>
						Once again, we seek through tax
avoidance schemes to distinguish between organisations that are genuine
commercial enterprises and those that are set up purely to avoid tax.
The Chartered Institute of Taxation suggested that the Government
consider introducing a motive test, which might have made a
contribution, so I should be grateful if the Minister could say whether
that proposal was feasible or
not.</div>

						The schedule seems to reflect a
fundamental misunderstanding of the investment environment. It confuses
working for an enterprise for 10 hours a week with providing finance
for risky ventures, and thereby plugging what is clearly a seedcorn
finance problem for many creative industries. I therefore urge the
Government to rethink the schedule.</div>

							<a name="07051580000773"></a>Mr.

patience unduly, but I certainly do want to respond to some of the
points that Opposition Members have
made.</div>
					<a name="07051580000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
schedule changes the rules for offsetting the trading loss of a
non-active or limited partner in a trading partnership against their
other income and capital gains, which is known as sideways loss relief,
as we have heard. The Exchequer has incurred significant and growing
losses from the misuse of sideways loss relief by wealthy people who
participate in partnerships not in anticipation of an investment gain,
but purely to access losses&#151;frequently highly contrived in
nature rather than real&#151;to reduce their tax on income or capital
gains.</div>
					<a name="07051580000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
new rules have been targeted specifically to halt that form of
avoidance while preserving access to a significant degree of sideways
loss relief for people who are not seeking to avoid tax. On a number of
occasions, Opposition Members talked about the abolition or removal of
sideways loss relief, but that is not correct. There is a limit in the
schedule to the amount of sideways loss relief available, and the vast
majority of sideways loss relief that is not motivated by tax avoidance
falls within that limit. We are not withdrawing
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">

Timms:
						</b> In a minute.</div>
					<a name="07051580000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I want to
make very clear the Government&#146;s position in response to the
points that have been made. We have a responsibility to block schemes
for tax avoidance. The argument that some ancillary benefit arises from
the scheme is not a justification for retaining the ability to
establish such schemes. We have introduced a number of measures to
encourage productive investment, such as the new film relief measures,
and the research and development tax credit, which if I remember
rightly, Opposition Members want to abolish. Ours is the proper way to
encourage investment.</div>
					<a name="07051580000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">The claim that some tax
avoidance schemes may lead to investment that would not otherwise have
occurred is not a justification for leaving tax loopholes in place, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>and the claims for the amount of investment that may take place are
often grossly exaggerated. At the very least, tax avoidance schemes are
a deeply inefficient use of public money. Sideways loss relief is not
an efficient use of taxpayer funds for promoting the investment that we
have heard about; it is deeply inefficient.</div>
					<a name="07051580000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Committee members are perfectly
entitled to believe that there is a need to use taxpayers&#146; money
to promote investment in a part of the economy, and they are at liberty
to propose measures to help, along the lines of the film relief or
research and development tax credits. However, let us reject the
argument that scams should be left in place because this or that
incidental benefit arises from
them.</div>
					<a name="07051580000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is very
important that we are not naive about what is going on. FT.com on 10

Churchill was quoted further:</div>
					<a name="07051580000564"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Everyone was gearing up
to put significant amounts of money into these schemes. Bonuses gets
paid in February and people don&#146;t tend to do anything until the
run up to the end of the tax
year&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051580000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can
get an idea of the impact of the change resulting from the announcement
through published data on limited liability partnerships. In 2005-06,
about 40 per cent. of the total number of partners in avoidance
partnerships, which are set up for an avoidance purpose, were recruited
after 1 March and before 6 April&#151;just in time for the end of the
tax year. In 2006-07, the most recent financial year, only 1.1 per
cent. were recruited following the announcement.</div>
					<a name="07051580000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet explained that amendment No. 62 would completely remove the
proposed annual limit on sideways loss relief while amendment No. 63
would increase it to &#163;100,000. We are dealing with a
particularly aggressive form of avoidance whereby schemes consistently
adapt their arrangements to get around the rules. It has become very
clear that a purpose test alone will not deter
it.</div>
					<a name="07051580000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to the
hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, there is a purpose test in the
Bill, but there is also a limit. We need an annual limit to provide an
additional deterrent to the purpose test and to make it uneconomic to
challenge the intention of the legislation. An annual limit of
&#163;25,000 will achieve that deterrent, comparing the relief gained
with the fees required to set up a scheme. A limit of &#163;100,000
would not do so. It would provide a significant incentive to continue
to use those schemes to avoid tax, even after allowing for the quite
considerable promoters&#146; fees and for other costs.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>
					<a name="07051580000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice, more than 90 per
cent. of losses incurred by people in the partnership population who
are not motivated by tax avoidance are lower than &#163;25,000. The
vast majority of losses that arise to those who are motivated by tax
avoidance exceed &#163;25,000. An annual limit of &#163;25,000
strikes the right balance between allowing non-avoiders access to
sideways loss relief, while preventing avoiders from abusing
it.</div>

					<a name="07051580000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cost of the
more modest of these two amendments&#151;raising the limit to
&#163;100,000&#151;would be at least &#163;150 million per year.
Given behaviour changes on the part of the avoiders, in due course it
would quite likely reach the full &#163;400 million score against
this measure in the Red Book. It could be more, but we have scored it
at &#163;400 million. Of course if the limit were &#163;100,000,
and it was economic to avoid tax still by this route, people would set
up a whole string of these arrangements so they could continue to avoid
tax in this way. I hope that I have explained the purpose of the annual
limit and the reason that it is set at &#163;25,000. I hope that the
hon. Lady will agree to withdraw her amendments. If not, I shall
certainly urge ask my hon. Friends to oppose them.</div>
					<a name="07051580000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should finally like to make a
couple of points on films. The hon. Lady quoted a couple of remarks by
people in the film industry. Let me just quote Andrew Eaton, co-founder
of Revolution Films, who
said:</div>
					<a name="07051580000565"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Everyone
has been aware that there have been funds that have been able to make
quite a lot of money out of tax schemes and haven&#146;t always been
putting money back into the business. There was a very strong sense
across the industry that at some point those funds were going to be
stopped.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051580000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, a
number of people in the film industry have made the point that what
they want is a sustainable industry. It is ludicrous for the hon. Lady
to say that the taxpayer must provide not only the 20 per cent. that
the tax relief now pays, but the rest of the 80 per cent. cost of
producing films too. The film industry is a commercial business like
every other. It is in the interests of the industry that it should be
viable and
commercial.</div>
					<a name="07051580000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
do not accept for a moment&#151;&#151;and I did see the letter in
the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> this morning&#151;&#151;that there will
be a huge impact on investment in research and development companies.
Since the announcement at the beginning of March, we have received just
two specific responses from research and development interests to that
publication of the technical note. We considered both those
representations carefully, and we are confident that the rationale for
the change remains sound. If hon. Members have evidence of actual loss
of bona fide investment not motivated by tax avoidance, I invite them
to submit it and I will look at it with great
interest.</div>
					<a name="07051580000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
more than 90 per cent. of the sideways loss relief claims in the past
couple of years that have not been motivated by avoidance have been
below &#163;25,000, so they will not be affected by the change. I
urge the Committee to reject the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07051580000776"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The Chief Secretary seems deliberately to have
misunderstood what I was saying and failed to read the amendments. We
are not concerned about the scams as the amendments are deliberately
designed to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>allow HMRC to shut down those scams. What we are concerned about are the
genuine, bona fide commercial arrangements that will be shut down by
schedule

should be left in place.</div>

						</b> The very demanding tests set out in the
amendment in the next group would enable HMRC to shut down those
schemes. No matter how ingenious the efforts to use sideways loss
relief for an abusive purpose, there is a way to ensure that the
genuine commercial enterprises are not hit by schedule 4 while at the
same time giving the Government the power to shut down the abusive
schemes.</div>
					<a name="07051580000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to correct the Chief Secretary. I was not saying that the taxpayer
should stump up the extra80 per cent. of film funding. I was
saying that withdrawal of an important way of reducing the risk of
investing would have a significant negative impact on the film
industry. The Chief Secretary also said that he would be willing to
look at evidence that research projects are being damaged. I believe
that I presented such evidence to the Committee and would be only too
happy to provide further details of those projects that are going to
the wall or going overseas as a result of his proposed changes. I would
like to press amendment No. 62 to the

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;103E Meaning of
&#147;qualifying
arrangement&#148;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(1) For the
purposes of this chapter, an arrangement is a qualifying arrangement
if&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) the individual
as a partner in a firm or as member of an LLP carries on a trade which
is conducted on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation
of profits and involves genuine financial risk;
and</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) before the individual
commences carrying on such trade, the Commissioners for Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs have on the application of the
firmor LLP notified the firm or LLP that the Commissioners are
satisfied that the arrangement is being entered into for genuine
commercial reasons and not as part of a scheme or arrangement of which
the sole or main expected benefit is the obtaining of a reduction in
tax liability by means of sideways relief or capital gains
relief.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2) An application
under subsection (1) shall be in writing and shall contain particulars
of the arrangements.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(3) If the
Commissioners for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs consider
that the particulars or any further information provided under
subsection (1) of this subsection are insufficient for the purposes of
this section, they must notify the applicant as to what further
information they require for those purposes within 30 days of receiving
the particulars or
information.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(4) If any such
further information is not provided within30 days from the
notification, or such further time as the Commissioners allow, they
need not proceed further on the
application.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(5) The
Commissioners for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs shall notify
their decision to the applicant within30 days of receiving the
application under subsection (1)(b) or, if they give notice under
subsection (3) above, within 30 days of the notice being complied
with.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(6) If the Commissioners
for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs notify the applicant that
they are not satisfied as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) above or do
not notifytheir decision to the applicant within the time
required by subsection (3) above, the applicant may within 30 days of
the notification of that time require the Commissioners to transmit the
application, together with any notice given and further particulars
furnished under subsection (3) above, to the Special Commissioners; and
in that event any notification by the Special Commissioners shall have
effect for the purposes of subsection (1) above as if it were a
notification by the
Commissioners.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(7) If any
particulars furnished under this section do not fully and accurately
disclose all facts and considerations material for the decision of the
Commissioners for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs or the
Special Commissioners, any resulting notification that the
Commissioners or Special Commissioners are satisfied as mentioned in
subsection (1)(b) above shall be
void.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(8) The Commissioners for
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs may by regulations provide
that any activities of a specified description shall be precluded from
being qualifying arrangements for the purpose of this section, where
specified means specified in the
regulations.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(9) The
regulations under subsection (8) above
may&#151;</div>

having retrospective
effect,</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000808"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I can be very brief on amendmentNo.
64.</div>
					<a name="07051580000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments put
into practice the entirely responsible approach that the Opposition has
taken on sideways loss relief to ensure that the dire consequences
predicted by the Chief Secretary would not happen. The conditions set
out in the amendments would enable abusive schemes to be shut down
while ensuring that genuine commercial enterprise could continue.
Critical to our proposal is that schemes and transactions should
qualify for sideways relief only where the venture involves genuine
financial risk. Tax-motivated schemes generally do not involve that
risk, so this is a key
divider.</div>
					<a name="07051580000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
section 103E would add to the safeguards by providing that an
arrangement would not qualify for sideways relief where the sole or
main expected benefit was the reduction of tax. There is even a further
safeguard in that only HMRC-approved schemes could obtain relief from
the package that the Opposition is putting forward, which gives HMRC
ample scope to crack down on those ingenious avoiders that the Chief
Secretary is so worried about. Proposed subsection (8) would provide
yet more protection in that it would allow HMRC to prohibit the use of
sideways relief in sectors in which there are significant concerns.
Such concerns have arisen in areas such as property development, hotels
and residential care homes, which are not generally associated with the
high-risk sectors that we have been
discussing.</div>
					<a name="07051580000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Lastly,
I come to proposed subsection (9), which I was not sure whether to
include, because it is quite draconian. It would give the Treasury the
power to adopt regulations with retrospective effect to close down
abusive and problematic schemes. Retrospective legislation must always
be approached with extreme care and should be used only when there are
genuinely special circumstances to justify that approach. In this case,
I would use it to give the Chief Secretary the reassurance that he
needs. I regret that the Government do not accept the
Opposition&#146;s entirely cautious and responsible approach, which
would help to save the high-risk enterprises that are, sadly, being put
in jeopardy by the
schedule.</div>
					
					<a name="07051580000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051580000809"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b>
						I certainly agree that what the
hon. Lady proposes is draconian. The amendment would ensure that in
every case in which an individual partner proposed to commence business
in a trading partnership or, indeed, enter into an arrangement in
connection with the business, that partner would have to seek advance
clearance from Revenue and Customs. If HMRC was not satisfied or did
not notify its decision within 30 days, the case would be referred to
the special commissioner.</div>
					<a name="07051580000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would mean that if an
individual partner did not seek advance clearance from HMRC before
starting a partnership, they would never be able to claim sideways loss
relief or capital gains relief for any losses that they made as a
limited partner or non-active partner in that partnership. I simply
cannot believe that
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>the hon. Lady really intends to impose such an enormous bureaucratic
burden on potential investors. It would simply be unworkable.</div>
					<a name="07051580000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also worth considering
who would want to seek a clearance and why. The avoidance arrangements
that are caught by the measure are not entered into accidentally.
People who use a scheme to create a contrived loss will know that a
main purpose of the scheme is to create a loss and gain a tax
advantage. It could certainly be expected that avoiders would, as they
have frequently done, attempt to dress up avoidance schemes as
commercial transactions and would seek clearance through the procedure
that the hon. Lady proposes before investing in a scheme.</div>
					<a name="07051580000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Conversely, a
genuine investor would not anticipate making a loss, or, at least, the
existence of sideways loss relief would not be the decisive factor in
the investment, so they would have no reason to seek pre-transaction
clearance. It is, therefore, clear that a clearance regime would not be
appropriate. It would not provide any benefit to the non-avoiding
population, but would impose disproportionate and unworkable
administrative burdens on them. I hope that with that explanation the
hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment. If not, I ask my hon. Friends to
oppose
it.</div>
