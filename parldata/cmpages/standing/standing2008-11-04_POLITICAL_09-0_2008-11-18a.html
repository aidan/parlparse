Eleanor Laing</b> (Epping Forest) (Con): This morning, we had
considerable argument, discussion and constructive consideration about
what has happened in Northern Ireland. However, I reiterate that we are
discussing not what should happen or has happened in Northern Ireland,
but what lessons are to be learned from Northern Ireland as a pilot for
what might happen throughout the rest of the United Kingdom.</div>
<a name="08111936000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying at the end of the previous sitting, there are significant
differences between the situation in Northern Ireland and that in the
rest of the United Kingdom. For example, in Northern Ireland, the
carry-forward that previously applied was scrapped, which meant that a
number of people fell off the register when they failed to re-register,
as more than one Labour Member pointed out. The temporary reinstatement
of the carry-forward was responsible for some 70,000 people coming back
on to the register. That is an interesting illustration but the fact is
that what we propose in new clause 1 would not abolish the
carry-forward, so that problem would not
occur.</div><a name="08111936000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Northern Ireland, the annual canvass was abolished. The annual canvass,
as we discussed earlier today, is an important tool to get people to
register, and its abolition would have prevented some eligible people
from re-registering. That is another lesson to be learned from what
happened in Northern Ireland. Again, we have no plans to scrap the
annual register. It is very important that there should be an annual
canvass and an annual register of voters. It is one way to encourage
people to vote and give them the opportunity to do
so.</div><a name="08111936000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
the abolition of the household registration system electoral
registration in Northern Ireland was 96.6 per cent. That is
unrealistically high, by its very nature. Hon. Members look puzzled,
but that figure is unrealistically high. It would be miraculous if
proper registration were at that level.</div>
<a name="08111936000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111936000439"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): The hon. Lady
says that the figure is miraculous. The figure for North-West Hampshire
in 2003 was 103 per cent. of the 2001 census, and that for East
Hampshire was 103.1 per cent. Are those miraculous or
perhaps subject to some other
explanation?</div><a name="08111936000024"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000440"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has come
forward with that evidence, which proves my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>point. It is not possible to have 103 per cent. so that truly is
miraculous. I do not see how it can be possible for 103 per cent. of
people to be
registered.</div>
<a name="08111936000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000441"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> If we take the 2001 census and then use the
on-year estimates from that census, in some seats where registration is
consistent because the seats are stable, registration may exceed the
total census figure that was recorded prior to the half-year figures
going forward. In other seats, such as those in Brent, which is about
60 per cent. of the census figure, the opposite is the case. I do not
believe that one is miraculous or that the other is because of feckless
citizens failing to register.</div>
<a name="08111936000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000442"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> What the hon. Gentleman is saying is all over the
place. No one is talking about feckless citizens failing to register. I
do not understand what he is talking about. He referred to 103 per
cent. but 103 per cent. of what? Did he mean 103 per cent. of the
estimate based on the census? That is interesting but fairly
meaningless, and it is not what we are discussing. We should get on
with debating new clause 1. We are discussing what should be the most
important part of the Bill and, quite honestly, Labour Members are
wasting
time.</div><a name="08111936000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fact that electoral registration in Northern Ireland fell by 10 per
cent. on the introduction of individual voter registration is evidence
that the problem of fraudulent over-registration was tackled directly.
That is the whole point. Individual voter registration and the
accompanying personal identifier system worked in Northern Ireland. It
is a good system. It is better and much tighter, and we ought to have
it in the rest of the United Kingdom. It is important that we tackle
over-registration in Great Britain, and that we restore the trust and
integrity that we should observe in the
ballot.</div><a name="08111936000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should also note that, in its report, the Northern Ireland Select
Committee stated that
the</div><a name="08111936000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Electoral
Commission has concluded that the removal of the carry-forward
mechanism is likely to be the most important factor by far in the
decline in the level of voter registration following the introduction
of the 2002
Act.&#148;</div><a name="08111936000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
that shows that the lessons from Northern Ireland are there to be
learnt, not to be copied, and that we should not dwell too much on what
is happening in Northern Ireland. What matters is that the integrity of
the electoral system is the very basis of our freedom under democracy.
That is precious. We are here as elected representatives of the people
to defend the process, and we should value it but it is under threat
because of how registration is carried out. It is not more difficult to
borrow a library book than it is to register to vote. In fact, we have
to prove more to take a book out of a library than we do to cast our
vote and influence who governs the country. Integrity could so easily
be restored by introducing individual voter registration coupled with
personal
identifiers.</div><a name="08111936000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have said on more than one occasion that they intend to
introduce a scheme of individual voter registration. The Minister has
said that he accepts the principle, as have his colleagues. If the
principle had not been accepted, it would not have been suitable for
Northern Ireland. The Government promised to put the principle into
action, but what puzzles me is that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>they have failed to take the opportunity to do so under the Political
Parties and Elections Bill, the perfect vehicle for such a measure.
That is why we put high store by the proposal and why the new clause,
tabled immediately after Second Reading, is about individual voter
registration.</div><a name="08111936000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a report published just last week, the Committee on Standards in Public
Life stated that, although levels of confidence in the electoral system
are reasonably
high,</div><a name="08111936000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;people
are attracted to the greater security and accuracy of individual voter
registration.&#148;</div><a name="08111936000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to explain that it undertook a survey that showed that about
two thirds of respondents&#151;65 per cent.&#151;in the United
Kingdom thought that the electoral registration system in their own
country was very or fairly safe from further abuse, but that only 15
per cent. of respondents felt that the system was very safe while 18
per cent. considered the system
unsafe.</div><a name="08111936000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
we not in the UK in the 21st century have a system that is very safe
and utterly watertight? Of course, we should. Mediocre is simply not
good enough. Nearly two thirds of respondents to the survey expressed
an overall preference for the individual registration system in
Northern Ireland, compared with 30 per cent. who preferred the
household system in Great Britain. There is a 2:1 plebiscite in favour
of an individual rather than a household system of
registration.</div><a name="08111936000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask the Committee to imagine it. If we were giving advice to a newly
emerging democracy on how to set up an electoral system in order to
produce the best democratic results possible, we might say,
&#147;Here you are; get on with it. You set up your
Parliament&#151;it may have one House, it may have two&#151;and you
set up a system of voting.&#148; The hon. Gentleman on my left would
say that the single transferable vote or some other proportionate
system was best, while I would say that first past the post was best.
It would be decided one way or the other. Each system has its merits.
But suppose that we then said, &#147;How about copying the British
system? You have a country full of free, individual people, and in
order to be allowed to vote, each one of them has to go to the head of
their household, who has the duty to fill in a form that gives them the
right to vote or doesn&#146;t.&#148; How utterly ridiculous when it
is looked at like that.</div>
<a name="08111936000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have that
system because it is left over from the Victorian age, when the
paterfamilias did everything. It is left over from an age when only the
men in the household voted. It is left over from an age when we did not
have the technical or practical ability to carry out a canvass of
individuals. It is an affront to the freedom of the individual and it
is totally ridiculous to take away personal power and responsibility.
No wonder lots of young people do not bother to vote or take their
duties seriously. They have to get their mothers or fathers to fill in
the form for them, as though they were children.</div>
<a name="08111936000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">In thinking
about it, I realised that it happened to me when I was living under my
father&#146;s roof and was a parliamentary candidate. I was the
person on the ballot paper. I was the person for whom people could
vote. All right, it was in Paisley, North and only 5,252 of them did
vote for me, but I thought that that was quite a lot at the time. I was
the name on the ballot paper, but before I could cast my vote for
myself, my father had to fill in my name and sign the form as head of
the household. How utterly ridiculous. That is the system that
Ministers are defending. It is simply not right.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div><a name="08111936000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I speak
jocularly about my situation because my father, being an honourable and
responsible district councillor, filled in the form properly, but if I
had tried to be a Labour candidate and not a Conservative one, you can
bet your bottom dollar that my father would not have let me vote.
Whether that is right or wrong&#151; [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;It is wrong.&#148;] Of course it is
wrong.</div>
<a name="08111936000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had better
be careful about using my late and very honourable father as an
example, because he did not do things that were wrong&#151;well, not
that sort of thing, anyway&#151;and he would not have done that, but
under the current system, we give the person who fills in the form the
ability, if not the right, to disfranchise other people who live in
that household. That is indubitably the case. It is not a
right&#151;it would be wrong for a person to fill in the form
wrongly&#151;but we give them the opportunity and ability to
disfranchise other people. It might not happen often in families, but
it might happen in other households in multiple occupation, such as
student or bedsit accommodation or homeless hostels. It is wrong that
one person should have the ability to prevent another from registering
to vote. If we are talking about individual responsibility and
individual duty, each individual must have the ability to register
themselves individually to vote. By not adopting new clause 1, the
Government are saying that they are content with the law of 100 years
ago, under which the head of the household is the person who holds the
power and individuals do not count. That is a disgrace in the 21st
century.</div><a name="08111936000401"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

I jocularly gave the example of myself bowing to the greater political
wisdom of my father, but fortunately I agreed with him, so there was no
difficulty for me, but what if there was a difficulty? What if there
was a difficulty in a culture in which men say that women should not
take part in affairs of the outside world? I know of many households in
and around my constituency and in other parts of our country where
women are expected to undertake the domestic duties and bring up
children. I am not saying that they are necessarily badly treated,
although sometimes that happens, but the men in the household will
frequently say, &#147;Voting is a matter that men undertake; women
don&#146;t need to do that.&#148; That may happen; it may not
happen. In many cultures, that attitude prevails. The point with new
clause 1 is that it should not be possible. By carrying on without
individual voter registration, the Government are potentially allowing
it to
happen.</div><a name="08111936000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111936000445"></a><b class="B">Tony

As she has already pointed out, it is a criminal offence to fail to
register, so it would be in her hands, in respect of the cases that she

that?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000446"></a>Mrs.

that I was not saying that I know of specific cases that I can name. I
have said that I know of cases in which a household is set up in a
certain way. It might be a large house with two families living in it,
in perfectly happy and luxurious conditions, but the men, according to
the particular cultural background that they pursue&#151;it is
entirely a matter of their free will for them to do that; I am not
complaining about it for a moment&#151;take part in the outside world
and the women do not even speak English and stay at home, look after
the children and undertake domestic duties. There is nothing wrong with
that. I am not criticising. Every family and every person can choose to
live the way they want to, but I am saying that keeping the current
system of household registration instead of individual registration
makes it possible for the head of the household, however right or
wrong, not to put down other people on the form. I am not saying that
that is being done vexatiously or even intentionally; I am saying that
it can happen and we should stop it
happening.</div><a name="08111936000043"></a>

the hon. Lady&#146;s family history, but I hope that she realises
that under provisions that the Government introduced in 2001, what she
describes need not be the case. Any voter can apply for an individual
registration form, even if they have been left off the household form,
so the hon. Lady need not have been excluded if her father had taken
the route that was

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000448"></a>Mrs.

us back again to the fact that the Government have accepted in
principle that individual registration, by individual voters, is the
right way forward. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I thank the Minister for
confirming that. I do not want to go down other illustrative
routes&#151;I intended to make a small point and I have given away on
too many occasions. I do not want to take up the Committee&#146;s
time. I am merely illustrating that things can go wrong under the
current system which would not do so under a system of individual voter
registration.</div><a name="08111936000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not the only person who thinks that; almost every organisation
concerned with such matters agrees. The chair of the Electoral
Commission, Sam Younger,
said:</div><a name="08111936000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Registration

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000450"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Indeed I can. First, the part of the Joseph
Rowntree report quoted by the Minister is just as bad if not worse than
the part that I quoted. It means that we must do even more to tighten
postal voting. There are some very questionable election results from
the last general election, and since then, postal votes have been
unreliable. The fact that the Government have done little to tighten
postal voting is even worse. My understanding is that there have been
43 cases of electoral fraud over the past few years. That means that
only one electoral district in England did not have a case of electoral
fraud to look at. There are far too many.</div>
<a name="08111936000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000451"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It is amazing that the Minister asked my hon.
Friend how many incidents of fraud have taken place in this country.
Perhaps he should be telling the Committee that. The figure of 43,
mentioned by my hon. Friend, referred to cases taken to court, not
cases notified to the authorities. The latter was, I think,
10 times that amount, not including the evidence given to
this very Committee by one of the learned professors, who said that
there had been under-reporting and that the true figures were not
known. Why is that the case?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div><a name="08111936000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000452"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> My hon. Friend is right. In the intervening moment
I have found my note on this. I was correct: in the past seven years
there have been 42 convictions&#151;not just cases brought&#151;for
electoral fraud. Only one of the 43 police authorities&#151;I
apologise, Sir Nicholas, a moment ago I said electoral registration
authorities, but I meant police authorities in England and
Wales&#151;has had no case to investigate at
all.</div>
<a name="08111936000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000453"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I just want to clarify something. When I was asking
the hon. Lady to enlighten the Committee, it was not because I did not
know the figures. I am very well aware of them and, in due course, with
your indulgence, Sir Nicholas, I shall reveal them to the Committee at
great length. The hon. Lady was making a hyperbolic speech about the
extent of all this and I just wanted to be clear that she knew what the
actual figures are. We have some idea of that, but I shall reveal more
in due course.</div>
<a name="08111936000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000454"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before the hon. Member for Epping Forest
continues her speech, may I say that I have been somewhat upset by the
Minister&#146;s response. He indicated that he is going to talk at
length. I had hoped that he would give us the information
succinctly.</div>
<a name="08111936000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000455"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. We look forward to the
Minister telling us, at length, why this is relevant. Perhaps we are
interpreting this rather differently, but I think that to have 42
convictions for electoral fraud over the past seven years is a high
figure and not one that we ought to be proud of in Britain in the
21st century. We should not have any electoral fraud; it is
bad enough that we can have electoral mistakes and that the occasional
thing goes wrong, but to have 42 convictions for electoral
fraud puts the integrity of the ballot in
question.</div>
<a name="08111936000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111936000456"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): Is this not another case of the
hon. Lady asking for something that we have already got? Just as she
asked for individual registration, which is already available to
people, it is generally agreed that the great majority of problems with
fraud centre on postal votes. However, in the postal votes system that
we have introduced, we already have signatures. In order to get a
postal vote, one has to produce two signatures&#151;one on the
application form and another on the declaration. Surely the security
that she is looking for is already there.</div>
<a name="08111936000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000457"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> The hon. Gentleman completely misses the point. Of
course what he says is correct for postal votes, but it does not apply
to votes in the polling station. It is more difficult to take a book
out of the library than it is to go into the room next to the library
and cast one&#146;s vote.</div>
<a name="08111936000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000458"></a>Martin

cast at the voting station?</div>
<a name="08111936000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000459"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I do not understand what the hon. Gentleman is hung
up about here. Postal votes are different from those at the polling
station. While we are on the subject of postal votes, let me say that
there have been many instances that prove the inadequacy of the system
for verifying signatures. Our postal voting system 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>calls into question the integrity of the ballot, which is all I care
about. I do not care what the Minister uses. I do not mind if it is not
national insurance numbers but something else&#151;as long as it is
not identity cards. If the Minister says not to use signatures, but
thumb prints, I say let us consider it. It is the integrity of the
ballot with which I am concerned, and not the
process.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000460"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way, and
I hope that she will not give me many more occasions when I feel that I
have to intervene. I must correct something she said. She suggested
that we on the Government Benches are proud of what happened. Of course
we are not proud. No one can be complacent about a single instance. One
instance is too many, and we agree on that. All that I have been
seeking to achieve is that she try to put the matter in
proportion.</div><a name="08111936000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000461"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I accept what the Minister says. Putting it in
proportion by my reckoning means that 42 convictions for electoral
fraud is 42 convictions too many. We should not have electoral fraud.
It is so easy to commit electoral
fraud.</div><a name="08111936000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111936000462"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000463"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Yes. As ever, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. I
am beginning to worry about the Government&#146;s motive for not
introducing individual voter registration. The Bill is perfect for such
a measure and everyone is calling for it, even Labour Back Benchers.
Some have even been brave enough to sign the early-day motion along
with the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon). Some 27 Labour
Members had the audacity to stand up to their Government and sign that
early-day motion. I am sure that many more would like to sign it and
support the proposal, because there are no arguments against
it.</div><a name="08111936000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire said
earlier about the reduction in the number of people registered in
Northern Ireland is not an argument against bringing in individual
voter registration. It is not an argument against saying that the
individual is a free person and should have the right to register
themselves to vote on every occasion&#151;not just when they do it
separately, because that takes a huge amount of
effort.</div><a name="08111936000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was mentioned a few moments ago that people can already register
individually, but they would have to take the trouble to do that,
knowing that for some reason they were not registered by the household
by which they ought to be registered. That goes completely against what
every member of the Committee and every Member of the House is saying
about making it easier for people to register and to
vote.</div><a name="08111936000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to encourage people to vote and to widen the franchise, not narrow
it. That is what individual voter registration is all about. What are
Labour Members afraid of? Are they afraid that some people in some
marginal constituencies held by their colleagues will not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div>register to vote, which will mean fewer votes for the Labour party? Is
that what they are afraid of? If not, they must be afraid of something.
There is no argument against individual voter
registration.</div><a name="08111936000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000464"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> As a Member who represents a very marginal
constituency, I am afraid that non-registration will get even worse, as
it did in Northern Ireland. Already in inner London, 18 per cent. are
non-registered. Some 27 per cent. of private tenants are
non-registered, and 37 per cent. of black Africans. In inner-London
seats, there is huge non-registration. Even if the experience in
Northern Ireland is replicated only partly as a result of an immediate
blanket move to individual registration, there will be an even greater
problem with under-registration in seats such as
mine.</div><a name="08111936000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000465"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> So, it is about party political advantage. The hon.
Gentleman is talking about inner-London seats, but almost every
inner-London seat is held by the Labour
party.</div>

<a name="08111936000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000467"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I am not worried about Kensington and
Chelsea&#151;I said almost every seat. The hon. Gentleman is talking
about an inner-London problem, but why do not people in inner-London
seats register? I shall give way to him if he cares to answer
that.</div><a name="08111936000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000468"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Well, since I have been asked to intervene again,
I think that the clue is in the categories in which under-registration
is highest: 47 per cent. of people who share flats, 38 per cent. of
people who live in unfurnished accommodation and 37 per cent. of black
Africans. Those are the very categories of people who are least engaged
in the political system. Those figures apply, regardless of party, to
all seats in which there is a mobile population and where there are
large proportions of people on low incomes or who live in tenanted
properties.</div><a name="08111936000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000469"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes my point far better than
anyone else has all day. As he has just said most eloquently, the
people in inner-London seats who do not register are those in shared
flats, in rented accommodation and who are part of the mobile
population. Those are the very people who depend on a head of household
to register them. They live temporarily in shared flats and rented
accommodation and do not register themselves. They do not register
because they have to depend on someone else to register them&#151;
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="08111936000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman makes my point perfectly, so I shall not give way to him
again. This is exactly the point: if people should have the right to
vote and to take part in the democratic system, they should have the
right, the duty and the responsibility to register themselves. What he
said a moment ago answers my question perfectly, and in the
inner-London seats it is exactly the reason why people do not
register.</div>
<a name="08111936000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
reason why people do not register might be that they are not engaged in
the political system, but that is up to them. Every individual has the
right not to be engaged in the political system if they do not want to
be. The reason why the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are so afraid
of this fair system of registration is that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>they think it might reduce the Labour party vote. That can be the only
reason why they are against individual voter
registration.</div><a name="08111936000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000470"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On this point, hon. Members will want to study
what happened in America recently with Obama&#146;s campaign. He went
to areas in which there was low registration and gave people a reason
to register&#151;some for the first time. The hon. Member for
Battersea and other hon. Members could do that in their constituencies,
but that is a separate issue from the need for individual voter
registration.</div><a name="08111936000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000471"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> That is absolutely right. It was striking to hear
people say in interviews for the American elections that they had never
voted before. It is incumbent on us all to encourage people to register
and to vote. A few weeks ago, I did an interview with a female
journalist on this subject. A person in the audience said something
about encouraging people to vote, and the journalist asked me,
&#147;Don&#146;t you think it should be up to MPs to try to get
people to vote?&#148; I realised that she had not a clue what she was
talking about because what do we all do, all the time, but try to get
people to vote? We encourage them to vote first and foremost for us, or
for whichever candidate we support, but my goodness, as a body of
people we go out there&#151;week after week, month after
month&#151;to encourage people to become involved in the democratic
process.</div><a name="08111936000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000472"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> My hon. Friend may not be aware of my evidence to
the Committee on Standards in Public Life. I suggested that it was our
job to get the vote out, not that of some other institution. That is
why I felt that that part of the Electoral Commission&#146;s budget
should be cut back and its role altered. The Government have accepted
the principle, and the Electoral Commission is being remodelled to take
account of exactly that point that I made to the Committee on Standards
in Public Life. The committee&#146;s report set out why it agreed. In
other words, it is our primary duty to interest people in politics. We
should not be relying on other institutions. We should certainly not be
relying on wheezes, such as maintaining completely out of date 19th
century registration
systems.</div><a name="08111936000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000473"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> My hon. Friend is correct. I shall move on, because
we are also considering new clauses 7 and
8.</div><a name="08111936000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111936000474"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): Has my hon. Friend
heard the explanation that the problem in Northern Ireland results more
from the number of voters exceeding the number of people resident in
the
constituencies?</div><a name="08111936000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000475"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Yes. Again, my hon. Friend makes a valid point of
which the Committee should take
note.</div><a name="08111936000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall move on, because I am conscious of the time and we have a lot to
get through. However, I am not sorry for taking time over this group of
amendments, because new clause 1 should have been the most important
measure in the Bill. It still should be the most important, but I fear
that the indications from the Minister are that the Government will not
accept it, which is a great pity.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div><a name="08111936000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 7
concerns opting in to the edited register. I merely propose it because,
as we said when discussing the keeping together of so much information
in the register, registers are used by many commercial organisations.
Rather than giving people the right to opt out of the edited register,
which then goes to mail order companies, charities and other such
organisations, it would be more sensible to give people the right to
opt in, if they so
wished.</div><a name="08111936000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should also consider, although not in the context of the Bill, the very
principle of the electoral register being sold for commercial purposes.
That is an argument for another day, and I do not propose to go down
that route
today.</div><a name="08111936000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 8 concerns personal identifiers at the ballot box. It is
incredible that a person can walk into a polling station, say,
&#147;I am John Smith and I live at 40 Acacia
avenue&#148;, and be handed a ballot to vote. They do not have to
prove who they are or where they live; they do not have to prove
anything at all. Most people think that they need their polling card.
How often on polling day have we all encountered people and encouraged
them to vote, but they say, &#147;Oh, but I can&#146;t find my
polling card.&#148; We have to explain to them, &#147;Madam, you do
not need your polling card. Just go down to such and such a village
hall, which is where this street votes, say who you are and
vote.&#148;? It is incredible that it is easier to vote than to take
out a library
book.</div><a name="08111936000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no doubt that the system needs to be tightened up. The most ironic
thing here is that it would be relatively easy to do. It has been done
in Northern Ireland. For more than three years, the Government have
been saying that they intend to do it, but they have not made proposals
for individual voter registration, personal identifiers or any system
that would take us forward to prevent fraud in the electoral system.
That puts the integrity of the ballot itself in
question.</div><a name="08111936000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we were to have an election where, unlike any election in recent times,
the majority in the House was small and some constituencies were
decided on majorities of well under 1,000, as many were during the last
general election, the integrity of our democratic system and of a
future Government could be brought into question. That is unnecessary.
If the Government introduced the safeguards that I suggest in new
clauses 1 and 2, the system could be massively
improved.</div><a name="08111936000403"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="08111936000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111936000476"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I will not take up as much of
the Committee&#146;s time as the hon. Lady, but I am glad that she
moved amendments (a), (b) and (c). Apart from the problems identified
by the Electoral Commission with the original drafting of new clause 1,
there is also the problem that it appeared to bar all gap year students
from the electoral register for at least three months. Given the hon.
Lady&#146;s strictures this morning about the importance of ensuring
that students can get on to the electoral register, it would have been
odd if she had proposed something that operated entirely in the
opposite direction only a few hours
later.</div><a name="08111936000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am somewhat disappointed, however, by the interventions from the
Government Benches on the question of individual registration. It seems
clear that there is a serious problem with the accuracy of the
electoral register, a problem that threatens the legitimacy 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>of the entire electoral system. What Richard Mawrey, the election
commissioner, said in the Slough case&#151;not the Aston
case&#151;is important. He said that electoral fraud
was</div><a name="08111936000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;childishly
simple to commit and very difficult to detect&#148;.</div>
<a name="08111936000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The particular fraud
that he was referring to in the Slough case was what the Australians
call roll-stuffing: increasing the electoral register by inserting
people who do not exist. There is a clear case for reform.</div>
<a name="08111936000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The arguments
on the other side are not arguments against reform; they are arguments
for doing reform carefully, in a properly considered way. For example,
the arguments from Northern Ireland about how much the register went
down and came back says that one can go too far in reforming and throw
off the register people who are entitled to be there, but that is not
an argument against the proper effect of reform, which was to throw off
the register people who did not exist in the first place and should not
have been
there.</div><a name="08111936000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
this point, I part company to some degree with the hon. Lady. When the
reform is introduced, as I am sure it will be, it needs to be
accompanied by a Government-led, state-organised campaign to get the
right people on the electoral register. It is not enough to say that
individual Members of Parliament or politicians in general should take
on that task; it must be the state&#146;s role to get the register
right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000477"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I agree entirely. I said that this morning, but it
might have been at a time when I was going on a
bit.</div><a name="08111936000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000478"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I hope that I will be forgiven for having
forgotten, because it was so long ago.</div>
<a name="08111936000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">My interest
in the matter, as I said this morning, comes from being in a university
seat. Among the households that organise electoral registration are
Cambridge colleges. They count as the head of the household and put
everybody on the register. If we changed to individual registration, we
would need some way to ensure that individual students were on the
register. That would not be too difficult to organise&#151;students
have to sign up for lots of things at the start of term, and they could
sign up for that as well&#151;but we would need to ensure that it was
carefully considered.</div>
<a name="08111936000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that we are also discussing new clause 2. The hon. Lady did not say
much about new clause 2, but its effect appears to be the opposite of
new clause 1. New clause 2 seems to say that if one is an overseas
elector and one does not have a passport, one does not have to present
one&#146;s passport number&#151;it is enough to claim to have a
passport. That seems to be the exact opposite of what the hon. Lady is
trying to do with new clause 1. It seems that it is okay to stuff the
roll with people who live abroad, but not with people who live in the
UK.</div>
<a name="08111936000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000479"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I ought to clarify that point. I skipped over new
clause 2 to try to save time, because I had given way so many times
over new clause 1. I realised that was the only time that other Members
would have a chance to participate in the debate.</div>
<a name="08111936000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
new clause 2 is simply to find a personal identifier for overseas
voters and a passport number seems to be a perfectly sensible
one.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div><a name="08111936000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000480"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I accept that a passport number is a sensible
identifier, but the substitute, which is simply a declaration that one
has lost one&#146;s passport, does not seem to be adequate at
all.</div>
<a name="08111936000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the rather disappointing arguments from the Government Benches about
why we should not go to individual registration quite yet. There is a
kind of Augustinian aspect to this&#151;we all accept that it is a
good idea, but we do not want to be made virtuous right now.</div>
<a name="08111936000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Battersea raised an argument about postal votes, saying that
they are the real problem and that if one looks at the cases one can
see that there is a serious problem. He said that there is not a
problem&#151;at least as far as we know&#151;with personation,
where people turn up at the polling station, pretending to be somebody
else. There is some truth in that, but individual registration would
make postal vote fraud more difficult because planning the fraud would
take longer. At the moment, all one has to do is to decide to commit
the fraud at the moment when one is trying to generate fake postal
votes. That is the point at which one would generate the fake
signature.</div>
<a name="08111936000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, to
commit the same postal vote fraud when the signature is on the register
and each individual has signed the register to make sure that they are
individually identifiable, makes the whole thing more difficult because
it has to be planned further in advance. That does not make the system
foolproof, and I fully accept that individual registration would not
make the system foolproof. It does not seem to be a significant
condition for increasing the security of the register to first-class
levels, but it would make it better. In the end, what would make the
system even better than simply a legislative change comes down to
resources, which I touched on earlier when I talked about the need for
a campaign of registration. One of the problems at present is that
electoral officials do not have the resources to check signatures
properly on postal votes&#151;they are simply overwhelmed by the
numbers.</div>
<a name="08111936000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000481"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that
there is a problem with resources, although whether the service is
better or worse depends on which part of the country one is in. It is
also a question of the checking systems&#151;the machines that help
with the checking are apparently not up to scratch in many cases
either.</div>
<a name="08111936000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000482"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I gathered the same thing as the hon. Gentleman,
but it is a matter of resources in terms either of people, or of the
equipment needed to make the system work properly, and we cannot do
without that. It is therefore not right to say that simply passing a
law to introduce individual registration would solve the
problem&#151;it would not. More would be needed, such as the
investment of resources and a real commitment by the authorities to
make the system work. Nevertheless, I am still convinced that the
individual registration route is an important step
forward.</div>
<a name="08111936000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000483"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I have been reflecting on the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals for a state-run campaign. Can he
clarify whether that state-run campaign is the Electoral Commission,
which enables a transition from the current 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>system to individual registration to be conducted without people falling
off the register, or is he primarily talking about a campaign with a
substantial increase in public expenditure that will take place every
year to achieve higher
registration?</div><a name="08111936000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000484"></a>David
Howarth:</b> There is definitely a need for a transitional
campaign. The question is where to go after that. Having been a local
councillor and seen how much money is devoted to ensuring that the
register is up to date in particular authorities, I think that there
might be a need for some permanent increase as well. My main point
remains that even though we will not attain perfection by introducing
individual registration, it will be an improvement. I support new
clause 1 as amended by amendments (a), (b) and (c).</div>
<a name="08111936000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
support new clause 8 in its present form. The problem with new clause
8, with its list of personal identifiers, is that it is too inflexible.
It does not allow for different circumstances in different parts of the
country. The hon. Member for Epping Forest spent a lot of time talking
about library cards, but I notice that library cards are not on the
list. I have a British Library card. It has my signature on the back
and a photograph on the front, and it seems a perfectly adequate
identifier. New clause 8 is imperfect, and I urge the hon. Lady not to
press it.</div>
<a name="08111936000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000485"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the principle of
personal
identifiers?</div><a name="08111936000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000486"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Yes. I agree with what the hon. Lady said. It has
always struck me as rather extraordinary that in the UK one can vote
without any personal identifier at all, but there needs to be
flexibility in how the system of identifiers works. What will count as
an adequate identifier in some parts of the country will not exist in
others. In my constituency, library and university cards would be good
things to use.</div>
<a name="08111936000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
new clause 2, which goes in exactly the opposite direction to new
clause 1. On new clause 7 and the edited register, I agree with what
the hon. Lady said, but it does not seem to go far enough. I do not see
why the electoral register should be used for any commercial purpose at
all. It should be used only for electoral and political purposes. We
should make that absolutely clear and try to get away from the
situation in which the electoral register has become a tool for
advertising and commercial
organisations.</div><a name="08111936000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000487"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the next speaker, may I make an
appeal for brief speeches? We have a tremendous amount of ground still
to cover. I know that the usual channels want to break at a reasonable
time this evening, and I hope that all the important parts of the Bill
can receive proper debate and scrutiny in the
Committee.</div><a name="08111936000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000488"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I rise to make three points. First, we should
be concerned about two things: the integrity of the register and the
validity of the ballot. If the ballot loses its value and its resonance
with people, confidence in the whole system will be undermined and the
outcome, as the hon. Member for Epping Forest said, could eventually be
called into question. The integrity and value of the ballot are
important.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div><a name="08111936000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
fact that someone can cast a ballot is important. That is why the
integrity of the register is essential. It is not just that people who
should be on the register are on it and people who should not be on it
are not; there should be access to the register in the first place. It
is an important part of our duty to ensure as nearly as we can that
people can cast their ballots and that as many people are registered to
vote as possible.</div>
<a name="08111936000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that it is reasonable in those circumstances to say simply,
&#147;Well, if people really want to register, they will.&#148; We
know from evidence gathered over quite a period that for various
reasons, cast it how we will, there are enormous variations in the
extent to which people living in a particular area of the country are
able to cast their ballots. I mentioned earlier that registration
figures in Hampshire in 2003 were 103 per cent. of the census. That is
what one would expect from a registration system that works properly.
The people on the census get to register, and more people register as
they move into the area over the years. Within two or three years of
the census, the number of people on the register will be in excess of
the number recorded as resident in the area when the census was taken.
That means that the system is working well. We should realise that the
electoral registration offices in the area are working well, and we
should reflect on the nature of the population living
there.</div>
<a name="08111936000404"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="08111936000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some parts of the country, over the same period, the electoral register
collapsed by more than 20 per cent. I do not mean in relation to the
census, but the electoral register itself. In 2003, almost 20 per cent.
fewer electors were on the electoral register in Brentford and
Isleworth than in 2001. In central Edinburgh, there were 10,000 fewer
people on the register in 2003 than in 2001, and in Bradford, West,
7,000 fewer. Those changes related to, among other things, differing
practices in electoral registration at local level. On a wider basis,
if we look at the 2001 census figures for various parts of the country,
as well as at electoral registration numbers, we see a different
picture to that in north Hampshire. The registration figure for Brent
in 2001 was 70 per cent. of the 2001 census figure, whereas for
Hammersmith and Fulham, and for Brentford, it was 76 per cent. There is
enormous variation in who is getting to vote.</div>
<a name="08111936000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">My plea is
not that we should not have individual registration, because that is
very important, in the short, medium and long term, to ensure that the
ballot is validated&#151;the use of individual identifiers is an
important aspect of validating the ballot. However, validating the
ballot is about not just one issue, but a whole range of issues that
ensure integrity in our electoral system. In some parts of the country,
the system fails to deliver huge numbers of people on the electoral
register, thereby denying them a vote. Under the current system, when
we periodically divide our electoral boundaries, through the boundary
commissions, the numbers of electors per constituency are taken into
account. Over a period of time, not only will some people be denied the
right to vote, but whole areas of the country will end up with lower
levels of representation than they might otherwise have had, because of
the way that the electoral system has
worked.</div><a name="08111936000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a dual responsibility. First, we must ensure that the ballot has
integrity. Our electoral system is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div>relatively clean, but even one case of fraud in a relatively clean
system is too many. We must have a system that is as fraud-proof as
possible.</div><a name="08111936000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000489"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> My hon. Friend makes some important points, because
there are two ways of getting the system wrong, one of which is when
people fraudulently want more than their one vote. It is equally fraud
of the electoral system when people cannot vote because they are not
registered. In an earlier speech, it was said that information about
that complaint was relatively light, but will my hon. Friend hazard a
guess as to which is currently the dominant feature in modern
Britain&#151;fraud or
under-registration?</div><a name="08111936000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000490"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I hope that I am making the case that those
elements are interlinked in a complete electoral system. I think that
all hon. Members present agree that there is not widespread fraud in
the British electoral system. We have a relatively clean electoral
system. However, some aspects of our electoral system have always been
as they are and always will be. For example, if one wished to be
sufficiently corrupt, one could, to some extent, in principle, match up
who has balloted and which way they have voted. Even with individual
registration, it would not be possible to clean the system completely
of fraudulent
entrants.</div><a name="08111936000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000491"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that expert
after expert, and report after report, have said that fraud is a
significant problem in the UK? Is it not therefore the first issue to
be dealt
with?</div><a name="08111936000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000492"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> With respect, the expert evidence that has been
given to the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs, of which I am
a member, and to this Committee has been that there are cases of fraud,
particularly postal vote fraud, but that they are not an enormous
proportion of the total system. Compared with a number of other
systems, fraud is a relatively small element of our system. That is
different from saying that the British electoral system itself is proof
against fraudulent entry. There are two separate questions to be
addressed. First, are people fraudulently entering or misusing the
ballot on a widespread basis? Secondly, does the construction of our
ballot system mean a low possibility of fraudulent entry, whether or
not it is taking place? Fraudulent entry is possible now and could
remain so in a future
system.</div><a name="08111936000405"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.37

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000494"></a>Martin

2004.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div><a name="08111936000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000495"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for those statistics,
because they underline that while one is too many&#151;we must make
our system as fraud-proof as possible&#151;the overall incidence
appears not to be enormous compared with a number of countries in the
world. That does not mean we should do nothing about
it.</div><a name="08111936000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
a valid electoral system is, one might say, a three-legged stool: those
entitled to vote should be able to vote; those who vote should be able
to do so freely, anonymously and without threat; and those who vote
should not feel that their vote has been devalued by casting their vote
alongside those who are not entitled to vote. If we ignore any one of
those three legs, the system will not work. That is why moving to
individual voter registration and to individual signifiers has to take
place alongside measures to ensure that the register itself is as good
as we can make it. That should include, as has been undertaken with
some other legislatures, voters whom we know as reliable entrants to
the register being placed on automatically&#151;perhaps sixth-formers
at college, rising-18 voters, or those known to have proper
data-protection safeguards, having identified themselves to public
bodies in various ways. In addition to having reliable canvassing
methods across the country rather than the huge variation in the
quality of register compilation in different parts of the country, we
should look at measures for strengthening the
register.</div><a name="08111936000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady asked what the argument was against individual registration.
There is not, and should not be, an argument against individual
registration. The question is how complete we wish to make our
electoral system. I am in favour of making it a complete system with
those three legs of the stool thereby verifying it. We have to move
towards individual registration with that understanding. That is how,
overall, we shall give our system integrity for the
century.</div><a name="08111936000135"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000496"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am sorry that I missed a couple of minutes of the
hon. Member for Southampton, Test, but I listened attentively to what
he had to say before the Divisions. He was right on the button in terms
of identifying the key issues. He and I worked together for a long time
on a Select Committee, and we also worked on the informal consultative
group for the Electoral Commission. We know each other&#146;s views
and there is a good degree of agreement between us. I agree that the
integrity of the register is important, but I differ slightly from him
in one regard.</div>
<a name="08111936000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made
this point repeatedly in different ways and it goes to the heart of a
question that was asked by an hon. Gentleman who is no longer in his
place&#151;it is a pity that the Divisions have broken up the
discussion as we had come to a very important point. The question was
whether under-registration or fraud posed the bigger problem. However,
I do not think that that is the crucial matter. The crucial question
is, what is the public perception of the bigger problem? The
essential&#151;the necessary&#151;condition for any electoral
system, is that it should secure consent. Broadly speaking, after
people have been upset about this, that and the other and have had a go
at all and sundry, they finally get the chance to vote and&#151;win
or lose&#151;they accept the result. That situation is not achieved
lightly but is easily destroyed.</div>
<a name="08111936000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have seen
many countries with apparently perfect and sophisticated constitutions
that have failed over time to find a means through which to establish a
level 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>of consent, regardless of how many rough edges still exist in the
electoral and voting systems. In Britain, we had a system that secured
a very high level of consent. The tragedy is that some of that consent
has been eroded because of the perception of fraud, even if the level
of fraud is lower than the perception of it. That is why it is crucial
to push through a measure such as new clause 1.</div>
<a name="08111936000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
point in thinking through clever wheezes to improve the situation such
as electronic voting or publicity campaigns. I am not against a
transition publicity campaign but I am nervous about having only a
campaign that might sit there in perpetuity and create its own
constituency, as Weber tells us that all bureaucracies do. The
Electoral Commission has threatened to do just that unless it is
reformed as a consequence of the investigation by the Committee on
Standards in Public Life. We must keep focused on the basic point of
securing consent. The perception is as important as the
reality.</div>
<a name="08111936000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
discuss a number of aspects to new clause 1 that have been touched on
by others. Before I do so, there is a relationship between this point
and that which I raised earlier concerning service voter registration;
I promise not to dwell on it long, Sir Nicholas. If we introduce
individual voter registration, we must think about how it will affect
voters in the services. They have already been badly affected by one
reform, and we do not want them to be affected by another. Has any
preliminary preparatory work been done on that subject? Have we
examined the effect that the introduction of individual registration
and voter ID might have on the arrangements that are currently in place
to try and secure higher levels of service voter registration? Have the
services been consulted?</div>
<a name="08111936000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask those
questions because, inadvertently, I did not give the accurate figures
for the fall in service voter registration as a consequence of PPERA. I
suggested that they had roughly halved but perhaps I can quickly give
more accurate figures. In 2000, there were 483 service
voters registered in Chichester, in my constituency. Two years after
PPERA, there were 22. That gives an idea of the scale of the fall.
Service voter registers are kept in Scotland, but are not kept
separately for England and Wales. In Scotland in 2000, there were
18,226 such voters on the register. By 2004&#151;the big drop was in
2003&#151;that figure of almost 18,500 had dropped to 2,100, which
gives an idea of the scale of what has happened. I cannot impress on
the Committee too strongly how important it is that we think through
carefully the changes for groups such as service voters, but that is
not an argument for delaying the introduction of individual
registration along the lines set out in new clause 1.</div>
<a name="08111936000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
while putting the new clause into context. When the Government came to
power, they were full of bright ideas for polishing up the
constitution. Some worked and some did not: rolling registration has
broadly worked, but postal voting on demand fell flat. In fact, it has
been an absolute disaster. It led to the warehousing of votes and ended
up with the notorious Birmingham court case. One of the key quotations
from that case, which has already been given, was that it resulted in
practices
that</div><a name="08111936000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
disgrace a banana republic.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div><a name="08111936000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had always assumed
that that quote was &#147;would not disgrace a banana

but</div><a name="08111952000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would

<a name="08111936000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">is actually rather
worse, so the judge was clearly in a firm frame of mind when he wrote
his
judgment.</div><a name="08111936000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
we go any further in working out how to address all this through the
new clause, it is worth asking this: before the Government introduced
postal voting on demand, just how big was the problem that three or
four Labour Members have alluded to? The most detailed recent
investigation of non-registration was by the Office for National
Statistics, which did work on behalf of the Electoral Commission.
Overall, it gave 8 to 9 per cent. as the best estimate for
non-registration in England and Wales in 2000. That sounds quite a lot
and it is not ideal, but it is worth bearing it in mind that that
compares to an estimate of 7 to 9 per cent. in 1991, so it does not
seem that there has been much change. There has been no sharp
decline.</div>
<a name="08111936000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
interesting to note that in two surveys, in 1981 and 1991, some 19 per
cent. of those who were then unregistered to vote said that they did
not wish to vote or that they could not be bothered, which is the point
that my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest was making. By
contrast, in 2004-05, a poll conducted by MORI showed that 14 per cent.
said they were not interested in voting.</div>
<a name="08111936000407"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="08111936000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should add that the figures I have just quoted are not entirely
comparable. The Electoral Commission has done its best to make them
comparable, and those who are interested can look at its September 2005
report, pages 43 and 44. I only say that because there would be no
point in the Minister coming back to me with detailed, technical points
about the construction of that survey. The commission has concluded
that the figures are broadly but not exactly comparable in the way in
which the questions were asked.</div>
<a name="08111936000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
the assessment that we are still in the range of 8 to 9 per cent., I
still think that there is a problem, and it is a problem that exists in
particular constituencies more than others. I agree with the general
point that has been made by Labour Members, but it is not an alibi for
delaying the introduction of individual registration and voter
identification.</div>
<a name="08111936000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Electoral Administration Act 2006, the Government tried what I still
consider was probably a stalling measure. I did not oppose it at the
time, but it was not ever likely to deal with the problem. I am
referring to the creation of the new offence of falsely applying for a
postal vote. It was in the wake of the Birmingham case. I am not a
lawyer, but I could not see the point of it. Falsely filling in a
postal vote application form was already illegal, even before the Act.
Those engaged in the warehousing in Birmingham already knew that such
action was illegal. The whole response of the Government to that issue
had the smell of display purposes only legislation, the sort of
legislation that we have had too much of recently. However, I do not
exempt my own party from such action when it was in government. The
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 is perhaps the most salient example of the
phenomenon.</div><a name="08111936000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
a measure was not an adequate response. We are now several years
further down the line and we still have not got to the starting post
for individual registration. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>I do not know whether what I am about to say is correct, but a colleague
told me that only one country has household voter registration.
Officials might be able to supply me with a long list of such
countries. I would be delighted if the Minister could supply additional
names. I was told that the only country was Zimbabwe, but that country
is not a good
precedent.</div><a name="08111936000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

combination of household registration and postal voting on demand, we
should not keep it because of concern about some other issue. One

Friend the Member for Epping Forest quoted the Council of Europe. I
will not repeat her quotation about the United Kingdom being open to
fraud and the system being childishly simple to fiddle, but it was
worth pointing out. Those quotations can be found on page 12
of the House of Commons Library brief on postal briefing and
electoral fraud. I implore members of the Committee to read the rest of
what was said, which is set out over the page, and note who said such
things. Politicians from Poland, Germany and other countries throughout
Europe strongly recommended that we do not tarry with such matters but
get on with changing the system in the manner that we are proposing
under new clause 1 without
delay.</div><a name="08111936000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
those politicians were so concerned about such matters that they
considered threatening us, as they might a hopeless banana republic.

these outstanding vulnerabilities during periodic monitoring reports on

overall democratic nature of British elections, a full monitoring
procedure should again be
considered.&#148;</div><a name="08111936000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">For

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000497"></a>Martin
Linton:</b><b class="B"> </b>Most European countries do not have
electoral registers or annual canvasses for the simple reason that they
have ID cards. There is no reason to draw up a separate register of
voters every year because they already have a register of the
population. One point that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the
Member for Epping Forest have not made is that Northern Ireland has
electoral ID cards, which is the most effective security device. The
logic of his argument, therefore, points to the fact that the most
effective way in which to register voters is through an ID-card
system.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div><a name="08111936000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000498"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I found that a deeply concerning intervention. No
one else who has looked at this matter has arrived at that conclusion.
I am talking about people who devote their professional lives to
considering this and no other issue. It also seems to confirm what I
fear, which is that the Labour party will cling to any counsel of
delay. As everybody knows, ID cards are something for the very
indefinite future, even if Labour were to win the next election.
Frankly, the matter is probably for the birds because the cost would be
so prohibitive, and the cost-benefit analysis simply does not stack
up.</div><a name="08111936000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000499"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> For clarity, I was not suggesting that progress on
the road towards individual registration should be held up on account
of the fact that Parliament may in future decide to adopt ID cards. I
was merely saying that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s international
comparisons are beside the point. He is comparing us with countries
that do not need to have electoral registers or annual
canvasses.</div><a name="08111936000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000500"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> There are upwards of 200 countries in the world, of
which 150 purport to have some sort of democratic system in place. I
would not claim to know what their systems are, which is why I referred
the point back to the Minister to consider in the fullness of time. I
was not demanding that though.</div>
<a name="08111936000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that
several European countries use ID cards does not seem to take us very
far in this debate. We do not have ID cards, but we have a method of
dealing with the problem. All the experts and the overwhelming evidence
suggest that we should go forward on that basis.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.]</i> I have been passed a note that says that

remaining argument, to which I alluded earlier&#151;we certainly had
a heck of a canter around it earlier so I do not want to prolong it
much further&#151;is this question of the Northern Ireland experience
providing an alibi for not acting now. Labour Members queued up to make
that point. I would not suggest for one moment that some brief had
passed among them. I doubt that it has because they made points from
very different angles. It clearly is a very strongly felt point, and I
am sure that Northern Ireland itself will be impressed by the depth of
their knowledge and understanding of what was allegedly done. The truth
is that Labour Members are clinging to a pretty poor life raft if they
want to use Northern Ireland as an excuse for not getting ahead with
this. It is such a waterlogged life raft that it is virtually
sinking.</div>
<a name="08111936000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
looking at what the Committee on Standards in Public Life said about
Northern Ireland on page 94, paragraph 5.67 of its &#147;Review of
the Electoral Commission&#148;, which I do not think has not been
quoted in Committee yet. It
states:</div><a name="08111936000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Committee&#146;s view is that individual registration in Northern
Ireland has not led to the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters,
as is widely believed to be the case.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div><a name="08111936000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a direct
reference to the earlier paragraphs. It
continues:</div><a name="08111936000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government is on record as saying that this drop owed to a combination
of inaccuracy resulting from weaknesses in the household-based system
and the withdrawal of the &#145;carry
forward&#146;&#148;</div><a name="08111936000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
5.67 goes on to
say:</div><a name="08111936000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">There
are...a significant number of individuals who, for various
reasons, do not re-register during the annual canvass; therefore the
withdrawal of the carry forward effectively meant that each year a
sizeable number of individuals would fall off the register. There would
be a similar significant reduction in registration under the household
system if the carry forward was
abolished.&#148;</div><a name="08111936000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
we have the answer to the points that Labour Members were making. The
lion&#146;s share of the reduction in the numbers on the register was
not caused by the introduction of individual registration. The report
goes on to praise the Government. Although it does not use the word
&#147;praise&#148;, it is fair to say that that is what it does. It
says that the Government&#146;s response, with the Miscellaneous
Provisions (Northern Ireland) Act 2006, was to
abolish</div><a name="08111936000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

registration.&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08111936000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">which

commissioned a series of research reports to monitor the impact of
individual registration on the numbers of people registered. The

individual registration itself, which affected the numbers of people

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000505"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Everyone on the Committee will agree that this has
been an extremely important and useful debate. I want to address the
new clauses in some detail and to make some general points of principle
in response to comments, but I shall start by correcting some of what
has been said during the
debate.</div>
<a name="08111936000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard
several times from those on the Opposition Benches about a belief that
there is a legal duty on an elector to take proactive steps to register
to vote. That is not correct. A person is liable to be fined only if
they fail to respond to a registration officer&#146;s request for
information. The next point was that the Government have taken no
action on electoral fraud&#151;I think I am referring to this
correctly&#151;and that, somehow, we are insouciant about that which
exists. I shall briefly put the record
straight.</div><a name="08111936000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
postal voting, in measures in the Electoral Administration Act 2006 and
associated secondary legislation, we have stipulated that postal voters
must specify a reason if they want their postal vote to be sent to an
address other than that at which they are registered. As administrators
get more time to check postal vote applications, there is a requirement
for electors to provide personal identifiers&#151;signature and date
of birth&#151;if they wish to have a postal vote. The identifiers
must be replicated by the elector when casting the postal vote, and
they will be cross-checked with the original samples to ensure that the
postal vote is
valid.</div><a name="08111936000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a new offence of falsely applying for a postal or proxy vote, and
new secrecy warnings on voting papers to deter attempts unlawfully to
influence another&#146;s vote. There is a strengthened offence of
undue influence, which the hon. Member for Epping Forest alluded to and
which will make prosecution easier. Ballot papers have a security mark
to enable ballot papers to be validated. After every election, a list
of all those who voted by post is published, so that individuals can
check whether their vote was
counted.</div><a name="08111936000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
police can check with any individual whether they voted by post or
their vote was stolen. Police have been given more time to carry out
investigations of electoral fraud&#151;increased from one year to two
years. There is a new criminal offence of supplying false information.
There are clear new powers for electoral administrators to cross-check
applications to register to vote against other information that the
councils
hold.</div><a name="08111936000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brief list&#151;brief in terms of time&#151;shows how ridiculous it
is to say that we do not take such matters seriously. Of course we
do.</div><a name="08111936000183"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000507"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am also under constraints. If it is a highly
significant point, I shall happily give
way.</div><a name="08111936000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000508"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I agree with the Minister. We accept that the
Government take those matters seriously and therefore are amazed that
they are not going further with individual
registration.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div><a name="08111936000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000509"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am glad&#151;a measure of consensus on that. I
hope we achieve consensus on some other things that I am about to
say.</div><a name="08111936000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically,
the hon. Member for Cambridge raised a detailed point about whether
electoral registration officers have been given enough resources to
check postal votes. It is an important point. We think that being able
to check 20 per cent. is statistically robust. Most people would think
that a reasonable argument. It is a good indicator of whether fraud is
occurring. Obviously, if an electoral officer thought that there was a
real risk of fraud, they could specify from the outset that all postal
voting statements would be
checked.</div><a name="08111936000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are committed to the principle that 100 per cent. of returned postal
votes need checking, but we need to ensure that electoral
administrators have the necessary systems in place&#151;that is a
question not so much of resources, but of the systems to do it. We
shall work with the Electoral Commission, electoral administrators and
software suppliers to establish when it will be appropriate and safe to
mandate 100 per cent. checking of postal votes. The opportunity is
there&#151;20 per cent. is statistically robust, but we are moving
towards that 100 per cent., which I hope the Committee agrees is the
desired
goal.</div><a name="08111936000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
had a whole series of hyperbolic statements about banana republics and
all the rest of it. I would urge all hon.
Members&#151;</div><a name="08111936000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000510"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08111936000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000511"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, he might want
to hear the point I am making, then I shall be happy to give
way.</div><a name="08111936000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000512"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I have heard the
point.</div><a name="08111936000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000513"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With all respect to the hon. Gentleman, who is
saying from a sedentary position that he has heard the point, he has
not.</div><a name="08111936000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had hyperbolic statements from those on the Opposition
Benches&#151;I am referring to a small amount of what they said. All
I say to them is that they should be extremely careful when they use
such language to ensure that they are putting it in the correct
context. Hyperbole does not usually help a reasoned
argument.</div><a name="08111936000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Chichester in particular&#151;I will give way to
him&#151;has shown over and over again that he is well capable of
making an extremely logical and intellectually consistent argument. I
urge him to be careful about ruining it with
hyperbole.</div><a name="08111936000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000514"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> The Minister seemed to backtrack a fraction there.
If I may say so, he is a very good chap, too, and a very thoughtful
fellow. It is a bit rich to describe a High Court judge as exercising
hyperbole when he came out with the
phrase</div><a name="08111936000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
disgrace a banana
republic&#148;.</div><a name="08111936000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000515"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With all respect to the hon. Gentleman, I was at
great pains to point out that I was not accusing the High Court judge
of hyperbole; I was accusing the hon. Gentleman of hyperbole in the
context in which he was describing this. If he reads <i class="I">Hansard</i>, he
will see that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>I was urging him to be extremely careful about that. I do not think that
any objective&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I ask hon. Members to
consider, from their own experience of elections in this country,
whether they think it is appropriate to describe their own
participation in the electoral process as analogous to what goes on in
a banana republic. That is all I ask them to
consider.</div><a name="08111936000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000516"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Will the Minister give way? That point really is
outrageous.</div><a name="08111936000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000517"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Not at the moment, because I want to
raise&#151;</div><a name="08111936000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000518"></a>Mr.
Tyrie</b>
<i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div><a name="08111936000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000519"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister is not giving way. Will the
hon. Gentleman resume his
seat?</div><a name="08111936000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000520"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We have spent a great deal of time on the new
clause. I have many important points that I want to make. If I may say
so, we can consider the question whether we are or are not a banana
republic as outside the purview of the
Committee.</div><a name="08111936000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Chichester again raised a serious point about service
voters. That is a significant issue that we take seriously, and the
revised figures that he gave us underline how important it is. Of
course we take it seriously. As far as I am aware, there have not been
any detailed discussions with regard to the effect of individual
registration, but as I said this morning, there are continuing
discussions involving the Ministry of Defence, electoral administrators
and Ministry of Justice officials on that issue. We will certainly bear
it in mind as we move forward in this
area.</div><a name="08111936000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I come to the substance of my remarks, let me say this. A lot of
comparisons with other countries have been made. Without wishing to go
into great detail, I ask all hon. Members, when they listen to the hon.
Gentleman, to bear it in mind that in this country we have a democracy
of extremely long standing. We are almost unique in the world in that
sense. Obviously, our circumstances are different. As a constitutional
theorist of great distinction, he will know that our constitution
evolves. It evolves organically and it is right that it should do so.
The Bill is part of that organic evolution. I hope he can agree at
least on
that.</div><a name="08111936000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000521"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I want to make a couple of quick points. The
Minister accused me of hyperbole, but the record will show that it was
a High Court judge who came out with the only phrase that the Minister
has identified to justify the
remark.</div><a name="08111936000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also like to point out that when I opposed the poll tax, which I
did quite vigorously from the inside, I pointed out that only two
countries had one&#151;Guinea-Bissau and Papua New Guinea&#151;and
they had widespread civil unrest and had to turn it into a hut tax,
which is a bit like a council tax. What I am trying to point out is
that I do not know the answer to the international comparison point. I
said at the time that I had not looked at it closely, but someone had
pointed it out to me that Zimbabwe has household registration and he
thought that it was probably the only country to have
it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div><a name="08111936000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000522"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Finally, you will be relieved to hear,
Sir Nicholas. If the hon. Gentleman examines <i class="I">Hansard</i>
tomorrow, he will see that I was referring to hyperbole as a matter of
context as much as to the exact remark. That was the point I was trying
to make. I think he will agree, as a great expert in these matters,
that that is also
possible.</div><a name="08111936000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come to the substance of the debate. The hon. Gentleman said in his
opening remarks that this is the most important proposal, and he may
well be right. The time that we have taken to discuss it and the
distinguished contributions that we have heard from the hon. Member for
Epping Forest and from my hon. Friends show how important it is to the
Committee. I hope that we can make
progress.</div><a name="08111936000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall set out broad principles that I think should underpin our
discussion&#151;although not at great length, you will be relieved to
hear, Sir Nicholas. The debate has raised important issues of principle
that I think everyone agrees are fundamental to the health of our
democracy. I hope that we can also agree that no party has a monopoly
on either wisdom or propriety in these matters.</div>
<a name="08111936000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
we can agree on a number of basic propositions. First, I agree with
everything that has been said on the question of fraud. We can all
agree that fraud is corrosive of our democracy and that we must do
everything we can to tackle it. That is not at issue. However, it is
also clear, and the evidence suggests it, that fraud is not systemic
and not widespread. That is completely compatible with everything that
we have heard from Opposition Members. We have heard a lot of figures
today, but research by the Electoral Commission has found 23
convictions for offences set out in the Representation of the People
Act between 2000 and 2006, with the figures peaking in 2001. However,
as I have said, we cannot be complacent about even a single instance of
such fraud.</div>
<a name="08111936000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
proposition that I hope we can all agree on is that democracy is
undermined when significant numbers are not able to participate in
elections because they are not registered to do so. Again, the figures
can be disputed, but it is commonly agreed that about 3
million people are not able to vote because they are not registered,
although they are otherwise entitled to do so. Having said that, we can
also agree, whatever else we may disagree on, that the electoral system
itself must be beyond partisan dispute. While elections will always be
vigorously disputed, and rightly so, the foundations of the
electoral system should not be the subject of controversy.</div>
<a name="08111936000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Securing
consensus on change to the electoral system can be challenging and we
all recognise why that is. Political parties inevitably draw support
from different parts of society and different parts of the country.
That is inevitable&#151;axiomatic, almost. However, it inevitably
produces an asymmetry of interest from time to time in pursuing
particular solutions to problems, and we have to recognise that that is
the case.</div>
<a name="08111936000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
however justifiable any proposal may be in its own terms, we must
always be wary of seeking to implement solutions to any given problem
and implementing any given principle if, in doing so, it creates,
however inadvertently, a biased outcome in the electoral system as a
whole.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div><a name="08111936000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
opening remarks in mind, I hope that we can also agree as a Committee,
and as a House of Commons, that any changes to improve the electoral
system&#151;we recognise that it needs improvement; that is
consensual between us&#151;should be subject to four tests: that of
the level playing field, being open, being fair and being
transparent.</div><a name="08111936000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
changes should always be directed towards the fundamental goal of
creating a level playing field for all democratic political parties.
Anything that undermines that principle is axiomatically partisan and
risks illegitimacy. If the securing of one principle or another, no
matter how desirable in its own right, tilts the playing field in one
direction or another, without any countervailing action, it must,
inevitably, risk that perception of
illegitimacy.</div><a name="08111936000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Chichester made an important point about securing
consent from society as a whole. I agree with him that that is of
paramount importance. If we do not have in our minds always the need to
pursue a level playing field, we will risk the securing of that
consent.</div><a name="08111936000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second, third and fourth principles are quite obvious. Any changes
should clearly aim to make the system as open as possible so that all
voters entitled to vote should be able to do
so.</div><a name="08111936000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
changes should aim to make the system as fair as possible, so that all
opportunities for systemic corruption and fraud are rooted out, and
they should aim to make the system as transparent as possible so that
everyone can see that it is open and fair. I hope that we can all agree
that such transparency is the best guarantor of openness and fairness.
Whatever changes are made should therefore be made in the interest of
the legitimacy of the system as a whole and not be subject to claims
that partisan advantage is being pursued. As the hon. Gentleman rightly
said, that would damage the chances of securing consent to the system
as a whole. Whether partisan advantage is actual or perceived, we need
to be extremely
careful.</div><a name="08111936000409"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="08111936000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
that end, having as complete a register as possible is a starting point
to ensuring in so far as is practicable that all eligible voters are
registered and able to exercise their franchise. I shall come to
individual registration in a moment, but as the Committee on Standards
in Public Life has been quoted several times and Sir Christopher
Kelly&#146;s evidence mentioned, I remind the Committee of my
exchange with Sir Christopher. I asked him whether he was aware that
the Government share his committee&#146;s view that, in principle,
individual registration is a good thing. Sir Christopher said,
&#147;I am.&#148; I then asked him if he recognised that we share
his worry that any moves leading to further disfranchisement would be a
serious democratic problem. I asked
him:</div><a name="08111936000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
moving forward on this, as everybody wants to, do you agree that it
would be a good idea to take every step we can to improve the register
as part of any process of moving towards individual
registration?&#148;</div><a name="08111936000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
said:</div><a name="08111936000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
can be no answer to that other than yes, of

Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee, </i>4 November 2008; c.
38, Q94.]</div><a name="08111936000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why we have taken steps to improve the register.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div><a name="08111936000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Electoral Commission&#146;s role has been mentioned. I have some
interesting leaflets in front of me showing how the Electoral
Commission has been trying to improve registration. We are working with
the commission. As a consequence of the 2006 Act, we are placing a new
duty on electoral registration officers, and we have seen results in
the past year. In the past two years, the registration figures for
parliamentary elections increased by 371,000 in 2006 and 307,669 in
2007. The registration figures for local government elections also
increased by 513,054 in 2006 and 463,000 in 2007. We are making
progress and actively considering further steps. I hope to be able to
come back to the House with further proposals
shortly.</div><a name="08111936000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside
all that work on individual registration, work has begun with the
Electoral Commission and electoral administrators to examine how
individual registration may effectively be introduced, and that work
will continue. It is clearly necessary to involve parliamentarians from
all parties in that if we are to do it by consensus, and we will
introduce proposals
shortly.</div><a name="08111936000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
form of consultation or legislative proposals may follow that work, but
the work itself is essential if we are to ensure that any proposals
introduced are thoroughly thought through by all those who need to
contribute. That may involve some use of pilots to identify issues and
how they can be addressed, consideration of a phased roll-out for
collection and use of identifiers and so on. I think that everyone
would agree that if we make a fundamental change to the system, we
should do so with care and caution, and ensure that we get it right.
Obviously, that cannot be achieved before the next general
election.</div><a name="08111936000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been considerable debate, as Opposition Members have said, on the
need to prepare carefully, the need for clear policy development and
the need for any subsequent legislation to be well developed. The hon.
Member for Chichester mentioned the Dangerous Dogs Act. We are all
conscious of lessons from legislation passed by all
Governments&#151;it is not particular to any one party&#151;that
legislation should be thoroughly prepared and implemented in good
time.</div><a name="08111936000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
process will be complex; it is radical and unprecedented in this
country. At every stage, we must be sure that we are subjecting it to
the proper degree of careful scrutiny. We will ensure that it meets the
four fundamental tests that I described. It must involve a level
playing field, and be open, fair and transparent. I hope that all
parties can agree that that is the way
forward.</div><a name="08111936000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I may, I shall deal with the detail of the amendments. I am conscious
that I am taking some time, Sir Nicholas, but this is fundamentally
important. I hope to secure your indulgence to explain why I must, I am
afraid, resist the amendments. That will not be a surprise to the hon.
Member for Epping Forest, but I will say why I must do so.</div>
<a name="08111936000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
1&#151;as it stands and as it would be if amended under amendments
(a), (b) and (c)&#151; would require eligible electors to provide
personal identifiers when they registered to vote either through an
annual canvass or on a rolling registration form. I note that the hon.
Lady has specifically excluded voter ID cards from any such personal
identifiers. On registration, the personal identifiers to be provided
by electors would be their signature, date of birth and national
insurance number, although they could theoretically also include their
ID card.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div><a name="08111936000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the integrity of the electoral system is of the utmost importance.
Of course, we recognise the benefits of electors providing such
personal identifiers, but further thought and preparation on that are
needed. As we move forward on the issue, we have to ensure that proper
work is done to explore ways to reach the significant groups and
categories of voter who have traditionally and historically been
under-registered. We have to be sure that we are including them before
there is any risk of their being further excluded from this fundamental
democratic process.</div>
<a name="08111936000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the new
clause would not affect the conduct of the annual canvass, every
household would continue to receive an annual canvass form for
completion, but the person who completed the form would be required to
provide personal identifiers for all the eligible electors living in
their house. That might not be a problem in many cases, but I ask
Conservative Members to consider that it might be difficult to collect
such personal identifiers&#151;now we are talking about the
detail&#151;if eligible persons were at university, on a lengthy
holiday or working
away.</div><a name="08111936000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
might also be difficulties for people living in shared accommodation,
who might not want the person completing the canvass form to have their
personal
identifiers.</div><a name="08111936000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
those issues require further careful consideration. I am not ruling out
giving them that consideration, but we are not at the right stage to
make a judgment on the new clause. I have consistently said that we
agree with the principle of individual registration, so there is no
difference between us on the principle, but there is a difference
regarding the detail of how we should bring it forward. On that basis,
I hope that Conservative Members will withdraw new clause
1.</div><a name="08111936000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 would insert a new sub-paragraph in section 2 of the
Representation of the People Act 1985, after paragraph (3)(b), setting
out the information that British citizens who reside overseas would
have to provide when making an overseas declaration. Regulation 18(5)
of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations
2001 provides that an overseas elector need provide their passport
number only if they are not registered or have not previously been
registered as an overseas
elector.</div><a name="08111936000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
elector making a first-time application for registration must have
their application attested by another British citizen residing
overseas, who must also provide their passport number. Having passed
those strict security arrangements, the elector is not required, in
subsequent years, to hunt for their passport number or to seek another
attestation.</div>
<a name="08111936000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) suggested
that the Bill should do more about the relatively low levels of
registration among expatriates, but a new requirement to provide a
passport number every year might deter eligible electors from
re-registering during the annual canvass. We want the registration
process for overseas electors to be secure, but simple enough to ensure
that people will register to vote. The current regulations achieve that
aim.</div><a name="08111936000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the concerns about expatriate registration. Now that this
issue has arisen, I might copy to hon. Members the letter that I wrote
to the hon. Member for  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>Ludlow, with his consent. In the letter, I set out the measures that we
have taken, are taking and intend to take to increase registration

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000523"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> To put the Minister right, one reason that the
Government have previously given for not pursuing individual voter
registration was the problem of overseas voters. New clause 2 is an
attempt to address that problem. It is meant not to encourage overseas
voters, but to get around the problem that his Department raised a few
months
ago.</div><a name="08111936000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000524"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those
remarks, and for the constructive spirit in which he intervened and in
which the new clause was tabled. We are willing to look at the issue in
connection with everything else. This case was raised specifically on
Second Reading. It goes to our concern about constantly improving the
register, including for expatriates. We want to do that and, with the
consent of the hon. Member for Ludlow, I will copy my letter to him to
all members of the
Committee.</div><a name="08111936000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come rapidly to new clause 7, which would reverse the current
arrangements by requiring electors proactively to state on a canvass
form or individual rolling registration form that they wanted to be
included in the edited register. It would effectively introduce the
need to opt in. Members of the Committee will know that the Government
asked Dr. Walport and Mr. Richard Thomas to undertake an
independent review of the framework for the use of personal information
in the public and private sectors. They produced a report on 11 July,
and recommendation 19 of that report called for the edited version of
the register to be abolished.</div>
<a name="08111936000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">We understand
the concerns about the sale of personal details through the supply of
the edited register. It is a sensitive matter and often goes to the
heart of how people feel that our democracy should operate. However, it
is complicated. There are issues for the British economy as a whole,
and for businesses, charities and the general public. We intend to hold
a consultation on those issues and to set out the problems, while
recognising what Dr. Walport and Mr. Thomas
recommended and acknowledging that there is widespread public concern
about the issue. We will then proceed accordingly. I hope that hon.
Members agree that we should wait for the results of that consultation
before deciding how to move forward on the issue.</div>
<a name="08111936000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, new
clause 8 would strengthen the security of the voting process at polling
stations. Of course, we take the integrity of that process extremely
seriously, and we see some merit in the new clause. Over recent years,
we have introduced measures to address issues of secrecy and security,
which, together with other factors such as more robust sentencing of
convicted fraudsters, are having an effect&#151;we can see the
results. Allegations of fraud have reduced over recent years and the
Electoral Commission has acknowledged that the identifiers used in
postal voting, for example, have had an effect in reducing those
allegations. In its 2007 report on local government elections in
England, the Electoral Commission found
that</div><a name="08111936000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
volume and scale of offences are both considerably down on
2006.&#148;</div><a name="08111936000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continued:</div><a name="08111936000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
low level of reports and allegations of offences this year is
encouraging.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div><a name="08111936000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, any perception that fraud is widespread is not supported
by the facts. Voting at polling stations has traditionally been
conducted without the need for personal identification to be produced,
but it is an offence to attempt to vote in place of another
elector&#151;the offence is personation, as you are aware, Sir
Nicholas. Staff at polling stations are given training and guidance on
how to spot people who attempt to cast fraudulent
votes.</div><a name="08111936000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
proposal to require voters in polling stations in Great Britain to
produce ID as envisaged under the new clause would need to be
considered carefully. The new clause provides for a wide range of
potential documents, but it is not inclusive. We would need to consider
what the practical implications of the proposal might be and what
barriers it might present to voting at elections, particularly as the
requirement to produce evidence of identity would be a significant
change to the electoral system.</div>
<a name="08111936000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure
members of the Committee that we are constantly examining ways to
strengthen the integrity of our electoral system. That is in
everybody&#146;s interest. We will keep the matter under review and
explore the options for ensuring that votes in polling stations are
cast safely and securely. I hope that, on that basis, the hon. Member
for Epping Forest will withdraw the new
clause.</div><a name="08111936000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000525"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I thank the Minister for the constructive way in
which he approached the new clauses, which were tabled to help the
Government&#151;that was the whole point. I am pleased that, at the
end of this long and sometimes heated but very constructive debate, we
find that, on both sides of the Committee, there is a large element of
agreement in
principle.</div><a name="08111936000410"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="08111936000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Minister said that he would come back to the Committee or the House
shortly on some of the issues that he mentioned under new clause 1, did
he mean before the next stage of the Bill, or at some time in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000527"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> That is fair enough. I will not push the Minister
any further at this late hour. There is quite a difference between
coming back during the passage of the Bill and coming back at some
stage in the future, but I appreciate that he has a lot to think about
after today&#146;s
debate.</div><a name="08111936000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as new clause 8 is concerned, the Minister has agreed in principle
to look at matters and I am pleased about that. The same goes for new
clause 7, which is about abolishing the edited register
completely&#151;I appreciate that the Information Commissioner is
looking at that. We are looking at it too and it needs further
consideration. New clause 2 was intended to be helpful and I am glad
that it has been taken in that spirit. I shall not press new clauses 2,
7 and 8, but new clause 1 is such an important matter of principle that
I shall have to ask the Committee to divide on
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000528"></a>David

the Committee not to press the new clause.</div>
<a name="08111936000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000531"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> On new clauses 2, 7 and 8, the Minister has been
helpful and constructive, but new clause 1 is so important that I would
like to divide the Committee. I understand the point made by the hon.
Member for Cambridge, who, as I said before, is a better academic
lawyer than me by a long way. Amendments (a), (b) and (c) must be in
new clause 1 in order for it to make sense. However, I do not want to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000553"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> The new clauses propose a moratorium on a review of
electoral modernisation pilots. The point is that it is wrong for the
Government to continue to bring forward gimmicks to try to encourage
people to register, to vote and take part in the democratic process.
Gimmicks are wrong. Those who are looking at electoral reform need time
to consider the sort of matters that we dealt with in the last group of
amendments. That is why we have proposed a moratorium on electoral
modernisation pilots and review of them.</div>
<a name="08111936000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">One need look
no further than last year&#146;s Gould review of the Scottish
elections, which came up with so many criticisms of the system that was
piloting electronic voting and counting. For the sake of time, I will
give just one example. In Airdrie and Shotts, Labour&#146;s majority
of 1,446 was less than the 1,536 rejected ballots under a very
complicated system. Our electoral and voting systems must be simple,
straightforward, and understood by every member of the electorate and
all the candidates. It is wrong to mess about with gimmicks, saying
that they are to modernise the system. The system does not need to be
modernised in that way. It needs to be reformed in the way we have
discussed.</div>
<a name="08111936000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000554"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Having achieved a large degree of consensus on the
principles on which we should move forward in reforming our electoral
system, it saddens me to have to resist the new clause. It is entirely
unnecessary and would fetter our attempts to make our democracy more
accessible and improve the efficiency of electoral administration. That
is not an alternative to the sorts of reforms that we were talking
about earlier&#151;it is something that we should be considering
anyway.</div>
<a name="08111936000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it
happens, the Government have no plans at present to conduct further
pilots at this stage, and none was conducted in 2008. None the less, it
would be wrong to place a limit on the Government&#146;s ability in
future to test pilots promising new technologies or new techniques.
Governments must be free to investigate possible innovations and pilots
when appropriate. Pilots allow for new technologies to be tested in
controlled environments and in real-life situations. Incremental
testing over time permits issues to be identified and solutions to be
adapted as a consequence, with retesting to prove that the issues have
been resolved. That is a matter of prudent process, and to fetter it in
such a way is quite wrong. If new clause 14 were to be approved, it
would only prevent piloting from taking place from under the provisions
of the Representation of the People Act. It would do nothing to prevent
the London mayoral and assembly elections from being electronically
counted again, as they were this year, or Scottish local authorities
from continuing to count their elections electronically. It would serve
only to prevent the Government from taking the lead, as they should, in
improving electoral
administration.</div><a name="08111936000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 15 would establish a committee to review electoral modernisation
piloting. Well, sometimes committees are a very good idea, but it is
difficult to understand what value that committee would bring 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>over and above the rigorous processes that are already in place to
ensure effective oversight of the piloting process. The Government take
into account the concerns of electoral administrators, local
authorities and the Electoral Commission. To date, all the electoral
modernisation pilots have been overseen by project boards and programme
boards with the involvement of the Electoral Commission, the
Association of Electoral Administrators and others. All those different
perspectives and insights from outside the Ministry of Justice and the
Government have therefore informed and underpinned the piloting
programme. That the boards are not currently meeting reflects the fact
that no pilots are planned, but the intention is to restart that
process if we were to resume pilots.</div>
<a name="08111936000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">We proceed
with pilots only following consultation with the Electoral Commission.
All pilots are evaluated after the event by the local authorities that
ran them, and by the Electoral Commission. The commission&#146;s
recommendations are taken into account when considering further pilots
and moving forward. We already receive expert advice on piloting
programmes, and we are considering whether to establish a panel of
recognised and respected experts from the academic, technical and
electoral administration fields to advise on policy, technical issues
and testing and, indeed, what we should be piloting, should we decide
to do so in the future. With a combination of such issues, there is no
need for the new
clause.</div><a name="08111936000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth pointing out that we in the UK are far from alone in piloting
new systems in electoral administration, and testing their benefits.
Many countries do so. We have heard about international comparisons,
and I can give some to the Committee. Australia has piloted e-voting
for specific groups, such as service personnel on deployment, which I
know will be of interest to the hon. Member for Chichester. The system
has been piloted for visually impaired voters. Other countries have
made e-voting more generally available, and some have rolled it out
more widely following pilots&#151;in Estonia, for example. Others
have decided to discontinue e-voting following problems that led to a
loss of public
confidence.</div><a name="08111936000290"></a>

Objection.</div><a name="08111936000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000567"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister was speaking. He would have
to sit down before I could ask the Government Whip to move the Question
that he seeks to put to the Committee and to which I am now aware that
there is an objection. Clearly, that Question is debatable. I suggest
that the Committee do not debate it at great length, but that is
entirely up to the Committee. Again, I can give only guidance, not
advice. I ask the Minister to speak to the amendments. It is up to him
how quickly he does so. Then I shall be happy to call the Government
Whip.</div><a name="08111936000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000568"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I will be as brisk as I
possibly can, but there are a great number of amendments, so forgive me
if I conclude my remarks in
full.</div><a name="08111936000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8 requires a person making a donation of more than &#163;200 to a
political party to make a declaration about the source of the funds.
The declaration must say whether another person or body has given more
than &#163;200 with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, the
making of that donation. If that is the case, the declaration must go
on to state whether sections 54(4) or (6) apply to the donation: that
is, whether the donations have been made by the donor
acting&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="08111936000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000569"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister has the floor. Minister,
please continue your remarks.</div>
<a name="08111936000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000570"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. If that is the case, the
declaration must go on to state whether section 54(4) or (6)
apply to the donation: that is, whether the donations have been made by
the donor acting as principal donor for a group of other donors or as
agent for another donor. If they have, the 2000 Act separately requires
the details of the true underlying donor to be disclosed. If the
declaration says that the sections do not apply, the declaration must
state why not.</div>
<a name="08111936000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a donation
of more than &#163;200 is not accompanied by a declaration, it cannot
be accepted by the party. Furthermore, the party must take reasonable
steps to verify that the declaration is accurate and include a
statement to the effect that it has done so in its donation report.
Schedule 3 replicates the proposal in respect of regulated
donees&#151; including MPs&#151;recognised third parties and
permitted participants in referendums.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div><a name="08111936000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns have
been expressed that the &#163;200 threshold is too low and that the
requirement to take reasonable steps is unduly onerous. I have listened
to those concerns and am keen to ensure that the provisions, while
being useful, do not impose an unnecessary burden on donors, parties
and volunteer workers. With that in mind, I have moved the accompanying
Government amendments. As they are technical, I hope that the Committee
will be content if I explain the combined effect of some of the
amendments rather than taking each individually, which might prove
unnecessarily complex and
time-consuming.</div><a name="08111936000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
combined effect of Government amendments Nos. 153 and 155 to 157 is as
follows. The size of donation that must be accompanied by a declaration
will be raised from the current threshold in the Bill of more than
&#163;200 to the level at which a central party is required to
declare a donation to the Electoral Commission, that is &#163;5,000.
Where the donation is to a local accounting unit of such a party, the
requirement is for a declaration to accompany donations of more than
&#163;1,000. In addition, where such a donation is made to a
party&#146;s central organisation, a declaration will have to say
whether an amount of more than &#163;5,000 has been provided to the
donor with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, that donation.
Again, the relevant figure is a donation of more than &#163;1,000 if
the donation relates to a local accounting unit. If an amount of less
than those sums has been provided, the further requirements relating to
making a declaration about the impact of sections 54(4) and (6) will
fall away.</div>
<a name="08111936000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
Government amendments Nos. 160, 161, 162, 164, 165, 166, 168, 169 and
170 seek to achieve the same effect for the declaration requirement in
schedule 3 with respect to donations to individuals and
members&#146; associations, recognised third parties and permitted
participants.</div><a name="08111936000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 158 removes the requirement for a registered party to
take all reasonable steps forthwith by, or on behalf of, the party to
verify it. Government amendments Nos. 163, 167 and 171 remove this
requirement with respect to declarations received by the individuals
and organisations covered by schedule 3, which I have already
mentioned. It is worth noting that removing this provision will not
reduce the obligations that parties are already under by way of section
56 to ensure that they take reasonable steps to verify the identity and
permissibility of donors. So, even where a declaration is made under
these arrangements, if a party suspects for any reason that the details
given are not right, section 56 may require them to make further
checks. These amendments will substantially reduce concerns about
overburdening central and local parties and donors, while ensuring that
the biggest donations are subject to an improved level of transparency.
That said, if hon. Members have residual concerns, about the level at
which these requirements have effect for example, I will, of course, be
willing to listen to them and consider them
further.</div><a name="08111936000339"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111936000571"></a><b class="B">Ian

<a name="08111936000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000572"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas, for making it clear that
the Question is debatable. I would like to have it debated and I would
also like to vote against it. The Committee is making painfully slow
progress with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>this Bill. Today, we have completed six groups of amendments in nearly
five and a half hours. If we continue at that pace, on Thursday, when
we have just short of four and a half hours, we will not even reach
clause 9. That means that the Committee will not get to discuss all of
the proposals about party funding that have been put down for
debate&#151;all the proposals about caps on donations, party
expenditure and about how to deal with the question of affiliation of
the trade unionists to the Labour party.</div>
<a name="08111936000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
an outrage if this Committee were to be denied the opportunity to
debate those issues which, for my party, and for many members of the
public, are central to our consideration. We would also be unable to
discuss clause 10, which is where the triggering proposal comes before
the Committee. We spent hours in the first part of the Committee taking
evidence from numerous experts on the question of triggering. There has
been wide debate, both inside and outside the House, on whether
triggering works. It would be farcical, having done all of that, not
even to reach that question in Committee. My proposal is that we do not
adjourn the debate now, that you, Sir Nicholas, suspend the sitting for
an appropriate time for us to have something to eat, and that we come
back after about an hour and carry on consideration so that we at least
get far enough tonight so that on Thursday we shall be in a position to
give full consideration to those important
matters.</div><a name="08111936000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000573"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> There is a longer-term timing issue and a
shorter-term timing issue. In the longer-term context, we have some
sympathy with what the hon. Member for Cambridge has just said. We have
maintained consistently that not enough time has been given, such as
the single weekend between the evidence sessions and the following
Committee sittings. We are still suffering from the lack of time to
consult properly as we move through the Bill&#151;that has been a
consistent problem for us. Given that the later stages of the Bill will
be in the next Session anyway, we have no idea what the rush has been
with Committee. The overall time could have been longer and, to that
extent, we have sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="08111936000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
in the short-term context, we wish to delay discussion of clause 8
until Thursday. Let me explain why. On Second Reading, the Government
implied and consistently after that said that we would get amendments
to clause 8. First, they spoke about providing a new clause, then
amendments. We received those amendments, such as they are&#151;I
agree that they are pretty poor&#151;only yesterday. We filed our
amendments, based on the Government amendments, yesterday evening. It
is not as if we had a week to look at what the Government came up with.
We had a handful of hours and we put in our amendments yesterday
evening, which means that, today, they came in starred, so we cannot
debate our amendments until Thursday. That is why I say to the hon.
Gentleman that I am very sorry, but he should not look to us. The
Government did not allow us time to debate our amendments, which is why
we think it fit and proper to adjourn now until Thursday, and that is
why we shall be voting to
adjourn.</div><a name="08111936000344"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111936000574"></a><b class="B">Pete
Wishart</b> (Perth and North Perthshire) (SNP): I rise to
support the hon. Member for Cambridge in asking for an adjournment, so
that the Committee can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>reconvene in an hour&#146;s time after we have all had some suitable
refreshment. The public will find it staggering that we are not able to
discuss, as now looks likely, such issues as party funding, caps and
donations, party expenditure and trade union affiliation. That is what
the public want us to discuss; that is the meat of the Bill. It would
be unforgivable if we spent all this time sitting and failed to reach
the crucial and important amendments. Failure to do so would be a
dereliction of the Committee&#146;s
duty.</div><a name="08111936000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
listened carefully to the remarks of the hon. Member for Huntingdon,
but I have to say to him that the Conservatives have been less than
helpful in making sure that we try to reach those amendments. I was
looking forward to the Conservative amendments on such crucial issues,
but they have not been forthcoming&#151;they have not
happened.</div><a name="08111936000346"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000575"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the hon. Member
for Huntingdon was not strictly accurate in his description of the
Government amendments? They were tabled last Thursday. Was he aware of
that?</div><a name="08111936000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111936000576"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I have absolutely
no problem at all with the process of the Government tabling their
amendments. The Conservative party seems to have a massive issue with
that. If that is why the Conservatives have failed to bring forward
their amendments and to make progress on the Bill, their approach is
absolutely disgraceful. It has not been in good faith and we should
have made further progress. Having to listen to the hon. Member for
Epping Forest&#151;whom I usually enjoy listening to&#151;for 50
minutes on what I assumed was an inconsequential group
of amendments is unbelievable and shocking. The
Conservatives have done the public a massive disservice in terms of
making progress on the Bill. We ought to reconvene at the earliest
opportunity to discuss these vital issues, because it will be a total
dereliction of duty if the Committee fails to address the important
issues of the Bill. I have spent several hours with the hon. Member for
Chichester discussing some of the issues, and I was looking forward to
his contribution. I thought that we had some sort of arrangement or
agreement about where we would move forward with the Bill, but nothing
has been put forward by the Conservatives. I hope that one of the
Conservatives will now get up and tell us exactly what their intentions
are on the Bill. It is inconceivable that we cannot deal with those
main issues. I agree with the hon. Member for Cambridge that we must
come back and discuss the vital
measures.</div><a name="08111936000412"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.30
pm</div><a name="08111936000348"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111936000577"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Alan Reid</b> (Argyll and Bute) (LD): I agree with my hon.
Friend the Member for Cambridge and with the hon. Member for Perth and
North Perthshire that we should reconvene later tonight to discuss
these important issues. I have little sympathy with the Conservative
viewpoint. My hon. Friend and I have tabled amendments to later clauses
in the Bill and have submitted new clauses. We did not wait to see what
the Government were planning to do. We put forward our own ideas, and
Conservative Members could have done exactly the
same.</div><a name="08111936000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw the Committee&#146;s attention to what little progress we have
made. The Bill has 20 clauses. We are now 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>discussing the 10th clause. That means that, in three quarters of the
time available, we have debated less than half the Bill. We have got
through six groups of amendments today. If we make similar progress on
Thursday, we will not even reach clause 9. The most controversial
measure is clause 10, which brings in triggering. As my hon. Friend
said, we debated that at great length when we were questioning the
witnesses. As that is the most controversial part of the Bill, it would
be an utter outrage if the Committee were not able to debate it. With
the knife already set in place by the House for 4 pm on Thursday, we
would have only four and a half hours on Thursday. That is simply not
enough time to deal with the rest of the Bill. We must reconvene later
tonight.</div><a name="08111936000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir
Nicholas, during your chairmanship, you have tried to usher us on as
quickly as possible, but Conservative Members have spent a great deal
of time debating their amendments. They are perfectly entitled to do
so, but the logic of their choosing to spend a lot of time debating
their proposals is that they will vote to continue consideration of the
Bill tonight. It would be an outrage to democracy if we could not
discuss the important amendments and clauses that are still to be
debated, so I urge members of the Committee to vote to continue
discussion of the Bill this evening, especially those Conservative
Members who have hogged most of time in Committee so
far.</div>
