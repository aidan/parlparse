Macdonald:</strong>
                  </em> The significant changes from the old
control order regime that are clearest to me are, first, the abolition
of relocation—whether you think it was good or bad, it was
certainly the most draconian measure under the old regime, and it is
gone. Secondly, there is the fact that long curfews—daytime
curfews in particular—have gone, which I suppose were the second
most draconian aspect of the old legislation. Thirdly, and equally
significantly, is the two-year limit on the period of the measure in
the absence of fresh evidence. Personally, I would like the whole
regime to be tied in to the criminal justice system so that the
measures can be applied only when there is a current investigation into
an individual. If that were the case, the measures would be akin to, if
not exactly the same as, bail conditions, and would be constitutionally
unobjectionable. In those circumstances, the measures would no doubt be
designed to encourage investigation and the gathering of
evidence,  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 30<a class="bkMark" name="Column30">&#160;</a>
                  </div>rather than impeding it, as I think the old control orders tended to. I
think that my successor as Director of Public Prosecutions has tended
to agree with that view.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000021">&#160;</a>

Farbey:</strong>
                  </em> Speaking from the perspective of a special
advocate, I feel that the special advocate’s role under the new
Bill will be very similar, if not identical, to that under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. We primarily make submissions for the
disclosure of secret evidence into the open part of the case. During
substantive hearings, we step into the shoes—if I can put it
that way—of the controlled person’s barrister when they
are turned out of the courtroom because the session is going into
secret. I feel very strongly that that role will remain under the new
regime and that I will basically carry out my current tasks under that
regime although, of course, much is left to the details of
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000022">&#160;</a>

a broader question to all three of you, the Government argue that there
is no provision within the terrorism protection and investigation
measure regime that requires derogation from the European convention on
human rights, and that the whole Bill would be not only Human Rights
Act-compatible, but significantly more so than the control order
regime. Do you agree with that and are there any areas in which you
have particular reservations, such as article 6?<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000025">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I feel—Angus and I have put in our
written view—that there will be no greater guarantee under the
Bill than under the current legislation that the TPIM notice will
satisfy article 6 in terms of disclosure to the person affected.
Therefore, we may well go through the same sort of exercise under this
Bill that we go through with the current administrative court under the
existing regime. Clearly, the measures that can be imposed on a person
subject to them are different from under the current Bill, but in terms
of article 6 in particular, which is really where our expertise as a
special advocate lies, I do not think that we are looking at a vista
where courts will necessarily spend a lot less time on article 6
arguments.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000026">&#160;</a>

in the absence of a conventional trial, as we would understand it, is
bound to engage arguments around article 6. I would certainly expect
those to continue, and the courts will have to continue to focus on
that. I do not think that this Bill will change that at

McCullough:</strong>
                  </em> I have a concern that the wording of the
Bill runs the risk of introducing language that cannot be applied
literally in a wide variety of cases. The House of Lords, in the AF
(No. 3) case, has said that the literal language of the 2005 Act cannot
be applied because in many cases it leads to a breach of article 6 fair
trial rights. Looking at schedule 4 to the Bill, it appears to be
envisaged that exactly the same or 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 31<a class="bkMark" name="Column31">&#160;</a>
                  </div>very similar words are going to be used, which again will not be capable
in practice of being interpreted as meaning what they say.

liable to lead to confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000028">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">For my part,
I would have preferred to have seen an attempt by the draftsmen to
recognise the state of the law as it has been declared by the House of
Lords in AF (No. 3), with a view to requiring the Secretary of State to
acknowledge the article 6 duty at the outset of proceedings, rather
than simply leaving it for the court and the special advocate to
address some way down the line. In practice, what has happened in
control order proceedings is that the control order may have been in
place for many months—even years—before the final,
substantive hearing, or before the disclosure stage is reached. The
Secretary of State, when it is put to her—as it has frequently
been, and is at the moment—then decides that the public interest
in maintaining the control order is not outweighed by the harm to the
public interest that would be caused by giving the required disclosure.
It is unsatisfactory to my mind that a control order would thereby have
been in place for an extended period without it actually being
justified through giving the level of disclosure required. Exactly the
same would appear to be envisaged under the TPIM regime, although of
course we have not seen the underlying rules of procedure
yet.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000029">&#160;</a>

to a substantive hearing. I foresee that those under TPIMs would be as
enthusiastic to go forward to a substantive hearing as those under
control orders. They will still be subject to intrusive measures, which
they will oppose. They will still want and have the right to full

are subject to restrictions before charge. Sometimes they are on police
bail for as long as two years, subject to significant restrictions on
the say-so of a police officer, because they are suspected of being
involved in crime. No one says that that is unconstitutional, unfair or
improper. It is a perfectly principled thing to do, because they are
under investigation.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000045">&#160;</a>

clearly occasions when, in the absence of a charge, people have to be
put under restriction, which happens across criminal justice, but it
has to be as part of a continuing investigation. We have to avoid the
situation where people are plonked under restriction away from the
prying eyes of criminal justice; they stay there for two years; and
then the matter is discharged. That does not protect the public, except
perhaps for those two years. It is not in accordance with our normal
constitutional principles, and we could easily cure it by tying these
sorts of restrictions into continuing
investigations.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000046">&#160;</a>

plausibly suspected of terrorist crimes should not be subject to
restrictions—of course they should—but they should also
be subject to investigation. It is not enough to say, “We
haven’t obtained any evidence so far, therefore we’ll put
them in a control order and let the security services look after
them.” That is not an appropriate response. If we have not
obtained enough evidence so far, we need to keep trying, and in the
course of that attempt, of course we can put them on something that is
analogous to police bail. Of course, we can put them on curfews, tell
them they cannot go to certain places and tell them they cannot meet
with certain people. Those are common or garden bail conditions. That
is happening up and down the country as we speak, including to people
who are not subject to charge, who are on police bail. There is a great
misunderstanding about this; it is not per se constitutionally
objectionable to restrict people who have not been charged. It happens
all the time, but you have to get the process right, so that it is a
part of criminal justice, and not just handing

legislation. Do you hold that view in relation to this, or do you think
it would be possible to have a power within this Bill that would allow

different views were accommodated and reasonable solutions were arrived
at. You have to posit a pretty horrendous catastrophe to go beyond
this, as you would to go beyond 14 days. We were talking about
scenarios in which there were simultaneous mass casualty attacks in a
number of major cities. We can all imagine ghastly things happening,
and all things are possible. One of the things that we have to do when
we are thinking about legislation is to come to conclusions about what
is remotely likely. Personally, I think that these sorts of measures
are proportionate and appropriate, so long as they are tied to the

prosecutions, where there is sufficient admissible evidence. Is there
anything that stops the DPP, in your words, actually carrying on with
the investigations or examining the prosecution possibilities? Because
certainly the evidence we have been given thus far is that that is
pursued.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000055">&#160;</a>

                  </div>much a cultural one as anything else, which is that when people are on
control orders, the view is that they have been dealt with. Somehow
they are contained, they have been dealt with, and they are not a
priority to the extent that people out there who are not under control
orders are. So people in prison and people under control orders are, to
an extent, contained. That has led to a situation in which there has
been a dearth of serious investigation into these
individuals.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000056">&#160;</a>

grapples with and acknowledges that—it was clearly acknowledged
during the course of the review. The Bill tries to grapple with that by
putting some sort of obligation on a chief constable to make a report
to the Home Secretary at regular intervals, but why do it that way? Why
do it in such a half-hearted way? Why not put the duty to investigate
not only at the heart of the Bill, but as a precondition to the sorts
of measures being imposed? It seems to me that, if you do that, you are
in the best of both worlds. No one can constitutionally object to the
measures and you have every impetus in the Bill to encourage
investigations, which, in turn, are the only process likely to result
in prosecution and then
imprisonment.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000057">&#160;</a>

issues arise. I think that the key comment is admissibility of
evidence. You know the challenges when a case is brought forward where
there is information and intelligence that may not be admissible but
that is highly persuasive and points to particular courses of action.
In such circumstances, where it may be determined that a prosecution
cannot be brought, are you saying that Government should not do
anything and that there is nothing they can do, because bail does not
seem to apply because there cannot be an ongoing investigation and you
have reached the determination that, based on the evidence, you cannot
bring a prosecution? Surely that is the crux of the argument that we

Traditionally, the way that a justice system would respond to that
would be to continue to investigate the individual. You do not reach a
point where you say, “We have investigated him. We
haven’t got the evidence. There’s nothing else we can do.
We will cease the investigation.” What you do is continue the
investigation and, meanwhile, if there are reasonable grounds to
suspect, which there plainly would be, you put the individual under
some form of restriction. That is what happens conventionally, and I
see no reason at all why the situation that you posit could not be
dealt with in the same way. An investigation into a crime such as
terrorism should not come to an end point. If there are continuing
suspicions about that individual, the investigation
continues.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000061">&#160;</a>

has been acquitted and there are no grounds to suspect that they have
been involved in anything other than the act for which they were
acquitted, I think that putting them under continuing restrictions is
deeply problematic. That is my answer. You may well say that, in those
circumstances, the Government have a duty to act, in spite of the fact
that they cannot do anything through the justice system, but we will
have to disagree philosophically on that. The Government have all sorts
of other powers at their disposal. They have agencies and very profound
forms of surveillance, which they can exercise in order to keep people
of that sort under control, as the Americans do. The Americans do not
have any form of control order, and European countries do not have
control orders of that sort. The traditional way to deal with the
problem that you have identified is surveillance and the gathering of
evidence. If someone has been involved in terrorism in the past, it is
more than likely, frankly, that they will be caught doing it
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000065">&#160;</a>

around relocation and curfews, but first I want to follow the
Minister’s point that you appear to be saying that police bail
is a preferable system to administrative restrictions, whether they be
control orders or TPIMs. Can you honestly say that you could put
somebody on two years’ police bail knowing that you cannot use
the intelligence that you have to bring that person into the criminal
justice system? Would that not be something of a sham whereby even
though you know you cannot use the intelligence that you have, you
adopt one set of procedures because they are connected to the criminal
justice system and have someone on police bail for two
years?<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000066">&#160;</a>

investigation. I would be very suspicious—I was when I was
DPP—of anyone who said to me, “We know something from
intelligence.” One wants to understand what the quality of that
intelligence is and what its character is. Intelligence, in my
experience, turns out to be wrong as often as it turns out to be right.
People who are professionally involved in intelligence will be honest
with you about that, if you catch them on their own. Intelligence is
sometimes right; it is sometimes wrong. You can always, with respect,
posit extreme examples that put the person who you are in a discussion
with into a corner. If you say to me, “We are absolutely certain
that someone has committed an offence. We are absolutely certain that
we are not going to get any evidence from them through an
investigation,” of course, that creates a difficulty for my
argument. However, I have never seen a case of that sort, and I did not
see a case of that sort in the five years that I was

the Director of Pubic Prosecutions said that he did not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 37<a class="bkMark" name="Column37">&#160;</a>
                  </div>think there was a great chance of getting evidence after you had made an
order or, indeed, after you had put somebody on police bail, because
they are then aware of surveillance. I think Deputy Assistant
Commissioner Osborne said that he thought it very unlikely that you
would be able to gather further evidence in those circumstances. Why
would police bail somehow be less of a problem and put the suspect on
less notice than either a control order or a TPIM? It seems that you
are reaching for this easy answer of police bail, as if it solves all
the problems, when we are dealing with things that are not easy to

admiration but whose role is protective rather than investigative. You
would change the culture if you had these sorts of measures
coincidental to and part of a police investigation, rather than as part

criticising the security services at all. I worked closely with them
when I was DPP, and I have huge respect for them but, on this issue,
they are wrong. We are more likely to lock these people up if we move

relocation, your views are very clear—you have opposed
relocation. We have heard evidence this morning from the DPP, from Lord
Carlile and from Deputy Assistant Commissioner Osborne that shows that
they regard relocation as probably the single most useful restriction
that can be imposed. Of the 12 existing control orders, nine of them
have a relocation provision. Of those 12 orders, half a dozen of the
people concerned reside in London and are likely to come back to London
once those restrictions are removed. They are likely to come back to
London by December this year, before the Olympics next year, which is a
huge security challenge for the whole country. Why are you so opposed
to the issue of relocation, which appears to be an extremely useful
tool in terms of

conditions. As long as a measure as severe as that is attached to the
justice system in the way I have described, I do not have a difficulty
with it. The problem with control orders is that they are a form of
administrative control that does not follow due process proceedings.
That is why I object to their more extreme form. If these measures are
part of a bail condition system—a due process criminal justice
system—they are perfectly appropriate. People are being subject
to relocation up and down the country as part of their bail conditions.
For me, this is an issue of principle. I am not saying that we do not
need these powers; my difficulty is where they are placed at the

suggestion that this could all be dealt with through the bail
mechanism, and police bail in particular. The measures associated with
either TPIMs or control orders are pretty draconian. Is it not better
to have them based on the reasonable belief of the Secretary of State
and reviewed by the High Court, rather than simply decided by a custody
sergeant in a police
station?<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000088">&#160;</a>

                  </em> You would need to have some sort of
mechanism for them getting there in the first place. You could have a
system, for example, where the Home Secretary applied to the High Court
to lift the bar on bail in terrorism cases, and if the High Court
agreed, the case could be passed to the police for investigation in the
way that I have described. There would have to be some kind of gateway
mechanism, and the Home Secretary would still have to play a role in
it. I agree with you about that, because these are such sensitive
investigations. It is because it is precisely likely that the measures
that were put in place as part of the bail conditions would be severe
that you would want some kind of entry mechanism before they were
passed to the police for that sort of process. I am quite sure,
however, that something along those lines could be designed quite
simply.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000089">&#160;</a>

Macdonald:</strong>
                  </em> There was a very strong view, which I
think was accepted by most people during the counter-terrorism review,
that control orders acted as an impediment to prosecution. That was
partly because the measures imposed prevented people from meeting,
talking and so on with co-conspirators. Normally, in a criminal
investigation, you would want to surveille all those sorts of
conversations, rather than closing them down, because that is apt to
produce evidence for
prosecution.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000107">&#160;</a>

is partly that, but there are a number of other reasons, some of which
I wouldn’t particularly want to go into in public, about how the
system works when it is operating. There are a number of reasons why,
when people are under control orders, the prospect of prosecution falls
away. Of all the people placed on relocation, only one has subsequently
been prosecuted. The people placed on relocation are those regarded as
the serious threat and those involved in the most serious terrorist
activity. It seems to me that the fact that only one of them has
subsequently been prosecuted is a failure of public
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000108">&#160;</a>

was very interested by what you said about the DPP having a role in the
process before the imposition of a control order or TPIM. I think you
said that, in your view, the DPP should issue a certificate prior to
the imposition of any alternative measures such as a TPIM or control
order. Would that be a certificate of insufficiency of evidence, either
under the full code test or the threshold
test?<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000114">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Lord
Macdonald:</strong>
                  </em> Under the old system, the DPP was
invariably asked at the time the order was going to be applied for
whether he thought there was sufficient evidence. Invariably, the
position was, “No, otherwise the control order would not have
been applied for.” I think that if you are going to have a
gateway system to enable measures to be applied to people, and if you
are going to tie it to a continuing investigation, that gateway system
ought to have some sort of statement from the DPP associated with it to
say that there is sufficient evidence to justify an investigation and
that an investigation should take place. It could then be passed to the
police with the bail measures then imposed. That is a rough sketch of
the
idea.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000115">&#160;</a>

Chakrabarti:</strong>
                  </em> From our point of view, we really
welcomed that argument. It might have been coming from the
prosecutorial side of things—from Lord Macdonald, who was
obviously an incredibly successful prosecutor in terror
cases—but it also chimes very well with our concerns about
fundamental rights and freedoms. There are some misunderstandings about
this debate, which obviously has been polarised over the years. No one
has an objection to putting restrictions on people’s movements
because they are considered to be a threat. Restrictions are put on
people’s movements. They are put on people’s movements
under pre-charge detention—we obviously have great arguments
about how long that should be for—and they can also be put on
people as part of pre-charge police bail. They can be put on
people’s movements as part of a community sentence post
conviction or a custodial sentence, and they can even be put on
people’s movements when they are released from prison under
licence.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000129">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
constitutional concern about the control order regime has always
been—and I do not need to remind members of the coalition
Government because they kept both Houses up all night in
2005—that it sits completely outside the criminal justice system
as an indefinite preventative measure. Separating this system
institutionally and legally from the criminal justice system makes the
difficulty permanent, because you basically decide at the beginning or
at some stage of an investigation that we have got some intelligence on
a person, but we will never be able to convert it into evidence that we
can use—whether for a terror offence, benefit fraud or anything
else. By the way, it would be good enough for me if this meant that you
could charge the person at some stage, and convict them if they are
guilty and put them in prison. With respect, Dr Huppert, you are right
and so was Lord Macdonald. If we can find a way to stitch restrictions
properly back into the traditional rule of law in this country and the
criminal justice system, that would be very welcome for
everyone.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000130">&#160;</a>

Metcalfe:</strong>
                  </em> On behalf of Justice, I agree with what
Shami has just said. I think an important point to bear in mind is that
the control order regime was in fact inspired by the immigration bail
conditions that were imposed on a suspect named M in 2004 by the
Special Immigration Appeals Commission precisely because he had mental
health difficulties with being in Belmarsh on an indefinite basis. Mr
Justice Collins imposed a series of bail restrictions, and in the
Belmarsh judgment by the House of Lords, Lord Bingham said that if bail
restrictions can be imposed on a person, it is a better way of dealing
with them than locking them up in prison indefinitely. I also agree
with Shami that what is primarily offensive about the control order
regime is not the idea of imposing restrictions on a person whom you
suspect of being involved in serious terrorist activity, but the way it
sidesteps the safeguards of our criminal justice system and the
foundation principles of the criminal justice
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000131">&#160;</a>

Korzinski:</strong>
                  </em> I come at this from a slightly different
perspective. I am not an expert on law or policy. What I am an expert
on is the impact that the control order regime has had on the people
who have been subjected to it. Since 2005, I have been working with
individuals whom, I guess, you could describe as the subjects of the
current conflict, if you want to put it in those terms. These are men
who have returned from Guantanamo Bay, people who have been subjected
to control orders or people who are at risk of being removed to
countries where they may be detained and tortured. The way in which I
come into it is that often I am instructed by solicitors to look at
what happens to the people. What I am concerned about in all
this—there are people on the panel who are far more expert than
me about the legal issues—is the absence of any sort of
safeguards with respect to the impact on the mental health of the
individuals who are subjected to these regimes. I can say quite
unequivocally that it has been catastrophic in all the cases that I
have worked
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000132">&#160;</a>

separation from family and loved ones—it is always outweighed by
security concerns. That is the area that I feel competent to talk to

want to come back to the issue of police bail. Would you be comfortable
with the idea that one could run a system of police bail that provided
at least as good security for the public, as well as at least as good a
chance of prosecution, as a TPIM or a control
order?<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000135">&#160;</a>

Chakrabarti:</strong>
                  </em> I am confident that you could have a
system that broadly replicates the TPIM in terms of the restrictions.
It is not ideal. I have to agree with Ms Blears that none of this is
easy, under any regime. The ideal, in terms of keeping the public safe,
is obviously arrest followed by a limited period of pre-charge
detention, and then charge and so on—do not pass go; do not
collect £500—so you are in custody all the way through
and there is evidence and you are convicted. Short of that, however,
ideally you would be putting someone under surveillance and
investigating them without tipping 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 44<a class="bkMark" name="Column44">&#160;</a>
                  </div>them off at all—with no control order and no bail
condition—for as long as you could achieve that with intensive
investigation and surveillance. However, if there comes a moment when
the risk to the public outweighs the benefit in an ongoing
investigation that does not tip people off, it is better, I
think—because you are more likely to get evidence in due course
and to have a charge and a prosecution—to go with a TPIM turned
into a bail condition than with this warehousing approach that broadly
replicates the control order
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
be reflective about the past 10 years—I wear specs now and my
hair is a little greyer than when I started complaining about
exceptional measures—and to be fair to the previous Government,
control orders were brought in relatively quickly after the Belmarsh
debacle, and since control orders were introduced in 2005, we have seen
some new ancillary criminal offences, such as acts preparatory to
terrorism and attending terror training camps. Some other criminal
justice-type measures were brought in by the previous Government that I
think would sit rather neatly with the criminal justice
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000137">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
big philosophical question in all this over the past decade, and it
continues now, has been whether everything changed so much on 9/11 that
we have to deal with terrorism outside the normal rule of
law—that this is war and not law any more—or whether we
need to modify our criminal justice system so that it is robust enough
to do what Lord Macdonald did so well and that we can do even better.
Obviously, I advocate the second approach, and I hope that now, as we
come to the 10th anniversary of the twin towers atrocity, all parties
might agree on that
ambition.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000138">&#160;</a>

do not understand why you say that it is more likely that evidence will
be gained to sustain a prosecution when somebody is on police bail,
rather than on a control order or a TPIM. The evidence that we heard
this morning from the Director of Public Prosecutions and Deputy
Assistant Commissioner Osborne was that it is most unlikely that, once
somebody is tipped off that they are under surveillance, they will
engage in activities that will give you evidence. I do not understand
the difference, that because you are on police bail you are somehow
more likely to be careless about how you use your computer, whom you
contact and associate with than you would be if you were on a TPIM. Why
do you think that is the
case?<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000140">&#160;</a>

not going to happen by magic. There is nothing magic about it. If we
call it police bail, and we do not call it a control order any more,
suddenly we are going to find evidence. Not at all—the crucial
difference is that you have now institutionally tied the police and

have had the privilege, and it may not have been such a pleasure for
the Home Secretaries concerned, to discuss these measures over the
years one-to-one with various Home Secretaries, who have been very
generous with their time. I remember a meeting with a Labour 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 45<a class="bkMark" name="Column45">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Home Secretary before the last election that was particularly important
to me and my colleagues. That Home Secretary said to me, I believe with
a genuinely heavy heart, “I am afraid that we haven’t
managed it. I don’t think we’re going to be able to do
away with control orders. There are still a handful of cases that are
very difficult, and I am really concerned about the risk. We have a
handful of files that are very sensitive and very difficult, so I
don’t think we’re able to do away with control
orders.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am grateful for that Home Secretary’s time. I remember turning
both to the Home Secretary and to the Home Office officials who were
sitting in the room—they were neither police officers, nor
prosecutors—and I said, “I appreciate what the Home
Secretary has said, but when you reviewed these files did you take the
advice of police and prosecutors to see whether any of this
intelligence can now be converted into evidence?” I am sorry to
say this, but there were red faces in that room. I was told by the
officials concerned that, no, the files were not being reviewed by
prosecutors because, of course, intelligence is different from
evidence. I said, “Well, of course I know intelligence is
different from evidence, but how are we ever going to look at ways of
converting intelligence into evidence and ways of following up
intelligence leads and turning them into evidence?” That is what

relatively unlikely that you will gain any more evidence from being on
police bail. The fundamental point is that it is an answer to a
different question, which is about harnessing this thing to the
criminal justice system. As much as I do not think that police bail
will gather much more evidence than control orders, you are likely to
marginally improve the system by having the police in charge of the

understand it, there is a two-year limit on the new TPIMs proposal, so
if we do not turn this into a proper criminal investigation with police
officers and prosecutors at the helm, what will happen after two years?
Will we just let people wander off into the sunset, or will we suddenly
concoct a way of issuing a new control order, and there still is not a
criminal investigator in charge of the
process?<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000152">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second answer is that, yes, if the system were abused, of course the
courts would say, “Are you really investigating; why is it
taking so long?” If there were a genuine good-faith
investigation, as no doubt happens in other cases—police bail is
the norm, by the way, in relation to other cases across the book, such
as organised fraud, serious crime, sex offences and murder, and those
are not all easy cases—the criminal courts and the High Court,
if necessary, would give a certain latitude to police and prosecutors
acting in good faith and demonstrating why a complex investigation was
taking time, perhaps even without the need for secret intelligence, but
having to co-operate with six different countries to convert our
intelligence into hard evidence, and to de-encrypt files. That is
another process that is easier, thanks to other measures that your
Government brought in, which now need to be reconsidered in the light
of attempting to move from preventive measures to the criminal justice
aspiration that you say you share.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000153">&#160;</a>

worth noting that in terrorism cases when a person is charged with a
terrorism offence there is often a considerable delay in the disclosure
of evidence in relation to the charge before they can challenge it.
They will not be on bail; they will be locked up, most likely in
Belmarsh, where people may spend up to six months before they have
sight of the evidence. We are not talking about a radically dissimilar
system of police powers between what goes on at the moment and when a

understanding Liberty’s argument. You are suggesting that the
sort of restrictive measures in control orders or the Bill should be
something on which a custody sergeant decides, as opposed to what is
proposed in the Bill, which is that the Secretary of State must have a
reasonable belief that an individual is involved in terrorism, which is
then subject to extensive review by the High Court. Is that not much
more satisfactory than having it decided by a custody sergeant in a
police station anywhere in the
country?<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000155">&#160;</a>

there would be a very good argument for lifting this above the level of
custody sergeant. I think I heard Lord Macdonald say—you will
correct me if I am wrong—that because you would not necessarily
want bail to be the norm in terror cases, and you would want pre-charge
detention in most instances, there could be a residual role for the
Home Secretary in deciding whether to lift the bar. The crucial
safeguard—this is what Liberty’s argument is
about—are the justifications for bail restrictions in the Bail
Act 1976 that apply in all other cases because they ensure the purpose
of the restriction, which is not indefinite warehousing because we have
given up on criminal investigations. The purpose is in the Bail Act.

custody sergeant. If police bail is offered in a serious organised
crime investigation, for example, which has been managed over 18 months
or two years, it will not fall to a custody sergeant to make the
decision to grant police bail. Such decisions will always be made in
consultation with, or at the direction of, senior officers, even a
chief constable, prosecutors and so on. I do not think we are comparing
like with like. The real analogy would be what a person who is facing a
two-year investigation by police in a drug importation case gets. It

subjective, it can be based on wrong information and it can be based on
information that might have been obtained overseas through methods that
we would not condone in the UK, so the type of review that will be

the review is any understanding of the impact of these
regimes—TPIMs, control orders—on the mental health and
well-being of the individuals and families concerned. That is a really
serious absence. As important as these discussions for the legal side
of this issue, for the seven years in which I have worked on this issue
it has been impossible to get people to think about the impact on the
mental health of the individuals involved. As important as the legal
principles are, there are other principles that have to do with the
individual’s experience of the regime and in turn with how that
experience is translated or communicated to the communities that are
often the most sensitive about these issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000162">&#160;</a>

“Could you fax it to me?” He said, “What are you
trying to get me to do? Breach? I can’t fax.” So we had
this conversation and he wrote something quite compelling. It is
probably not appropriate to share it, but I thought that it was
profound in terms of understanding what is going on with these
individuals.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000163">&#160;</a>

if that factor is not taken into consideration you are storing up
problems, because all the controlees I have worked with and
who have come off control orders have major mental health problems. You
see breakdowns within their families, and children who are completely
dysfunctional in school and who need support. With one guy,
the child was rubbing his faeces on the wall because of “what
happened to daddy”. There is something around the need to get to
grips with that part of it that I wish I could engage people in a
conversation about, because believe me— whatever policies you
come up with, the long-term issue is that you have to weigh those
policies up against the impact on these individuals and what the
long-term consequences are for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000164">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">That is what
I am working on at the moment. I have been in a privileged position; I
am only an expert because I have been working with the controlees for
as long as I have. I have had the experience of working in depth with
people who are considered the most at risk—the people who pose
the highest threat—and to get somebody from, let us say, some
part of the country to our foundation to do an
assessment in the old days was like getting blood from a stone. If
that person required treatment, they were told
they could go to the local GP. These guys will not go to the local GP,
so we need to engage with them and have conversations with them, and I
think that we need to talk to them. In my view, I think that that is
what is missing in all of this.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000165">&#160;</a>

serious issues such as national security, risk and terrorism, but with
these phrases—“extremism”,

down into what these words are. In my view, by the time that we start
formulating these Bills it is too late, because the issues are
really beginning in the families and the communities. They are
beginning with young people. We are not talking about outsiders; we are
talking about people who, for the most part, are English or people who
were refugees at one point but who are now British citizens. So by the
time that we create these laws, in my view it is too late. This has to

should be temporary in nature, in the same the way that legislation in

Metcalfe:</strong>
                  </em> I am sorry that I did. I do not mean to
suggest that the police have not been diligent in making their reports
under control order legislation but, as Lord Macdonald said in his
review, it had virtually no effect. To cite him chapter and verse, he
described the scrutiny provided by the process as “frankly
inadequate”. I do not think that putting an additional duty on
chief constables to report back annually to the Home Secretary will
greatly increase the quality of that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000173">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Under condition A—the first condition for
imposing a TPIMs order for the Home Secretary—we have moved from
reasonable suspicion required under control orders to asking the Home
Secretary to have a reasonable belief. We were told earlier this
morning that that was a considerable improvement. What is the
panel’s view?<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000180">&#160;</a>

Sankey:</strong>
                  </em> It is a marginal difference and perhaps only
semantic. It is nowhere near the standard of proof that you have in
civil cases which is, on the balance of probabilities, much further
away than “beyond reasonable doubt”, which you have if
you convict somebody in the criminal courts. The punishments can be
very similar to community sentences, but you are not anywhere near that
standard of proof, so I do not think that it makes much
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000181">&#160;</a>

                  </em> And it is not proof; it is all based on
secret intelligence. I am prepared to concede here and now that the
Home Secretary has “reasonable belief” rather
than “reasonable suspicion” when she has seen the secret
intelligence and passes a control order, but the point is that it is
unchallenged. It is secret. The suspect and his lawyers are not able to
probe it, so you can use all this legal language
such as “reasonable belief” and whatever, but this is not
a legal system. It is an administrative secret system. You can have all
tests you want, but they will not mean anything, because you do not
have a charge and an adversarial fair trial to follow.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000182">&#160;</a>

Metcalfe:</strong>
                  </em> The president of the Special Immigration
Appeals Commission said in 2003 that the standard of reasonable
suspicion was not an exacting standard for the Secretary of State to
meet. The standard of reasonable belief, which is already in place for
the asset-freezing legislation that Parliament passed last year, is
really only slightly more enhanced than reasonable suspicion. It is the
kind of distinction that you would teach to law students in an advanced
public law class. It is extremely difficult to explain the gradations
otherwise, and it is certainly far below the standard of proof that
would apply in an ordinary civil case about a road traffic dispute, for
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000183">&#160;</a>

a charge—that is the point. You get your due process and, to
take up Dr Korzinski’s point, you get to the end of this
Kafkaesque process down the road. It may be a long process, and you
could end up being acquitted, having been banged up or under
restrictions for years, but at least you can stand outside the Old
Bailey saying, “Justice has been done and I have been
vindicated”. The problem with these administrative, shadowy,
quasi-judicial systems is that they potentially go on for ever and you
never know why.<a class="bkMark" name="11062224000186">&#160;</a>
