<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis) to move the sittings 
motion, I should inform the Committee that I have selected the amendment to it in the name of the 
hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope).
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. 
I apologise to you, to the hon. Members for Christchurch and for Ceredigion and to all members of 
the Committee. Somewhat strangely, I have an Adjournment debate at 1 pm today, and will therefore 
have to leave the Committee at approximately seven minutes to 1 o’clock.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We shall miss the hon. Lady badly. Thank you for your courtesy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cynog Dafis </B>(Ceredigion): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, if proceedings on the Road Traffic Reduction (United Kingdom Targets) Bill are not 
completed at this day’s sitting, the Committee do meet on Thursday 19th March at half-past Ten 
o’clock and half-past Four o’clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am confident that the sittings motion should provide sufficient time for the completion of the 
Committee’s debate of the Bill. It will enable us to continue until midday on Friday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion, leave out 
from first ‘March’ to end and add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘, Monday 23rd March, Tuesday 24th March and Wednesday 25th March at half-past Ten 
o’clock.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I pointed out during the Committee’s first sitting that the hon. Member for Ceredigion had not 
moved a sittings motion. There was, therefore, no debate upon the matter and I presumed that the 
Committee would meet on Wednesday mornings until our proceedings were completed. That is what 
occurred in the case of the Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill, and a motion to that effect was 
moved on 17 December at the beginning of that Committee’s proceedings. That Bill was supported by 
411 hon. Members on its Second Reading, but despite that strong level of support the Bill’s sponsors 
did not request more than one sitting of the Committee a week.
<P>
There is a stark contrast between the approach of the sponsors of the Wild Mammals (Hunting 
with Dogs) Bill and that of the sponsors of the Bill that we are debating. There was no attempt to push 
the Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill through Committee without proper consideration of its 
contents.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Ceredigion will accept my amendment to the sittings motion. It 
would enable the Committee to sit next week if our business remains unfinished at the end of this 
week. It would also enable members of the Committee to participate in the important Budget debate 
that will take place on Thursday afternoon.
<P>
The Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill would dramatically change the law of the land, 
but it is ironic that the Road Traffic Reduction (United Kingdom) Bill would not change the law at all 
if it were to pass on to the statute book in its current emasculated form. Neither the Bill, nor the 
amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Ceredigion, will change the law.
<P>
I am worried that the Bill’s supporters are supplying the public with misleading information. I 
recently acquired a Friends of the Earth document, a briefing on the Road Traffic Bill, that refers to 
me and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N. Fowler). It sets out the 
Friends of the Earth’s Road Traffic Reduction Bill campaign and states that the organisaion has been 
campaigning for the Bill for several years and believes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the Government should set targets for reducing traffic levels on our roads. The Government 
should then draw up plans to provide alternatives to the car, encourage cycling and walking and 
change planning law to reduce the need to travel, in order to meet those targets.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The document reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“FOE have proposed a target for a 10 per cent. traffic reduction by the year 2010”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which it describes as “challenging, but achievable.” It seeks in aid the advice of Professor John 
Whitelegg, who was an adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister. The document goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The target would not require a 10 per cent. traffic reduction in every region of the UK—we 
accept that traffic reduction in some areas will be more difficult than in others. Indeed, in some areas 
much needed redevelopment may lead to a local increase in traffic, and the Bill would allow 
this.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have tabled an amendment, which has yet to be debated, that reflects that point, and I pay 
tribute to  the hon. Member for Ceredigion for having put his name to that amendment, which he has 
accepted on behalf of the Bill’s sponsors. Not surprisingly, the document circulated by Friends of the 
Earth gives me no credit for having tabled an amendment that has been accepted by the promoter and 
adopted by Friends of the Earth.
<P>
The document goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“However, a national target does need to be set if we are to tackle the problems of air pollution, 
climate change, noise, road danger, threat to wildlife and wildlife sites”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on. It then describes the Bill’s current situation, stating that about 420 Members have 
declared their support for it, and says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“As a result, the Government agreed to support a Bill requiring the setting of national traffic 
reduction targets.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
But, of course, the Bill does not—and would not, if amended as proposed—require the setting of 
national traffic reduction targets. Although that requirement is set out in the Bill, the Secretary of 
State is exempted from having to comply with it. The Bill’s sponsors are misleading themselves if 
they say that the Bill requires the setting of national road traffic reduction targets.
<P>
The document goes on candidly to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Unfortunately, we have so far failed to persuade them”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the Government—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“that the target should be for a 10 per cent. reduction by 2010. However, establishing the 
principle of traffic reduction targets is an extremely important step forward, so FOE agreed to work 
with the Government on a compromise Bill (the Road Traffic Reduction (UK Targets) Bill)”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An amendment that would remove the reference to the United Kingdom has been tabled with 
Government support. There is no reference to that in the updated description of the current situation.
<P>
The document says that this compromise Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“leaves the level of the target to be decided by Government, after a report to Parliament.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another of the amendments that the promoter and sponsors propose to support would remove the 
word “Parliament” from the requirement to publish the targets in a report to Parliament. Again, the 
Bill’s supporters are misrepresenting the situation to people who read their circular. The Bill not only 
leaves the level of the targets to be decided by the Government, as the document points out, but leaves 
the Government to decide whether there should be a target.
<P>
The document continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We will certainly continue to call for a 10 per cent. target—we still believe that it is a sensible 
level to aim for—but are currently working to establish the principle of national targets first.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The document goes on to describe my involvement in the process. It states that the Bill passed 
Second Reading on 30 January. It omits to state, however, that I spoke in that debate and that I 
supported much of the thinking expressed there, and said that the Opposition did not wish to object to 
Second Reading, but wanted to amend the Bill in Committee. The document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“At this stage a number of amendments are usually made to improve the Bill and correct any 
drafting errors.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It states that I have tabled about 30 amendments. The record shows that that is a significant 
exaggeration. It is no surprise that Friends of the Earth does not refer to the fact that supporters of the 
Bill, and indeed the hon. Member for Ceredigion, have moved a large number of amendments and 
new clauses. The hon. Gentleman has put his name to new clause 4, which I proposed, and he has 
adopted another of my proposed amendments.
<P>
I am delighted that, because of the debate during the Committee’s first sitting, the hon. 
Gentleman has tabled an amendment that reflects concerns expressed on both sides of the Committee 
Room about the need to differentiate for disabled people and for taxis. That is a good example of why 
it is sensible to keep a couple of days or so between sittings. Otherwise, it is not possible for the 
promoter to table an amendment that reflects the Committee’s debate and will be in order at a 
subsequent sitting.
<P>
That is probably one of the reasons why it is a convention for Committees considering public 
Bills promoted by the Government to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and for Committees 
considering Bills promoted by Members under the private Member’s Bill procedure to meet on 
Wednesday mornings.
<P>
The document goes on to misrepresent the tenor of the Committee’s discussion in the previous 
sitting. I shall not speak at length about that under the sittings motion. It says that I was calling
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“for a 10 per cent. national traffic reduction target to be set”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as with the base of 1990. As I made clear, I was simply seeking to ascertain from the 
Government and from the promoter why the target that was set in the original Bill, which was 
circulated to supporters of Friends of the Earth, was removed. I hope that the Committee will find out, 
when discussing the relevant amendments, whether the Government support the principle of having a 
national traffic reduction target in absolute terms.
<P>
In the light of yesterday’s Budget announcement, it seems that the Government are now on a 
very different course. They seem to accept that there will be a significant increase in road traffic that 
they will reduce by a minute percentage.
<P>
That is much in line—perhaps to my embarrassment—with the arguments that I put forward at 
the first sitting. I said that there was a strong argument for concentrating on reductions in the rate of 
growth rather than having arbitrary absolute reductions overall without spelling out how they were to 
be achieved.
<P>
Unfortunately, Friends of the Earth goes no to misrepresent Conservative party policy in its 
document. It alleges that because of our—and, indeed, my—position we will not be able to achieve the 
air-quality targets that the Conservative Government set. There is no evidence to substantiate that.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Table 5.3 of the Budget report shows that increasing the duty differential for ultra low-sulphur 
diesel will reduce particulates by 20 per cent. and NO. by up to 2 per cent. An abundance of evidence 
already suggests that those targets will have been achieved to a significant extent by the period 
covered by the Bill.
<P>
As a result of the policies promoted by the previous Government, cleaner fuels and 
improvements in technology will result in a fall in emissions of PM10s to one third of their peak 1990 
levels by the year 2010—an absolute reduction of one third since that base date.We had a debate about 
PM10s at our previous sitting, and I am delighted that the Government have followed the reasoning 
that I advanced. I said that we should take action against the high incidence of PM10 emissions in 
urban areas from traditional diesel, old buses and heavy goods vehicles. The Budget contains 
measures to deal with that.
<P>
Nothing that I have said in our debate and nothing in Conservative party policy suggests that we 
should do anything other than go for higher levels of air quality. It was, indeed, the Conservative 
Government who promoted the idea of an air quality strategy. I am supportive of the fact that the 
Government are continuing down that route. To suggest, as the Friends of the Earth paper does, that 
my comments or actions undermine that strategy is mischievous and inaccurate. I take exception to 
such behaviour; it does no credit to Friends of the Earth.
<P>
The document suggests that the Conservative party position has changed from what it was when 
we were in government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Surely a 
document produced by Friends of the Earth is not a matter for discussion by the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If it is relevant to the business before the Committee, it probably is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) might know that the Bill is 
prompted by Friends of the Earth, Plaid Cymru and the Green party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. I have 
listened carefully to the contribution made by the hon. Member for Christchurch. I understood that we 
were considering the sittings motion. Some time has elapsed, and I have tried to discover where we 
are going in terms of the sittings motion, but I am having some difficulty. Will you advise me, Mr. 
Stevenson, as a new Member? For how long will the process continue?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I cannot say how long it will go on for because I am in the hands of members of 
the Committee—provided that they adhere to the Committee’s procedures. I am advised that it is 
generally accepted that sittings motions offer an opportunity for wide-ranging debate. I ask members 
of the Committee not to push those boundaries too far. I assure members of the Committee, however, 
that I shall take fully into account the wide-ranging nature of the debate when we come to clause 
stand part debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. I note from the interventions that there seems to be 
reluctance on the part of Labour Members to address the real issues, although I hope that that is not 
so.
<P>
Without any doubt, there has been an attempt to misrepresent to supporters of Friends of the 
Earth the position that I have adopted in Committee and on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn </B>(Islington, North): On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. What is the relevance 
to the sittings motion of correspondence between Friends of the Earth and the hon. Gentleman? The 
sittings motion will enable us to deal with amendments that will raise the very issues on which the 
hon. Gentleman is now droning.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have already made a plea to members of the Committee not to push the 
boundaries of the conventions on sittings motions; I can do no more than plead with hon. Members to 
comply. By and large, I am in hon. Members’ hands in that regard.
<P>
I am anxious to ensure that reference to any correspondence or report is relevant to the business 
before the Committee, in line with the pretty wide-ranging debate to which sittings motions, by 
convention, have always been subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Stevenson, for defending me once again.
<P>
This is a serious matter. Friends of the Earth is circulating propaganda to my constituents and 
those of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield which is entirely at odds with the 
truth. I am surprised that Labour Members are not concerned about that. It may be that Friends of the 
Earth is not familiar with the position of Parliament and hon. Members responsibility to ourselves, 
our constituents and the nation to debate these issues and to ask what may be awkward questions. It is 
most unfortunate that despite the progress that we have made—progress resulting from amendments 
that I have tabled, which we have debated and which have been considered on their merits by the hon. 
Member for Ceredigion—the people behind the Bill are misleading themselves as to its intention.
<P>
Without legislation, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions 
could, if he so wished, announce United Kingdom road traffic targets. Indeed, he may announce such 
targets in the White Paper that is due out in May without having to seek the leave or approval of any 
hon. Member. Without legislation, the Secretary of State could, if he so wished, produce a report on 
the entire topic.
<P>
Under the Bill, the Secretary of State is under no obligation to do anything. He does not have to 
set a target or targets for road traffic reduction,  and he does not have to make a report to Parliament 
within a time scale—or at all. His only obligation—which, by convention, he delegates to a junior 
Minister—is to be represented in this Committee and to engage in what I describe as a charade. This 
is not a Bill of great moment; it is quite the opposite. It is gesture legislation—the legislative 
equivalent of mood music. 
The Bill is truly irrelevant to tackling the real issue before our nation and the House of Commons—
the increase in road traffic.
<P>
The sittings motion may come to be cited in the history of Parliament as the earliest example of 
Dafi’s law: the more inconsequential the legislation, the greater the urgency with which it must be 
promoted. What is the great hurry? What is the destination? How has such a measure, promoted with 
deep sincerity, become but a mirage? If the hon. Member for Ceredigion or anyone else dreamt of 
forcing the Government to set real road traffic reduction targets, it is clear that those dreams are now 
illusions. The Bill is an empty vessel. We should not be spending time debating it in Committee while 
the Budget is being debated in the House of Commons. My amendment would enable the Committee 
to sit just as frequently, and within the same time scale, as the hon. Gentleman proposed in his 
sittings motion. We could have just as many Committee sittings between now and Wednesday of next 
week, as the hon. Gentleman wanted, but my amendment would ensure that those sittings took place 
in the morning rather than the afternoon. In that way, members of the Committee and, indeed, you, 
Mr. Stevenson, could participate in  the Budget debate on Thursday and Monday afternoons and in 
the all-important continuing debate on the School Standards and Framework Bill on Tuesday.
<P>
If this Bill were the most momentous legislation to come before the House of Commons, that 
would have to be weighed against the other arguments about the convenience of members of the 
Committee discussing other matters on the Floor of the House. In my submission, however, the Bill 
does not come into that category.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps asking me to give way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Christchurch will give way if he is minded to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I think that it is the second time that the hon. Gentleman has asked me to give way. 
[Interruption.] I am sorry, his first intervention was on a point of order. I shall give way in a minute.
<P>
The amended sittings motion would enable members of the Committee to participate in debates 
as I have described. What I would describe as a minor Bill and by any standards does not warrant 
prime-time debate.
<P>
The sittings motion could have been discussed with members of the Committee. There is a 
convention in the House of Commons that quite often such issues are discussed between the two Front 
Benches. That has not happened in this case, which is a disappointment to me.
<P>
As can be seen, I am not opposed to the Bill having just as much time as is needed to expose to a 
wider audience the charade that it represents. The Bill will doubtless go on to Report, and I predict 
that its promoter and supporters will try to transfer blame for its inadequacies on to people like me 
who have tried and will continue to try to improve it, and in so doing to challenge the Government to 
declare their policy on road traffic reduction targets.
<P>
Is it the Government’s policy to reduce the overall amount of traffic on our roads? If so, how will 
they achieve that? Why are they targeting overall traffic rather than congestion, pollution and the 
accidents engendered by those problems? I hope that in however much time that it takes to discuss the 
remainder of the Bill, the Minister will answer those questions.
<P>
I have sympathy with the hon. Member for Ceredigion. He had reason to believe, in the light of 
the support for the early-day motion, and having been successful in the ballot, that he was well on the 
way to making his mark on the statute book with a piece of legislation that changed the law and 
required the Government to do something they might prefer not to do. The Bill, which it is proposed 
to emasculate further, is a sad reflection on the extent to which pressure has been put on the hon. 
Gentleman to withdraw from his original line.
<P>
I hope that members of the Committee will accept my amendment in the spirit in which it has 
been moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I object to that amendment. I do not intend to respond to what is in effect the Second 
Reading speech of the hon. Member for Christchurch. Most of the issues that he raised were debated 
thoroughly then.
<P>
May I first apologise to the hon. Gentleman for inadvertently referring to him at our previous 
sitting as “the Minister”? I do not know why I did so. however, his surname reminds me of Trollope 
and his constituency is called Christchurch, so perhaps I was thinking of ministers of religion, coming 
as I do from a non-conformist background.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the Bill would not change the law. I do not know what he means 
by that; it would certainly change the face of Britain if it were implemented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> No, I shall not give way.
<P>
The  Bill requires the Government to set targets or to provide another process that would achieve 
the same aim. Therefore, it is certainly not gesture legislation.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Christchurch proceeds with his present line of action, he will be seen 
and, by association, his party may be seen as seeking to obstruct the progress of the Bill. Time is now 
of the essence. There is enormous support for the Bill in the House and it is important that it reaches 
the statute book. I therefore reject the hon. Gentleman’s amendment to the sittings motion.

<P>
Hon. Members will note that an additional amendment has been added to the group: No. 51.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I shall not take much longer to promote this group of amendments, but hon. 
Members will notice that amendment No. 51 would remove “adverse” from line 18 in front of 
“impacts”. The Secretary of State should have regard to all the impacts of road traffic, beneficial and 
adverse, when he produces a report, if that is what he chooses to do when the Bill reaches the statute 
book.
<P>
One of the main elements of this group of amendments in my name is to flush out the promoter’s 
and the Government’s true response to the implications of the original idea that there should be a 10 
per cent. reduction in 1990 road traffic levels by the year 2010.
<P>
In 1990, cars and taxis travelled 335.9 billion vehicle km, light goods vehicles travelled 35.7 
billion km and heavy goods vehicles travelled 29.1 billion km. I shall not refer to public service 
vehicles because of the Committee’s majority decision during discussion of clause 1 not to include 
them in the debate.
<P>
Road traffic in 1990 totalled 405.3 billion vehicle km. To achieve 90 per cent. of that total would 
mean reducing the vehicle kilometres travelled by cars and taxis to 300 billion km, by light goods 
vehicles to 32 billion km and by heavy goods vehicles to 26 billion km. That would produce a total of 
364.8 billion vehicle km.
<P>
In 1996, the most recent year for which figures are available, cars and taxis travelled 362.4 
billion vehicle km, light goods vehicles 40.4 billion km and heavy goods vehicles 30.7 billion km. 
That is a total of 438.3 billion vehicle km. In their document “National Road Traffic Forecasts (Great 
Britain) 1997”, the Government forecast that by 2010 a total of 561 billion vehicle km would be 
travelled on British roads—460.25 billion km of which would be by cars and taxis, and 57.81 billion 
km by light goods vehicles.
<P>
In round figures, there is a gap of almost 200 billion vehicle km between the Government’s 
forecast for road traffic in 2010 and the amount that there would be in 2010 if the Government 
accepted the policy proposed by the hon. Member for Ceredigion, and supported by the Minister on 
Hampstead high street. In anybody’s language, 200 billion km is significant.
<P>
The total of vehicle kilometres travelled in Britain grew at 3 per cent. a year between 1976 and 
1986. Between 1986 and 1996, growth was 3.3 per cent a year. The Bill’s supporters and the Minister 
support a real reduction in the vehicle kilometres travelled in the period from 1996 onwards.
<P>
The latest information that we have is published in the Financial Statement and Budget Report, 
which has only become available since the Committee’s previous sitting. The Chancellor of the 
Exchequer yesterday made much of the environmental case for increasing fuel duty for the third time 
in 16 months. It is now 20 per cent. higher than when the Government entered office.
<P>
The Government’s forecast document contains a helpful table explaining the impact of the duty 
on the number of vehicle kilometres travelled. However, the Chancellor did not refer to that in his 
statement. Instead, he chose to refer to millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide—not a particularly 
meaningful measurement to ordinary people.
<P>
However, I am a great believer in giving credit where it is due, and the Chancellor has said that 
the fuel duty increases will result in a reduction of around 3 billion car km by 2010, compared with 
present estimates. So on the basis of what was presented in the Budget yesterday, the gap between 
what the supporters of the Bill are asking for—which the Minister supported—and what the 
Chancellor predicts on the basis of present Government policy will be only 193 billion vehicle km.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> Nobody imagines that the escalator can achieve the reductions that we are discussing; 
a whole raft of policies are needed. They are familiar to people who have studied the issue. The targets 
will be achieved through an integrated policy, not through one mechanism such as the escalator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I hope that he will tell the Committee how he 
thinks that it will be possible to reduce the amount of traffic on our roads by the order of 195 billion 
vehicle km by 2010. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman refers to the fuel price escalator. In its submission to the pre-Budget 
consultation, Friends of the Earth mentioned a fuel price escalator of at least 8 per cent. and implied 
that that would make a significant difference. We know from observations made by a number of other 
commentators that fuel price hikes will not cause a significant reduction; that is reflected in the 
figures in the documents issued by the Chancellor.
<P>
How is that vast gap to be bridged? How will history be defied? Mr. Bailey, an advisor to the 
hon. Member for Ceredigion, helpfully wrote to me to say that that reduction would be possible and 
that he was prepared to explain to me exactly how it could be achieved. If that is right, and if the 
Government accept that it can be achieved, why do the Government not support the target set in the 
earlier versions of the Bill?
<P>
The only other element of the package for environmental improvement in the Budget was the 
increases in the scale charges for free fuel provided for company cars. Again, I know that Friends of 
the Earth has been campaigning for that and referred to it in its pre-Budget statement. To put the 
issue into context, the total effect of the increases in those scale charges announced yesterday will be 
to reduce car kilometres by 300 million by the year 2010. That is one tenth of the impact of the fuel 
duty increases, and a pinprick compared to the size of the target reduction that the hon. Member for 
Ceredigion wishes the Government to adopt.
<P>
I am delighted that we have an opportunity to discuss this issue today, in the immediate 
aftermath of the Budget. Far too many people do not realise what is happening under the 
Government’s policy on road traffic. By their every move, the Government—who have been in office 
for almost a year—are accepting the reality, which lies behind the amendment, that road traffic will 
increase and that we should deal with its adverse impact.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> Does not what the hon. Gentleman is saying emphasise the importance of putting the 
bill on the statue book? The Bill will oblige the Government to address the issues that he thinks they 
are failing to address.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> If the Bill contained a date by which it must be implemented, I could understand the 
hon. Gentleman’s point. However, if an amendment that he tabled is agreed it will contain no date by 
which the Government need to do anything, let alone produce a report. It has been suggested that it is 
unreasonable to ask the Government to set any target until they know what targets local authorities 
have set. Local authorities are required to set targets under the Road Traffic Act 1997, which was 
enacted under the previous Conservative Government, but they do not have to do so until June 1999.
<P>
Shortly after Second Reading, an article in The Guardian stated that the Government’s 
behaviour was extremely cynical—it was designed to give the impression that the Government were 
in favour of road traffic reduction targets, but to ensure that they would not have to produce any target 
until just before the next general election, so there would be no targets against which their 
achievement could be measured.
<P>
From the figures that I have given, it is apparent that, if hon. Members are concerned about the 
levels of road traffic, action must be taken now, not deferred. Yet, by tabling amendments that the 
Government agree with, the hon. Member for Ceredigion will enable the Government to get off the 
hook that he wants them to be on.
<P>
Other aspects of the Budget—for example, those on public transport, to which I shall not refer—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am happy to accept that matters in the Budget statement can be debated 
if they are relevant to the Bill, but I do not want the Budget debate to be rehearsed in Committee. That 
would be unacceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. That is exactly what I was saying before you called me to 
order. 
<P>
I hope that the promoter and the Minister will take up the issues I have raised in responding to 
the debate. I said that I would not take long in moving the amendment, so I shall now finish—I hope 
that no one will urge me to carry on.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I shall be brief. We perceive no value in the amendments. The hon. Member 
for Christchurch says that he wants the Bill to be examined but tries to preclude the Committee’s 
ability to do so, as has been shown in the previous sitting and this morning. The amendments add 
nothing to the Bill. Despite the hon. Gentleman’s contempt for the Bill and despite his statement that 
people would not understand it, it is astonishing that he believes that the majority of people would not 
understand what is meant by a reduction in carbon emissions, when they are suffering from the excess 
of such emissions, which have an effect on their health and their children’s. Every member of the 
Committee, with the exception of the hon. Member for Christchurch, views the Bill as a valuable start 
to slowing the apparently inexorable increase in vehicles on the road. The Government are committed 
to reducing traffic and to placing environmental considerations at the heart of all our policies. It is 
absurd to mislead the Committee into believing, as the hon. Member for Christchurch tried to do, that 
the Bill will not bring about the changes that the whole of Parliament wants. The Bill was 
overwhelmingly supported on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Sir Raymond Whitney </B>(Wycombe): The Minister said that the amendment would add nothing to 
the Bill. The Bill lays upon the Secretary of State a duty to set targets but absolves him from the 
responsibility to publish specific targets. The amendment proposes such publication so even if the 
Minister does not agree with it, she cannot say that the amendment would add nothing—it would add 
a tooth to a toothless Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> With respect, the Minister can say whatever she believes. I accept that that does not 
automatically make me right, but it does not automatically make me wrong. If we add to a Bill it 
should be to improve it. The amendment and the other amendments tabled by the hon. Member for 
Christchurch would not improve the Bill. Indeed, far from wishing to improve it, the hon. Gentleman 
wishes to delay its passage. I strongly urge him to withdraw the amendments, but if he does not do 
so—
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No. If he does not do so, I strongly urge all members of the Committee to vote 
against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> If that is the sum total of the Minister’s response to our debate this morning and in 
the previous sitting, I hope that a much wider audience will note how unacceptably trite it is. The 
Minister sits there as though she has every right to go down Hampstead high street and tell her 
constituents that she is in favour of specific targets for reducing road traffic by 2010 to 90 per cent. of 
its 1990 level, but she has performed a volte face that she is now unwilling to defend. She is also 
unwilling to tell us whether an absolute reduction in road traffic is Government policy; she said 
merely that it is Government policy to reduce the increase. If she thinks that that is the right 
approach, she should accept my amendments which deal with reducing the increase.
<P>
It is a travesty of our proceedings for the Minister to avoid answering the points that have been 
raised and for the promoter to sit silently concurring with the Minister. The Minister has driven a 
coach and horses through a Bill for which she has long been campaigning. She has not confronted the 
issues raised by her hon. Friends and many other hon. Members when they supported the concept of 
real road traffic reductions. Will the Minister answer the question: does she agree with absolute 
reductions in the United Kingdom’s road traffic, or not? I shall give way to her if she wants to answer 
my question.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and I am happy to answer his question. I 
thought that I had made the position clear, but I now realise that in order to facilitate the hon. 
Gentleman’s understanding and to ensure that the arguments are not beyond his grasp, I shall have to 
be infinitely more precise in my choice of words. For his benefit, I shall restate the position as simply 
as I can.
<P>
It is absurd for the hon. Gentleman to assume that the majority of the amendments that he tabled 
could possibly have the desired effect. My argument—which, I am sure, will be endorsed by all 
Committee members—is that there should be a reduction in road traffic. The idea that one small, 
isolated Bill can contain all the relevant proposals that are necessary for that reduction is absurd.
<P>
Moreover, the hon. Gentleman undermined his own argument. When he first spoke this 
morning, he argued that the Bill was irrelevant and unworthy of anyone’s time, and he suggested that 
we should spend our time trying to catch Madam Speaker’s eye in the Budget debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister continues to astonish me.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am delighted to hear that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister says that she is delighted to hear that. She said that her objective is to 
reduce the overall, absolute amount of road traffic. I have put forward arguments and deployed figures 
and statistics—with which she did not quarrel—that make it plain as a pikestaff that the Government 
will not achieve the objective of reducing road traffic by 10 per cent., compared with the figures for 
1990, by 2010. Indeed, the trend is in the opposite direction, and the Government recognise that there 
will be a significant increase in road traffic between this year and 2010, let alone between 1990 and 
2010.
<P>
The Minister said that my amendments would not add anything to the Bill, but some of them 
would restore it to the form it was in when she signed a petition in Hampstead and Highgate calling 
for the reductions to which my hon. Friend the Member for Wycome (Sir R. Whitney) referred, and 
which people outside the House still think are the Bill’s core. I find it breathtaking that the Minister is 
now abandoning any intention of promoting targets and that she absolves herself and the Deputy 
Prime Minister of any responsibility for setting targets or for reaching them. The Minister’s 
demeanour will get her into considerable difficulties. A great body of opinion outside the House 
demands that something should be done about road traffic levels in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I recall the halcyon days of the previous Government’s 
transport Bill—he steered it through the House—when we had similar debates in this very Committee 
Room. Would not his proposals increase rather than decrease the amount of traffic on the roads? He is 
even further away from public opinion than he was during his ill-fated attempts to build a motorway 
across Twyford down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> My efforts to ensure that the M3 was completed had a successful conclusion. The 
tens of thousands of motorists who travel along it every week happen to have a debt of gratitude to me 
personally because I ensured that the project had a successful conclusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Would it be in order to table a manuscript 
amendment proposing that the M3 be renamed the Chope motorway?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Whatever title is attributed to that motorway, I am worried that we may begin a 
debate about the merits or otherwise of the M3. Although I appreciate that roads play a role in traffic 
volume, I hope that hon. Members will not go down that particular motorway with the vigour that 
they are demonstrating at the moment.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> As the Committee is in good humour, I can tell the hon. Member for Islington, 
North (Mr. Corbyn) that when my children travel with me in the car down that motorway, they refer 
to it as Daddy’s road, with good reason.
<P>
I shall pause a while. Although the Minister showed a total inability to answer my questions, my 
hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe might be more successful in pointing out the error of her ways.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Raymond Whitney:</B> I am glad to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch say that 
humour has been restored to the Committee, but in 20 years in the House, I have never heard a 
Minister address a Committee in a tone of such arrogance and contempt, with a complete refusal to 
discuss the issues. The essential element of the Committee, as I am sure you, Mr. Stevenson, are 
aware, is to discuss calmly the intellectual challenge of the issues while our party differences remain 
in place. The hon. Lady conspicuously failed to do that, and she resorted to an intemperate attack on 
my hon. Friend. I hope that her future contributions will be of a higher level.
<P>
The Minister said that we cannot include the whole range of traffic reduction measures in this 
small private Member’s Bill. Of course not. Although we could argue whether targets are necessary 
and ask why there are no targets in other areas of our national life, we understand that we must do 
something about the challenges and pressures presented to our society and economy by an increase in 
road traffic. However, even if we accept the straightforward and simple proposition that targets to 
reduce road traffic are good, I fear that the Government, who came into office with great éclat, have 
no idea what to do. The more they hold and postpone reviews, the less clear it becomes that they have 
an answer. The Minister’s response has made that even clearer.
<P>
We have an opportunity to put one tooth into what is—I must tell the promoter, the hon. 
Member for Ceredigion—a toothless Bill. Why we are wasting time on a toothless Bill? The Minister 
can argue the content, but at least with one tooth it would set some targets. Why can the Minister and 
the promoter not accept that the targets in the amendment give the Bill the chance to make a 
contribution?
<P>
Finally, I have had the good fortune, in more than 10 years as a Back Bencher, of coming five or 
six times in the top 20 of the private Member’s Bill ballot. That is a great privilege and opportunity. 
When one has that privilege it should be used constructively within the parameters of the realities of 
the House, which we all know. It is a waste of an opportunity to indulge in gesture politics, 
especially—I suspect that this is happening now—if the private Member falls within the thrall of the 
Government Department concerned. Our privileges as private Members should be used fully. I am 
disappointed that the more we see of the Bill, the less likely it seems to make a sensible contribution 
to our legislation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Sir Raymond Whitney:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Has the hon. Gentleman finished?
<P>
<B>Sir Raymond Whitney:</B> Indeed, yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Sir R. Whitney) for his 
comments. I note again that the Minister will not respond. The Bill’s promoter also will not 
respond—he has not risen to speak, and if he does not catch the Chairman’s eye, he cannot do so. Am 
I right to think that the hon. Member for Ceredigion does not want to speak on the group of 
amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I shall speak about targets when we consider amendment No. 40 and subsequent 
amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> As I understand it, amendment No. 40 is included in the group that we are 
discussing. If the hon. Gentleman intends to speak about targets, which have provoked much debate, I 
shall sit down and listen to him. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe said, it would be 
unfortunate to miss an opportunity to consider targets seriously. I look forward to hearing the 
comments of the hon. Member for Ceredigion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> To give the hon. Gentleman an opportunity to do that, I shall call the hon. 
Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake).
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake </B>(Carshalton and Wallington): I want to speak to amendment No. 40. I support 
the Bill, and welcome the support of one Conservative Front Bench Member, the right hon. Member 
for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). In a letter to a constituent, he wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“I support the broad objectives of the Road Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Bill. I can 
confirm that I will not take steps to block this Bill.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Christchurch has adopted the same constructive 
attitude. He has made some important points, and I sympathise with his comments on targets, but it is 
a pity that other amendments tabled by him contradict the important points, which are lost in a sea of 
verbiage. It is hard not to conclude that he is attempting to destroy the Bill single handed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Islington, North and I tabled amendment No. 40, which would require the 
Secretary of State’s report on road traffic reduction to include information on the way in which traffic 
could be reduced by 10 per cent. from 1990 levels. The amendment would not commit the 
Government to the 10 per cent. reduction, but the Government should shadow targets. Several 
Ministers, when in Opposition and more recently, reiterated their commitment to a 10 per cent. 
reduction in road traffic. As members of the Committee know, 435 Members supported that. Thirty 
Ministers, including the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 
also back it.
<P>
The amendment would provide guidance and establish targets that could be shadowed. 
Therefore, I hope that the Minister and the hon. Member for Ceredigion will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> I am associated with most of the amendments that we are discussing, especially 
amendment No. 42.
<P>
I support the best achievable traffic reduction target. The amendments that the hon. Member for 
Carshalton and Wallington and I have tabled are not meant to wreck the Bill. They compliment the 
Bill and the campaign. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Ceredigion for his persistence in 
promoting the measure. 
<P>
Time has moved on rapidly, although some people have not noticed that. This country and 
others in Europe and north America have begun to realise that there are limits to traffic growth. If we 
continue to allow traffic to increase, there will be a demand for new roads and more vehicles will be 
pumped on to them. Indeed, only about five years ago, we were in this Room, debating red routes and 
the maximisation of road space, rather than the principles of reducing the amount of road traffic 
altogether.
<P>
The Bill will enable the Secretary of State to take into account a wide range of social and 
environmental factors, both in forecasting traffic growth, and in making planning decisions that relate 
to traffic matters. Within the parameters of a private Member’s Bill, it is difficult to set out what the 
Secretary of State should do, down to the last dot and comma. The Bill is a signpost measure, which 
will for the first time enable us to direct our traffic policy. We shall no longer just sit back and predict 
traffic growth, but we shall make positive plans. We shall ensure that employment is nearer to 
people’s homes, and that public transport is improved. We shall ensure that retail and shopping 
facilities are accessible by public transport, instead of only by private cars.
<P>
In the Budget yesterday, the Chancellor recognised that we need to put money into public 
transport and to encourage the use of cleaner cars. Above all, however, we must encourage safer travel 
and a reduction in the use of cars. If we do not introduce serious traffic reduction measures, the forces 
of inertia in our society—those that have a vested interest in building roads and cars, in selling fuel, 
oil and car accessories—will continue on their merry way. That will inexorably increase traffic and, 
therefore, the pressure to build roads.
<P>
We must take a stand somewhere. If we are to reflect public opinion, we must push and support 
the Secretary of State in two directions: first, in undertaking the necessary planning decisions for 
traffic reduction; and secondly, in standing up to the vested interests that have dominated transport 
planning for so long.
<P>
The measures in the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington 
and I are achievable, and would transform cities such as London and Birmingham. When the Greater 
London council introduced its “Fares Fair” policy in the early 1980s, it lead to a dramatic reduction in 
public transport fares for some time. Statistics showed an immediate reduction in commuter traffic 
and an increase in bus and train travel. That was a win-win situation. A reduction in fares led to an 
increase in the use of public transport and a decrease in car traffic, and busses could, therefore, travel 
faster. That resulted in a better use of capital investment.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I want to ensure that the Bill will give the fullest support to Ministers and 
civil servants when they take planning decisions in future. That is why we have tabled amendments 
Nos. 40 to 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> When the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked whether the hon. 
Member for Christchurch intended to block the Bill, the hon. Member responded by shaking his head. 
As that cannot be recorded in Hansard, will the hon. Member for Christchurch tell the Committee that 
he does not intend to block the Bill’s progress?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Absolutely. It would be wrong for me or any hon. Member to block a Bill. I want 
some clear answers from the Government about their policy in these matters.
<P>
The White Paper will probably be published in May and that might contain much information, 
but before then Conservative Members would like the Minister to say that the Government are 
committed to an overall reduction in road traffic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful confirmation of Conservative Members’ 
positive approach to the Bill. I am glad that the hon. Member for Christchurch is on message with the 
rest of his party. That is encouraging news.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 40 to 48 are friendly, and in keeping with the spirit of the Bill. As the hon. 
Member for Christchurch said several times, the 10 per cent. target was in the original version of the 
Bill produced by me and my supporters. The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Carshalton 
and Wallington, and by my hon. Friends the Members for Islington, North and for Bury, North (Mr. 
Chaytor) are variations on the theme of trying to achieve substantial reductions and to begin that 
process soon.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 refers to reductions to be achieved by 2002, in time for the next general 
election. Amendment No. 42 establishes 1990 as the base year for road traffic reduction targets. There 
is a good case for using that year as the basis for other targets, such as the reduction of carbon dioxide 
emissions.
<P>
It is important that reductions should be meaningful and substantial. I have dropped the specific 
reference to 10 per cent. in the Bill, not because it is not needed, which it is, but because apart from 
all other considerations, it is probably necessary to meet the stated Government intention to bring 
about the reduction of CO2 emissions by 20 per cent. by 2010. That key Government commitment is 
most important in the context of international negotiations on the Kyoto agreement. The global level 
of CO2 reductions must be reduced by 60 per cent. as soon as possible to stabilise carbon 
concentrations in the atmosphere.
<P>
The paper produced by the Office of Science and Technology shows that the transport share of 
CO2 emissions is increasing rapidly and is set to increase further by 2010. To make its proper 
contribution to the Government’s target, those emissions should be reduced by 20 per cent. by 2010, 
which means between 30 per cent, and 43 per cent. below the projected emissions at that time. The 
report states that that can be achieved partly by improved technology.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“but inevitably reducing journeys must have an equally, if not more important, role to 
play.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An equally important role implies responsibility for half of the 20 per cent. reduction in 
emissions, that is, for a 10 per cent. reduction. The energy and technology support unit’s calculations 
lead to a similar conclusion. The question thus remains whether it is possible to achieve such a 
reduction. The hon. Member for Christchurch threw cold water on the suggestion but several studies 
have shown that substantial reductions are possible. The standing committee on trunk road 
assessment—SACTRA—report of December 1997 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“there is scope to achieve some reduction in national traffic volumes through restraint measures 
which will at the same time improve economic growth.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The reduction will not be at the expense of economic development and growth.
<P>
I referred at a previous sitting to the former Secretary of State for the Environment the right hon. 
Member for Suffolk, Coastal who said that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“a growing economy does not need ever-growing traffic. If we focus on the opportunities for 
gaining access with less movement, for maximising public transport and exploiting new technology 
we will be able to continue to meet our economic needs without traffic growth.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not quite the same as reduction, but the options for achieving reduction are well 
established and well documented, especially in the work of John Whiteleg. His report is available to 
the hon. Member for Christchurch, who might not approve of his ideas, as he has been an adviser to 
the Deputy Prime Minister, but he might like to consider the work of Professor Phil Goodwin, who is 
the current Government adviser on transport policy. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“What I am saying here is that if we are in conditions where congestion is itself wasting 
economic resources, traffic restraint. . . is good for the economy not bad for it . . . It is now established 
that reducing traffic levels in town centres can improve the level of turnover and the competitive 
position of those towns, provided this is done with style and ambition”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
provided that it is done properly.

<P>

<B>Sir Raymond Whitney:</B> All the points made by the hon. Gentleman reinforce the case for targets. 
Why would the Bill not require targets to be set?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> It would be very peculiar if an hon. Member trying to get a private Member’s Bill on 
the statute book did not try to come to an agreement with the relevant Government Department. We 
have come to what we regard as a useful compromise, which makes it clear that there should be a 
process of setting targets for road traffic reduction. However, the Bill also includes a provision that 
would absolve the Government from trying to do that—on stringent conditions. Clause 2(2) sets out 
the alternative approach, governed by subsection (3), which sets several important criteria. Those 
criteria would, if taken seriously—the Bill would, of course, require them to be taken seriously—
imply road traffic reductions. 
<P>
It is important to remember that it is necessary to reduce road traffic, if other goals such as those 
that we have mentioned are to be met; that it is possible to reduce it significantly; and that the benefits 
of doing so, in terms of lives saved, improvements in health environmental protection and 
enhancements of quality of life, would be significant. If hon. Members want to consider one argument 
for substantial reductions in road traffic, they might examine the evidence provided by the Institute of 
Child Health at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children. That states clearly that a 10 per cent. 
reduction in traffic would yield a greater than 10 per cent. reduction in child deaths. If that is not a 
substantial argument for 10 per cent. reduction, I do not know what is.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I saw that the Minister was trying to catch your eye, Mr. Stevenson, so I shall 
resume my seat.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I concur absolutely with the points made by my hon. Friend the Minister for 
Islington, North, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and, of course, the hon. Member 
for Ceredigion, about the necessity of reducing the apparently inevitable rise in road traffic. It is not 
just to improve the health of the nation that the reduction is needed—although it is generally accepted 
that there is a link between emissions and deterioration in health, including an increase in respiratory 
illnesses. It has also been pointed out that reducing the undoubted burden that an ever-growing 
number of vehicles on the roads imposes on the nation would allow not only a sustainable economy 
but one that could grow.
<P>
The figures presented on this matter by the Confederation of British Industry, which are 
generally accepted, show that the bill to the nation for congestion costs alone is more than £20 billion. 
I have often said that we have yet to tot up the environmental costs of the overdependence that we 
have for too long had on road traffic to move us and our goods.
<P>
I reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North that the Government are committed 
to the use of targets for a wide range of policy areas. As I said on Second Reading, we have made a 
clear commitment to targets that set out clearly what we want to achieve in relation to health, 
education, crime and the vital issue of transport.
<P>
The Departments of the Environment and of Transport were combined to become the present 
Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in acknowledgement of the point about 
land use planning made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North. If we plan the basic 
necessities of life far enough in advance, we can reduce people’s need to travel. As the hon. Member 
for Ceredigion said, we need to plan for industry and business as well as individuals.
<P>
To dispel any possible doubt about the importance the Government attach to setting targets, I 
remind the Committee of the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister 
when he appeared with my hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment before the Environmental 
Audit Committee: he said categorically that targets would be a central part of the Government’s 
policies and he urged the Environment Audit Committee to be a terrier snapping at the heels of 
Government. Sustainable development is another key theme of the Government’s policies. There must 
be a way of ensuring that such development will not be stifled by an overdependence on one form or 
mode of transport.
<P>
That brings me to the overriding importance of public transport in the Government’s thinking 
about real alternatives to the private car. We want to engineer a real shift away from viewing roads as 
the only way of moving freight, for example, which we want carried more effectively and in greater 
numbers. We are considering the possibilities not only of using the railways but of moving goods via 
inland waterways and coastal shipping.
<P>
I have taken some of the Committee’s time in putting on record the Government’s absolute 
commitment to the intent behind the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I should like to make a brief helpful intervention. The Minister has emphasised the 
Government’s commitment to targets, especially to the reduction of road traffic. That is confirmed by 
what the Deputy Prime Minister is reported as having said in The Guardian:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“I will have failed if in 5 years time there are not many more public transport and far fewer 
journeys by car”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a commitment to early reductions. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“It’s a tall order, but I urge you to hold me to it.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Environmental Audit Committee will try to hold him to it, and the Bill provides another 
way of holding him to it.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> That point was also referred to on Second Reading. I am grateful for that 
intervention, which confirms that the Government regard setting targets over a range of policies as a 
priority issue. We want the electorate to understand the Government’s policies so that they can ensure 
that we do not fall behind in achieving such a major task as changing the direction of transport policy. 
The problem stems mainly from the failures of the previous Administration, but I shall not go down 
the sterile road of making party political exchanges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No.
<P>
That brings me directly to the amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, 
by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North and by the hon. Members for Charshalton and 
Wallington and for Ceredigion. The precise specification of the level of targets and of dates by which 
they should be achieved need not be set out in the Bill because there are other avenues and methods 
through which the Government can achieve their objectives. 
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government’s method of introducing policies ranges broadly. We heard earlier how it is 
possible to achieve shifts by, for example, the fiscal route. No doubt all hon. Members welcome my 
right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s announcement about the 6 per cent. escalator for 
fuels in his Budget speech yesterday. We do not think that it would be sensible to set targets so high as 
to be unachievable, although some might think that we should. Because of the broad range of 
Government policies that will work together towards one end, the reduction may in some instances be 
greater than we suppose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> Can my hon. Friend the Minister say when the Department will publish its ideas on 
traffic projections, and begin regular monitoring and updating? There will be local reductions in 
traffic because of local management, but those may hide a bigger increase. We need a firmer 
commitment to regular publication, to promote public discussion of the need to reduce traffic.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. The Government are already monitoring. Indeed, in 
many respects it would be impossible for us to devise policies, or acknowledge the need for certain 
changes requiring greater priority than others, without facts and figures at our disposal. A great deal 
of extremely important information will come to us via exercises that local authorities are already 
undertaking. I hope that local authorities will not regard this as an even greater burden.
<P>
<B>Sir Raymond Whitney:</B> The Minister will agree that her position can be fairly summed up thus: 
the Government agree that targets are virtuous, but do not accept them. Is not that rather like St. 
Augustine asking to be made virtuous, but not yet?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> In a word, no. The Government have made a clear commitment to the value, even 
the necessity, of wide-ranging targeting of all their policies. Given that there are so many ways of 
achieving our aims, and that the Government are already actively assessing figures and examining 
priorities to produce the desired effects, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. I do 
not ask in an empty way that Opposition Members simply trust the Government—[Interruption.] 
Conservative Members laugh. That sort of hollow laughter should be reserved for the Government 
Benches. Our experience of the trustworthiness of Government is somewhat more scarring than theirs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No.
<P>
The central point is that, since May 2, we have been devising programmes and policies to tackle 
various issues. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North knows, we shall publish our White 
Paper on an integrated transport policy this spring. Many of the concerns that have been expressed—
not in Committee, but outside—will be put to rest by the way in which the Government intend to 
process and progress matters to achieve our desired ends. More detail will be available in the White 
Paper. I am hesitant because of the possibility that there may be greater achievements, so I ask the 
hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am glad that we got the hon. Lady to her feet on the matter of targets and that the 
Government are clearly committed to their value. I hope that she will explain—she has not done so 
yet—why, if the Government are so committed to the value of targets, they want to be excluded from 
having to comply with the terms of clause 2(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State . . . to set and publish in a report to Parliament 
national targets for road traffic reduction”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By not allowing that provision to stand in the Bill, the hon. Lady is contradicting herself and the 
view that she has just expressed that the Government are so clearly committed to the value of targets. 
If they are clearly committed to road traffic reduction and the value of targets, why are they not clearly 
committed to the Secretary of State having a duty to publish those targets in a report? The hon. Lady’s 
response does not add up to a coherent policy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ceredigion talked about how to achieve traffic reduction targets in 
England and Wales and referred to the report of Professor John Whitelegg, the terms of which 
concern us. The earlier part of the report refers to traffic reduction and local authorities, but chapter 4 
deals with the identification of policies with traffic reduction potential, depending on central 
Government action. It is on that issue that the hon. Lady has not addressed her mind. The report 
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Central government is the provider of the majority of funds for local transport projects and 
this is likely to continue. Using that funding power to bring about traffic reduction is critical to the 
success of policy in this area. Local authorities need a strong ‘steer’ from central government, 
particularly where there are regional issues as in the case of car parking provision norms and also in 
the case of new revenue raising powers.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report continues that there should be Government action on, among other things, new 
methods of funding public transport, for example, fuel taxation. The Government had the opportunity 
in yesterday’s Budget to provide new methods of funding public transport by raising fuel taxes. They 
did so to the extent of £1.7 billion in the coming year and raised the money available for public 
transport by £175 million—exactly one tenth of the amount of money in increased fuel taxation. Yet, 
the hon. Lady asks us to accept that the Government are serious about targets on road traffic reduction 
overall.
<P>
There is cross-party agreement; indeed, all sensible people agree that the incidence and 
availability of public transport is inextricably linked with the viability of targets for road traffic 
reduction. The Government, having fallen at the first hurdle, had another opportunity in last July’s 
Budget but fell again by failing to transfer significant funding to public transport from fuel taxes as 
suggested by members of the public and motor organisations.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be interested in what the Confederation of 
Passenger Transport said yesterday. It was “ecstatic” at the decision of my right hon. Friend the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer to freeze fuel tax on public service vehicles. Its director general said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“This is wonderful news for public transport in general, but especially for passengers.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
The confederation expected that this
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“will save the industry and its passengers £30 million.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Of course I do. The person concerned speaks a lot of good sense. However, the 
Minister should not delude herself into thinking that the CPT’s ecstasy is synonymous with accepting 
that the Government have been generous in providing resources from fuel taxes for public transport.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman unclear on what the CPT is? It is the trade association for 
bus and coach providers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Absolutely. I have met the CPT, as the hon. Lady has. It is keen to promote the bus 
and coach industry.
<P>
The public transport package will result in 160 million vehicle kilometres of additional bus 
mileage nationwide. To put that into context, that would be a 3 per cent. increase of bus kilometres, 
which is a pin prick of difference. It is better than nothing, but it would be misleading to suggest that 
the package will transform the relationship between public transport and car users. It will do nothing 
of the sort.
<P>
The Sheffield supertram project—one project in one city—cost more than £200 million. The 
hon. Member for Islington, North is nodding at that. However, the Government are, despite an 
enormous increase in fuel taxes, giving less than that sum to the whole of public transport.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> But £300 million is more than £200 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> So it is, but if the Minister examines the Budget, she will find that the £500 million 
public transport package is not available all in one year. The Chancellor gave £500 million in a lump 
to the health service, but did not do that for public transport. The hon. Member for Ceredigion is 
sharp on the detail and saw—as perhaps the Minister did not—that the transport package will be 
spread over three years.
<P>
The point I was making was that £160 million is less than the £200 million spent on the 
Sheffield supertram scheme.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> That was spread over more than three years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The cost of the Sheffield project’s economic failure is likely to be spread over 25 
years or so. Every householder in Sheffield and the three adjoining metropolitan authorities will pay 
an average £40 a year additional council tax for the next 30 years. Householders who do not have 
access to the supertram and who are burdened with additional fuel taxation will not be saluting the 
Government this morning.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> It was the hon. Gentleman’s Government who introduced the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister is obviously enjoying our debate about the Sheffield supertram. The 
previous Government promoted the project and I was delighted that the Government continued that 
support by successfully defending it in the High Court. In the list of policies that Professor Whitelegg 
recommends the Government adopt to enable traffic reduction, he places great emphasis on urban 
road pricing—an extremely controversial proposal—on financial support for high-quality public 
transport and on fuel taxation.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> To settle the issue of fuel taxation, John Whitelegg says clearly that if the other 
measures are applied, the target that was set in my original Bill could be achieved without reliance on 
increased fuel duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am sorry to disagree with the hon. Gentleman’s interpretation of the report—
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> The hon. Gentleman should read page 4.
<P>
Mr. Chope: I shall. I do not want to be at odds with the hon. Gentleman, but it says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The report shows . . . that the road traffic reduction targets in the Bill can be achieved by<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) implementing various tried and tested policies, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) without any reliance on increased fuel duties”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Professor Whitelegg says that the Government should place emphasis on fuel taxation and 
quotes figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and says that that 
is the way forward.
<P>
If traffic reduction can be achieved without raising fuel taxes, that would be very welcome, 
especially to those in rural areas. Indeed, it would bear out the comment of the European 
Commissioner for Transport, Mr. Neil Kinnock, in July last year who said that it was wrong to rely on 
simplistic taxation methods. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The purpose of fair and efficient transport pricing is not to add to the flat rate system of 
vehicle taxation which is generally operated now. It is, in whole or part, to replace the unfair and 
inefficient system that patently does nothing of significance to reduce congestion, pollution or 
accidents, or relate use to costs.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The AA has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Blanket increases in motor taxation are blunt, inefficient and unfair.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such increases do not work. Increasing the cost of fuel targets the group that one least wants to 
target—those on low-income—living in uncongested rural areas who are dependent on their cars. 
Whatever the arguments for external costs, the burden that they place on the rural motorist is 
excessive, by any definition.
<P>
The means by which the targets are to be achieved is important. It is noteworthy that the 
Minister is so coy about declaring the Government’s hand in that regard. She says that some of them 
will be detailed in the White Paper; perhaps the Government would undertake to move amendments 
when the Bill goes to the other place, that would incorporate into the Bill the targets that she implies 
may be included in the White Paper. I shall give way to the Minister if she wishes to respond that 
suggestion, which she may find helpful and constructive—as are many of my suggestions.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Although the hon. Gentleman may find it painful, I must set the record 
straight: I have yet to find any of his suggestions helpful. On the question of what happens in another 
place, I am already on record as saying that the supreme decision maker is the House of Commons, 
not that other unelected, unaccountable Chamber.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister may rue the day that she uttered those words. A Select Committee in 
the other place produced a scholarly report on road taxation and alternative fuels. The other place has 
demonstrated, over a longer period than the House of Commons, a genuine commitment to 
environmental issues that is based on sound science. I am sorry that the Minister should be so 
dismissive of, and does not wish to take any notice of, what comes from the other place simply 
because a number of its Members happen to be there as a result of birth rather than by election. The 
notion that that place would be better if every Member was nominated—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have tried my level best to ensure that every hon. Member has the 
opportunity to make a contribution. I said earlier that I would take a careful note of the issues raised. I 
advise hon. Members that transport policy and the Budget were discussed at length during the debate 
on the sittings motion. I certainly do not want the Committee to debate the validity or otherwise of the 
House of Lords.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I accept your ruling, Mr. Stevenson. I am sorry that the Minister should have 
tempted me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman should be stronger.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Member for Islington, North is quite right that I should not be tempted by 
the Minister, as I sometimes am.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> He is weak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister says that I am weak. I am resolute. 
<P>
The hon. member for Ceredigion has not been given satisfactory answers to some of the points 
that he raised. Next year, if he is lucky to be in the ballot, he may have the chance to bring forward 
another Bill to force the Government to comply with what so many members of the Government have 
already said they wanted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Although the hon. Member for Ceredigion described amendments Nos. 41 to 48 as 
“friendly”, I am disappointed that he will not accept them. Amendment No. 41 is particularly 
relevant. During our previous sitting, we debated whether a Minister could be held to account for 
statements that he made when in Opposition.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 seeks to hold to account the Deputy Prime Minister, who, one month after 
the election, clearly stated that if traffic had not been reduced during this Parliament, he would have 
failed. I am sorry that amendment No. 41 will not be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I can tell the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington that I see great merit in 
amendment No.41. I should like some of the other amendments to be incorporated into the Bill, but 
that will not happen. I recognise that the Government need and require flexibility.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 seems inoffensive and useful it  states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“A report...shall contain...information on such measures as, in the opinion of the Secretary of 
State, will, taken together, result in a reduction in road traffic based on the level prevailing in May 
1997 by 2002”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not require those measures to be put in place, but it does require them to be described. 
The reality is that none of amendments Nos. 40 to 48 will be incorporated into the Bill, but does the 
Minister agree that a report could and should usefully include such detail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I rise to give the Minister time to respond to the question about amendment No. 41. I 
hope that many Committee members agree that the Bill would be better if the amendment were 
incorporated into it, and that it will be pressed to a vote by the hon. Member for Carshalton and 
Wallington and the hon. Member for Islington, North. This debate gives the Minister the last 
opportunity to say whether she agrees with the point made by the promoter of the Bill that the 
inclusion of the amendment would be helpful, or whether she will impose her will and say that it 
cannot be included. I see that the Minister has a text in front of her—no doubt prepared by her 
officials. Perhaps she would like to share her views on the amendment with the Committee. I note that

<P>

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am not taking the opportunity to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Perhaps the Minister will speak on the matter. I certainly hope that she will, as the 
amendment has attracted a lot of interest.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am mindful of what the hon. Member for Ceredigion has said. I appreciate the 
purpose of his remarks, but I am somewhat chairy about the prospect of an endless burden of reports 
to be drafted and produced. Although I understand the thinking behind the amendment, such reports 
do not come out of the air. I ask that the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment, but I think that 
the area that it addresses could be defined in greater detail at a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> If the Minister feels unable to accept amendment No. 41, would she be prepared to 
consider what it proposes and return to the matter on Report? I understand what she says about all the 
factors relating to road traffic reduction, but amendment No. 41 does not require the Government to 
do anything other than propose a report setting out the basis on which calculations could be made and 
comparing the situation in 2002 to that in May 1997. That does not seem to be overwhelmingly 
different from the Bill’s provision. It adds to the Bill and gives it slightly greater strength, but 
requires the Government to do nothing other than promote a public debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I hope that the Minister will respond to that point. I shall not press my amendments 
on the basis that we will have a further opportunity to debate these matters in the future. I want the 
Bill to make fast progress. To date, it has made extremely slow progress.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North, I was 
concerned in my earlier statement about the seemingly inevitable growth of reports. Although it is 
easy to propose a report, the compilation of a valid report can sometimes be complex. In the light of 
what my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North, the hon. Member for Carshalton and 
Wallington and the hon. Member for Ceredigion have said, I would be happy to discuss this matter 
with the Bill’s sponsors in more detail if the amendments are withdrawn. It may be possible to return 
to the matter on Report.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26 in page 1, line 9, leave out ‘to Parliament’.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments:
<P>
No. 37, in page 2, line 5, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘( ) The Secretary of State shall lay a copy of any report published under this section before 
Parliament.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 29, in page 1, line 11, leave out ‘specify targets under’ and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘comply with the requirements of’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 30, in page 1, line 14, leave out from ‘case’ to ‘an’ and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘he shall publish a report explaining his reasoning and including.’<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I do not intend to detain the Committee long.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 would remove from subsection (1) the requirement that a report be presented 
to Parliament; that requirement will, of course, be re-inserted at clause 2(5). Amendment No. 37 
provides for a report to be laid before Parliament but sets no actual time limit. It is important to 
establish that such a report would be available with 18 months, even though that might not be 
specified by the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 are simply technical changes to improve the Bill’s wording in 
accordance with advice from Parliamentary Counsel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The amendments have been tabled by the Bill’s promoter and the Government. I 
should like to put it on the record that despite the length of time the Bill’s promoters spent discussing 
the Bill with the Government, the published version is different from what they now wish it to be.
<P>
The effect of the amendments would be make weaker a Bill that is already significantly weaker 
than the original. Although amendment No. 26 removes a reference to a report to Parliament, a new 
subsection will require that a copy of any report published be laid before Parliament. However, as the 
hon. Member for Ceredigion said in his short opening remarks, no time scale is specified within 
which the report must be produced. That is a major weakness in the Bill.
<P>
Why has the hon. Gentleman agreed to accept an amendment that will remove a requirement for 
the Government ever to produce a report within a specific time scale? The Road Traffic Reduction Act 
1997 requires local authorities to submit reports within a specific time scale, yet we are not imposing 
the same obligation on the Government. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us why the Government have 
put pressure on him in that respect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> Nothing in the existing Act sets a timetable; that comes in the guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I stand corrected. It is one thing for the Government to issue guidance to local 
authorities, but it would be pretty absurd for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that the Government 
publish guidance to themselves under the Bill. If we as legislators want to ensure that the 
Government, who are in the driving seat, fulfil the obligation that we place on them we must provide 
for a time scale within which it will be done; otherwise, there is no guarantee that it will ever be done.
<P>
A report was originally required to be published within 12 months of the Act coming into force. 
That is not particularly onerous, but the promoters have withdrawn even that requirement at the 
behest of the Government. That must cause some consternation among those who wonder about the 
Government’s motives. It sometimes seems as though the Government do not want to address the 
substance of the Bill, yet that they want to avoid being shown not to be in favour of it. I can see no 
other reason for them not to agree to a report being produced within 12 months. There is no such 
requirement at the moment.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> To allay the hon. Gentleman’s anxieties, I should say that I am surprised, 
given his close interest in the Bill, that he is not aware that the Government have given a clear 
commitment that the report would be published within 18 months. The request for an extension of six 
months was made to ensure that all the relevant information could be obtained and that the report was 
in a proper state to be presented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I accept what the hon. Lady says and I am grateful to her, but I am still concerned. 
We have the opportunity to make provisions in the Bill. The Minister could propose an amendment to 
the effect that the period should be 18 months instead of 12 months, which most people would not 
think unreasonable. Instead, however, she has given an undertaking, which would be pretty worthless 
if there were an early change of Government or a change of Minister.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that his party—should it ever be returned to 
Government, which is debateable—would be committed to expunging the Bill if it reaches the statute 
book?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Lady misunderstands what I said. If there were a change of Government or 
Minister, it would be impossible for the legislature to require a Minister in the same Government or a 
different Government to comply with undertakings that were given by the original Minister. Evidence 
of how little we should rely on such undertakings is apparent from the history of road traffic 
reduction. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington reminded us of the way in which the 
Government, Ministers and Members of the majority party in the House supported concepts—not just 
before the election, but since—that they now want to disavow.
<P>
We note that the Minister has given a specific undertaking that the Secretary of State will 
publish a report within 18 months of the legislation coming into force. It is proposed that the Bill 
should come into force when it reaches the statute book. That means that a report will be produced 18 
months from July 1998, which would be just around the millennium. That will be getting on for three 
years after the Government came into office. Only then would the Government have an obligation to 
say something about their policy under clause 2. I should be surprised if that is what the hon. Member 
for Ceredigion had in mind when he set out on this road. It is clear from the drafting that he wanted 
to get on with matters a lot faster than that. The hon. Gentleman is, I fear, becoming the victim of 
delaying tactics on the part of the Minister in getting down to the substance of the road traffic 
reduction targets. I have expressed my concerns about those two amendments. Amendment No. 29 
would have the effect that the Secretary of State was not obliged to comply with the requirements 
under subsection (1), and that point, with the problem of the timing of any report, makes it clear to 
me, if not to other members of the Committee, that the Government are doing nothing more than 
paying lip service to the thinking behind the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 1, line 10, leave out ‘national’.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> I speak with relish to the amendments that are tabled in my name and that of the 
Minister. Amendments Nos. 13 and 28 mean that separate targets would be set for England, Wales 
and Scotland. I am particularly in favour of that because a reference to the United Kingdom will be 
replaced by a reference to England, Wales and Scotland. I am tempted to say that that fulfils a lifetime 
ambition, but I am sure that there is some merit in the term “the United Kingdom” and that that will 
remain the case.
<P>
Amendment No. 38 will give the Bill the title “Road Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Bill”, 
but of course the word “national” will now have a different meaning from what was originally 
intended. That gives me great comfort.
<P>
I prefer to leave comment on amendment No. 39 and new clause 9 to the Minister as they refer 
to Northern Ireland. I believe that they mean that the Bill will not apply to Northern Ireland except in 
a technical manner and I do not feel qualified to deal with that technicality.
<P>
It is important that we understand that setting national targets for Wales, Scotland and England 
will nevertheless lead to the establishment of a UK target, simply by totting up those targets. We must 
end up with an understanding of reduction target that we are hoping to achieve for the whole of the 
UK.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): I support the amendments and the Minister’s proposals. 
I am glad that Northern Ireland will be included in the Bill, and that is being achieved elegantly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> As hon. Members are slow to rise and I understood that the Minister would speak to 
the amendments with Government support, I will defer to her if she wants to speak now. Perhaps she 
is a little confused because amendment No. 13 was originally in my name. As she said that she did not 
want to support any amendment that I was proposing, she may be concerned to find her name added 
to that of the proposer in support of amendment No. 13. I welcome her support for that amendment, 
even if she does not welcome my support for her support. That may be why she is a little confused 
about whether she has any amendments to speak to in this group.
<P>
New clause 9 merits some explanation from the Government. It would interfere with normal 
practice in the application of legislation to Northern Ireland. When the Bill was conceived by the hon. 
Member for Ceredigion and his supporters, it involved United Kingdom targets for road traffic 
reduction. The hon. Gentleman believes in the United Kingdom, and so do I. It is important that there 
should be a United Kingdom target. When the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister engage in 
international diplomacy, and sign protocols for reductions of one sort or another, they speak for the 
whole United Kingdom, rather than for individual parts.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is a great pity that the reference to United Kingdom targets is being taken out of the Bill. The 
hon. Member for Ceredigion says that adding up targets for England, Wales and Scotland will 
produce a United Kingdom target. There is a gap in his logic. A Northern Ireland target has to be 
added to produce a United Kingdom target. There is no requirement in the Bill for a separate target 
for Northern Ireland. Usually, the extension of a Bill to Northern Ireland would be done by 
affirmative resolution, under the Northern Ireland Act 1974. New clause 9 seeks to change the usual 
practice of the House in dealing with such legislation, and to allow the Bill to be extended to Northern 
Ireland through a negative resolution. We know that that means, in essence, that the matter would not 
have to be debated. We also know, however, that it would mean that the Bill would never have to be 
extended to Northern Ireland. It is impossible for a United Kingdom target to comprise of only the 
individual targets for England, Wales and Scotland. It must also include a target for Northern Ireland.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) served with distinction as a 
Minister in Northern Ireland, and has long been concerned about road safety. He would agree that 
some issues should concern everybody in the House, including the higher than normal number of 
accidents, and the high incidence of casualties, on the roads in Northern Ireland. We should take an 
interest in traffic issues in Northern Ireland, but the amendments tabled by the Minister and by the 
Government seen to discourage hon. Members from doing so.
<P>
In Northern Ireland, there is not much of a rail network, but there is quite a lot of bus public 
transport. The taxi system has an international reputation. It is important to differentiate between 
what happens there and what happens here. Indeed, that was the purpose of my original amendment, 
which aimed to ensure that England, Wales,  Scotland and Northern Ireland had individual targets. 
We had assumed that the Bill had been thought through as much as possible. The removal of 
references to Northern Ireland from the Bill was therefore surprising, as was the fact that the Bill will 
become the Road Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Bill.
<P>
I know that the Minister is leaving not because she does not wish to face this issue but because, 
as she said at the beginning of the sitting, she has to respond to an Adjournment debate on the Floor 
of the House. If neither she nor the hon. Member for Ceredigion can respond to the point about 
Northern Ireland, I hope that somebody will give us an explanation because it is an unusual way of 
proceeding. As hon. Members know, it might establish precedents that could be used in the future. I 
know that when the hon. Gentleman said that he welcomed the idea of national targets for England, 
Wales and Scotland he did so slightly tongue in cheek.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> The Bill would not be unique in its treatment of Northern Ireland. I am told that the 
Home Energy Conservation Act 1995, with which I was associated, operates in the same way. 
Northern Ireland is encompassed in the Act in the same way as in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> That is an interesting explanation, because it shows that a one-off procedure adopted 
for a private Member’s Bill will now be used more widely for a more important Bill, as I think the 
hon. Gentleman would agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> The Home Energy Conservation Act passed into law under the previous 
Administration. It is not unusual for legislation in the UK to develop gradually on the basis of 
precedent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> That is true. However, I cannot understand, in the light of what the hon. Gentleman 
is saying, why that proposal was not set out at the beginning. It was open to the hon. Gentleman, the 
Government and the parliamentary draftsmen at their many meetings to get to grips with it.
<P>
I wondered whether the change in the treatment of Northern Ireland had anything to do with the 
fact that the national road traffic forecasts produced by the Department of the Environment, Transport 
and the Regions are at present called “National Road Traffic Forecasts (Great Britain)” rather than 
covering the whole of the United Kingdom. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman knows what 
the forecasts are for Northern Ireland and whether he is campaigning to have truly United Kingdom 
road traffic forecasts. The fact that national road traffic forecasts are published only for Great Britain 
may be the reason why, at the outset, the Bill would not apply to Northern Ireland,  unless there is a 
move to extend it to Northern Ireland under the procedure introduced by the Home Energy 
Conservation Act.
<P>
I also seek the hon. Gentleman’s help on the traffic targets for individual parts of the United 
Kingdom. We know that separate statistics are kept for Scotland. They raise some interesting points, 
because they show that, although car ownership in Scotland is lower, it is increasing rapidly. From 
answers to questions that I have recently put to the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales, it 
is clear that the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office have separate policies for national road traffic 
levels. Indeed, in answer to a question, the Under-Secretary of State for Wales said that he expected 
road traffic levels in Wales to increase faster than in the rest of Great Britain, as a result of the growth 
of the Welsh economy. However, he went on to say that he did not know by how much they would 
increase, because he did not have any base measurements. I should be grateful if the hon. Member for 
Ceredigion could tell us what information is available to ensure meaningful and distinct targets for 
the separate parts of the United Kingdom, recognising the regional input.
<P>
One of the amendments in this group is my proposal to incorporate regional targets. There are 
distinctive differences between the incidence of road traffic and road traffic growth in the regions. For 
example, 41 per cent. of households in Greater London do not have a car; in Scotland, 40 per cent. of 
households do not have a car, but in the south east, excluding London, only 22 per cent. of households 
do not have a car.
<P>
The hon. Member for Islington, North represents a London constituency and understands a lot 
about London issues. When he talks about the availability of public transport to people who do not 
have cars, he should not allow his argument to lead him to think that it is reasonable for those who 
have to have cars who live in south-east England—excluding London—or elsewhere in England and 
Wales where car ownership is significantly higher, not to have access to public transport. If public 
transport were provided in those areas so that every household had access to it, it would be reasonable 
to consider road traffic issues on a level playing field. However, that is not the position at present. 
There is a distinct difference between the incidence of car ownership, and car use in London and the 
rest of the south east.
<P>
The transport statistics report shows that the average distance travelled per person by region of 
residents by different modes varies significantly. People outside Greater London and the metropolitan 
areas drive much further each year, despite the fact that some of them, such as those in Scotland, have 
fewer cars. They are therefore adversely affected by the impact of increased fuel duty, and are in 
double jeopardy if any money raised from fuel duty is not ploughed back into public transport in areas 
that are not served by public transport—by which we mean collectively rural areas.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> My hon. Friend will notice that we are approaching one o'clock. On this group of 
amendments, the Minister will want to start the next sitting by responding on what is called the 
“totting up”—how to get a United Kingdom figure from different national totals within the United 
Kingdom. If my hon. Friend would allow someone else to speak before one o’clock, it would be useful 
to follow his remarks. There is no suggestion of trying to collapse the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> If my hon. Friend would like to speak now, I shall sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Minister will have to answer the serious question of how one does the 
mathematics. Having a national United Kingdom total alone is not sufficient—Wales, Scotland, and 
England all need to be considered. My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch made an interesting 
speech about whether there should be regional targets, or regional elements to it. He rightly pointed 
out that the issue is not necessarily one of car ownership, and that distance travel is not the only issue 
behind the Bill. Vehicles becoming more fuel efficient and less polluting is a gain in itself.
<P>
Many of the people who will gain if we change our culture and some of the options are those 
who gave up using their cars for so many long-distance journeys. With targets, everyone can gain. A 
better environment, better transport options and different patterns at the margin may not be difficult to 
attain but can be beneficial. More pensioners should be able to have and use cars without necessarily 
having to do long journeys. We should be able to assume that many more people who can afford a car 
will not necessarily chose to buy one if living in a city and using public transport, bicycles or walking 
make sense. Whatever our views on the various amendments, we have  a great deal to gain if we can 
make progress in changing attitudes and hearing the kind of reply that I am sure the Minister will 
make at our next sitting.
