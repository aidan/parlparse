                           </strong> Good morning to you and the Committee, Mr
Streeter. This is my first opportunity to welcome you to the Chair for
our deliberations on the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When reading
the provisions on wheel-clamping, I noted again what my hon. Friend the
Member for Gedling said earlier in our deliberations: the Bill contains
a range of issues. Earlier this week, we considered squatting and
various other issues, and we now move to wheel-clamping. During Public
Reading, it became clear from comments by members of the public that
feeling is mixed about whether the provisions offer protection to
various groups. I looked at the coalition agreement,  to which
I am told we must now always refer, to see what the coalition
Government’s policy intentions are. The coalition agreement
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
will tackle rogue private sector wheel
clampers.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
does not say that they will ban them, but it says that they will tackle
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 107
deals with a problem identified by witnesses during the evidence
sessions at the beginning of the Committee stage, when fixed
barriers were discussed.  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 406<a class="bkMark" name="Column406">&#160;</a>
                           </div>The amendment is intended to help the Government. It relates to
subsection (3) and would make it clear what the intention of a fixed
barrier is, so that the provision does not widen the opportunity for
car park owners and private landowners to immobilise vehicles using
wheel-clamping as well as
barriers.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
put the amendment in context, subsection (1) makes
wheel-clamping an offence. Subsection (2) states that it is unlawful to
enter into a contractual agreement giving legal authority for the
purposes of subsection (1). Essentially, that means that one
cannot put up a sign at the entrance to a piece of land implying that
anyone who enters in a vehicle is agreeing to the possibility that they
will be clamped. Subsection (3) goes on to say that the clause provides
an exemption if a fixed barrier is in place.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I said,
the amendment attempts to improve the drafting of the Bill. Currently,
I believe, the clause provides an exemption from the wheel-clamping ban
for landowners who use a fixed barrier at the entrance to their land.
It appears that the subsection was included to deal with multi-storey
car parks that operate a barrier system to allow regulation of use of
the car parks and ensure that people pay before leaving.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
current wording, if a barrier is in place, as in a multi-storey car
park, subsection (2) will not apply after a car enters the car park.
That means that a contractual agreement between the driver and the
owner of the land can lawfully provide legal authority not only for the
used of a fixed barrier to prevent the car being able to leave but for
wheel-clamping and towing away. I imagine that that is seen as
important for large organisations such as Tesco. Tesco’s car
parks have huge volumes of traffic passing in and out. They generally
have a barrier at the front of the car park, which is usually up. I
have never seen the barrier brought down. I believe that under the
provision there is the opportunity for Tesco to wheel-clamp, and tow
away, a car that enters one of its car parks and stays there for days.
It would not want to put the barrier down because that would prevent
lawful customers from entering and leaving the car park. I can
understand, therefore, that the Bill is drafted as it is to allow for
such instances, but there is clearly a lot of confusion about what the
subsection will
mean.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000023">&#160;</a>

a big loophole because it allows any rogue operator to buy a piece of

                        <p>That is
what the clause appears to say; I cannot see any other possible
interpretation. It creates the danger of allowing rogue operators to
continue operating, and all the Act will do is put the legitimate
clamping operator out of action, which I am sure is not the
Bill’s intention. If someone such as Patrick Troy, an expert who
over many years has looked at wheel-clamping and parking regulation,
says that that is his interpretation of the Bill, the Government need
to consider carefully what their intention is and whether the Bill
currently achieves
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000025">&#160;</a>

Government’s intention to outlaw
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000026">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
its report in response to the Public Reading stage, the Home Office
states that it believes it is worrying that the interpretation is such
that the public are confused, but that it thinks the intention is
clear. In the light of Patrick Troy’s evidence and the range of
other evidence put forward by the public, the Home Office must look
again at whether the Bill is clear. We do not want to agree laws that
the public find confusing; the public are genuinely concerned and
confused about parking regulation and wheel-clamping. It would have
been sensible, before embarking on the ban, to have sat down and gone
through a longer-term approach to parking, trying to marry up private
land and public land parking issues, because two clearly different
systems operate and I  do not think that the public fully
understand that. Amendment 107 would limit the scope of the
Government’s intention, which is to allow just the use of a
fixed barrier to prevent vehicles being moved. At the moment, the Bill
allows a wider interpretation, which covers the use of
wheel-clamping.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Government will see amendment 108 as helpful, as it deals
with the problem that private landowners have when a vehicle parked on
their land and about which they are concerned is not registered in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland. In such cases, the new provision
presents the landowner with some difficulty because the ticketing
approach, which is set out later in the Bill, is of no help to them if
the vehicle is not registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency. In those very clear circumstances, where there is not a
registration in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, amendment 108
attempts to allow landowners to use wheel-clamping so that they can
remove a vehicle from their land.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000028">&#160;</a>

The disappointing aspect is that we have not had an opportunity to

vehicles in this country that are registered abroad and who may have
concerns generally about understanding our parking regulations and
laws. It seems that we are rushing into what appears to be a very
popular thing to do, namely getting rid of wheel-clamping. I know that
lots of MPs will say that they have had huge numbers of constituents
contacting them about the problem of rogue wheel-clampers. However, by
rushing ahead in this way, not thinking things through properly and not
paying regard to all the issues that arise from banning wheel-clamping,

is a simple amendment and, as my hon. Friend said, it is designed to
make clear which authority will tackle illegal clamping and towing, and
who the public can approach if they are prevented from using a vehicle
due to its having been clamped or towed. In my reading of clause 54, we
are creating a new offence of immobilising, moving or restricting the
movement of a vehicle without lawful authority. In effect, the clause
bans most clamping and towing by anyone other than the police, or local
authorities and government agencies, acting in accordance with their
statutory or other powers. To be guilty of that offence, the person
immobilising or moving the vehicle must intend to prevent or inhibit
the removal of the vehicle by its driver or owner. The penalty for the
new offence will be a fine. That will either be limited to an
indictment or a fine not more than the statutory minimum. On summary
conviction, I think that is £5,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000045">&#160;</a>

it clear explicitly who is responsible. I tabled the amendment because
there are some very good intentions laid out throughout the Bill but
the Government seem a little reticent to provide powers to enforce
them. We debated biometrics in schools, but there was no sanction for
schools that chose to ignore the guidance. The situation

                        <p class="tabbed">The British
Parking Association provides a framework for self-regulation in the
British parking and traffic management sector. In order to become a
member of the BPA, companies must comply with all of its code of
practice. Car parking companies are not compelled to join the BPA and
comply with the code, whereas the clamping ban will apply to all
operators. It hardly seems appropriate that the BPA should enforce the
clamping ban against operators that are not its members. That is not a
solution. I understand that the Government probably envisage that
enforcement of the ban will fall within the remit of the police. The
amendment would clarify that in the Bill, so that the public can be
aware of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000051">&#160;</a>

and clamping of vehicles an offence. It is to get rid of the menace of
intimidation and extortion. I began with that, because that is the
central point and reason for us moving forward on banning clamping and
towing, rather than taking up what the previous Government suggested,
which was more regulation and more processes, which I doubt would have
had the effect that Opposition Members

responsible for enforcing the ban. Members of the public would then
know who to turn to if their vehicle is clamped or towed, because such

fall to the Crown Prosecution Service to take the prosecution forward,

I am reflecting on all the issues raised by all hon. Members during our

but it cannot be made clearer that it is the police
to whom members of the public go. I have now put that clearly on the

different. For instance, some police forces and local authorities come
down on owners of untaxed vehicles like a ton of bricks, but others do
not consider the issue that important. Where does the balance
lie?<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000062">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman, but there were
many menaces and there was much intimidation under the old order of
wheel-clamping, and I fear that the police faced many dilemmas when
members of the public called them.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000063">&#160;</a>

Although, on the face of it, it seems that there is a wheel-clamping
ban, that is not the case. In the stand part debate, we will discuss
where wheel-clamping can lawfully still be done, including by bailiffs.
Again, there is confusion, and it would be helpful if the Government
could be clear in the Bill exactly what the provisions mean for members
of the public.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000066">&#160;</a>

underestimate the public. The response from the public to the
announcement of the ban on wheel clamping has been clearly received and
clearly understood. As I say, however, we will work with the CAB, which
says that inquiries to bureaux across England and Wales about parking
and congestion have risen from 8,000-ish in April 2006 to 16,000 in
2010. The hon. Lady is right: confusion exists already, but the
provisions will clear it up, not add to it. However, it is important

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
107 deals with fixed barriers. I am happy to clear up any
misunderstanding that exists about the absolute express purpose of
subsection (3). The wording of the provision does not mean that
clamping or towing will remain lawful as long as a barrier is fitted.
It means that the landowners or their agents will have lawful authority
to use a barrier to restrict the movement of a vehicle, if the barrier
were present when the vehicle was parked, and where it was clear or
prominent enough for the driver to have been aware of it. That is the
clearest way for such matters to be carried out. If the barrier is
there, it must be visible in order for a driver to have implied
agreement or consent. If drivers enter land where they can see the
barrier, they enter at their own risk and they would be silly to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000075">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Opposition
are referring to rogue barrier people, not rogue clampers. If the
hypothesis is that a piece of land could be bought by a rogue barrier
operator and a barrier fitted and raised to attract drivers, and
lowered to prevent their egress, and was visible, it is, “driver
beware”. That is explicit under the clause. It deals with
exemption. It is exactly the issue raised by the hon. Member for
Kingston upon Hull North herself. We are all familiar with commercial
car parks that operate fixed barriers, and we would not want to inhibit
in any way their purposeful and lawful use of parking law. It is
clearly right that parking providers should be free to continue to use
barriers to ensure payment, but that does not then permit them to clamp
or
tow.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000076">&#160;</a>

is that public understanding of this legislation and the meaning of
subsection (3) is not as clear as the Minister is trying to present.
What is more concerning is that Patrick Troy, who is an expert in this
area, is equally confused. The Opposition’s amendment is

listened to Patrick Troy at the witness session. He is a representative
of the BPA and clearly knows a lot about the industry. In this
particular circumstance we need to make it clear and we will be working
with all organisations to inform the public. However, I think there is
a public acceptance that barriers mean charges; we have all been
trained by car parks to take our tickets and see a barrier rise and
close. If there is a barrier, it is clear that we are implying our
consent by driving across, even if the barrier is up and there is no
signage around.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000078">&#160;</a>

that even if a barrier is up when people drive into a car park, they
acknowledge that they are going into a private car park and will have
to pay a parking fee to leave and the barrier could be put down. The
problem is that as the provision is drafted, the BPA and members of the
public think that it would also give power to the private landowner not
only to put the barrier down but to immobilise the vehicle in some
other way, by use of a wheel clamp and by towing away. That is the
problem, and the clause should be amended to remove that
uncertainty.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000080">&#160;</a>

the case. The exemption for barriers in clause 54(3) does
not mean that landowners will still be able to clamp or tow where there
is a barrier. The wording of the clause makes it clear that the
landowner will have lawful authority to use a barrier to restrict the
movement of a vehicle if the barrier was present when the vehicle was
parked, where it was clear or prominent enough for the driver to have
been aware of it. In other words, a barrier cannot be hidden so as to
entrap people.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000081">&#160;</a>

clampers to look for unregistered or foreign vehicles to ticket.
Foreign drivers are not required to register their vehicles for the
first six months that they are in this country. They are no less likely
to pay parking tickets than drivers of registered vehicles. There is no
requirement for foreign-registered vehicles brought to the UK to be
registered if they are in the country for less than six months, so it
would be unfair to allow such vehicles be clamped on the basis that
they failed to fulfil a condition that is not a legal requirement. It
would create a loophole that is arguably discriminatory against foreign
vehicles.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000093">&#160;</a>

regime. If the ticket is paid straight away, that is fine, but if the
ticket is not paid, and the landowner wishes to take enforcement
action, they will have nowhere to go, because the car is not registered
with the DVLA. We will come to the clauses on keeper liability later,
which kick in only if the landowner is able to access DVLA information
about registered vehicles. In effect, the Government are leaving

that to be the issue. Once we create a loophole where we allow clampers
to clamp, they will go around to find people to clamp, and they will
say to people, “I am sorry, sir. I thought your vehicle was not
registered, or is a foreign vehicle.” They will contravene the
law if they do that. That is the point. It is an offence and we do not
want to leave loopholes so that clampers can continue to clamp on some

                           </strong> That is why I drew the Committee’s
attention to the fact that we decided on a ban because it is an
absolute. It is much the simplest way to understand that the menace of
clamping and towing needs to be stopped. It is intimidation and
extortion. The mechanism of ticketing and barriers still exists, which
is what the vast majority of the country uses to protect private land.
The right of the landowner to protect their land remains intact, so I
am not persuaded by any of the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000105">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for South Swindon has just reminded me of another
option. When I was on the point of announcing the wheel clamp ban, I
had some 500 comments posted on my website. They were mostly from wheel
clampers. A couple of them threatened to park on my one little parking
space in front of my house and worse, which did not improve my view of
the fraternity. However, as my hon. Friend reminded me, when someone
parks in the wrong place, the first thing that anyone does is put a
note on the car saying, “Please don’t park here
again.” When people are concerned about their space in front of
their house, they start with a note and then escalate it. In the end,
it is a parking offence and most people want to use their car
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000106">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have listened carefully to the Minister. In
light of the fact that we have a coalition Government and a new style
of politics, the amendment that my hon. Friend the Member for West
Bromwich East has tabled is very much in keeping with that new style of
politics and allows a precedent to be set. I am disappointed that the
Minister is not willing to add those words to the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On amendment
107, the wording of the clause is still a problem for the general
public. I am particularly worried that someone such as Patrick Troy is
confused by the drafting. I am pleased that the Minister has said that
she will go away and consider this again. My position is that I might
want to return to the matter on Report, depending on what the
Government decide to do. We want clarity in the provisions that we make
on the issue because they directly affect so many motorists and
landowners. However, at this stage I shall withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000109">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 108, I am not persuaded by the Minister’s arguments.
Private landowners will still have problems with unlicensed and
unregistered vehicles parked on their land. I understand the
Minister’s point about

                           </div>putting a note on a car if it is parked in the wrong place. Clearly, one
would like to see the problem of people parking in the wrong place,
perhaps in the driveway of a householder, dealt with by a note, with
that person, hopefully, not returning. However, in the real world,
especially around commuter stations and underground stations and
underground stations in London, estates and private housing often have
people who—week in, week out—deliberately park in spaces
on private land, and leaving a note on the windscreen has not worked.
That also does not deal with people who park a car that is not
registered in this country, and landowners will be left with absolutely
nowhere to go under the provisions in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000110">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I draw the hon. Lady’s attention to
the fact that the Bill will give landowners explicit permission to move
a car sufficiently to get it off their land. That will still be legal
under the Bill, because they have no intention to stop the owner
driving the car away; they will simply be moving it off their
land.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000111">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is very interesting that the Minister is
coming up with all these options for landowners or
householders—putting notes on or moving a vehicle—but
that might be very difficult. If an old-age pensioner living in a
sheltered housing block has a car parked in a space that they need for
their car, perhaps because they are disabled, we do not expect
legislation to say to that pensioner that they are responsible for
pushing that car off their land. We expect the Bill to be very clear,
to set out the issues and to offer protection to, obviously, the
motorist and the landowner as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000112">&#160;</a>

car is for the domestic situation, and there is an escalating range of

expensive.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000113">&#160;</a>

about what will happen to unregistered vehicles, I will not press it to

genuine problem, which the Minister identified on her website last
year, and I am still not clear what options are open to landowners
dealing with the issue of unregistered vehicles and ticket enforcement.
I hear what the Minister says about barriers and tickets being
available, but how do landowners deal with the problem of what happens
if they cannot enforce the ticket? I am still not

hope, when we can deal with the wider issue of wheel-clamping. On the
amendments, it is appropriate for the Opposition to press the
Government about the drafting of the clauses they are introducing to
ensure that the clauses do what we all want, which is to offer
protection to motorists and landowners and to have clarity about what
the law means on a day-to-day basis—for example, for the old-age
pensioner living in a sheltered block in whose disabled parking bay
someone else is constantly parking. What do they do, and what options
are available to them? That is the purpose of the amendments. I might
bring the issue back on Report, but on that basis, I beg to ask leave

                           </strong> The clause sets out the ban on wheel-clamping. We
have just had a fairly lengthy discussion about various subsections.
While the wheel-clamping ban sounds attractive and popular—the
Minister announced the coalition Government’s plan to introduce
it in early August—it came out of the blue. As the Minister will
recollect, the previous Government introduced provisions to regulate
wheel-clamping in the Crime and Security Act 2010, which dealt with
many of the issues that arose from the behaviour of rogue clampers.
Those provisions were in place to deal with things like signage and
appeal mechanisms and proper telephone numbers for people to contact if
they have been clamped.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 420<a class="bkMark" name="Column420">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">So the
previous Government recognised the problems with rogue clampers and a
large consultation took place in 2009 on what to do about those
problems. Out of that consultation came the decision to introduce
tighter regulation and the various provisions that then flowed into the
Crime and Security Act. That had the support of the majority of
stakeholders within the parking sector. There were those who wanted a
complete ban but organisations like the BPA felt that there was enough
in that Act to offer motorists protection. However, none of the
provisions in the Act relating to wheel-clamping protection has been
enacted.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People in
England are still being subjected to those rogue clampers. It is
disappointing that the Government did not, perhaps as an interim
measure, introduce the provisions in the Crime and Security Act to
offer some protection now. As I understand it, it will take quite a
long time to bring in the ban—it will be 2012 or 2013 at the
earliest. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that. It worries me that
people are still without the protection that is set out in law at the
moment, which could be introduced even if only on an interim
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have listened to what the Minister said about people being intimidated
by having a wheel clamp applied to their car, and, as someone who has
had their car wheel-clamped, I fully appreciate that, but I recall from
my experience of being wheel-clamped that the behaviour of the wheel
clamper was quite intimidating in itself. The wheel clamper was not a
pleasant person to deal with. Although he did not march me to a
cashpoint to take money out, his manner and his refusal properly to
engage with me were worrying. We all recognise that even with ticketing
there could still be a level of intimidation in the way in which the
car ticketers
behave.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want the Minister to make it clear to the Committee and the general
public that the clause will not deliver a total ban on wheel-clamping
in England. The provisions will only prevent wheel-clamping on private
land; the police and local authorities will still have the power to
clamp on the public highway and on land managed by local authorities.
The DVLA may clamp, and certain byelaws permit landowners to continue
to clamp and
remove.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also an issue with bailiffs. Again, that is an area in which there
is some confusion. The written submissions from some of the bailiff
companies show 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 421<a class="bkMark" name="Column421">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that they are concerned about what the Bill will
do. As I understand it—again I seek
clarification from the Minister—certified bailiffs will have the
power to immobilise or remove vehicles for unpaid council tax or other
unpaid national taxes. Paragraph 56 of the Home Office Public Reading
stage report states that bailiffs will continue to be able to clamp,
but the written evidence provided by John Kruse, the editor of
<em>Bailiff Studies Bulletin</em>¸ disputes that. He said that
what the Home Office says about the continuing powers of bailiffs to
clamp is not
correct.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
submission from Claire Sandbrook, an authorised High Court enforcement
officer and the chief executive officer of Shergroup, also agrees that
there is confusion about how the Bill’s provisions will affect
the power of bailiffs. It would be helpful if the Minister would look
at that and comment on what the correct understanding should be. It
would also be helpful if the Minister would detail her understanding of
when a vehicle may be clamped and by
whom.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Home Office has produced an impact assessment on this issue, but there
are some concerns about that impact assessment. First, it does not
address the costs to the police of enforcing the ban. Has any thought
been given to how that could be looked at and collated? What
methodology was used to determine that? If a wheel clamper criminally
wheel-clamps a vehicle, does the Minister expect the police to take
that forward? I understand what she has said about its being the
decision of the CPS to prosecute, but will it be on that one basis, or
does she expect the police to be looking for a pattern of a
wheel-clamping company operating when it should not? What is the
likelihood of prosecutions? Bearing in mind what my hon. Friend the
Member for Alyn and Deeside said about the cuts to the police and the
CPS and about the reduced budgets that are available, what priority
will it be
given?<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also the question whether a fine will be enough of a deterrent to
those people who wish to engage in such wheel-clamping after it becomes
a criminal offence. Has the Minister thought whether a term of
imprisonment ought to be one of the options available to the courts for
those people who engage in criminal
wheel-clamping?<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
would happen to persistent evaders? I am discussing motorists that will
simply continue to park on private land and will not engage with or
accept the issue of the parking ticket. What other options are open to
a landowner to change that behaviour? The Federation of Private
Residents’ Associations, in its submission to the Committee,
discussed some of the problems that exist for landowners. We have just
discussed the use of barriers under amendment 107, and the
federation states that it is not always possible to erect barriers.
That option is not always available to small estates or small
properties. The federation says that barriers
may<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000157">&#160;</a>

those of my hon. Friends the Members for Eltham and for Lewisham East
(Heidi Alexander) and of my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford), who are all sympathetic to the concerns
that were raised in the evidence of Rev. Dr Adam Scott OBE. He makes a

people wanting to use the station.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000163">&#160;</a>

its evidence, the estate committee seems to have thought through the
matter and set out several issues that it thinks ought to be addressed.
It discusses the concerns about rogue clampers and says that in its
view, the idea that all clamping on private land should be banned is
wrong, because it is rogue clampers who need to be dealt with, not the
issue of clamping itself.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000164">&#160;</a>

must also consider disabled drivers. I was concerned to see that the
equality assessment column of the impact assessment did not seem to
have much in it. There are equality issues for disabled drivers that
need to be addressed. Disabled drivers are much more likely to be
adversely affected by the provisions in the Bill. Disabled drivers have
fought hard over many years for disabled car parking spaces to be
marked, available and protected. How will they be protected now? If a
car is parked every day in a space designated for a disabled person,
what protection will be available so that the disabled person can use
the space? It is all very well to ticket, but that does not provide a
practical solution for the person who needs to use that disabled
parking space there and then. What can be
done?<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000171">&#160;</a>

Government have now taken the view that they wish to ban the practice.

“Well, you can put a ticket on the caravan,” but the
keeper cannot be pursued, which is the intention in later clauses. How
can we deal with caravans and trailers that are parked on private land?

suspect that Members on both sides of the Committee will have had a
long list of such cases passed on to them. In Croydon—a
neighbouring constituency to mine—one private car park is
notorious for clamping cars, with people having to pay large sums to
recover their vehicles. The Labour party has suggested that regulation
is the solution. It is not necessarily the solution for a vulnerable
person who, under a regulated system, is perfectly legally clamped but
is vulnerable as a result because they are unable to access their
vehicle at a time of day or night that puts them at risk. Regulation
does not necessarily address the issue, particularly in relation to
vulnerable people.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000182">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not as familiar with the cities of Edinburgh
and Glasgow as some Members might be, but I assume that there are
estates near railway stations in Scotland, and I assume that they also
have difficulties with illegal parking. The absence of clamping has not
caused them to seize up.<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000189">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is attempting to make a poor
comparison. For people who live on the commuter lines coming into and
out of London such parking is a serious problem. On the railway lines
that pass through my constituency the local authority has had to go to
great expense to introduce controlled parking zones around all those
stations, because of  the problems that are caused to local
communities by commuters who seek to railhead—to park their cars
around those railway
stations—<a class="bkMark" name="11042866000190">&#160;</a>
