Patrick’s day to you and to everyone on the Committee. I am

I remind them of my father’s admonition on drinking. He came
from Cork, and said, “Two is plenty, and four is only half
enough”, so do be careful this evening, if planning to
celebrate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000022">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 5
removes the requirement to give parents a minimum of 24 hours’
written notice that their child is required to attend detention outside
of usual school hours. Labour Members are worried about the clause and
will listen carefully to what the Government have to say about it. We
are concerned that it could put young children at risk, that it is
discourteous to parents and that it could put young carers in a
difficult situation. It could deny parents the knowledge of where their
child is and could cause great anguish, anxiety and perhaps
danger.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Why?
Where is the great campaign for the removal of the requirement? Where
are the people holding up banners saying, “24-hour notice of
detention to be abolished now”? Was it a measure introduced by a
red in tooth and claw, lily-livered, liberal Labour Government? No, the
current Secretary of State for Wales introduced it under a Conservative
Government in 1996. Where has the idea for its removal come from? My
charge against the Government is that it is another one of their
headline-grabbing initiatives. They dream up such stuff because they
know that they will get a few headlines in the tabloids. That is the
reason for this, so we will examine closely the Government’s
motives. Presumably, they will have to write into regulation all the
things that denote that the clause means nothing, which is what the

40 shows the importance of identifying the need for safeguards for
young carers in particular. It is vital that the needs and
responsibilities of young carers are considered when debating the
clause. In many cases, schools are aware of pupils with caring
responsibilities while, in many other cases, schools might not be fully
aware of them or even aware of them at all. I was the Minister with
responsibility for young carers for a short period, and I visited the
young carers’ annual outing on the south coast—a
remarkable event—to meet those remarkable young people. I hope
that Ministers in the Department have the opportunity to do the same.
One message that comes through very strongly is that schools are often
unaware of the situation at home and the burden of responsibility faced
by
pupils.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000027">&#160;</a>

you tell the teacher why you were late? If you are late will you be
given detention that means you can’t get home and make your mum

a policy within their school that aims to balance out such

that. Heads will make common-sense adjustments and decisions. If I were
a head, I would look to agree with parents. I would write to them and
come up with a settlement with them so that we had clarity. Many
parents would be quite happy for their child to be kept in if their
child was out of order, especially the parents of younger children who
are more likely to live nearby. If not, the head would make

turn to amendment 42. The clause shows lack of respect, as Sir Alan
Steer said in his oral evidence to us, for parents and their ability to
make plans for their family on any given evening. The NASUWT told us
that the
clause<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000051">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Under the clause,
parents would not necessarily be given any notice. The Government do
not seem to recognise that not all families can instantly drop
everything to accommodate a change of plans. The clause ignores the
fact that for many working parents a change in the time they must pick
up their child could be extremely difficult to negotiate with their
workplace at the last minute. The Government seem to be legislating to
say that that is
irrelevant.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000052">&#160;</a>

necessary votes to defeat the coalition because the Liberal Democrats
have done an about-face on some children’s issues, but perhaps I
am wrong about that. The Conservatives have done an about-face from
their position in 1996, when the now Secretary of State for Wales
legislated to introduce protection. If they use their majority to ram
the measure through against reason, we must try to temper it with a
reasonable
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000056">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me tell the hon. Gentleman one or two things.
For a start, I had experience of negotiating a coalition with the
Liberal Democrats in the Welsh Assembly in 2000 for my former boss,
Rhodri Morgan. Secondly, the first Bill Committee that I sat on in this
House, in 2001 or 2002, along with my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Heeley, dealt with similar territory: the Adoption of
Children Bill. It was amended by the Labour Ministers following
Back-Bench amendments, with cross-party support, which led to a bit of
a crisis in the Conservative party because its Members wanted to
support it, too. That was in relation to the law on adoption, when my
hon. Friend and I introduced very reasonable amendments. So we have a
lot of experience of being able to change legislation through this
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the
Government are committed to reducing the 24-hour notice of detention,
for whatever reason, we must ensure that there is a clear indication in
the Bill that the parent must be informed. That is the intention of
amendment 43. Not only must the parent be informed about the detention,
but the school must confirm that the parent has been informed. As I
read it, the clause takes away the 24-hour notice provision, but does
not include in the Bill a duty on the part of the school to inform the
parent.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000060">&#160;</a>

there should be confirmation that they have been informed. As I recall,
she herself commented on the issue as it related to pupils in rural
areas in our discussions at the evidence stage of the Bill. She
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000066">&#160;</a>

it requires something active on the part of the parent or carer, as
opposed to it being a matter of courtesy to inform the parents. This
whole thing is about giving notice—it is not about having a
conversation. I can see that there are cases where parents might choose
not to accept that they have been made aware of a detention. What would
happen in those cases? The problem with the provision is that it says
that in some way they have to confirm that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000068">&#160;</a>

reasonable notice of the detention. Some of the issues that I set out a
few minutes ago made that clear. Such notice can also avoid issues
relating to pupils with special educational needs. Organisations such
as Ambitious about Autism have concerns about the repeal of the
requirement to give notice of a detention to a parent. It is worried
that children on the autistic spectrum might have a limited
understanding of risk and danger. Disruption to their travel plans home
from school, changes to their routine, or parents being uncertain about
their whereabouts can all cause serious distress and create
safeguarding risks. We want more clarity from Government on how they
will ensure that the additional needs of children with autism are
considered in proposals. What proposals does the Minister have to

school might leave them without a safe means of getting home.
I note that the hon. Member for Wells raised this
point in the evidence sessions, when she asked for witnesses’
views on 24-hour detention. She

conclude, Sir Alan Steer made it clear that it was simply bad manners
for schools to proceed in that way. It is a good thing that the days
have gone—there used to be such days—of heads who used to
say of parents, “Tell them nothing. Don’t let them
through the school gates.” That used to be an attitude prevalent
in education. I wonder sometimes whether the Minister of State,
Department for Education, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, has a slight hankering for those days, given how he
approaches some subjects. Power without any accountability can be a
dangerous
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000082">&#160;</a>

therefore, surprised when the Minister announced the change during
Education questions, some time back in the summer. On that very day, I
was fortunate enough to be called in topical questions and was able to
raise the issue, and I have been raising the issue ever since.
Unfortunately, the Government have not accepted the real concerns here.
The Minister sets out—with admirable faith and trust in
teachers, head teachers and so on—that we have to trust
professionals. What would he say to the parents who I knew, whose
children were abused by a head teacher, using the position to do so?
The reality is that some people malevolently, and some through lack of
care, put children in situations of danger. The amendments seek to row
back from children possibly being put, either deliberately or
inadvertently, in situations that none of us would want them to be
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000087">&#160;</a>

do not attribute to the Minister, the Secretary of State or the
coalition Government a desire to cause problems for vulnerable
children. However, as has often been discussed, the matter is one of
balance. The issue was last debated more recently than when the
regulations were brought in, under clause 79 of the Education and
Inspections Bill, which became section 92 of the Education and
Inspections Act 2006. The Committee on that Bill had precisely this
debate about balance. The Minister, the hon. Member for South Holland
and The Deepings, who is not in his place, was present at that debate,
and he was remarkably consistent. However, the Committee also heard
from Liberal Democrat MPs, including the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and
North Poole (Annette Brooke), who has much experience of
children’s issues, and she
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000088">&#160;</a>

would be extremely concerned. It is perfectly acceptable to give 24

Friend has said, I am not wedded to 24-hour notice. Time has moved on
since the measure was first introduced, as have we all. Most of us have
mobile devices and better ways of keeping in touch, and many schools
have systems. Schools in my constituency subscribe to systems that
enable alerts to go out to parents, so that they are informed if, for
example, the school is closed because of snow. Systems are in place
that were simply not there before, so 24 hours may be neither here nor
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend and I are wedded to giving parents notice, however, which is
entirely reasonable. In what other circumstances would anybody behave
in this way? I know that Government Members—including the Chair
of the Education Committee, who is not in his place—would say,
“Well, teachers and head teachers are all reasonable.”
Unfortunately, that is not my experience. If the measure would lead to
one, two or 10 children every year finding themselves in situations
that any of us would not want our own children, nephews or nieces to be
in, we should not be introducing it. We should not be going for the
headline, “We are making teachers all-powerful. We have got rid
of this issue.” The matter is more important than
headlines.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000093">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have
spoken at length about young carers, and I have tabled questions and
received unsatisfactory responses on that. I know that the Minister
recognises the problem. The hon. Member for Wells has also raised the
issues. They are better understood than when the Minister first made
his statement, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff West has
said, we know that every young carer is not known to the school, so we
cannot make assumptions about any child. Notice therefore seems
entirely reasonable, otherwise children will be left in the situation,
described by my hon. Friend, of having to make a decision about whether
they obey a teacher or whether they do something that causes a problem
for the person for whom they are caring, for a young sibling or for
themselves. Putting young children in situations in which they have to
make those kinds of decisions is not
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000094">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also concerned about wider child protection issues. I accept that
people who seek to abuse children will use whatever means available,
but we should not make it easier for them. For example, somebody might
befriend a child in an internet chat room by pretending to be another
13-year-old boy or girl and ask them to meet them after school. The
child might reply that they have to get home, but the other person
might say, “Tell your parents that you have detention.” A
requirement for notice makes it less easy for an abuser to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000095">&#160;</a>

a red herring, if that is the right expression. It is a completely
different situation when children are involved in out-of-school

child plays football, chess or whatever, as opposed to a situation that
has arisen for disciplinary purposes—again, I accept that that
is not an unreasonable sanction, but we are discussing keeping a child
in detention without a period of notice. Let me say to hon. Members
that I am raising a concern about the way that such a measure might be
used, rather than thinking on the hoof of situations that are not

example than I can. My main concern is about children who are placed in
difficult situations that put their safety and well-being at risk,
whether they are young carers or live in a rural area. The amendments
are entirely reasonable, and seek to put in place a system that is not
wedded to a period of 24 hours. A minority of the witnesses said that
the ability to issue a detention quickly was important. I accept that,
but I do not accept that it can be reasonable or safe in any
circumstances to have children kept in school without their parents or
carers knowing.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000108">&#160;</a>

notice—or not—still has to take place. Clearly it is a
courtesy to bring parents on side, and that is an important part of
ensuring that the school works effectively with parents. There must be
that working relationship for the school to excel, and for pupils to be
happy and excel. The Minister is fully aware of my concerns about
students who live in rural areas and use the school bus as their only
route home. There is little public transport in rural areas, and I have
commented on that matter in the Education Committee and

contact parents, preferably by text or e-mail so that there is a record
to prove that contact has been made. Amendment 42 states that there

are in place. There are also fixed-term exclusions, and they can be on
the premises or off the premises. Sometimes—on rare
occasions—it is necessary to use fixed-term exclusions to give
both the child and the school an opportunity to look at the situation
again, to see what needs to be put in place before the child comes
back. Increasingly, schools are using fixed-term exclusions on the

schools. Detentions tend to be for the most minor infringements of
school rules such as not bringing homework to school or minor
disruptions. For all the other things, there are plenty of sanctions in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000128">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
only argument the Government have put forward is about the child who
says, “I know my rights.” That is incredibly difficult
for any teacher to deal with, but good teachers do not get defensive,
argue with the child or get into a confrontation—they handle
such things sensibly. A good teacher, faced with the argument,
“I know my rights. You have to give 24 hours’
notice”, would simply say, “You’re absolutely
right. I have a life as well, and I, too, need 24 hours’ notice
to put my life in place, so I’ll see you back here at 4
o’clock tomorrow, and we’ll entertain each other a bit
longer.” They take the confrontation out of the situation. The
clause appears to be legislation for poor teaching, and goes against
everything that the Minister has said about the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Why
was the measure introduced in the first place? It was introduced by a
Conservative Government, and was sensible in the view of most people in
education. It was introduced because of the huge number of complaints
from parents—not unreasonable parents who said, “I know
my rights”, but parents who were worried that their children
were simply not turning up at the right time. Serious distress was
caused by children not turning up at home at the time they should have
and parents were justifiably angry about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

were complaints from parents, but there were complaints from staff as
well. As I said earlier, they, too, have a right to a life, and they
need 24 hours’ notice because they need to make arrangements. So
there were complaints from parents and teachers. Coming back to what I
said earlier, I do not understand where this is coming from. I am not
aware of a huge groundswell of opinion in schools or requests from
teachers that they need to have 24 hours’
notice.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000131">&#160;</a>

children who live in rural areas, and the hon. Member for Wells spoke
eloquently about them. Some children live in areas where there is one
bus that they can catch, or they need to get the school bus, otherwise
they have serious
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000132">&#160;</a>

Select Committee heard a great deal of evidence about young carers and
children with SEN. The fact is that schools do not always know who
their young carers are. I remember a situation some years ago when I
was called to a child protection case conference, which is a serious
matter. We assume that head teachers use common sense but are then
confronted with evidence that they do not always do that. A young child
of five was coming into school very dirty and hungry at about 11
o’clock every morning. The child had serious speech and language
difficulties and could not tell the teachers what was happening. The
head teacher called a child protection case conference, which is a
serious issue, but a little bit of digging would have identified that
the mother, who was a cleaner, went out to work at 5 o’clock in
the morning. Normally, a 17-year-old sibling got the child up and got
him ready and off to school. Because of circumstances, that sibling was
in youth custody, so the child was getting up in the morning on his
own. He was dirty because he was setting the fire before he came to
school. He would think, “I am hungry and I can get a free school
meal. I’ll wander off to school.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000133">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That was an

teachers should act sensibly and use common sense, but experience
suggests that they do not always do that. I ask the Minister genuinely:
what is the reasoning? Given the whole range of sanctions available to
teachers—permanent exclusion, fixed-term inclusion, internal
exclusion and detention, which is used for minor infringements of
school rules—I cannot think of an incident where it would not be
possible or right to give 24 hours’ notice. I can only think
that the Minister is legislating for poor teaching, which he clearly
would not want to do. That would not be in the interest of good schools
or good teachers, and certainly not in the interest of parents. The
children who are most likely to be disadvantaged, as we have said many
times, would be those who have special needs, who are living in poverty
or who are living in rural areas. I am looking to the Minister for an
answer on why he has come up with that proposal, because I simply do
not

                           </strong> In 2006, the cyber-bullying of teachers was not a
pervasive issue, but it is today. There is a concern in the public
about low-level disruption in our schools and about children not doing
their homework. Teachers tell me that it is hard to get children to
learn their vocabulary for the next lesson. People may think that that
is not the most important issue in behaviour, but it is. If we are to
raise behavioural and academic standards in our schools, we have to
tackle serious incidents of poor behaviour and the persistent low-level
disruption that happens in too many of our schools. We also have to
change the culture in our schools so that pupils understand that they
have to do their homework, concentrate and achieve if we are to have an
education system that will enable them to compete in a global
economy.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000141">&#160;</a>

This is not, of course, the only measure we are introducing to tackle
poor behaviour and, of course, a detention may not be sufficient to
tackle very serious issues of poor behaviour. It is one of many
measures, but the problem is that all the measures we are proposing to
tackle poor behaviour—or too many of them—are being
opposed by Opposition

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
5 removes the requirement in England that a pupil’s parents must
be given 24-hours’ written notice of detention outside school
hours. Being able to use detentions more effectively will help teachers
nip persistent disruption in the bud, before it escalates to the point
at which a pupil is excluded. That is what we all want to achieve: we
do not want to have to resort to the nuclear option of expulsion
whenever a child commits a serious offence. It is better if these
behavioural problems can be nipped in the bud and that is what this and
other measures are designed to achieve. The requirement to give
24-hours’ written notice can encourage pupils and parents to
challenge teachers over a detention and thereby diminish their
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000146">&#160;</a>

of authority in schools back to the teacher and head teacher and we do
not apologise for that. That is the direction of travel we want for
schools. Head teachers will be given the freedom to decide what
arrangements are most appropriate for their school. They will set a

this requirement is removed, a number of safeguards will remain in
place. There is already a legal requirement that disciplinary penalties
must be reasonable in all circumstances and when considering this,
teachers must take account of the special circumstances of the pupil,
including age and any special educational needs or disabilities. That
requirement applies when issuing detention outside school hours and it
means that an out-of-hours detention will be unlawful if the
pupil’s parents are not given notice, if that is appropriate in

needs of particular pupils in these contexts and they should be trusted

teachers and teachers to behave reasonably. There are many instances
when issuing an immediate detention could well be reasonable, for
example, a summer evening when it stays light until 10 pm or when a
school serves a very small local community. In such circumstances, it
is perfectly reasonable for a child to stay an extra hour after school

September 2010 and found that teachers reported that removing the
requirement for 24-hour notice of detention would be empowering, as it
would allow timely detention at the teacher’s convenience,
rather than at that of the pupil. Ofsted, which we cited during the
debate, reports that 20.2% of state-funded secondary schools are judged
only satisfactory for behaviour and that a further 1.1% are judged
inadequate. That is a huge number of schools, serving a large number of

The list is not exhaustive when deciding whether an out-of-hours
detention is reasonable for a pupil. Teachers must consider what
notification to the parent is reasonable, as well as all the relevant
circumstances. There is not a fixed rule, and  the current
safeguards recognise that decisions about notice should depend on the

the school should take into account, when issuing detentions. We must

in our schools. I feel strongly about that because it is a matter not

To many of us who have worked with young children, there is a big
difference between what happens in schools and the ability of schools
to manage challenging behaviour, and the support networks that those
young people need. It is a dangerous path to conflate the support that
we need to give young people who are facing difficult challenges in
their lives, and the ways in which schools are operating. There are
dangers in not looking at how the powers could be used by head teachers
and teachers, and in using the cover of being concerned about what is
happening within schools and with our young people in Britain today.

serious

what safeguards are already in place. In addition to the safeguards
that I have highlighted, such as public bodies and schools acting
reasonably and the specific safeguards under the 2006 Act, governing
bodies will continue to have a statutory duty under the Education Act
2002 to make arrangements to ensure that their functions are carried
out with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of pupils
under the age of 18 at school. For example, they must consider
safeguarding issues when drawing up a statement of general principles
to which the head teacher is to have regard when determining the
school’s behaviour policy. That would include issues arising
outside school
hours.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000175">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady’s accusation was that the clause puts at risk the
safety and well-being of pupils. However, it does not, because current
law does not permit schools to put children at such risk. That is what
I demonstrated by citing the 2002 and 2006 Acts and general principles
of common law.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000176">&#160;</a>

we have moved on and it has been raised by the Minister. I have no
reason to doubt the Minister—he has set out the law—but
what is the purpose of not having any notice for detention? All such
notice would do is add an extra safeguard to enable a teacher who, for
whatever reason, was not aware of the special needs—teachers,
like everybody else, do not have special powers—to act in the
same way as they can under other
laws.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000177">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Those safeguards are already in place. The problem
with a statutory requirement for 24 hours’ notice is that it
would prevent head teachers and principals from taking the action
needed to tackle poor behaviour in our schools by children who are not
subject to those extra responsibilities and special needs. Again, I
cite Sir Michael Wilshaw. His school is in a difficult and challenging
part of London in Hackney, and it would be difficult to say that that
is a safe area all the time. He

                           </strong> I agree. I am not saying that head teachers should
not contact parents, or have arrangements in place with them. However,
it should be left to the professional judgment of teachers and head
teachers. We should not write into statute a series of new duties
telling schools how they should be run. The general duties that I have
cited state that they should act reasonably and, in doing so, take into
account the circumstances of children with special needs and special
responsibilities. That is the law at the moment, and I do not think
that we need to go beyond that and specify what letters they have to
write to whom within whatever number of hours. That is the problem that
confronts us on this and so many other measures that we are trying to
tackle in order to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on our schools.
When considering the issues, teachers have to take into account the
special circumstances of the pupil and any caring responsibilities that
they have. That is the law and it will remain so after clause 5 is
agreed
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11031764000181">&#160;</a>

out-of-hours detention will be unlawful if the person imposing it is

account of them by giving, for instance, appropriate notice. However,
as the Princess Royal Trust for Carers has pointed out to me, it is not
the notice that is the main issue for children with caring
responsibilities, but it may be the detention itself, with or without
notice. If children are picking up their siblings at the primary school
down the road at half-past 3, they have to do that every day and, in
many cases, will not be able to make alternative arrangements. Schools
need to take that into account right now, with or without the
requirement for 24 hours’ notice. Teachers
