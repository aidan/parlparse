							<b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings)
(Con): I beg to move amendment No. 52, in
clause 70, page 40, line 14, after &#145;their&#146;, insert
&#145;aspirations and&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08022862000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is nice to be in the final
run, on the last lap of our marathon, which has been enjoyable and, we
hope, valuable. The amendment that I tabled with my hon. Friends deals
with the duty of the Learning and Skills Council to provide facilities
for training adults at only basic levels. The explanatory notes on
clause 70 state:</div>
					<a name="08022862000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;New section 4A places a
new duty on the LSC to make proper (rather than reasonable) provision
for facilities to enable adults who lack particular vocational skills
to obtain relevant qualifications. The qualifications will typically be
those at relatively low levels of learning, which are designed to equip
people with basic and intermediate skills for work and everyday
living.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concern is that the Government are implicitly encouraging the LSC to
provide facilities for training at a too basic level, which is not in
line with the findings of the Leitch review, on which we touched
earlier in our considerations. The review explicitly spoke of the
importance of upskilling and reskilling the work force to deliver what
it called &#147;world-class skills&#148; because if we are to meet
the skills challenge we need to deal with the demographic imperative.
Even if we are highly successful with very young people, we need to
upskill the existing workforce to meet the demands of an increasingly
competitive world
economy.</div>
					<a name="08022862000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
the Leitch review, we
need</div>
					<a name="08022862000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a step change in
skills investment if we are to meet those economic
challenges.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The review
estimates that there will be 3 million fewer low-skilled jobs by 2020,
and a demand for another 5 million highly skilled workers. We cannot
rely only on improving on the skills of young people to meet this
challenge. Demographic change means that more than 70 per cent. of the
2020 workforce will be over the age of 16. Leitch
concludes:</div>
					<a name="08022862000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is a pressing need to raise the rates of skill improvements among
adults. The UK cannot reach a world class ambition by 2020 without
this.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
a mountain to climb if we are to equip people with the skills they need
to prosper. More than a third of British adults do not have basic
school-leaving qualifications&#151;double the proportion in Germany
and Canada. One in six do not have the literacy levels expected of an
11-year-old, and half do not have that level of functional numeracy.
Just 28 per cent. of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column744" />Column number: 744</div>Britons are qualified to apprentice-skilled craft and technician level,
as opposed to 51 per cent. in France and 65 per cent. in
Germany.</div>
					<a name="08022862000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
evidence, however, that people do not have sufficient access to
opportunities to raise their skills level. British
workers spend less time in job-related training than workers in key
competitor countries. Consequently, many workers below management level
have relatively poor skill levels and little prospect of advancement.
Participation in education and training can help to enhance prospects
for employment and career advancement, and can also lead to wider
benefits for the community and the individual concerned. Research
suggests that participation in learning can have benefits for health,
help to reduce crime and lead to greater social
cohesion.</div>
					<a name="08022862000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
entitlement to free tuition for any adult who has not achieved a full
level 2 qualification. As I suggested to the Minister in departmental
questions last week, the evidence suggests that there may be a
declining rate of participation for those who are not already trained
to level 2 standards. We tabled the amendment, because we are anxious
that the offer to the people concerned should be appropriate to meet
the skills targets outlined by Lord Leitch. There would be a real risk
that we would not do so if we set the bar too
low.</div>
					<a name="08022862000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is essential
that we raise Britain&#146;s intermediate and higher-level skills. As
the Minister will tell us, it is a prerequisite to get people on the
ladder in the first place so that they can subsequently climb to the
top of it. However, I feel that there is a risk in the Bill as drafted
that we will set the standards below where they should be, and that the
Learning and Skills Council may set a common denominator that is
insufficiently demanding to meet the Leitch
challenge.</div>
					<a name="08022862000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000236"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I say this to help the hon. Gentleman. We
have 30 or 40 pages of amendments to get through in one day. This
amendment is very narrow, as it deals with the question of whether the
training provided by the council should meet someone&#146;s
aspirations as well as their requirements. On one level, it is entirely
up to the hon. Gentleman how he uses his time, but if we have a very
detailed debate on each of the first 20 amendments, we will have no
debate on the remaining 50 or
so.</div>
					<a name="08022862000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000237"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Let me assure you, Mr. Bayley, that that
fear will not be realised. On looking at the amendments on the
selection list, I passed a note to my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton. In respect of amendment No. 52, I wrote
&#147;longish&#148;, referring to my speech, but in respect of
subsequent amendments, I wrote &#147;v.
short&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022862000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000238"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> If the hon. Gentleman is satisfied, he may make
progress.</div>
					<a name="08022862000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000239"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I assure you, Mr. Bayley, that we will
make rapid progress following this extensive peroration. I think it
important that we fill the Bill with aspiration. As you suggested in
your reference to the amendment, Mr. Bayley, that is
precisely the term that we have used. If we set individual and national
aspirations at insufficiently 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column745" />Column number: 745</div>demanding levels, we will not only short-change
those individuals but we will not face up to the realities identified
in Leitch regarding the need to raise skills levels to maintain
economic competitiveness. If we are to upskill and reskill to meet the
skills challenges outlined by Leitch, adults will need access to
education and training at various stages of their working lives and at
various levels. We need a mechanism to ensure that the resources are
there to provide support, when required, through a lifetime of
learning. It is in that aspirational spirit that I have tabled the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022862000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000240"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and
Skills (Mr. David Lammy):
						</b> I
am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment. It is because we
want to help adult learners meet their aspirations and aid the least
skilled in achieving their potential that we are introducing, for the
first time, the right to free training towards Skills for Life. That
training would cover a person&#146;s first full level 2&#151;GCSE
level&#151;qualifications and, for those aged between 19 and 25,
their first level 3&#151;A-level standard&#151;qualification. All
the stakeholders I have met, from college principals to organisations
representing adult learners, providers and employers, have indicated
their support for the new duties on the Learning and Skills Council in
clause 70. College principals indicated that support in the
Committee&#146;s oral evidence
sessions.</div>
					<a name="08022862000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings is right to point to the
Leitch review of skills, which is the backdrop to the provisions. Our
stretching ambition is to have world-class skills by 2020, and that
means that we need to go further in creating a system that responds to
learners&#146; individual requirements to improve aspirations and
increase demand for learning. To pick up on the language used in the
Committee, clause 70 does much to &#147;galvanise&#148;&#151;or
as the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings prefers to say,
&#147;catalyse&#148;&#151;the system so that it can respond to
individual learner needs and aspirations. Ensuring that people have the
opportunity to obtain a wide range of skills at basic and intermediate
levels is the most effective way both to improve the life chances of
those with fewer skills and to support social
justice.</div>
					<a name="08022862000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">They key
change in clause 70 is that, for the first time, we have placed a new
duty on the Learning and Skills Council to secure the provision of
&#147;proper&#148;, rather than &#147;reasonable&#148;,
facilities for specified adult qualifications. To fulfil that duty, the
Learning and Skills Council must secure the provision of facilities for
education and training which are of sufficient quantity and quality to
meet the reasonable needs of individuals and be suitable to their
requirements. In practice, the new duty on the LSC means that adults
have a right to expect free and appropriate provision for specified
Skills for Life qualifications. In future, learners can expect a wide
variety of courses on offer to suit their requirements: those courses
should be made available within a reasonable time period and should be
free.</div>
					<a name="08022862000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000241"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for welcoming the
spirit of the amendment. He will know that work-based training has
declined over the past 20 years. What element of work-based training
does he anticipate will form part of the range of products offered as a
result of the Bill, and how does he explain that
decline?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column746" />Column number: 746</div>
					<a name="08022862000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000242"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman and I have had disagreements,
ever since I took up my post, on the numbers behind work-based
training, and I have continually tried to reassure him. I am beginning
to think that he is the only person left in the country who believes
that work-based training has declined. It has not. It continues to be
something of which we can be proud, and the Government&#146;s
aspirations are to take work-based training
further.</div>
					<a name="08022862000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the hon.
Gentleman looks at the statistics, he must concentrate his attention,
particularly in relation to apprenticeships, on the number of young
people who start work-based training and the number who complete it. He
will see that on both accounts the figures have gone up and are moving
in the right direction. If he concentrates on the number of young
people as a snapshot, or as an average of young people in learning,
there appears to be a decline. He has written to me in the past and
told me not to do that in relation to the figures when his
Administration were in power&#151;that is where we have got the
figure of 75,000 from. We want young people coming on, and coming off,
work-based training&#151;not staying on it and failing to complete
it. If completions go up, the average number in learning at any one
time appears to be lower&#151;it is about starts and completions.
That is the statistical difference. The hon. Gentleman might be using
statistics to meet his argument, but he has also challenged me on
statistics, when I have used them in that way. Work-based learning is
not in decline, but going in the right
direction.</div>

					<a name="08022862000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000243"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Minister is always generous in accepting
interventions. I do not want to prolong this too much. First, perhaps
we can look at figures on work-based training later in the day and
satisfy ourselves as to who is
right.</div>
					<a name="08022862000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly&#151;I
raised this issue in a ministerial question last week, but I have not
yet received an answer&#151;what about the Learning and Skills
Council data, which suggest that the number of adults without a level 2
qualification who are now participating is less than it previously
was.</div>
				
					<a name="08022862000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000244"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> Over the comprehensive spending review period, the
Department will spend &#163;1.5 billion per annum on learning below
level 2, to get people up to level 2, precisely because that is the
direction of travel and we want to see people moving in the right
direction. That is what the clause is
about.</div>
					<a name="08022862000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Learner choice
is paramount, so the Bill requires the Learning and
Skills Council both to increase opportunities for learners to exercise
choice and to encourage a wider range of education and training
opportunities. That includes the provision of more part-time courses
and ensuring a closer fit with the local, regional and national job
market. Effective operation of our information, advice and guidance
services under the guise of the adult advancement and careers service,
too, will support learners, helping them to identify the right courses
for them up front and, if necessary, to find a range of suitable
alternatives to meet their needs and aspirations. Those services will
proactively market the opportunities open to people, and ensure that
they have information about courses and financial
support. We envisage that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column747" />Column number: 747</div>the advancement service will work with the LSC to
address any gaps in provision. From what I have said so far, the
Committee will see that I support the intention of the amendment, but
believe that the provisions in clause 20 go a long way towards
achieving what the amendment
desires.</div>
					<a name="08022862000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inclusion of the word, &#147;aspirations&#148;, is inappropriate on
two levels. First, on a practical level, the LSC is necessarily a
high-level funding body, which must make strategic decisions on the
funding of facilities and training across the country while acting to
increase opportunities for learners to exercise choice. We might
reasonably expect it to reach a view on whether facilities are suitable
to the requirements of persons falling within subsection (3) of new
section 4A. However, the LSC is not the body that will deal day to day
with individuals and assess their needs according to their future
goals. In other words, the LSC is not in a position to meet something
as subjective as a learner&#146;s aspiration. That would require it
to engage at too deep a level with every individual in the bracket,
because learners&#146; aspirations are highly subjective.</div>
					<a name="08022862000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We consider that nextstep,
learndirect and the future adult advancement and careers service are
best placed to engage directly with learners to define their
aspirations and access courses best suited to them. The legislation
must be seen as an essential building block in the wider context of
delivering commitments set out in the &#147;World-class
Skills&#148; reforms, which, over the course of the next few years,
will ensure that all adults have access to the learning opportunities
and wider support that they need to achieve those skills, find work and
establish careers in line with their
aspirations.</div>
					<a name="08022862000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Linked to
that point is the fact that aspirations are
subjective. The clause uses the word,
&#147;requirements&#148;, which is much more easily defined in law
through assessment of needs and can be costed. Aspirations are
potentially unlimited and difficult to determine. The amendment would
put the LSC in the position of being required to make provision to
satisfy ambiguous aims. The clauses as drafted are carefully balanced
to ensure that the duties of the Learning and Skills Council enable it
to operate in practice, while enabling learners&#146; needs to be
met. That is why it uses the word,
&#147;requirements&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022862000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I would like to emphasise that part of the intention of the clause is
to signal to the system that adult skills are as important as improving
the skill levels of young people. We have had much discussion about the
skills needs and participation of young people, but we should remember
that, if we are to meet that Leitch ambition, two thirds of the 2020
work force are already in work and are adults. Indeed, it is at that
cohort of people&#151;and there are many of them&#151;who have jobs
that will stop being part of the British economy in this century, who
never got an O-level standard qualification, and who do not have the
appropriate literacy and numeracy levels, at which the provisions in
clause 17 are aimed. For that reason, I hope that the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022862000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000245"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> This has been a useful opportunity to speak about
skills and their significance, and how the Bill affects the ambitions
that we share for raising skills 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column748" />Column number: 748</div>levels. One might argue that learning detached from aspirational intent
is an impoverished affair. However, the Minister
makes a plausible argument that the amendment would make the practical
job of constructing learning very difficult, because aspirations are as
various as the individuals in the
system.</div>
					<a name="08022862000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We hope,
however, that the Government will be absolutely committed to ensuring
that the learning put in place as a result of the Bill is progressive
and aspires to allow people to achieve their potential. That is the
spirit of the amendment, but, given what the Minister
has said and his shared determination to bring about
that aim, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

am moving the amendment, Mr. Bayley, although it could
easily have been my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The
Deeping.</div>
					<a name="08022862000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to move
amendment No. 115, in clause 70, page 43, line 33, at end
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) For the
purpose of paragraph (4) a level 1 literacy qualification must ensure
that students can effortlessly decode any word using the principles of
synthetic
phonics.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08022862000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
view of the time remaining for the Committee stage of the Bill, I will
keep my remarks succinct. The purpose of the amendment is to introduce
into the new definition of level 1 literacy that will be inserted into
the Learning and Skills Act in new subsection (4A), the requirement
that students must be able to</div>
					<a name="08022862000051"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;effortlessly decode any word,
using the principles of synthetic
phonics.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wanted to make the point that in Britain and America, but particularly
in Britain, we have a long tale of underachievement. That is a defining
characteristic of the British education system in comparison with other
OECD countries. According to the National Audit Office, 23 per cent. of
adults cannot read the dosage on an aspirin bottle. The same figure
applies in the United States. That is one of the highest levels of
illiteracy in the OECD. Britain and the United States have one thing in
common: since the 1950s, they have both gone down the route of using
&#147;look and say&#148; as a method of teaching children to
read.</div>
					<a name="08022862000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea behind
that method is that children will be able to sight read instantly, in
the way that adults can when they read words. Bright or average
children can pick up decoding techniques using that method.
However, less able children do not grasp it. That bottom 25 per cent.
of children have suffered for 50 years in this country and the United
States from the &#147;look and say&#148; method of teaching
children to read. That is an appalling tragedy, yet many people in the
education establishment still advocate that
method.</div>
					<a name="08022862000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Clackmannanshire study, which was conducted over seven years, a
synthetic phonics method was used 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column749" />Column number: 749</div>to teach children the 44 sounds of the alphabet and how to blend them
together into words within the first 16 weeks of school. It was so
successful that, after seven years, those children had a reading age of
fourteen and a half at the age of 11. That is three and a half years
above what was expected of their age group, and above the level that
they would have attained, had they stuck to the previous system. The
National Reading Panel in the United States is a multi-million dollar
research project, and it shows unequivocally that synthetic phonics is
how children should be taught to read.</div>
					<a name="08022862000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">When teachers say, &#147;Yes
we use phonics, but we need a range of measures as well&#148;, it
means that they are not using synthetic phonics. Synthetic phonics has
to be an exclusive scheme. One cannot shift between schemes. The main
characteristic is that children&#146;s reading books should not
include words that go beyond the child&#146;s phonic knowledge. If
children are taught to guess a word from the picture, the story or
grammar context, they are not developing and honing their decoding
skills. If they are not doing that, they are not learning to
read.</div>
					<a name="08022862000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">People complain
that it is &#147;read and bark&#148; and does not develop
vocabulary, but we are only talking about the first few weeks of
schooling. Of course, one can help children to understand words with
comprehension too, but there must be a focus on teaching children how
to decode the alphabet in the same way that a piano teacher teaches a
child how to transfer notes from the written stave on to the keys of a
piano and to practise their
fingering.</div>
					<a name="08022862000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am delighted that the Government have commissioned the Rose review to
implement the scheme. It is not a right-left issue&#151;it is a
right-wrong issue, and we have to work together to ensure that it is
rolled out in all schools. It is the fundamental building block of
education. I have seen many examples of schools around the country that
have adopted synthetic phonics, which has transformed the life chances
of children from very deprived backgrounds. We must ensure that
synthetic phonics is used in every state primary school in this
country, just as it is used in every independent primary school. That,
more than any other single measure, will raise educational achievement
in this country.</div>

							<b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): First, I congratulate the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on succeeding in having
his amendment selected and his hobby horse debated. He has had more
luck than my hon. Friends had in the Chamber on Tuesday when we were
tried to have our amendment on Europe selected. While we were debating
the Education and Skills Bill in Committee, we missed all the fun that
was going on in the
Chamber.</div>
					<a name="08022862000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, too, visit
many primary schools, just like the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton. I always ask teachers how they teach children to read,
and there is real enthusiasm for, and commitment to, synthetic phonics
as a valuable tool. Indeed, I sat in on a lesson, and by the end, I was
able to pronounce several words quite differently from how I would
normally do. I cannot remember whether it was Lord Lamont or the right
hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) who said
that he did not want to be a &#147;one-club&#148; Chancellor, with
only one club in his bag: in other words, using interest rates as the
only policy to bear down on inflation.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column750" />Column number: 750</div>
					<a name="08022862000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are many ways of teaching
children to read. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
referred to &#147;look and say&#148;. If there is just one method
in the Bill, there is a danger that it will be promoted over and above
all the others. Synthetic phonics undoubtedly works for all children,
which is what the hon. Gentleman argued, but &#147;look and
say&#148; and other methods are necessary to bring on other children
who may get bored quite quickly with synthetic
phonics.</div>
					<a name="08022862000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022862000249"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Gibb</b>
							<b class="B">:</b>
						 This is an important point. There are no
children for whom &#147;look and say&#148; is more appropriate.
What teachers tell me is that some children simply do not get phonics.
They are the least able children, and so the least likely to get on
with &#147;look and say&#148;. If children cannot get the synthetic
phonics and the phonics approach, they have to get it, which means
taking them aside and giving them extra lessons to ensure that they can
decode words using phonics.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000250"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I do not think we disagree. I am just saying
that there is more than one way of teaching children to read.</div>
					<a name="08022862000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
primarily concerned with 16 and 17-year-olds, but the clause that the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton seeks to amend sets a
literacy target for those aged 19 and over. By the time someone is 19
and over, the ability to pronounce or decode a word in a phonics style
is not necessarily an adult skill to which we would aspire or wish to
visit upon our fellow countrymen. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman
genuinely desires the literal interpretation of his amendment: that
everyone aged 19 and over should be able to decode phonics. I would
have thought that success with phonics meant that children, by the age
of seven or eight, would be able to read in what we would describe as
the normal way and would have forgotten that phonics was the method by
which they learned to read. To suggest that those aged 19 and over
should be able to speak in a phonics style seems rather bizarre, so I
will not support the amendment if it is pressed to a
vote.</div>
					<a name="08022862000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022862000251"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): In special
schools, where there are children with real barriers to learning,
synthetic phonics is used, and it succeeds in teaching those children
to read. It brings shame on our nation that 40,000 youngsters leave
school each year unable to read, write and add up properly. The
Minister for Schools and Learners puts his head in his hands, but the
standard that those youngsters fail to achieve means that they cannot
write to their bank to tell it they have
moved.</div>
					<a name="08022862000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000252"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b> We are
talking about adult skills, and many of the people whom we are talking
about in relation to the Bill were educated under a previous
Government. I think that it would be worth while for the hon. Gentleman
to bear that in
mind.</div>
					<a name="08022862000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000253"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister, who seems to have
forgotten that his lot have been in office for 10 years, so
we are talking about many youngsters who  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column751" />Column number: 751</div>have been educated under the Labour Government. It
is not a party political issue to say, as a country, that our
youngsters ought to be able to read and write. If we use synthetic
phonics to teach children who face real barriers to learning, it is our
duty to teach those who do not face such barriers. To
have so many people leaving school unable to read, write and add up
properly is wrong, and is an unacceptable scar on the nation. When one
can read and write, one can of course educate oneself. In the great
history of socialism, the Labour party had the Labour book club, and
people educated themselves because they could read and
write.</div>

so.</div>
					<a name="08022862000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000255"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> They did not necessarily get the right answer. The
truth is that the ability to read and write is such a huge engine for
education and achievement that we need to do better as a
country.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000256"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> I have often wondered what the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton would sell if he were a salesman, and I
think that the Committee has been provided with the answer. The new
duty on the Learning and Skills Council to secure provision for proper
facilities for learners includes the basic literacy skill
level&#151;literacy at level 1&#151;that was identified in the
independent report by Sandy Leitch as essential to changing
people&#146;s lives and upskilling the work force.</div>
					<a name="08022862000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would add an additional level of complexity to the learning aims of
learners undertaking a level 1 literacy qualification, as it would
ensure that students can effortlessly&#151;I am having literacy
problems, as I cannot pronounce that word&#151;decode any word using
the principles of synthetic phonics. I should emphasise that these are
adult skills courses aimed at people over the age of 19, and the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton directed his remarks
primarily at children&#146;s education.</div>
					<a name="08022862000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relevant
clauses are aimed, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and
Learners indicated, at people who were in education prior to 1989.
Learning to decode words using the principles of synthetic phonics
involves a particular approach to the teaching of reading. Synthetic
phonics is a particular branch of phonics, and is by no means the only
method of teaching reading. I believe that it should be up to
institutions, working with teachers and partner organisations such as
Lifelong Learning UK and the Quality Improvement Agency, to decide
exactly which teaching methods are appropriate for use with individual
adult learners.</div>
					<a name="08022862000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000257"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I counsel the Minister to be cautious about the
notes that have been prepared for him. The amendment is a probing
amendment, and I accept that he is talking about adult skills. However,
if we apply the principle to children, the law that was passed by his
Government says that primary schools should use one exclusive
method&#151;synthetic
phonics.</div>
					<a name="08022862000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000258"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> I acknowledge the progress made since the Rose
review in relation to this subject. However, we should remember that
the clause will affect adults from communities in which English is a
second language, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column752" />Column number: 752</div>adults who have had a bad experience at school but are able to read and
get the gist, and adults with special needs. A whole range of adults
are in that cohort, and we therefore believe it is right to give
institutions the choice and flexibility to apply the pedagogy that they
believe is appropriate. Some, indeed, will use synthetic phonics where
it is appropriate; others will not. I suspect that is why the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton focused on
children.</div>
					<a name="08022862000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000259"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Perhaps I can be helpful. Is this not really an
issue about the different levels of competence of those adults? We know
that literacy and numeracy, in their functional forms are very
different from literacy and numeracy per se. People can be
illiterate&#151;literally unable to read or write a word&#151;or
they can be functionally illiterate. Perhaps the Minister could be
helpful to the Committee, to my hon. Friend and to me by giving us a
feel for how those groups break down. Roughly 40,000 young people leave
school at 16 each year functionally illiterate and innumerate. That
total includes many people who are wholly illiterate. The methodology
will apply differently to different people. What is the breakdown, and
how many adults lack those very basic
skills?</div>
					<a name="08022862000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000260"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right in relation to literacy
and numeracy. If, like him, one is in church every Sunday morning, it
is possible to learn a hymn by singing it every week for six weeks, and
yet still have serious problems with basic literacy. In the same way,
it is possible to buy a round of drinks in the pub and to give friends
the appearance of knowing what change to expect from a &#163;20 note,
while lacking the numeracy skills to know the cost of that round of
drinks. Adults adapt and adjust in many ways to the numeracy and
literacy challenges they face.</div>
					<a name="08022862000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the figures, he will
know that our ambition is that 95 per cent. of working adults will have
functional level 1 literacy and entry level 3 numeracy skills by 2020.
I do not have the figures for those who are completely illiterate to
hand, but if I obtain them, I will let the hon. Gentleman
know.</div>
				
					<a name="08022862000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000261"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> It would help if the Minister provided
the Committee with a breakdown of the levels of
competence&#151;the paucity of skills&#151;among different groups
of individuals. That would give us a better opportunity to make a
judgment about the application of different
approaches&#151;methods&#151;to helping those people. If he cannot
do that now&#151;I accept that it is a tall order&#151;it would be
helpful if he could commit to coming back to the Committee with the
breakdown.</div>
					<a name="08022862000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000262"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> I think that the breakdown is in the Leitch review,
which the hon. Gentleman has at his side. It goes into these issues in
some depth. I am happy to come back him as to where those are contained
within the report. The clause is directly aimed at meeting the 2020
ambition in Leitch.</div>
					<a name="08022862000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would question whether
requiring students to be able to decode words&#151;I do not
like this word&#151;effortlessly would set an unrealistic threshold
for all adult learners gaining a level 1 literacy qualification. On the
contrary, I would suggest that for these learners, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column753" />Column number: 753</div>even at the conclusion of their literacy course, reading is likely to
require some effort. It also begs the question how we would assess
someone if he had performed a task effortlessly. That is ambiguous and
difficult to apply. For that reason, I hope that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="08022862000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000263"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> The &#147;toe by toe&#148; reading scheme is
used in prisons to teach children to read. That is a synthetic phonics
programme. I do not agree that it is not a skill that all adults need,
even at the age of 19. If you read the latest Michael Chabon book, for
example, it is full of words I have never come across before. To say
them to myself, I used the synthetic phonics approach of sounding them
out. Whenever a person comes across a new word, it is possible to use
that approach. It is a skill that people need. If someone was taught
under the &#147;look and say&#148; method and had not encountered a
word before, it would not be possible to ask someone else what it
meant. It is a very important point, therefore. I was disappointed by
the Minister&#146;s notion that somehow the threshold is too high for
some people. Again, that is the education of low expectations and low
aspiration.</div>
					<a name="08022862000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000264"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> To correct the record, I did not suggest that the
threshold was too high. I was simply making the point that it cannot
and should not be something that is directed by the Government and
Whitehall. We cannot have it both ways. We are talking about adults and
professionals, and many of those professionals gave evidence to the
Committee. They must determine whether, at this level, phonics and the
pedagogy that they wish to use is useful. There will be many who choose
that option. There are others, however, who will rightly choose other
options. The amendment would require them to go down one route. We
should be more flexible than that.</div>
					<a name="08022862000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000265"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> As I said, this is a probing amendment so we could
have a debate on the deep-seated causes of illiteracy in this country
which causes a problem to 19-year-olds in the workplace and older young
adults in the workplace who do not have these skills. The Government,
the Opposition and some members of the Liberal party are all saying
that there is one method of teaching children to read in primary school
and it is synthetic phonics. This is not because we know better but
because the evidence is unequivocal. There is no question when you read
the evidence that it is the method to teach children to read, and those
that do not do it are not using their professional skills according to
best practice. The Government agree with that and we agree with the
Government.</div>
					<a name="08022862000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way
dyslexic children are taught to read is with an intensive synthetic
phonics programme. Even for children with special needs, therefore, it
is also the right approach. I do not care which Government were in
power because the approach was not driven by Ministers until recently
when, in a welcome way, the Government intervened to require synthetic
phonics to be taught. That was driven by the
education establishment. The academics and the colleges of education
have peddled a &#147;look and say&#148; approach under our
Conservative Government, the previous Government to that and under this
Government as well until the Rose review. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column754" />Column number: 754</div>&#147;Look and say&#148; reached its peak in the mid-1980s under
Margaret Thatcher&#146;s Government. I do not care, therefore, under
which Government it occurred&#151;it was wrong. I am delighted that
we have now seen sense and that we are requiring primary schools to use
the method that all the evidence in the United States, the UK and
elsewhere says is the most effective method of teaching children to
read. Indeed, it is now used in Australia as well.</div>
					<a name="08022862000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a brief but

Mr. Bayley, by being very brief in speaking to these
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08022862000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
relate to part 3, which deals with adult skills. In particular, they
would amend part 2 of proposed new schedule 1A that
clause 70 would insert into the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which
relates specific qualifications to the learning aims for persons aged
19 and over. The amendments would add to the list of qualifications the
international general certificate of secondary education and the
Cambridge Assessment pre-U qualification. We have debated both of them
before, and do not need to do so again. The amendments speak for
themselves and we look forward to the Minister&#146;s equally pithy
response.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000269"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> As has been said, we have already debated the IGCSE
and pre-U qualifications at some length in relation to part 1, so I do
not propose to go over the same ground, and I am grateful that the hon.
Gentleman did not either.</div>
					<a name="08022862000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 70 is drafted so as to
define the new duties on the Learning and Skills Council against
generic and widely recognised descriptions of qualifications. As I have
already said, for level 2 that is five good GCSEs or above, and for
level 3 it is two A-levels. As they stand, the descriptions of the
relevant level of attainment at levels 2 and 3 are appropriate and well
understood by the Learning and Skills Council, the Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority and the further education sector. They are also
easily understood by learners and employers. That is not an
insignificant point when one of the aims of the clause is to signal the
Government&#146;s commitment to adult learning to the sector and to
eligible learners.</div>
					<a name="08022862000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 117 would insert
IGCSEs in the description of level 2 qualifications in paragraph 6 of
proposed new schedule 1A. We have used GCSEs as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column755" />Column number: 755</div>generic description and a reference point for level 2 qualifications
because they provide a widely recognised standard of education. That, I
am afraid, does not apply to the IGCSE, which is not so generally
known.</div>
					<a name="08022862000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
descriptor for a level 2 qualification for adults, the IGCSE is wholly
inappropriate. Paragraph 1(c) of new schedule 1A makes it clear that
only vocational qualifications at level 2 will fall under the duties in
the clause. We simply use GCSEs as a benchmark in our description of

level of attainment.</div>
					<a name="08022862000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
118 concerns the description of level 3 and would insert a reference to
a specific qualification, designed by an individual awarding body, into
primary legislation. Again, the addition would not be helpful, because
the pre-U qualification is not widely recognised among learners. Nor
would it be right to single out qualifications of particular
organisations in that way at level 3. For those reasons, I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

						</b> The amendments are, almost by definition, probing
amendments. We hear what the Minister says. We remain convinced that
the qualifications that we have identified need to be considered
carefully, because there is widespread support for them in the higher
education community. There will come a point when the universities will
want to accept them and will come to value them as at least equivalent
to the existing qualifications that provide the entry route
clarification, and their acceptance will become inevitable. However,
this is not the time to vote on the matter, and I therefore beg to ask

						</b> The clause allows for the sharing of information by
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to be included in the
&#147;information gateway&#148;. It would allow information to be
shared with devolved authorities. Put simply, our amendments would
specifically prevent the disclosure of information relating to income
tax and tax
credits.</div>
					<a name="08022862000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
earlier we spoke at some length about the sensitivity that is abroad
about data and information sharing, not least because of some of the
scandalous errors that have taken place over recent months. It would be
unkind and unnecessary to speak at length about the Government&#146;s
embarrassment or to blame 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column756" />Column number: 756</div>the Under-Secretary personally for the profound
incompetence shown by the Government, although of course he accepts
collective responsibility. With those few words, and not wanting to
exaggerate that point, I await the Minister&#146;s no doubt ready
response.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000274"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> Sandy Leitch, as has been said, correctly
identified the need to improve the integration of employment and skills
as an important policy agenda. That would serve the goal with which the
Committee has been occupied over the past few weeks, of moving more
people who are out of work into learning and then into long-term
employment.</div>
					<a name="08022862000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 71
to 75 will provide an all-important means for us to assess, in a
joined-up way, whether we are delivering on that goal. The intention
behind the clauses is simple: to enable data to be made available to
researchers in Government and beyond, and in the devolved
Administrations in Wales and Scotland, so that that assessment can be
made. The data will be used for two forms of analysis: first, to
determine whether low-skilled individuals are moving into sustainable
employment and then progressing in work, rather than falling back on to
benefits; and, secondly, to explore the economic returns on the
qualifications and skills that individuals achieve. Current legislation
puts a duty of confidentiality on Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions in
relation to the data that they handle. Unless the disclosure is lawful
for other reasons, or the information is in the public domain, an
express legal provision is required to enable data to be shared outside
HMRC. That takes the form of information gateways, which the Bill
creates.</div>
					<a name="08022862000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
of us as constituency MPs have come across people who might be in
employment for a month or two, but then fall out of employment simply
because they do not have the skills to progress in and hold on to their
jobs. The clause provides a means by which we can analyse those data to
see whether our qualifications and the routes set out by Sandy Leitch
are working, and whether we are getting the progression we want. We all
share those aims. For that reason, I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels
able to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000275"></a>Mr.

						</b> These are sensitive issues. People&#146;s tax
affairs are private matters, which one would expect to be handled with
appropriate discretion&#151;hence our amendments. We do not have
time, nor would it be appropriate, to debate the tax credits system
now, but we all know from our constituency casework that it is a
nightmare. In the light of what has occurred in recent months, there is
fear in every hearth and home in Britain that the Government are about
to spread personal data far and wide.</div>
					<a name="08022862000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, this is not
the time to press the amendments. Our case has been made; the

ears of Ministers and, one hopes, these matters will be handled with
greater discretion in future. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000309"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> We now come to part 4 of the Bill which presents a
case study in how not to legislate. I think we have just had such a
case study&#151;when Ministers are not focused on what is happening
in the Committee, it makes it very difficult for the Opposition to
express a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column761" />Column number: 761</div>view when it is not clear precisely whether or not the Minister is in
favour of a clause.</div>
					<a name="08022862000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come to
another example of poor legislation: a series of proposals that is
based on an inaccurate understanding of the facts and that has an
accompanying impact assessment that is factually wrong; a consultation
document that contains errors of materiality that go to the root of the
proposals; and a consultation process that involved no genuine
consultation prior to the proposals being formulated with the
organisations directly affected by the measures. We had a consultation
process affecting 1,300 schools that took place between 27 July 2007
and 19 October 2007&#151;the majority of that period was during the
school summer holidays&#151;and the result of the consultation
process was entirely ignored except for one tiny concession about
delaying the transfer until Ofsted was more able to cope with the extra
work.</div>
					<a name="08022862000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will come to
each of these issues, and more, when we address the appropriate
amendment; for now, I will confine my remarks to clause 76. The clause
introduces an additional definition of an independent school to include
part-time education. The proposal goes back to a
Department for Education and Skills&#151;as the Department was
then&#151;consultation in November 2006 on guidance regarding what
constitutes full-time education in independent schools. The reason
given by the Department for needing such a definition was
that:</div>
					<a name="08022862000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;patterns of
schooling are changing, and there is a greater diversity of approach to
education, with some parents opting for home education which includes
part time tuition at tutorial colleges or schools.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consultation document went on to
say:</div>
					<a name="08022862000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Parents
must ensure that their child receives an education suitable to his/her
age, needs and attitudes, either at school or otherwise. In cases where
this is achieved by a mix of part time attendance at school and part
time education at home, this must be agreed with the school, with both
parents and schools having a clear understanding of their roles and
responsibilities. Both should be able to describe and evidence the part
each plays in contributing to a broad and balanced curriculum meeting
the needs of the individual child.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">It therefore appears
that the initial reason for embarking on this consultation and revision
to the definition of an independent school was to ensure that home
educators were able to demonstrate that their children were receiving
an adequate education. However, the consultation document goes on to
say that the proposals</div>
					<a name="08022862000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will ensure that any settings
providing all, or a major part, of children&#146;s education will be
registered, and required to meet the minimum regulatory
standards.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first question for
the Minister is, which of those two reasons is the prime reason for
launching the policy revision?</div>
					<a name="08022862000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The response
to the November 2006 consultation document was overwhelming
opposition&#151;72 per cent. disagreed with the proposal that any
setting that provided more than 20 hours of education a week should be
treated as an independent school and thus subject to registration.
According to the Government&#146;s summary of responses,</div>
					<a name="08022862000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The majority of those
opposed were home educators, who believed that it was the
responsibility of parents to provide and educate their child rather
than the responsibility of the state. They were concerned about what
was meant by a &#145;school&#146; in this context, and wanted
clarification about whether the DfES was planning on changing the legal
definition of a school.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column762" />Column number: 762</div>
					<a name="08022862000215"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div>
					<a name="08022862000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the light of this overwhelming opposition the Government consulted in
August last year on revised proposals which were meant to take on board
the concerns of home educators. The revised consultation
says:</div>
					<a name="08022862000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have
now had time to consider these points and have concluded that the best
approach is to adjust the definition of an independent school so as to
specify that an independent school is the main organiser of a programme
of education for children of compulsory school age, unless provision is
excluded through
regulations.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation document goes on to
say:</div>
					<a name="08022862000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We would
propose that regulations exclude: schools maintained by a local
authority; non-maintained special schools; temporary provision e.g.
summer schools; any institutions providing less than 12.5 hours per
week tuition (primary) and 15 hours (secondary) for individual
children; further education colleges; hospital schools; home tutorial
services organised by a local authority; education supervised or
delivered by
parents&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those proposals,
too, were overwhelmingly opposed by respondents: 79
per cent. disagreed with the main proposal that settings that are the
main organisers of education for children of compulsory school age
should be regulated, subject to the list of exceptions that I have read
out, and 74 per cent. opposed the list of
exceptions.</div>
					<a name="08022862000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
main concern of Education Otherwise, as summarised in the
Government&#146;s summary of responses, was
that</div>
					<a name="08022862000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the proposals would
have an undesirable impact on home educating families, compromising
their educational
freedoms.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home
Education Advisory Service also disagreed with the proposal. The
summary of responses
reports:</div>
					<a name="08022862000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;They
believe that some of the highly individual arrangements that are made
by home educating parents should not be subject to the same
registration procedures as independent schools which have premises,
teaching staff and a specific
curriculum.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
the opposition to the proposals from respondents to the consultation
process, the Government have decided to proceed with the revised
definition, as contained in the clause. They say:</div>
					<a name="08022862000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We will consult further
on draft regulations in the coming months, but are committed to
providing examples in relation to those institutions to be excluded
from the requirement to register, eg: home education, including part
time teaching in the home by tutors, home education through
correspondence courses, and collaborative arrangements where home
educators come together for part of the week to jointly educate groups
of children; sports clubs, and language colleges, which offer
specialist coaching in limited subjects; local authority organised home
tuition; temporary provision; summer
schools.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
responding, will the Minister tell the Committee what is his estimate
of the number of compulsory school age children who are currently home
educated, whether that figure is rising or falling, and why? Clause
76(3)(a) states that regulations
may</div>
					<a name="08022862000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide that a
specified institution or an institution of a specified description is
not an independent educational institution by virtue of subsection
(1)(b)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022862000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
he say whether those regulations will include all the types of
education listed in the Government&#146;s summary of responses to the
consultation process, including home education or groups of parents
collaborating together on the education of their
children?</div>
					<a name="08022862000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its response to the consultation, Education Otherwise said that its
main concern with the proposal to broaden the definition was that many
home education families 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column763" />Column number: 763</div>could end up being affected. The Government&#146;s policy statement on
the clause, circulated by e-mail to members of the Committee on Tuesday
says:</div>
					<a name="08022862000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
not the intention of the proposals to remove parents&#146; right to
educate their children at home. However, we believe that it is
essential that institutions which are the main provider of a
child&#146;s education are subject to the regulation and inspection
which the independent school legislative framework
provides.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022862000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">That statement
of policy is highly ambiguous, given the word
&#147;however&#148;. An explicit and unequivocal assurance by the
Minister on this point would go a long way towards assuring the tens of
thousands of home educators that the underlying purpose of the clause
is not to undermine the growing trend towards home
education.</div>
					<a name="08022862000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister will say that these proposals were never
meant to affect home education, despite the initial consultation
document of November 2006, which made explicit reference to home
educators. I am sure that he will say that this measure is all about
dealing with a small number of independent schools that are part time,
but are none the less the main providers of a child&#146;s education.
My understanding is that the matter relates to four institutions. The
Minister&#146;s answer to my parliamentary question of 16 January
said that there were four unregistered
settings:</div>
					<a name="08022862000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
four unregistered settings are as follows: a small tuition group which
provides a curriculum based on Christian principles for children aged 4
to 11 and operates for five hours a day for up to 20 children; a
support centre for home
educators&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08022862000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
there we are, some home
educators&#151;</div>
					<a name="08022862000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which
provides academic lessons for 18 hours from Monday to Thursday and
optional recreational based activities for three hours on Fridays; an
establishment providing 16 and a half hours of education from Monday to
Friday for three to six-year-olds as part of a home education programme
where parents also provide five hours 15 minutes a week; a centre
educating both pupils placed by local authorities and others. Pupils
attend for a total of 20 hours from Monday to
Friday.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 16 January 2008; Vol.
470, c. 1269-70W.]</div>
					<a name="08022862000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister let the
Committee know the names of these four institutions and his assessment
of the quality of provision in those four institutions? The more open
and transparent the Minister can be, the better for the functioning of
this Committee. In particular, will he confirm whether or not Tyndale
Academy is one of the four
schools?</div>
					<a name="08022862000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022862000310"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b> It is a
pleasure to be able to make a contribution this morning and to have
been able to move on to part 4 at such an early stage in the
Committee&#146;s proceedings.</div>
					<a name="08022862000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton started with a series of
allegations, which I could reject one by one, but for the sake of the
efficiency of the Committee, it is probably better that I do that when
we reach the appropriate amendments rather than in the context of
clause 76, to which the allegations were not really
specific.</div>
					<a name="08022862000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
76 introduces a new definition of independent educational institutions.
The new definition includes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column764" />Column number: 764</div>independent schools which provide full-time education for pupils of
compulsory school age. It also includes part-time institutions which
are the main provider of a child&#146;s education, as defined by the
number of hours of operation per week over a period of weeks in one
year.</div>
					<a name="08022862000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have
the names of all four institutions to hand&#151;in response to his
last set of questions&#151;but I can confirm that Tyndale Academy is
one of the four and, from memory, Kids Company is another. I cannot
remember off the top of my head what the other two are, but it may come
to me in the course of my
response.</div>
					<a name="08022862000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Independent
schools are already required to register and are inspected against the
regulatory framework introduced in September 2003 following the
Education Act 2002. Independent schools,
incidentally, are defined in statute by section 463 of the Education
Act 1996. It is worth noting, in relation to what I will go on to say
regarding home educators, that an independent school has more than five
pupils, unless they have one pupil who has special educational needs or
who is in public care. A home is also not defined as an institution,
which is part of the protection to home educators in the way the clause
is drafted.</div>
					<a name="08022862000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally, the other two of
those four institutions are the Headstart Learning Centre and The
Children&#146;s
Garden.</div>
					<a name="08022862000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The framework
that I have referred to, introduced in September 2003 under the 2002
Act, ensures that all children in these schools have
suitable learning opportunities in a safe and secure learning
environment. The requirement to register part-time institutions, which
are not currently subject to any regulatory or monitoring framework,
will ensure that these same safeguards are put in place for children in
those settings. I am sure the Committee agrees on the importance of
ensuring that every child who is being taught in a school, full time or
part time, should be safe and secure in their learning
environment.</div>
					<a name="08022862000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause applies to institutions that make 12 and a half hours&#146;
provision for primary age children and 15 hours for secondary age
children for 28 weeks a year or more&#151;that equates to more than
half of a typical school week for more than half of a school year.
These institutions are, in our opinion, providing the majority of a
child&#146;s education, so it is right that they should meet minimum
standards. We strongly believe that, where parents delegate the
education of their children to others, the state has a responsibility
to ensure that children have appropriate learning opportunities and
learn in a safe and secure environment. On the inclusion of part-time
institutions, although they are limited in number at this stage,
patterns of education are changing and we want to ensure that we have
the regulation in place before they change
further.</div>
