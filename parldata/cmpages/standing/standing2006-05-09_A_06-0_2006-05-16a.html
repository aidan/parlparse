Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): Amendments Nos.

60 and 61 are probing amendments dealing with the proposed changes to

the time scale to which the increase in the amount of allowance for

small enterprise applies. Clause 30 proposes to increase for one year

the first-year capital allowance for spending by small businesses from

40 per cent. to 50 per cent. The amendments propose to

increase that time to two years.</div>

<a name="06051694000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek the rationale behind the

Government&#146;s decision to propose the increase for only one year.

I should be interested to know the Minister&#146;s opinion on how

capable small businesses are of responding to relatively small and

rapid changes. If the changes proceed as proposed by the clause, that

will represent year-on-year change in the capital allowance for four

years. I have received many representations expressing concern that

that uncertainty will undermine business confidence about how the

allowances can be used. Has the Department assessed how such a small

temporary change will affect small businesses&#146;

behaviour?</div><a name="06051694000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051694000344"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): Does the hon. Lady share

my earlier concern that the Government are dealing with the issue

wrinkle by wrinkle? What the Government really need is a major facelift

in dealing with the issue of R and D tax credits. They should use a big

bang, rather than doing things slowly and one by

one.</div><a name="06051694000017"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000345"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> The issue is whether the Treasury decided

that it wanted creases down the front or not. It seems to keep changing

every year.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 192</div><a name="06051694000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that

the Minister does not particularly approve of the report referred to

earlier, which was undertaken for the Institute of Chartered

Accountants in England and Wales by the Manchester and Nottingham

business schools. The report examined the role of tax incentives in

capital investment and expenditure. Looking specifically at the capital

allowance issue, the report found

that</div><a name="06051694000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if

it is intended that the capital allowances regime should provide

positive incentives to increase or accelerate the level of investment

in capital, this is not being achieved. Capital allowances, with the

exception of some generous investment incentives such as those for

environmentally friendly investment, are too small to influence the

expected payoffs from the

investment.&#148;</div><a name="06051694000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister has already expressed his concerns about the small scale of

the study, and other hon. Members have referred to it as a focus group.

Does the Treasury know whether the businesses claiming such capital

allowances are aware of the fact that the capital allowance has

increased and select it, or do its figures showing take-up of the

scheme actually reflect small businesses that have already made a

business investment decision and then look to see what allowances are

available?</div><a name="06051694000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

doubtful that capital allowances accelerate investment. Any further

uncertainty would undermine

it.</div><a name="06051694000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051694000346"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I welcome you to the Chair for

our proceedings this afternoon,Sir John. Those of us on the

Conservative Benches look forward to serving under your chairmanship. I

am sure that you will ensure that the business of the day proceeds as

smoothly as it did this

morning.</div><a name="06051694000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051694000347"></a><b class="B">Rob

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000348"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman tempts me down a route of

metaphor that I do not wish to exploit further. We had too many ironing

metaphors this morning for me to risk continuing with that train of

thought. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I know that the Economic Secretary to

the Treasury is getting excited because he is on the next chapter of

the Bill, but it might be better for him if he can just control himself

for a moment and hold his firepower for that stage&#151;I should like

to give him that advice from the Opposition side.</div>

<a name="06051694000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to

comment briefly on clause 30 and pick up on the point that the hon.

Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) made about the

fluctuating fortunes of the rate of first-year allowances. It is worth

remembering what has happened since 1998. From 1998 to the fiscal year

2003-04, first-year allowances were 40 per cent., and there was a nice

period of stability, but in 2004-05 they went up to 50 per cent., in

2005-06 they went down to 40 per cent., in 2006-07 they will be at 50

per cent., and in 2007-08 they will go down to 40 per

cent.</div><a name="06051694000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

suggested that the 50 per cent. rate should continue for two years.

However, if small businesses are to expand, invest capital and take on

some of the challenges that have been discussed in the debate, they

need some stability and predictability in the first-year allowance

rate. How can a business plan confidently for the future, taking into

account the incentives offered by the Government, if it is difficult to

predict the level of first-year allowances from year to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 193</div>year? Will the Minister therefore give some indication of the

Government&#146;s thoughts on how long the 50 per cent. rate will

continue and when there will be stability on first-year

allowances?</div><a name="06051694000026"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000349"></a>The

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> I

welcome you to the chair, Sir John, and I look forward to serving under

your chairmanship again. The clause increases the rate of first-year

capital allowances for small businesses from 40 to 50 per cent., for

one year from April 2006. It is designed to assist the cash flow of

small businesses and to provide enhanced funding for new

investment.</div><a name="06051694000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne addressed the amendments that she

has tabled as probing amendments and she cited again the Manchester

business school survey that was commissioned by the institute. However,

although the study sample was larger than the one that we discussed

this morning, it was still based on interviews with only 20

respondents, which is not a terribly strong basis on which to determine

important policy. Its findings do not contradict the fact that

first-year allowances provide a valuable cash-flow boost to small

businesses.</div><a name="06051694000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

purpose of the hon. Lady&#146;s amendments is to extend to the 2007

financial year the increase in the allowances that the Government are

introducing inthe Bill. I remind the Committee that it was in

the pre-Budget report that we announced the package of changes of which

the proposal in the Bill is a part, and there was a considerable

discussion on other elements of the package in a Committee of the whole

House. The package includes the one-year increase in first-year

allowances for small businesses&#151;an element that was introduced

in response to submissions from a number of bodies that represent the

interests of small firms. It was warmly welcomed at the

time.</div><a name="06051694000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) asked for an

explanation of the thinking behind the decision. Although we recognise

the value of certainty and stability in the tax system, we have to

ensure that the system is responsive to increasingly flexible and

global business pressures. That was manifest in the package of

announcements of which this proposal is a part and which was set out in

the pre-Budget report. The Government are committed to supporting small

firms, and we shall keep the options that may be appropriate for the

future under close review. In doing so, we shall try to ensure that

small business support is provided in the most effective way, but in a

manner that is consistent with a set of principles that could be

summarised as simplicity for businesses that comply with their tax and

legal obligations, support for small businesses that have aspirations

to grow and determination to maintain the attractiveness of the United

Kingdom as a business location. The amendments would tie our hands

rather than enable us to continue to work with business interests on

these factors.</div>

<a name="06051694000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise

that the changes in clause 30 were not only requested by business

organisations; they were also welcomed when we announced them. On 5

December, the Federation of Small Businesses

said:</div><a name="06051694000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

welcome the small business measures and the simplification they will

offer, especially the corresponding increase in the level of capital

allowances that can be claimed by small businesses.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 194</div><a name="06051694000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the same day, the Institute of

Directors

said:</div><a name="06051694000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

replacement of the zero rate corporation tax by increased capital

allowances for small businesses was

welcome.&#148;</div><a name="06051694000032"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000350"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> The Minister spoke of turning capital allowances on

and off as part of a package. We need to remember that the abolition of

the zero rate corporation tax is not just for this year, yet one of the

measures that he offers in compensation is for one year

only.</div>

<a name="06051694000033"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000351"></a>John

Healey:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. The matter was

debated in Committee of the whole House. I quoted the responses of

business representative organisations, such as the Institute of

Directors, to the package that was announced, including the moves on

zero rates. The Institute of Directors supported that move, or gave the

response that it did on 5 December, because it will reduce the

differences in taxation for small businesses, depending on how they are

organised. He will remember that that was the principal rationale for

the moves that we have made on the zero rate.</div>

<a name="06051694000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the response and the

welcome from those organisations is significant not only in policy

terms, but because it may help to deal with the concern of the hon.

Member for Falmouth and Camborne about how small firms will become

aware of the changes. In addition to the sources of

Government-sponsored advice and information, we would expect their tax

agents and advisers to play a large part in ensuring that they are

aware of changes that may benefit them.</div>

<a name="06051694000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, organisations such as

the Institute of Directors with its large membership and the Federation

of Small Businesses with its federated network also have an important

role to play in helping to ensure that their members and small

businesses in general are fully aware of the tax support and benefits.

On that basis, I hope that the hon. Lady will feel comfortable about

withdrawing the

amendment.</div><a name="06051694000036"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000352"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I must apologise, Sir John, for not yet

welcoming you to the Committee. That was perhaps due to my eagerness to

debate the

amendments.</div><a name="06051694000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened

carefully to the Financial Secretary&#146;s response. I am keen to

press upon him that the issue is not simply awareness of the

allowances, but whether there is an incentive to take up the first-year

allowances or whether it is something that small businesses come to

after they have made the decision to invest. The support for the

proposals, which have been welcomed by many parts of the industry, has

not been entirely unqualified. Although it refers to the changes as

beneficial changes, the Chartered Institute of Taxation said

that</div><a name="06051694000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this constant

change and uncertainty undermines the effectiveness of any particular

beneficial change and generally increases the complexity of the system

unnecessarily&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051694000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis that the Financial

Secretary has spoken of his commitment to small businesses and has left

the door open to greater stability and consistency in future, I beg to

<a name="06051694000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before turning to the substance

of amendmentNo. 30, I should like to start with some general

remarks about part 3 and the Government&#146;s new film tax-break

regime and its history. Strictly speaking, the latter might be more

suited to the debate on clauses 46 and 47, but as it is important that

we learn from our mistakes, it would be useful to take this matter at

this stage in order to set the scene and background for the new

framework proposed and the Opposition&#146;s amendments to it. I am

conscious of the need to make progress, so as I have indicated

informally, I should be happy for the debate on the amendment to cover

the clause stand part debate without the need for any separate

discussion of the clause.</div>

<a name="06051694000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I start by declaring that my

sister-in-law is a film producer. I do not think that it counts as a

declarable interest, but I thought I would mention it just in case.

Like the Government, the Opposition believe that it is important to

work to ensure that the UK provides a competitive and attractive

environment for the film industry for commercial and cultural reasons.

However, although we understand the Government&#146;s motivation in

their film tax-break regime and we, too, want a successful and

sustainable film industry in the UK, we have serious concerns about

their effectiveness in that area to date.</div>

<a name="06051694000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chancellor&#146;s film

tax regime has a chequered history. The costs of film tax relief

spiralled from&#163;10 million when it was initially

introduced in 1997-98 to &#163;520 million in 2004-05 and to a

staggering&#163;560 million in 2005-06. They are huge sums

when one takes into account the fact that the UK&#146;s entire cinema

sales were only &#163;770 million last year. It seems clear that many

used the tax breaks in a way that the Treasury did not intend, and that

a significant proportion of the revenue lost to the Exchequer did not

directly benefit film producers and production.</div>

<a name="06051694000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the funding

arrangements developed under the section 42 and section 48 reliefs that

we are proposing to abolish had much more to do with reducing the tax

bill of a limited number of high net worth individuals than any desire

to make films. The outgoing regime depended on investors to provide

funds through complicated sale and leaseback arrangements, which gave

rise to a veritable industry of tax avoidance schemes. As Revenue and

Customs set out in its recent consultation paper, that led to

considerable problems. It

said:</div><a name="06051694000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst

the current film tax relief has ensured the production of many valuable

British films, the financing structures that have been used to access

them have affected their value for money for 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 196</div>the taxpaying public, calling into question their fairness and

effectiveness. The repeated use of tax avoidance schemes around the

current film tax relief has also involved significant Exchequer cost

and there remains a clear Exchequer risk in the current reliefs. This

has resulted in fluctuating and, at times, untenable levels of

Exchequer costs over the years the reliefs have been in

operation.&#148;</div> <a name="06051694000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the

aggressive structures allowed investors to make high rates of return

that were almost risk-free, and some schemes apparently allowed

investors to claim more in tax relief than they invested. Loopholes

included so-called double dipping, which enabled film producers to

claim tax relief twice on the same production&#151;on production

costs and the sale and leaseback of the final film.</div>

<a name="06051694000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">In September 2003, the Culture,

Media and Sport Committee stated:</div>

<a name="06051694000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The historical cycle of

change in the tax regime was presented to us by the majority of

witnesses as a huge disadvantage to the

industry.&#148;</div><a name="06051694000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although

acknowledging the problems flowing from aggressive avoidance schemes,

the Chartered Institute of Taxation said recently:</div>

<a name="06051694000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We think there has been

too much tinkering with the tax system. As with other relieving

provisions, the government introduces a relief and then expresses

surprise when taxpayers obtain the benefit of it.</div>

<a name="06051694000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">Then the relief was withdrawn

or redrafted.</div> <a name="06051694000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">More

careful thought and consultation would have resulted in better

legislation.&#148;</div><a name="06051694000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the

Chancellor first introduced his tax break, the rules have been amended

in the Finance Acts in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005 and now again in 2006.

The continual change has caused uncertainty, damagingthe

competitive position of the UK as a destination for the film

industry.</div> <a name="06051694000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

announcement of a further review last year unsettled the industry yet

again. Harry Hicks, a film tax consultant with Grant Thornton,

commented:</div><a name="06051694000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

quicker we see the new legislation in full, together with HMRC&#146;s

proposed interpretation of its practical application, the better. In

the meantime, I fear that many projects will be prevented from going

ahead whilst financiers and bankers simply sit on the fence and wait

and see how the new tax breaks will operate in

practice&#148;.</div><a name="06051694000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">His firm

predicted a downturn in the film business in 2006. It would be useful

if the Minister gave us an insight into recent levels of investment in

the film industry. Pinewood&#146;s profits fell from &#163;6.5

million to &#163;571,000, which it attributed in part to the

uncertainty caused by the pending new

regime.</div><a name="06051694000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Problems

were also reported with several other films: &#147;Lassie&#148; was

due to be filmed at the book&#146;s original British locations but

was moved to Ireland, &#147;The Libertine&#148;, starring Johnny

Depp, moved to the Isle of Man, and, most controversially, James

Bond&#146;s 21st film outing in the remake of &#147;Casino

Royale&#148; will be the first of that long-running series to be shot

predominantly overseas. Pinewood, Bond&#146;s traditional home since

&#147;Dr. No&#148;, lost out to Barrandov studios in the Czech

Republic. Tim Adler of Screen Finance commented:</div>

<a name="06051694000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For the Government to

allow its most high profile civil servant to go abroad is

extraordinary&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051694000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainty is of key importance,

and it will be the theme of a number of the amendments that I table. If

there is significant uncertainty about how our rules 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 197</div>operate and will operate in future, that will deter the large US studios

from investing in the UK and making films here. Uncertainty probably

has an even bigger impact on indigenous, independent film producers,

because it impacts so significantly on their ability to raise finance

for their film projects. They are unlikelyto have the ready

cash available, so they must borrow to finance their projects. If this

regime is to be successful, we must ensure that film producers can

borrow against the tax credit. If the rules are uncertain, the risks

will be higher and the banks will be reluctant to lend; where they do

lend, it will be at significantly higher rates. Currently, few if any

banks are willing to lend pending resolution of the new

structure.</div><a name="06051694000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we

regret that it has proved necessary to introduce yet another revision

of the rules, we agree with the Government that changes are necessary

to deal with the problems I have outlined and the significant loopholes

in the existing framework. There is no doubt that the proposed new

framework is an improvement on the current rules and that it has

received some positive comment from many of those who are affected by

it. In particular, the Opposition agree that it makes sense to amend

the framework to try to ensure that the benefits can be claimed only by

the companies who are making the films.</div>

<a name="06051694000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We still have several

reservations about the proposals. I have tabled a series of amendments

that seek to elicit clarity from the Government about a number of

points that have been raised with me by the film industry and by those

who are affected by the new framework. As I said, the amendments were

tabled in a constructive spirit to try to ensure that we end up with a

framework that achieves the goals that the Government have

set.</div><a name="06051694000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to clause

31 and amendment No. 30, the clause defines the meaning of the word

&#147;film&#148; forthe purposes of the tax regime.

Anyone who produces a film as defined by the clause will automatically

fall within the new framework, although they will qualify for the tax

break&#151;the enhanced deduction or tax credit&#151;only if they

also comply with the conditions set out in clauses 32 to

41.</div><a name="06051694000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want the

Committee to consider clause 31(2), on films produced as a series.

Amendment No. 30, which I moved, seeks to delete paragraphs (a) and (b)

from the clause and deal with the fact that the Bill currently provides

that unless a series complies with all of the criteria set out in

subsection (2) each film will be treated as a separate film for the

purposes of taxation. Paragraphs (a) to (c) require that the series has

no more than 26 episodes, that the total length is no more than 26

hours and that

it</div><a name="06051694000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;constitutes a

self-contained work or is a series of documentaries with a common

theme&#148;.</div><a name="06051694000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

cumulative conditions of subsection (2), particularly paragraphs (a)

and (b), could cause considerable practical problems if the legislation

goes ahead as it is. For example, a TV series that has a significant

number of short episodes would fall outside the cumulative conditions

of those paragraphs. There seems no sensible reason to treat such a

series as separate films for the purposes of taxation, nor is there any

obvious reason why a series of more than 26 hours should not be treated

as a single unit for film tax purposes.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 198</div><a name="06051694000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the

Chartered Institute of Taxation pointed out in its briefing on the

Bill, the cumulative conditions would give rise to a considerably

increased compliance burden because of the requirement to treat each

episode of a series as a separate trade. Schedule 4 treats each film as

a separate schedule D case 1 trade. For example, TV companies producing

long-running soaps will be required to keep separate tax records,

monitor costs and estimate the total future income for each individual

programme. They will have to track the loss position for each separate

episode, and that will involve considerable extra

cost.</div><a name="06051694000061"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000354"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> Does the hon. Lady think that the British taxpayer

should subsidise through tax breaks the production of soap

operas?</div><a name="06051694000062"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000355"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> No. I was just coming to that. TV companies

cannot qualify for the tax break as their programmes are not intended

for theatrical release, but, because of the way the legislation is

structured, they come within the taxation framework that is being

introduced. They are concerned about getting an additional compliance

burden without any chance of getting a tax credit. That is why I am

discussing the clause with particular reference to TV companies. I am

not suggesting that we should extend the tax credit to cover

them&#151;that would be inappropriate&#151;but we must mitigate the

compliance burden that clause 31 would

impose.</div><a name="06051694000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have also

tabled an amendment that we shall discuss later which would take TV

companies that do not qualify for the tax break out of the overall

taxation framework in the Bill. That would also deal with the

problem.</div><a name="06051694000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

the Economic Secretary will explain why he thinks it inappropriate to

consider a series of short episodes to be a single film and a single

trade for the purposes of taxation.</div>

<a name="06051694000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude, clause 31(2)(c)

deals with the connection that there needs to be between films in a

series. Perhaps the Minister would like to expand on that. It seems

that it could involve subjective judgments as to whether a series of

films is sufficiently connected to qualify under paragraph (c). One

example that springs to mind is the series of Harry Potter films. Would

they be considered sufficiently connected to come within the paragraph?

If we leave uncertainty and subjective judgments in the framework, they

could lead to disputes about the level of the tax credit, which of

course will drive up the cost of borrowing against it. That was one of

the general points in my introduction. I look forward to the comments

of members of the Committee and the

Minister.</div><a name="06051694000297"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000356"></a>The

Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b>

May I start by echoing the words of the hon. Member

for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) and say that it is a great pleasure

and privilege to serve for the first time on the Front Bench in a

Committee under your chairmanship, Sir John? I thank you for your

indulgence in allowing us to debate the amendments and discuss clauses

31 and 32 at the same time. In discussing those two clauses, I shall

deal with several issues that were referred to by the hon. Lady and

that are pertinent to the Bill.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 199</div><a name="06051694000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank Opposition Members for

their kind, warm words of welcome last week to those on the Front Bench

and particularly the hon. Member for Fareham for his comments a moment

ago. I served for 20 hours last year during the proceedings on the

Committee dealing with the Finance (No. 2) Act 2005 and, until today, I

would not have recognised the concept of becoming over-excited in

Committee. After the fine speeches of the hon. Member for Fareham and

my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), I

would not say that I was over-excited, but there have certainly been

moments of interest.</div><a name="06051694000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

shall start by following the lead of the hon. Member for Chipping

Barnet in making some introductory remarks about chapter 3 in general

and clause 31 in particular. I will then turn to the points that she

made about the amendment. I have some comments to add to hers about the

context of the new tax credit for British films. She made many points

about that context with which my hon. Friends and I could agree. At

times, it was almost as if she had seen some of my speaking notes, so I

shall make sure that I do not repeat any of her words.</div>

<a name="06051694000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The importance of British

cinema to our cultural heritage was obvious from the hon. Lady&#146;s

comments in welcoming the importance of the clauses. It plays an

important role in Britain and around the world in building a sense of

national identity and propagating it beyond our borders. Our aim in the

clause is to continue to provide and enhance the support necessary to

encourage a sustainable British film industry in what is an

increasingly competitive environment. That can be done in a range of

ways. For example, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport supports

the film industry in a number of ways directly through grant support.

However, the tax system also plays an important role. The UK is not

alone in this: many countries around the world do the same. All large

countries use their tax system to some extent to provide incentives to

support film production.</div>

<a name="06051694000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Lady said, the

previous tax reliefs for British films have been in place since the

beginning of 1992 and, in 1997, they were enhanced and tailored to meet

the needs of small films. In that time, as she explained, expenditure

on British film production has risen from around &#163;98 million in

1992, when the reliefs were first introduced, to &#163;569 million in

2005. Over that period, attendance at cinemas in the UK

hasrisen from 98 million at the beginning of the 1990s to

264.7 million last year. It has clearly been the case that as the

strength of the British film industry has grown&#151;along with its

use of tax relief&#151;cinema audiences have grown as well.</div>

<a name="06051694000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady mentioned

&#147;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&#148;, and many other

British films have been produced in recent years. In the last year and

a half, &#147;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#148;,

&#147;Nanny McPhee&#148;, &#147;Pride and Prejudice&#148; and

&#147;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&#148; were released. I have

seen some of these films, but I must admit I have never seen other

British films such as &#147;Layer Cake&#148;, &#147;Kinky

Boots&#148; or &#147;Ladies in Lavender&#148;. I am told,

however, that the production of these films was based in

Britain.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 200</div><a name="06051694000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to the hon.

Lady&#146;s point about the danger of the number of UK films dropping

off, I point out that, in 2004, the number of British productions was

133. In 2005, during which the debate about these reforms was ongoing,

the number fell, but only marginally&#151;from 133 to 124. Numbers

for this year will show the continuing engagement of the British film

industry in the production of films.</div>

<a name="06051694000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,

as the hon. Lady said, there is another side to this story. Throughout

the lifetime of the old reliefs that the Bill will deal with, there

have been examples of abuse and of people using those reliefs not as an

aid to film production but as a convenient way of avoiding tax. That is

why anti-avoidance legislation aimed at protecting the Exchequer from

abuses of film tax reliefs has been enacted regularly. Such reliefs

have featured in a number of Finance

Bills.</div><a name="06051694000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

referred earlier to the consultation document produced last summer,

which contains a full explanation of how the previous reliefs, which

were inherited in 1997 and continued since then, have been subject to

abuse, particularly from sale and leaseback schemes and, more

generally, because people who are not really film makers or producers

used such reliefs for tax purposes. There is a very long list on page

13 of the consultation document of all the different times in Finance

Bills from 2000 onwards that action has had to be taken to try to

tackle that abuse and those problems.

</div><a name="06051694000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We announced in last

year&#146;s Budget that there would be a formal consultation on a new

approach to reliefs for the film industry to remedy the defects of the

predecessor regime. As that consultation document exemplifies, there

has been an intensive, constructive consultation over last summer,

leading up to the details of the new relief being announced in the

pre-Budget report in 2005 and a complete change in the conceptual basis

on which film taxation support will be

provided.</div><a name="06051694000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change

will mean that the targeting of the relief will now shift directly to

the film production companies, rather than indirectly through the

financiers, investors or other intermediaries. That means that not only

will film makers no longer have to share the benefit of the reliefs

with others, but it will also bring an end to the tax-driven sale and

leaseback structures used extensively by film financiers to access

relief, which has been the source of so much tax avoidance in the

past.</div><a name="06051694000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further

significant way in which the new relief differs from its predecessors

is that, for the first time, its value to film makers is directly

related to the amount of work actually done in the UK. Previously,

eligibility for tax relief was determined by the certification of the

film as British under schedule 1 of the Films Act 1985, and the way in

which the certification rules worked meant that it was possible to

claim the relief on the total production budget, even where little, if

any, filming took place within the UK. Instead, the new relief provides

a direct incentive to make full use of film making skills, facilities

and infrastructure in the

UK.</div><a name="06051694000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another important

feature, which we will debate later when we get to the loss provisions

and the details of schedules 4 and 5, is the way in which this relief

is now designed to encourage genuine sustainability in the British film

industry. The value of the reliefs will be greatest where film is

profitable and where its income is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 201</div>retained within the UK, rather than sent offshore, and there are also

incentives for film makers to reinvest profits from films in the UK,

particularly in the production of further British

films.</div><a name="06051694000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Together,

the various elements of the new relief constitute a package designed to

give genuine reassurance of the Government&#146;s continuing support

to the film industry. We have already announced the rates at which the

relief is set, which will mean that small budget films will be able to

claim a guaranteed minimum benefit worth 20 per cent. of

qualifying production costs, while large budget films will be able to

claim a benefit typically worth 16 per cent. of qualifying production

costs. By targeting the new relief at film producers, the provision

will be much better focused and more effective in fulfilling the

Government&#146;s objectives for the film industry. As John Woodward,

chief executive officer of the UK Film Council, has said, the new

relief marks a new era for the future growth of our industry, which

operates in a highly competitive global

marketplace.</div><a name="06051694000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">We take

seriously the comments of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet about the

importance of moving forward expeditiously to ensure that we have no

unnecessary uncertainty. It is important that we move expeditiously

through the debate on the clauses and amendments, because there is a

danger that, if we take too long over the details, we will add to the

uncertaintyÂ rather than resolve it. Margaret Matheson, a

producer, from Bard Entertainments, has

said:</div><a name="06051694000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Yes,

there will inevitably be delays involved in the changeover. That is

unfortunate, but this time next year we will have forgotten about

it.&#148;</div><a name="06051694000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not so sanguine

as to believe that people will have forgotten, but once the film

industry sees the scale and benefits available under this new support,

we will be able, as John Woodward said, to move into a new era with

substantial benefits to the British film industry for making films in

Britain, with British employees and British

ideas.</div><a name="06051694000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 30 would relax the test under which a series of films is treated as

a single film by removing the requirement that it must not have more

than26 separate parts or a playing time of more

than26 hours. A series that has fewer than 26 parts can be

considered to be one film, whereas a long-running series such as

&#147;EastEnders&#148; or &#147;Friends&#148;, if produced in

Britain, would have to be accounted for under tax purposes on a

case-by-case and episode-by-episode basis. The 26-part, 26-hours test

is a purely administration decision. It does not make any difference to

the favourability of the tax treatment; it is only to do with the way

in which the tax is accounted

for.</div><a name="06051694000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">A 10-hour episode

TV drama would be treated as a single film, but a long-running series

such as &#147;Friends&#148; or &#147;Blue Peter&#148;, if they

were being made as a TV series, would not be treated as single films.

They would instead be treated for the purposes of the tax regime as

separate trades. That is not new; it simply reproduces a requirement

under the Films Act 1985 that has been in force since 1999 and is based

on our consultation with not only the film industry, but the TV

industry.</div><a name="06051694000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

our view, the requirement will not involve any significant concerns. It

is quite in line with practice in the industry. A series such as

&#147;Parkinson&#148;, the &#147;Jonathan Dimbleby

Programme&#148; or &#147;Davina&#148; does not begin with the

assumption that it will be made in perpetuity. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 202</div>People will want to be sure that they are making a return case by case,

that the audience figures match it, and that the costs are being

covered episode by episode. On the basis of the consultations, our

understanding is that that is in line with how the industry chooses to

organise itself and therefore should not cause a problem. On that

basis, we urge the Committee to reject the

amendment.</div><a name="06051694000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Lady referred to the broader issue of whether we are right to try to

have a single regime for the treatment of films, and TV and DVD

production, whether or not they qualify for the enhanced tax relief

that comes from their being made in Britain as a British film for

cinema showing. For the benefit of members of the Committee, I must say

that a key requirement is that at least 25 per cent. of the film has to

be made in Britain, an important matter that we shall be discussing

later.</div><a name="06051694000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The existing

treatment of film production is based on the principle that film makers

exploit the films to generate income from their use rather than by

selling them. It is also tied to the completion of the film at which

point a trade of exploitation can start. At that point, the cost of

creating a film is deemed to be a normal trading expense. However, on

the evidence of our consultations so far, that fits pretty badly with

the way in which the industry works, how it accounts for itself and how

the accounting model was put to us during those

consultations.</div><a name="06051694000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

industry regularly makes films for immediate sale or in a way that

pre-sells almost all the exploitation rights to generate income to fund

the film. Rather than the tax treatment occurring at the end of the

process when the film is completed, it makes more sense to calculate

taxable income on a cost basis through the lifetime of the production

of the film. That is why we are structuring the tax reliefs under

schedules 4 and 5 to follow the principles that are used to account for

income and expenditure on long-term contracts. Although the treatment

is essential for the new film tax relief, it also provides a firm

foundation for other film production companies, such as those making

films for TV or for transfer to DVD. Nothing that we have been told by

the industry suggests that the working of those industries will find

difficulty with

that.</div><a name="06051694000298"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Helen

Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): Before my hon. Friend sits down, I

Balls:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that

intervention. We consulted widely with the film and TV industry. I am

sure that many people whom we consulted have had their avant garde

moments, but I am not sure whether we consulted any specialist avant

garde producers. My feeling is that if one is making an avant garde

film of more than 26 hours, it would still 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 203</div>be one episode&#151;one film&#151;and would therefore count as one

film for tax purposes. There may be examples of avant garde film

companies that have attempted to make films of more than 26 hours in

length running to a series of more than 26 episodes, but it strikes me

that the idea of 26 or more episodes of a 26-hour-plus film would not

necessarily be a profitable enterprise. I do not think that that

particular example was put to us during the

on the holistic nature of the Government&#146;s proposals, and the

fact that they are trying to bring television and film production under

the same regime, I am a little confused by what the Economic Secretary

is saying; it seems to fly in the face of the proposals in clause 39,

under which, in order to be eligible for film tax relief, productions

have to be intended for theatrical release. Several examples that he

cited were clearly made for television, rather than theatrical,

release.</div><a name="06051694000093"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000359"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We are

putting in place a way of accounting for films, television and DVD

productions for tax purposes, under which enhanced relief is available

only for films intended for showing in a cinema. The point that I was

just concluding, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop

Auckland (Helen Goodman), is that when one commences the production

process, it is not always clear whether the film will be for cinematic

or TV purposes. It would not make sense to do as someone proposed and

have one method of accounting for tax for films that will qualify for

enhanced relief, and a completely separate and different basis for TV

and DVD films that will not qualify for enhanced relief.

</div><a name="06051694000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not think that

the proposal will be a problem for the industry; in fact, in the main,

it is in line with industry accounts, and in line with the direction in

which international accounting standards are moving, in terms of their

reform. It is much more sensible to move to the single system proposed

in the Bill for tax accounting purposes for all films, including TV and

DVD films. Included in those are films intended for cinematic showing,

which will also qualify, beyond the normal setting of cost against

income for tax purposes, for the enhanced relief that is set out in the

schedules to

come.</div><a name="06051694000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some

have suggested that we run two completely parallel systems&#151;a new

one for cinema films, and the old one for TV films. Our view is that

that is out of line with best international practice and current TV

practice, and would be complex, burdensome and over-regulatory. It is

much better to move over to a single system for all TV, film and DVD

production, within which the enhanced relief is available only for

British films produced in Britain that are for cinematic release.

Having said all that and having made a reasoned case, I urge the

Committee to reject the amendment in the name of Opposition Members,

and to support clause 31, allowing us to commence debate on the rest of

the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000360"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I was slightly unnerved by the spooky similarity

between the first part of the Economic Secretary&#146;s speech and

mine. That outbreak of consensus is welcome, although I suspect that he

and I will not always find ourselves of such like mind.</div>

<a name="06051694000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Economic Secretary also

emphasised the importance of not delaying this afternoon&#146;s

debate so that we did not add unnecessary uncertainty to Bill business.

I suspect that the film industry will not mind whether we take an hour

or two hours to deal with the issue, particularly as most of its

members are yacht-hopping at Cannes this week. I do not think that they

are looking at what we are up to with great closeness.

<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> My sister-in-law is not there; her film was not

selected. It is important that we take time to get this issue right. We

do not want to rewrite the film tax regime for the seventh

time&#151;or whatever time it would be&#151;next year.</div>

<a name="06051694000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a sense, it is a little

difficult to respond to a number of the Economic Secretary&#146;s

points, because they tend to bleed into the debates that we will have

on the coming amendments. I shall confine myself to picking up on one

or two things that he said. He emphasised that the issues relating to

the amendment of paragraphs (a) and (b) were administrative and did not

affect the amount of tax payable. My response is to ask why we are

imposing that complicated and difficult framework if it is not going to

yield revenue benefits for the Government. It seems to me that we are

imposing a burden unnecessarily.</div>

<a name="06051694000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">For reasons that I shall go

into when we explore the next set of amendments, it is impractical and

not sensible to have separate regimes for TV and film companies. It is

entirely possible to retain a framework for TV companies that runs

along ordinary company law accounting lines, and I have tabled

amendments to that effect to which I shall speak in a moment.</div>

<a name="06051694000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remain concerned about the

issue of treating each particular episode as a separate trade and have

tabled amendments on schedule 4 in respect of that. I shall not press

my amendment to a Division and I beg to ask leave to withdraw it, but I

retain concerns about the issue and hope that the Government will take

them on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000363"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I do not propose to press amendment No. 46.

Having reflected on it, I do not believe that it would be a positive

change to the

Bill.</div><a name="06051694000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause

32 is one of the most important and controversial parts of the new film

tax structure. It defines the meaning of &#147;film production

company&#148; for the purposes of the Bill. The clause represents one

of the most significant changes to the old rules, focusing the tax

advantages solely on film production companies to ensure that what the

Chancellor called grey middlemen cannot get the tax advantage. As we

have heard, the clause focuses the scheme on the people making the

films, not on the groups of high net worth investors.</div>

<a name="06051694000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new framework proposes that

only companies falling within the definitions set out in clause 32 can

be capable of qualifying for the new film tax breaks. A number of film

industry sources have expressed anxieties about the definitions; many

are worried that legitimate productions will miss out because of how

clause 32 is drafted. In its helpful briefing, the British Screen

Council stated that</div> <a name="06051694000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

provisions of clause 32 are very proscriptive and make it extremely

difficult for genuine film production companies to

qualify&#148;.</div><a name="06051694000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It felt that a

simpler and clearer definition should be

considered.</div><a name="06051694000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

amendment No. 33, I proposed to allow the Treasury to refine and update

the definition through regulations. The use of secondary legislation in

the tax context is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 206</div>always problematic, and I am also conscious that it would give rise to a

degree of further unpredictability and instability. However, it could

be useful for the Committee to consider the idea, given the

definition&#146;s drawbacks, which I shall

outline.</div><a name="06051694000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I turn

to the issue that we have already started to address: that of TV

companies. As we have heard, any company falling within the scope of

the Bill&#146;s definition of a film production company is covered

even when it cannot qualify for the tax break. Hence, a number of

companies will not be able to benefit from the advantages of the film

tax regime, but will be subject to the disadvantages. As we have heard,

that will concern a lot of TV companies, although not only TV companies

could be involved.</div>

<a name="06051694000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those making training videos or

safety or promotional films, or airlines that produce films with

guidance on safety measures could also be affected. My amendment No. 47

would remove companies from the scope of the legislation unless they

were making a film that would qualify for the tax relief set out in

clause 38&#151;that is, the enhanced deduction or film tax

credit.</div> <a name="06051694000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would

leave TV producers governed by the ordinary rules on company taxation

and the existing rules set out in the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992. I have

tabled consequential amendments on clauses 46 and 47 to make that

possible. They would deal with the problem that we have discussed

because TV companies would no longer be at risk of having to draw up

separate accounts for every episode of a single series.</div>

<a name="06051694000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is another

pressing reason to take such companies out of the framework. In general

terms, the framework set up by the Bill requires that a relevant

proportion of income from the making or exploiting of films is brought

into account for tax purposes on an estimated basis, before it is

earned. That includes income from merchandising and the use of

characters and music, as well as directly attributable

income.</div> <a name="06051694000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect is

that tax liability will be accelerated and tax will be due on income

that has not yet been earned. I do not wish to anticipate our debate on

schedule 4, but although applying the provisions to film companies that

can qualify for the tax break is controversial, it seems even more

harsh to apply what I think is a problematic regime to companies not

eligible for the tax break at all. That would mean subjecting such

companies for no reason to a regime harsher than that applicable to

companies in other industries.</div>

<a name="06051694000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be useful if the

Economic Secretary explained the motivation behind that new regime in

schedule 4. If it is to do with a tax break and seeks to deal with some

kind of tax loophole, there is no justification for applying it to

companies that are not capable of qualifying for the tax break in the

first

place.</div><a name="06051694000125"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000364"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> Just to be clear, is the hon. Lady saying that,

for example, each episode of &#147;Coronation Street&#148;, which

would not meet the 26-parts rule that we discussed, would have to be

treated as a separate film? Is that how she understands the

legislation?</div><a name="06051694000126"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000365"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Yes, my understanding is that that is how it

works. I urge the Committee and the Economic Secretary to consider the

problems in respect of TV companies.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 207</div><a name="06051694000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee should consider a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000366"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Another key problem with the definition of film

production company in clause 32 is that subsection (3) requires a

company to be involved in and responsible for multiple activities

before it can qualify as a film production company and potentially

obtain the tax break.</div>

<a name="06051694000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph (a) seems to require

that a film production company should be responsible for all activities

that are listed. They include,</div>

<a name="06051694000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;pre-production,

principal photography and post production...and...delivery of

the completed film&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051694000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph (b) requires the film

production company also to be involved in the planning and decision

making in relation to those activities, and paragraph (c) introduces a

further requirement that the company</div>

<a name="06051694000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;directly negotiates, contracts

and pays for&#148;</div> <a name="06051694000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">those

rights, goods and services.</div>

<a name="06051694000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">An initial problem arises

because there is no statutory definition of terms such as

&#147;pre-production&#148;, &#147;principal photography&#148;

and post production. It could be cured by regulation if amendment No.

33 were agreed to. Alternatively, the early publication of guidance

notes would I am sure be welcome. However, even if that problem were

dealt with, the definition would still be at odds with the way in which

the industry works. It seems unrealistic to expect a single company to

be directly responsible for all the listed activities in subsection

(3).</div> <a name="06051694000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee

knows that all industries break down their activities into specialist

areas, and the division and specialisation in the film business is more

marked than in any. Some of the specialist production companies in

Britain are world leaders in their field, and if a single company must

undertake all those activities to qualify as a film production company,

many in the industry are concerned that it would mean depriving many

genuine film production companies of the support of a tax break. For

example, when a company films overseas, it is standard practice to hire

a local production company to organise much of the work and carry out

many tasks in relation to the film. In some countries, there may even

be a legal obligation to hire a local firm for such

activities.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000368"></a>Mrs.

and do not require direct involvement when they construe

&#147;responsible&#148;, it will be a positive move and it will

make the framework much more workable. There is a particular problem in

paragraph (c) where it refers to &#147;directly&#148;. It

says,</div><a name="06051694000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;directly

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000369"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> But is there not the concept

<a name="06051694000141"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000370"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Both interventions indicate that it would be

useful to obtain more clarity about that point. If one were to take a

flexible interpretation, as the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,

South-West proposed, it would mitigate the problems. However, if one

were to take a more conservative interpretation&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.

Members</span>: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;]&#151;I am not sure

that that is the right word. Perhaps I should say a more restrictive

interpretation.</div> <a name="06051694000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

hope that the Minister will make it clear that a film production

company is permitted to subcontract parts of the film-making process.

That is the point. Without the ability to subcontract the listed

activities, many companies will fail to qualify for the relief that I

am sure the Government intend they should benefit from. If the terms of

the clause do not include the flexibility to subcontract, the tax

relief will either be very narrow or lead to a wholesale restructuring

of the film industry. I do not think that the Government intend either

of those

results.</div><a name="06051694000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051694000371"></a><b class="B">Jeremy

Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Does my hon. Friend

agree that if one looks ahead toclause 41, which I appreciate

we will come to later, it is clear that the Government anticipate that

a great deal of work will be done by qualifying film production

companies abroad? The provisions require that 25 per cent. of spending

be done within the country&#146;s UK spending. It is clear that the

Government accept that a great deal of work on some productions must or

could be done outside the UK, so it makes sense to accept in clause 32

that a good deal of work must be done by other companies

also.</div><a name="06051694000144"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000372"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Yes, we must take a realistic view of how the

film industry works if the tax break is to be effective and workable.

We must ensure that film companies can subcontract and still claim

relief, particularly in relation to filming overseas, as the hon.

Gentleman said. I tabled amendment No. 64 to deal with that problem and

to make it explicit that FPCs can subcontract without losing the tax

break. I hope that the Minister can give us some assurances on

interpretation.</div><a name="06051694000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

is a particular problem with pre-production. Paragraph (a) states that

one of the activities for which the company must be responsible is

pre-production. The effect is that any company not involved in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 209</div>pre-production will not be able to qualify for the film tax credit.

Generally, pre-production tends to cover rehearsals with actors,

deciding on a film location, building a dressing set and sorting out

the finance for the project&#151;activities that occur in the run-up

to the roll of the cameras.</div>

<a name="06051694000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

31 would delete &#147;pre-production&#148; from paragraph (a) and

amendment No. 65 would delete it from paragraph (b), which refers to

involvement in the planning process. If the amendments were adopted,

FPCs could still qualify for the tax break even if they were not

involved in pre-production work. That is important because many

companies are set up as special purpose vehicles specifically to

produce a particular film. A film&#146;s development and

pre-production are often done before that special purpose vehicle is

set up. Hence, it is common practice for the company making the film

not even to exist during pre-production. Even if we took a flexible

approach to being &#147;responsible for&#148; and even if it were

possible to subcontract, we would still run into a significant problem

if pre-production remained one of the compulsory activities for a film

production company to be involved with or responsible for, because of

the overall structure of the film industry.</div>

<a name="06051694000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">From what I have read of the

Revenue&#146;s publications and consultation document, I understand

that it knows that SPVs are commonly used in the film industry and

recognises that they are useful vehicles. I understand that the

Government are not seeking to change that, so I ask them to look again

at pre-production. Unless that term is deleted from the section, it

will become much more difficult to make a film using an SPV. SPVs often

do not come into existence until film production and principal

photography start because until that stage, the studio or entrepreneur

might not know whether the project will actually go ahead. Once all the

preparation work is done, a vehicle is set up to make the

film.</div><a name="06051694000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051694000373"></a><b class="B">Stephen

Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): Would not the problem be

solved&#151;I think this is what the Minister may be getting at in

the proposed clauses&#151;if there were a clear link between those

who bring the matter to pre-production and those who then go into

production, whereby they would be one body, rather than entirely

separate vehicles? They would then all be responsible, even though

technically and legally they may be separate

companies.</div><a name="06051694000149"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000374"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> That would not work within the framework of the

Bill as it is drafted, because the Bill deals specifically with

individual companies, so if the same company that makes the film does

not undertake the pre-production, it cannot qualify for the tax break.

That is the problem that the Opposition are getting

at.</div><a name="06051694000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051694000375"></a><b class="B">Stewart

Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): Is the

problem not compounded by paragraph (c)? It may well be the studio that

negotiates contracts, perhaps pre-production and afterwards, and pays

for rights, perhaps for a book or a play, and which negotiates

merchandising rights and enters into contracts concerning them.

However, the real production company that undertakes the filming would

have nothing to do with it. The clause&#151;especially the

combination of paragraphs (b) and (c)&#151;makes it almost impossible

for the real production company to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 210</div>gain the benefits, because that company almost certainly would not

undertake all the activities that are referred

to.</div><a name="06051694000151"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000376"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Yes. I shall address those points in a moment,

but I agree with the hon.

Gentleman.</div><a name="06051694000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude

my remarks on pre-production, my understanding is that the proposal

made in the clause was not a requirement of the initial framework set

out in the pre-Budget report. The PBR dealt with principal photography

and post-production, but it did not require the film production company

to be involved in pre-production. It is interesting that the Department

for Culture, Media and Sport guidelines on the area, which were

published only a few weeks ago, after the Finance Bill, did not mention

pre-production either. There seems to be a difference of opinion, and

it would certainly be useful if the Economic Secretary outlined why the

Government have changed their mind between issuing the PBR and

publishing the Finance

Bill.</div><a name="06051694000153"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000377"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I think I understand the hon.

Lady&#146;s point. However, when I look at her proposed amendments it

seems to me that it would have been logical to include an amendment to

delete subsection (2), which

says:</div><a name="06051694000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There

cannot be more than one film production company in relation to a

film.&#148;</div><a name="06051694000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why did she not do

that? Is she suggesting that the companies that undertake

pre-production before an SPV is even formed should not be counted as

film production companies at all, or should not get tax breaks, or

both?</div><a name="06051694000155"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000378"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> That might be one way to tackle it, but I do not

think one need go that far to tackle the problem. I suspect that

deleting subsection (2) might have problematic knock-on

effects&#151;I certainly believe that the Economic Secretary would be

concerned if the Committee proposed deleting it. I agree that such a

deletion might mitigate the problem, but it could have unintended

consequences.</div><a name="06051694000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

point raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie), there

are problems with subsection (3)(c) which I have sought to address

through amendment No. 32. The amendment proposes deleting paragraph

(c), which requires the FPC to be directly involved in negotiations, to

contract directly, and to pay directly for rights, goods and services

in relation to a film. As the hon. Gentleman said, the structure of the

industry can make compliance with paragraph (c) difficult. The British

Screen Advisory Council has said that requiring a single company to be

directly involved in all negotiations makes matters difficult, for

similar reasons to those that I have outlined in relation to the

earlier part of the

clause.</div><a name="06051694000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

particular practical problem with the requirement to contract directly

for goods, rights and services. As with pre-production, the rights may

have been contracted for and bought before the SPV was brought into

existence in order to make the film. There are additional problems,

however, in that some key directors and actors may not wish to contract

with the SPV. Some writers and directors, together with certain

artists&#151;American actors in particular&#151;may insist on

contracting with a signatory to the relevant actors&#146; 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 211</div>guilds agreements. For example, many US actors will contract only with a

company that has been approved by a screen actors&#146;

guild.</div><a name="06051694000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many

film producers in Britain whom the Government, I am sure, would want to

benefit from the tax break will not fall into that category. Currently,

the usual practice is for the actor to contract with a US-based company

that has the relevant SAG approval. That American company then invoices

the British company for the cost of the arrangement. That indirect

relationship is not contemplated in paragraph (c), so the measure could

again make it difficult for several sensible and genuine film

productions to fall within the scope of the tax

break.</div><a name="06051694000301"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

pm</div><a name="06051694000159"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000379"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I bow to the hon. Lady&#146;s superior knowledge

of common arrangements with certain American film stars, but would such

arrangements not come under the rubric of &#147;services&#148; in

paragraph (c)? The services would be provided by the American

intermediary, as it were, to provide a named actor for a particular

British production.</div>

<a name="06051694000160"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000380"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> That could be a way to

approach the matter. We might be stretching things if we tried to

persuade a court to interpret the measure in that way. If there were a

requirement to contract directly for something, the court&#146;s

interpretation is likely to be that it would expect a company to

contract directly with the actor. A very flexible interpretation might

solve the problem, but I would be worried if we relied on that kind of

tenuous interpretation. The Economic Secretary might be able to

reassure us on the point, because I do not believe that he would want

to exclude film production companies that enter such arrangements. If

he were to provide such reassurance, that would give us comfort. A

significant degree of uncertainty needs to be dealt

with.</div><a name="06051694000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">A third

problematic issue about the clause is a horizontal one, which stretches

across a number of the subsections and relates to co-productions. In

this instance, I should like to quote a copy of a letter from a firm of

accountants, Malde and Co., who got in touch with me about this issue.

It stated:</div><a name="06051694000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Revenue&#146;s emphasis in clause 32(3) that an FPC should be

responsible for ALL the activities set out in subclauses (a), (b) and

(c) of clause 32(3) virtually rules out any possibility of an FPC

embarking on film production activity as a co-producer with another

genuine film production

company&#148;.</div><a name="06051694000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections (3)

and (4) both specifically exclude companies working in partnership and

specifically refer to activities &#147;otherwise than in

partnership&#148;. I would be grateful if the Economic Secretary

would explain why companies working in partnership will be excluded.

Some in the industry are concerned that that blanket exclusion may

adversely impact on the film industry. Virtually all co-productions

seem to involve companies working in partnership. Depending on how one

views the law, the mere fact of two companies working together could be

sufficient to qualify as a partnership. The exclusion of all

partnerships from the film tax credit scheme could therefore limit its

scope considerably.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 212</div><a name="06051694000163"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000381"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> On the point about

co-productions, subsection (5)

states:</div><a name="06051694000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If

there is more than one company meeting the description in subsection

(3) or (4), the company that is most directly engaged in the activities

referred to...is the film production company in relation to the

film.&#148;</div><a name="06051694000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the hon. Lady

share my concerns that the British film industry is well known for its

post-production skills? In those cases, there may be significant

British involvement, but because the company might not be &#147;most

directly&#148; involved, it might not qualify under the

clause.</div><a name="06051694000165"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000382"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> That certainly is a concern.

It is important to realise that British companies, particularly our

indigenous film producers, are heavily dependent on co-production to

get their projects off the ground, and we are talking particularly

about co-productions with other European countries. If the framework is

to work, we must ensure that it works for co-productions. Clearly, in

the past, there have been problems with partnerships that have been

used as part of the avoidance schemes. I think that there is a

consensus that we want to see the back of them. However, my

understanding is that many of those tended to be partnerships between

individuals, and such individuals cannot take advantage of the tax

break because it applies only to companies.</div>

<a name="06051694000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps there is also anxiety

about partnerships between a film producer and a financial company and

the Government wishing to prevent the financial entity from being a

partner and gaining the tax break designed for the film production

company. However, as we have already explored, where there is a

partnership, it will be the company working on the film that qualifies

for the tax credit; it is clearly provided for in subsection (5) that

only one company can qualify, and that is the one most directly engaged

in film making. It would be useful to hear the Economic

Secretary&#146;s thoughts on what yardstick will be used to determine

which company is most directly engaged in film-producing

activities.</div><a name="06051694000167"></a>

way?</div><a name="06051694000168"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000384"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Yes, but then I would like to make a bit of

progress.</div><a name="06051694000169"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000385"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> The hon. Lady says some interesting things about

co-production, but subsection (4) refersto a qualifying

co-production, which is specifically defined in clause 36. As far as I

can tell it is nothing to do with the interesting and important point

that she is making about

co-production.</div><a name="06051694000170"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000386"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I will take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s word on

that, but still I think that there is an important point to address. I

would welcome the Economic Secretary&#146;s reassurance on how

co-production will be treated under the framework

generally.</div><a name="06051694000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 34 deals with clause 34, which defines production expenditure and

core expenditure. My amendment is about the definition of the latter.

Core expenditure has a crucial part to play in the framework before us,

because it determines the size of the tax break. Amendment No. 34 seeks

to add development 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 213</div>costs to the expenditure that can qualify as expenditure giving rise to

the tax break. Development costs include scouting for a film, looking

for good film ideas, purchasing an option to buy the film rights of a

book at some point in future, and script development. Such activities

have genuine costs that make up part of the production

process.</div><a name="06051694000172"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000387"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> The hon. Lady made the case that

we ought to exclude the development or pre-production phase from the

ambit of the relief, because it is only when one starts the principal

photography phase that engagement should occur. However, she now makes

the case that development costs should come within the ambit of the tax

relief. Is that not an

inconsistency?</div><a name="06051694000173"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000388"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> No, I do not believe so,

because we are talking about two different concepts. I am arguing that

development costs should be taken into account as core expenditure

because they are expenditure that needs to be incurred to make the

film. The fact that a particular company may not have been involved in

the development process should not bar that film from qualifying for

the tax relief. The terms are used in two different contexts in the

statute, and it is overly restrictive in the definition of &#147;film

production company&#148; to require companies to be involved in

development and pre-production. However, I see no reason why

development costs should not be part of the expenditure that qualifies

for the tax

break.</div><a name="06051694000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly, many

in the industry share the feeling that development costs should be

considered part of core expenditure. It would be useful to hear from

the Economic Secretary why those costs have been excluded. One of the

problems is that the distinction between development and pre-production

is blurred; it is difficult to see where one starts and the other

stops. That blurred distinction could give rise to disputes with the

Revenue about the quantum of the expenditure, and about which

expenditure counted for the purposes of the tax break, thus giving rise

to the uncertainty that we are seeking to avoid. That, of course, is

compounded by the fact that there is no definition of either term in

the Bill.</div>

<a name="06051694000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

particular problem with the issue of purchase of

rights&#151;copyrights, and rights to script and music that are

necessary for a film. It is a specific example of the blurred line

between development and pre-production, which may cause difficulty if

development is not included as part of the core expenditure.</div>

<a name="06051694000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rights acquisition costs are

normally viewed by the industry as part of pre-production rather than

development, although at the initial stage the purchase of an option to

buy rights such as book rights tends to be viewed as falling into the

category of development. Using that argument, most rights acquisitions

would fall under the clause as they are part of pre-production.

However, the Treasury&#146;s frequently asked questions document

states that the acquisition of pre-existing rights is a development

cost, which therefore falls outside the scope of subsection (1). It

would be helpful if the Economic Secretary could expand on the

distinction drawn in the document between the purchase of pre-existing

rights, which it states cannot be taken into account in quantifying

core expenditure, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 214</div>and rights that are generated during the production of the film. Further

detail about that would be very useful.</div>

<a name="06051694000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">To close my remarks, I want to

mention the concern expressed by the company that I quoted before on

the matter of development costs. It said:</div>

<a name="06051694000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These are not phantom

costs but genuine ones.&#148;</div>

<a name="06051694000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

argued:</div><a name="06051694000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Development

expenditure is and always has been nothing but a genuine cost of film

production and we cannot see your

rationale&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06051694000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">it is

the Treasury that is being

addressed&#151;</div><a name="06051694000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in

excluding it from the definition or meaning of core

expenditure.&#148;</div><a name="06051694000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 35 and Government amendment No. 26 relate to clause 35, which is

another of the controversial clauses and defines UK expenditure, which,

along with core expenditure, will be a key determinant of whether and

how much tax credit is payable. Subsection (1) provides that UK

expenditure covers services performed in the UK and goods supplied in

the UK. The film producers association, Pact, has stated

that</div><a name="06051694000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the requirements

for EU approval (under State Aid rules) of the new credit have resulted

in a narrow definition of UK qualifying expenditure being adopted,

which is very unhelpful to lower budget

co-productions.&#148;</div><a name="06051694000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given

the amendments that have been tabled, there seems to be consensus among

the Front-Bench teams that we need a clearer definition of goods and

services in this context. First, clarification of the distinction

between the two would be useful. Would that distinction, in this

context, echo the VAT rules under which the supply of goods tends to

cover cases in which there is transfer of title, and the supply of

services covers all other cases, including equipment rental?</div>

<a name="06051694000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need further clarity on

the place of performance of the supply of goods and services. Both

amendment No. 35 and Government amendmentNo. 26 would address

that point, albeit in slightly different ways. Paragraph (a) of my

amendment is intended to gain clarification of what is meant

by</div> <a name="06051694000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;services performed

in the United

Kingdom&#148;.</div><a name="06051694000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">It provides

that if goods and equipment are used in the United Kingdom, although

they are rented or bought from an overseas supplier, they would qualify

as UK expenditure. Paragraph (b) is intended to clarify the meaning

of</div> <a name="06051694000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;goods supplied in

the United Kingdom&#148;.</div><a name="06051694000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

would deal with the situation in which costumes and cameras are

supplied in the UK and transported

overseas.</div><a name="06051694000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government amendment covers, I think, the same ground as the first part

of my amendment; it deals with the concerns behind it to make it clear

that goods or services that are consumed in the UK count as UK spend

for the purposes of clause 35 and it is clearly an improvement on the

Bill. From that perspective I welcome it, but it seems to exclude the

latter part of my amendment&#151;the possibility that goods and

services supplied in the UK and used overseas could count as UK spend.

That is unfortunate given that the type of work that can be done in the

UK and consumed abroad is an important part of the UK film

business.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 215</div><a name="06051694000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government amendment

confirms the Government&#146;s statements that spending on British

crew, actors and craftsmen cannot count as UK spend when it takes place

overseas. I see the appeal of that restriction, in that films made in

the UK are likely to have a more direct effect in the promotion of UK

culture around the world. However, one should bear in mind that films

set overseas can promote British culture effectively as

well.</div><a name="06051694000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

pm</div><a name="06051694000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">One example

that springs to mind of a very successful British film is &#147;The

Constant Gardener,&#148; which was set largely in Kenya but filmed

partly in the UK and Germany. Presumably, it would have a problem

qualifying under the UK spend rules in the new

framework.</div><a name="06051694000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many small

UK producers are worried about the extent to which the restriction on

the UK spend is likely to curtail the usefulness of the tax credit.

They argue that British talent can be showcased on overseas shoots as

much as on domestic ones, and I should be grateful if the Economic

Secretary would outline the rationale behind the restriction. It seems

that it is motivated purely by the views of the European Commission and

the threat of action in the European Court of Justice. As we have

already heard today, it is a matter of concern that despite the

Government&#146;s tough rhetoric on tax harmonisation, the

involvement of the European Commission and the ECJ on tax matters is

still progressively increasing. That was extensively discussed in

relation to group

relief.</div><a name="06051694000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster

General chairs the Primarolo group, which has examined the UK&#146;s

film tax rules in the past. It would be useful to hear from the

Minister whether any problem is anticipated in respect of the new rules

by the group that bears her name. I am sure that the Committee would

also value an update on whether the Minister anticipates any problem in

clearing the new rules with the Commission. As I have said on several

occasions during debate on this part of the Bill, uncertainty has a

crippling effect on the British film industry. I am sure that it would

value reassurance that there is no danger of sudden changes forced on

the Government because the Commission felt that there was a problem in

respect of EU rules in this context, or in any other part of the Bill.

With that, I look forward to the comments of the

Committee.</div><a name="06051694000190"></a>

in 1997, they set up the ill-fated film partnership scheme. It is a

cause of constant surprise to me that despite the wealth&#151;I use

the word advisedly&#151;of experience of the film industry and the

entertainment industry more widely of Labour-appointed Members in

another place, the Government were not able to call on them for help in

devising a scheme that would meet the objective of encouraging the film

industry in this country without exposing it to the concerns that we

are now trying to address&#151;that is, the extent of tax avoidance

by the very wealthy.</div>

simply, my point is that all the clauses and the amendments that we

seek to make to them are required to deal with the Government&#146;s

policy for encouraging a vibrant British film industry, as they have so

palpably failed in their previous efforts. It is worth rehearsing some

of the statistics that both the Front-Bench spokesmen have mentioned.

Mine are slightly different. I am sure that it is a matter of

definition.</div><a name="06051694000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Slamming

the door to tax avoidance schemes for film partnerships in February

2004 had a significant impact on the British film industry. I

understand that the number of films commencing production in the UK,

which is slightly different from the numbers discussed by other hon.

Members, fell by almost half, from 44 in 2003 to only 27 in 2004. That

is a very significant impact. It is even more significant when spending

on films is taken into account: it fell from &#163;269 million in

2003 to&#163;118 million in 2004, with a similar but

slightly less marked reduction in the number of UK-US co-productions

during that

period.</div><a name="06051694000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

takes me to the amendments, particularly those tabled by my hon. Friend

the Member for Chipping Barnet, relating to clause 32 and the

definition of a film production company eligible for relief. We are

looking to encourage medium and small-budget films, not the major

studio productions. The Minister is shaking his head. I understand that

less than &#163;20 million is the criterion that we are applying, but

perhaps he will clarify if I have got it wrong. I take it from his

assent that I have got it

right.</div><a name="06051694000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most films with

budgets of that size are organised by production companies that seek to

bring in production finance from whatever sources are available

globally. That involves co-productions with film production 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 217</div>companies, distribution companies or other companies around the world

that are involved in some element of the film process. It might involve

more than one UK company, frequently a company involved primarily in

television finance and one involved primarily in pure

production.</div>

<a name="06051694000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Confining the

benefit of the reliefs to any one company in the context of one film

under clause 32(2) misunderstands the way that the industry works. I

should be grateful if the Minister would clear up the matter if I have

misunderstood it. A number of companies can take on a significant role

in a film, and that might be hindered if only one company per film is

eligible for

relief.</div><a name="06051694000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings me

to amendment No. 34 to clause 34, which would define what expenditure

is eligible and what is not. I am perplexed that development costs have

been excluded from the definitions of production expenditure under

clause 34, as we are trying to encourage the development of an

industry. We must encourage it at its roots&#151;at the smallest

start and at the origin of a film.</div>

<a name="06051694000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The origin of

a film typically involves taking an idea and working up to the point at

which it is bankable, so that funding can be sought on the back of the

proposition. That is done in what the film industry calls development.

A producer engages a writer, typically either a screenwriter or an

author, to develop a treatment for the film. That is what is involved

in the development cost, which is the seed money for beginning a

production.</div> <a name="06051694000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that

expenditure is excluded from the benefit of relief, there will be no

incentive to start making a film in this country. The funding will all

be geared toward the making of the film at a later stage. Much of that

is undertaken by mature and established companies, not the early stage

producers seeking to develop careers in the industry. Can the Economic

Secretary tell us whether his intent is merely to help established film

producers in this country or rather, as I would hope to be the case, to

seek to encourage new, early-stage entrants? If that is the intent,

surely development costs should be included within the definition. I

support my hon. Friend&#146;s

amendment.</div><a name="06051694000205"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000396"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> May I belatedly welcome you to the Chair, Sir

John, and congratulate the Financial Secretary on his

promotion?</div>

<a name="06051694000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to

make a few remarks about the way in which clause 32 may or may not

reflect reality in the world of film. I speak not as an expert but,

like other members of the Committee, as somebody who watches the

occasional film when I have the time. I notice when I do so that a

number of production companies feature in the credits before the film

starts. It seems to be increasingly common for more than one production

company to be involved in the making of a film. That being so, it must

be the case that clause 32 makes it extremely difficult for that

situation to occur and for each of the companies involved to obtain any

kind of UK tax relief, notwithstanding the ingenious machinations of

any lawyer who might be involved to redefine the words

&#147;responsible&#148;, &#147;engaged&#148; or

&#147;direct&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051694000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the

less, I accept that any assistance for the UK film industry is a good

thing. I invite the Financial Secretary to consider ways in which he

can make it better and more effective. I made the point in relation to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 218</div>an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet that

there is a contradiction between clause 32&#151;a rigorous and

restrictive structure, designed to prevent more than one company from

being involved in the making of a UK film and obtaining tax

relief&#151;and clause 41, which indicates clearly that in order for

a company to obtain UK tax relief it is necessary only for it to have

spent 25 per cent. on UK expenditure. That being so, the Government

must envision that 75 per cent. of the expenditure could be spent

abroad. If it is, it must be spent on companies that are based abroad.

Surely if 75 per cent. of the expenditure is going abroad, 75 per cent.

of the work is going abroad, so it must be obvious that lots of other

companies are involved in the making of the film. The rubric of clause

32 is too restrictive.</div>

<a name="06051694000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other

difficulty that I foresee, and which was alluded to by my hon. Friend

the Member for Chipping Barnet, relates to subsection (5). It is clear

that the way in which the Government propose to resolve the difficulty

that more than one company may appear through the first parts of the

clause to be a film production company is that they require that

potential conflict to be resolved by determining which company is most

directly engaged in the activities listed in subsections (3) and (4).

If I may put it delicately, in an industry that is not necessarily

averse to litigation, there might well be a great many long, complex

and no doubt expensive legal disputes simply to establish which of

several companies involved in the production of a film is the one

entitled to UK tax relief. I am sure that the Financial Secretary would

not wish that to happen&#151;I certainly would not&#151;and I

invite him to reflect on that when he

responds.</div><a name="06051694000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000397"></a>Stewart

Hosie:</b> A great many issues have been discussed, and I will

not go over them again. I shall restrict my remarks to Government

amendmentNo. 26. The objective would appear to be to change

clause 35 to insert</div>

<a name="06051694000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;goods or services that are used

or consumed in the United

Kingdom&#148;</div><a name="06051694000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">in the context

of the meaning of &#147;UK expenditure&#148;. In the only example

that I am aware of in life outside Parliament, a blockbuster film

employed a very expensive team of scriptwriters&#151;it was a large

part of the cost of production of the film. As the script was the basis

of the movie, that was certainly a service consumed in the UK, in

Scotland, where the film was wholly set and shot. However, the primary

scriptwriter and his team were based in Hollywood. Given that the

script, as a service, was wholly consumed in the UK as part of the

production of the movie, is it the Minister&#146;s intention that

that would be covered under the meaning of &#147;UK

expenditure&#148;? It certainly would be if amendment No. 26 were

accepted, but from the general tenor of the clause I am not sure

whether it would if it were not. Will the Economic Secretary advise the

Committee on

that?</div><a name="06051694000211"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000398"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> The debate that we have had on the amendments shows

how wise you were, Sir John, to group them together under this clause,

which defines how a film production company will qualify for relief.

The essence of the reform is to try to move away from the past

difficulties of avoidance.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 219</div><a name="06051694000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The contributions made by some

members of the Committee show the two ways in which one can attempt to

critique or amend the Bill. In her opening remarks, the hon. Member for

Chipping Barnet acknowledged, as have the Government, that although

there has been growth in the number of UK films being produced and in

cinema audiences, there has been an avoidance problem. The scale of

expenditure on relief therefore needs to be dealt with. She is broadly

sympathetic with the conceptual framework that I have established. Her

amendments are intended to strain against and dilute the definitions

set out and the requirement that eligible films be British films, made

by British film makers in our country. We must tackle the problem of

avoidance and move away from the idea that we are simply offering a tax

relief to a financier or a partnership. I shall respond to all of her

points.</div><a name="06051694000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

the other hand, the point made by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr.

Dunne) was factually incorrect. He gave the impression that we are

discussing enhanced tax relief for only small films. In fact, a film

costing under &#163;20 million will benefit from 20 per cent.

enhanced relief, and a large film with a budget of more

than&#163;20 million will also benefit from enhanced

relief, just not quite as much: 16 per cent. The reason why

I&#151;</div><a name="06051694000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051694000399"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):

Paused.</div><a name="06051694000215"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000400"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> The reason why I paused was that I wanted to check

that I was right to tell the hon. Member for Ludlow that he was wrong.

Having checked that I was right, I can now tell him that he was wrong

on that

point.</div><a name="06051694000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Lady said that the rising scale of relief was a potential problem,

and the hon. Gentleman said that we slammed the door on the film

industry in 2004-05. He gave the impression that he would have

preferred the status quo ante, before the reforms&#151;the tax regime

that was put in place in 1992, and which we inherited in 1997. One of

the problems is that, despite repeated amendments, that regime is

flawed and needs to be replaced so that we can tackle the problem of

avoidance. He is right; we have slammed the door on the risk of

avoidance and are instead putting in place a new model that will be fit

for

purpose.</div><a name="06051694000217"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000401"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Is the Economic Secretary seriously saying that

the problems with film tax relief since 1997 are due to the previous

Government? He may be trying to slam the door, but it is taking quite a

long

time.</div><a name="06051694000218"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000402"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> To be fair, I was not trying to

make a party political point. A regime was put in place in 1992 and has

been allowed to operate for well over a decade. In that time, the

industry has seen an opportunity for tax avoidance. Despite repeated

attempts to tackle the problem since 2000, we have all reached the

conclusion that the fundamental model is flawed and needs to be

replaced. All that I was saying to the hon. Gentleman was that if, as

he believes, the scheme is a failure for tax avoidance reasons, that is

a collective failure of the model inherited in 1997. If, as I heard him

say, the failure was not the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 220</div>avoidance, but the fact that we have tackled the avoidance, we have a

fundamentally different view of our responsibilities for the tax

system. Our responsibility is to make sure that the tax reliefs are

used for the purpose that we intend, which is to make sure that British

films are made in Britain, not simply to allow people to avoid

tax.</div> <a name="06051694000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s criticism of the Government&#146;s approach in the

past 18 months is that it has caused uncertainty and a fall in the

number of &#147;films&#148; or the tax relief by slamming the door

on avoidance, I think that that is the right approach. My sense was

that, while we may debate some of the details, there is a consensus

across the Benches about the importance of replacing a flawed

model.</div><a name="06051694000220"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000403"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I am most grateful to the

Economic Secretary for allowing me to respond to his remarks. My

criticism was not that the provision was a belated attempt to deal with

the problem of tax avoidance after the event. It was that tax avoidance

had been progressively worse for a number of years and, instead of the

Government coming up with measures to encourage the film industry at

the same time as dealing with the avoidance, they chose to slam the

door on the avoidance and spend the next 18 months coming up with an

alternative regime. It would have been better to have done the two in

tandem because the Government had plenty of warning that the avoidance

was taking

place.</div><a name="06051694000221"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000404"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> It is certainly the case that measures were put in

place over a number of years in an attempt to tackle the avoidance,

such as those I read out earlier in respect of the Finance Bill. There

were repeated attempts to do that. The conclusion was reached that the

model was flawed and that we needed to move to a better way of

supporting the film industry, one that was in line with the way in

which the modern film industry works and which achieves what needs to

be achieved. We did not simply scrap the old reliefs. As part of the

Bill, they are being removed as a new regime comes into place. We

wanted to consult as widely as possible to make sure that we had a fit

for purpose regime that could last into the future.</div>

<a name="06051694000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">From reading the

comments of experts and practitioners during the consultation, my sense

is that, while there may be some debate about the details, that is what

we have achieved. The Bill will provide a model that will allow the

British film industry to go from strength to strength. To take the time

to do that in order to get it right is the right approach to tax

policy. Last summer&#146;s consultation paper, to which the hon.

Member for Chipping Barnet made reference, outlined the diagnosis of

the problem and also the principles which were to guide the approach.

Those principles are all being enacted in the Bill.</div>

<a name="06051694000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the main, the

consultation paper has been preserved in the legislation. However, we

have made one important concession. We said originally that there had

to be 40 per cent. British expenditure to qualify for the enhanced

relief, but following the consultation, the Government generously

decided to reduce that to25 per cent. to make sure that even

more British films could benefit. The consultation was good; it was

well 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 221</div>conducted by officials as well as Ministers. If we get this right today,

we will have a model which will be of benefit to the British film

industry.</div> <a name="06051694000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on

to discuss the amendments, the first of which has been moved and the

rest of which will be moved in due

course&#151;</div><a name="06051694000225"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000405"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Or may not be.</div>

<a name="06051694000226"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000406"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> Or may not be. We will be able to cover all of the

issues that are relevant to the clause as a whole. I will take them in

a different order because they fall into a number of discrete groups.

Amendments Nos. 31, 32, 64 and 65 are about change in the definition of

a film production company for the purposes of the chapter. Amendment

No. 34 seeks to widen the base upon which film tax relief will be

provided. AmendmentNo. 47, which we referred to in the

earlier debate, would exclude films not made to be shown in cinemas,

such as TV programmes, from the basic tax treatment set out in schedule

4. Amendment No. 35 attempts to refine and clarify the meaning of UK

expenditure and has been referred to by other hon. Members.</div>

<a name="06051694000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make a few general

conceptual comments about what we are trying to achieve, which will

help to meet some of the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns, in particular

those about what a &#147;film production company&#148; means and

why it has been defined as it has for the purpose of the

clause.</div> <a name="06051694000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said

earlier, the most important feature of the new relief, and a

fundamental way in which it differs from its predecessors, is that it

is directed at the film makers, not the financiers, a partnership or a

middleman. That is deliberate, because we do not want the tax

incentives to be diverted to intermediaries or investors; we want them

to go to the film makers themselves. That is the fundamental goal that

we are trying to achieve in order to tackle avoidance.</div>

<a name="06051694000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the clause is to

define those film makers as film production companies and ensure that

those people benefit. The definition in subsection (3), to which hon.

Members have already referred, follows extensive consultation with the

industry. I shall not spend a huge amount of time talking about it, but

there has been a reference to the nature of the film-making process.

Unfortunately, I do not have a direct family member involved in the

film industry, so I cannot claim the degree of knowledge that the hon.

Lady possesses. She was eloquent in her use of technical terms, but I

shall attempt to come close to matching her with my discussion of the

creative process.</div><a name="06051694000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">By

having one &#147;film production company&#148;, the important thing

we are trying to do is make it clear that in the making of the film and

in the essence of that film, there is a being, a person, a film

production company that controls the process, and that that entity, the

individual or vehicle, is consistent throughout the different stages of

film making, from pre-production to completion.</div>

<a name="06051694000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first

requirement is that a film production company be responsible for the

development phase&#151;the initial concept or idea for the film. In

advance of the pre-production phase, there is the development phase, as

the hon. Lady mentioned. It is the period before the film-making proper

starts. With the development phase, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 222</div>in which the initial idea is put together and the film is conceived, one

could say that J. R. Tolkein played a very important role in the

conception of &#147;The Lords of the Rings&#148; film trilogy. It

was an essential part of the development phase, but we would not think

of the film having been made at that stage. The making of the film

proper begins at the end of the development stage, when one has the

story and has conceived of the idea. At that point, the tax support

that we envisage for the making of the film kicks

in.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000410"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> The hon. Gentleman helpfully allows me to make it

clear where the line is drawn. It is absolutely right that one has to

draw a line to delineate the point at which we believe the making of

the film begins. It is clear that when writing the book, J. R. Tolkein

was not part of the making of the film. It was a much earlier stage

than that. There is a long development stage, which often involves

people trying to commission or write scripts. There could be a book, or

the script could be for a film, a television show or whatever. During

that creative process and in that development stage,the

production of the film has not begun. To obtain the enhanced tax relief

that supports the making of the film, the line has been drawn after

that conceptual development stage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000412"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> The process in the consultation

has been to separate the stages of the film-making process. The

development stage takes place before the pre-production stage begins. A

lot of thinking goes on in the development stage, including the writing

of a script and consideration of which actors might be part of the

film. All those activities take place before the pre-production stage

begins and would fall under the definitions set out in the legislation.

The initial conception of possible story boards for a film would take

place in that development stage. That is not to say that there are no

costs involved or that they could not be set against income for tax

purposes. However, if we are trying to incentivise the making of a

British film, we must draw a line between developing the conceptual

framework and moving into pre-production. One starts to contract for

the making of the film at the pre-production stage.</div>

<a name="06051694000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis

of the consultation, it is understood in the industry that there is a

distinction between amuch broader conceptual, speculative

phase, which is development, and saying, &#147;This is a film; this

is a script. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 223</div>We&#146;ve gone beyond the point of creative speculation. We&#146;ve

decided to make the film and we&#146;re now going to commission all

the things that we need for it in the pre-production phase.&#148;

That is understood in the industry and therefore reflected in the

amendment. There is a process called pre-production, which is a clear

phase in the making of a film that comes only when one has gone beyond

the speculative, creative phase and decided to make the

film.</div><a name="06051694000240"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000413"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> The Economic Secretary is floundering slightly.

The definitions that he is offering are open to interpretation. My

concern is that there will be an incentive for smart tax accountants to

shove what might generally be viewed as pre-pre-production into

pre-production. I am curious as to how he will get over the problem of

who will play Solomon in those

decisions.</div><a name="06051694000241"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000414"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> It is widely understood in the industry that after

the development phase, when the conceptual phase is taking place, there

is a particular point called green light. At the point of green light,

the film gets the go-ahead, the studio is booked, the financiers come

in, the legal documentation is brought together and the special purpose

vehicle is created to bring together all the different elements of the

creative phase&#151;people, rights, obligations and risk&#151;into

one legal entity. At that green light stage, when a film moves from

development into pre-production, the tax incentive starts to kick

in.</div>

<a name="06051694000242"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000415"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> Once again, the Economic Secretary shows that he

perhaps does not understand the creative accounting that tends to go

on. My concern&#151;I still do not understand how he is going to get

us over this hump&#151;is that the definitions that he has come up

with will not be clear and that there will be a tendency to show what

was pre-green light as pre-production. I still do not understand how

the Government propose to oversee that and decide who should play

Solomon in those very

decisions.</div><a name="06051694000243"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000416"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good

point. In defining the stages, we must ensure that the opportunities

for ambiguities or avoidance are reduced as far as possible. That is

exactly why we are specifying clearly that there must be one film

production company responsible for all the phases from the beginning of

the pre-production phase right through to completion, rather than a

number of overlapping entities. There has been extensive consultation

with industry figures to ensure that the terms pre-production,

principal photography and post-production of a film, as set out in

subsection 3(a)(i), are clearly defined and understood in the

industry.</div> <a name="06051694000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a way

the difficulty we face was the point I was going to make in response to

the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet: we need flexibility in the way in

which the legislation is enacted. We need flexibility in guidance and

the way in which the tax authorities treat the production company. We

are not saying, as was suggested earlier, that the film company must do

all the pre-production, principal photography and the third stage

itself. We are not saying that it cannot work in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 224</div>partnership or subcontract part of the work to other companies. The

important point is that, through these phases, an entity must be

actively engaged rather than simply being a financial shell in order to

divert tax revenues.</div>

<a name="06051694000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way that the FPC will

operate will be differentin every case and there has to be

flexibility in the way in which we interpret the amount of its

engagement in each of the three stages. It will not be a

black-and-white situation. The important thing is that we will be able

to track the responsibility of the FPC through all the three stages.

Companies have to be actively engaged in making a film. The tax relief

is for making a film, not for writing a book or for simply saving or

avoiding tax.</div>

<a name="06051694000246"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000417"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I very much appreciate where the Economic

Secretary is trying to go. On the one hand, he is trying to create

specific definitions of what is pre-pre-production and what is

pre-production, but on the other, he says that there must be some

flexibility. To me, flexibility means ambiguity, so my concern is how

the Revenue will interpret a piece of an advice given by an accountant

as opposed to what the Government want it to

be.</div>

<a name="06051694000247"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000418"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> It goes to the very essence of making tax policy to

ensure that there are rules that are understood by people who are going

about a piece of businessor undertaking a project and that

have common application, while ensuring that there is flexibility to

deal with the circumstances of each individual trade. No two films will

look the same, or be financed or produced in the same way. The question

is whether we have a model that allows us to be confident that, when

attempting to subsidise through the tax system the making of a film,

the FPC is actively engaged in each of the three stages.</div>

<a name="06051694000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis of our

consultation with the industry, we have come up with a definition that

is much better than the previous one because it makes clear that, to

some extent, there should be active engagement by the company in each

of the three stages involved in the making of the film. The FPC could

be making a film, but not rolling the cameras; it could be making a

film, but not actually booking a studio or getting actors in; or it

could be making a film without being involved in distribution. However,

if it is not involved in any of those three activities, it is not

making a film. The guidance and the tax case law, as it develops, will

make clear exactly how that will be applied in

practice.</div>

<a name="06051694000249"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000419"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> It is now clear where the Economic Secretary is

seeking to draw the line. I happen to think that he is making a mistake

in that development cost expenditure ought to be included as a

legitimate expense of a film production company, but I would like to

draw his attention to a couple of clauses.</div>

<a name="06051694000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Economic Secretary is

creating confusion through the drafting. In clause 33, there is a

definition of film-making activity that includes the word

&#147;development&#148;. That is picked up in paragraph 5(1)(a) of

schedule 4 which refers to</div>

<a name="06051694000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;film-making activities in

connection with the film&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 225</div><a name="06051694000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">thereby picking up development costs from

clause 33. The first line of paragraph 4(1) of the schedule refers to

the development costs of a film, so the Economic Secretary seems to be

clearly expressing an intent to the Committee that is not reflected in

the drafting of the

Bill.</div><a name="06051694000252"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000420"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> I do not think that that is right. The hon.

Gentleman should find that clause 32(3)(a) is very clear. A film

production company is defined as a company that is

responsible:</div><a name="06051694000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(i)

for pre-production, principal photography and post production of the

film, and</div> <a name="06051694000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">(ii) for

delivery of the completed

film&#148;.</div><a name="06051694000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">To qualify for the

tax relief it needs to be involved in all three stages and the

definitions are commonly understood in the industry. In the earlier

phases, the costs that can be set against tax in the normal way are not

part of the making of a British film for these purposes so they are not

included. We had to draw the line somewhere and we consulted widely

with the industry before coming to that

view.</div>

<a name="06051694000254"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000421"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> I want to take the Economic Secretary back to what

he said about subsection (3) when he indicated that it would be

remarkable if a British film or, indeed, a film of any other

nationality, did not involve one of the activities in subsection

(3)(a), (b) or (c). I agree, but the difficulty is that because of the

way in which the clause is drafted, the provisions in those paragraphs

are conjunctive and not disjunctive. All three must be done to qualify.

The difficulty that Opposition Members have highlighted is that there

are situations when companies may not be involved in all those

activities, but may still qualify in ordinary language as a film that

deserves tax

relief.</div><a name="06051694000255"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051694000422"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> We are trying to put into statute definitions that

ensure that that the tax relief is properly applied and goes only to

genuine British film makers. We do not want to introduce loopholes that

allow the tax resource to be diverted elsewhere to shell companies and

so

on.</div><a name="06051694000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

&#147;responsible for&#148; meant that a company had to finance the

relevant activities in their entirety, if &#147;actively engaged

in&#148; meant that it had to do everything, or if</div>

<a name="06051694000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;directly negotiates, contracts

and pays for&#148;</div>

<a name="06051694000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">meant that it could not

involve or buy in expertise to advise it or to do some of those things,

the hon. Gentleman would be making a good point. However, that is not

the absolutist way in which this is being set up. We are requiring

active engagement, which does not mean absolute engagement. We are not

being prescriptive 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 226</div>and we are not saying that, to qualify, a company must be responsible

for every aspect of every activity. Clearly, the degree of activity

will vary film by film, case by case and with some films there will be

much more active engagement by the film production company in the

pre-production phase or the completion phase than in others. The

important point is that to qualify the film production company must

have some engagement in the pre-production and completion phases. It

cannot opt out of one phase or the

other.</div><a name="06051694000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

hope that that provides some clarity for the hon. Member for Chipping

Barnet because she made the same point earlier. We are not saying that

a special purpose vehicle cannot be used or that the company must

either work in isolation or do everything itself. We are saying that it

must be engaged in, have responsibility for and negotiate each aspect

of those three phases, but it may do so in partnership with others or

by bringing in other services from Britain or overseas. The important

point is that we will not allow the tax relief to go to a partnership.

There may be a partnership, but the tax relief will go to the British

film maker and the British film maker must be a film production

company&#151;a vehicle that meets each of the three tests in the

clause. I hope that that provides

clarity.</div><a name="06051694000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

come now to the details of the amendments. First, amendment No. 31, as

the hon. Lady said, would remove the obligation on a film production

company to have responsibility for pre-production activity. As I

explained, we believe that a film maker must be actively engaged in,

and be responsible, for the pre-production phase. We are not saying

that that is an absolute or inflexible definition and it is possible to

have a greater or lesser engagement in the pre-production phase but, on

the basis of our consultations, we believe that it would be a mistake

for the provision to apply if there is no engagement as that would

suggest that we did not properly understand the delineation between

speculative development and the beginning of the production

process.</div><a name="06051694000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise,

amendment No. 32 would weaken the definition of a film production

company by removing the requirement that it must be involved in

negotiating, contracting and paying for the various rights, goods and

services that together make up the expenditure on making a film. Again,

and for reasons that I hope I have made clear, any company that is not

involved in negotiating contracting and paying for the fundamental

elements of making a film cannot be the controlling entity or the

essence of the making of that British film, which is what we want to

achieve in the provision. I stress that that does not mean all of the

film.</div><a name="06051694000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Debate
