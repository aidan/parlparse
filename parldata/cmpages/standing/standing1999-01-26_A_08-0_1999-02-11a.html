<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/007/1999007.htm">Greater London Authority Bill</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>(Except clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome the Committee back. Before we start our consideration of the Bill, I should remind the Committee of the Business Sub-Committee's decision. It is my duty to commence the conclusion of proceedings on all aspects of the Bill up to the end of part III by 6.50 pm. The consequence of that is that if we are debating Opposition amendments, I will interrupt the debate and put the Question. I will then put the Question that the relevant clause stand part. After that, I will put the Question that all subsequent clauses stand part. I will not call further Opposition amendments, although I will call Government amendments. The same applies to new clauses: I will call only Government new clauses and simply put the Question that they be added to the Bill.
<P>
I thought that it would be as well to focus the Committee's attention on those matters. I should also call attention to the exigencies of business because we may be interrupted several times by Divisions in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. My comments may bear slightly on your good guidance to the Committee. I have consulted Standing Order No. 120, which deals with this Committee's business sub-committee but is silent about how the sub-committee is convened. We are all still new to these Standing Orders. I may have misread Standing Order No. 120, and it is always possible that I should be put right and made wiser. I do not know how the business sub-committee is convened. The issue is germane and important as I may try&#151;possibly with the co-operation of the usual channels&#151;to get it to convene.
<P>
This Committee's business resolution envisages us sitting next Thursday, and Conservative Members are fully prepared to do so. That is part of the arrangement behind the Committee's mileposts and its conclusion date. The Government have a majority in the Committee and I accept the realities of that. If we do not get our way and are not allowed to sit next Thursday by force majeure, I will seek to negotiate an extra sitting to compensate for the one that will be lost.
<P>
I do not ask for, nor could I reasonably expect you to give us, an instant ruling on the matter, Mr. O'Hara. I want, however, to lodge the point with you so that you can give it some thought and advise us on whether we are due to sit next Thursday, as Conservative Members are willing to do.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is not asking for an instant ruling, but I can give instant guidance. The business sub-committee can be reconvened at the Chairman's discretion. The matter need not be determined now. We should wait to see whether the Chairman decides that he needs us to use his discretion to reconvene the business sub-committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. How does one get on the business sub-committee? Is there a volunteering procedure?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall interrupt that point of order. The membership of the Business Sub-Committee has already been determined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> By whom?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> By the Speaker.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I have today answered a written question and confirmed the start date for the Greater London authority. Committee Members will be aware that we debated the issue earlier in our deliberations. At that point, the Government were not in a position to make an announcement. I have today made it clear that the GLA will come formally into existence on Monday 3 July 2000, just two months after the election. That is in line with the view that was expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the House. I hope, therefore, that it will be welcomed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): In response to that statement, I should say that Conservative Members welcome the Government's decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes (Southwark, North and Bermondsey):</B> The Minister knows that I welcome the date because I suggested it to him a long time ago. [Hon. Members: ``Oh.''] It may not have been exclusively my idea, but it was certainly my idea.
<P>
The date is also welcome because it means that there will be a logical sequence of events, and not a transitional period in which some other authority will run the GLA before elections. Also, for the first time in British politics, elections will be followed by a period of several weeks in which the mayor and assembly can organise their affairs and appoint staff, establishing a new administration in a sensible, orderly way. That is also welcome.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have been generous in allowing all parties to get in their two pennyworth, or even their three pennyworth. I hope that in return the Committee will now concentrate its attention on expediting business.
<H4><center>Clause 87</center></H4>
<H4><center>Mayor's duty to distribute certain grants etc between Authority and functional bodies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I beg to move amendment No. 381, in page 47, line 35, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including a percentage, to be determined, of enhancement obtained during the previous year to the level of non-domestic rates in Greater London.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
You, Mr. O'Hara, welcomed us back, and I welcome you back. I am entirely resigned to the Minister for London and Construction telling me that the wording of my amendment is technically defective. He can be as callous in his language as he wishes.
<P>
One of the mayor's key functions in conjunction with the London development agency will be to attract new investment to London and to secure regeneration of brownfield sites. The Bill as drafted exhorts the mayor to do that, but does not provide him with a direct financial incentive to do so. My amendment, however inexpertly it is expressed, is intended to remedy that situation by adding to the mayor's budget a share of any enhancement in the level of non-domestic rates attributable to Greater London.
<P>
For example, the London First centre&#151;London First's inward investment subsidiary&#151;has identified more than 30 major sites comprising more than 1,000 acres which are market-ready, and a much larger number of sites in the Lea valley, the Thames gateway, the Wandle valley and in west London, which require more investment to unlock their potential. Development of those brownfield sites will create employment and generate tax revenues for the Treasury, including a substantial addition to non-domestic rates. However, it will be a major task requiring substantial resources to help prepare sites for development and to market them to attract inward investment.
<P>
Under the present arrangements, the extra tax revenue generated and the costs involved are completely unrelated. If the GLA wants to step up its regeneration and marketing efforts, it will be dependent on bidding for a larger share of national resources or increasing the burden on council taxpayers. It would be much better for the cost of such efforts to be funded by part of the increased tax revenue that is generated. That arrangement would be simpler, fairer and more transparent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman said that I could be as callous as I wished about the wording of the amendment. I would not wish to be in any way callous to the right hon. Gentleman, who has played a constructive role throughout the Committee. I must admit that from the wording of his amendment I was left far from clear about its intentions, until he gave us his admirable exposition.
<P>
The problem is that the clause is about the distribution of resources by the GLA, while the intention behind the amendment is to increase the resources available for distribution. I think that the right hon. Gentleman would accept that the amendment does not logically fit the clause. I will not get into textual analysis about the quality of the drafting.
<P>
The income from the national rate is currently distributed among authorities in proportion to their population, and is shared between the district and upper-tier authorities according to the services they provide. That helps in equalising resources between rate-rich and rate-poor authorities, and, together with the revenue support grant system, allows councils to provide a similar level of service throughout the country while setting broadly the same rate of council tax.
<P>
The amendment appears to suggest that the rate income should be top-sliced before distribution, and that the top slice should go to the GLA. I can see no justification for that. It would run counter to the principle of resource equalisation that I have outlined and would undoubtedly generate considerable unhappiness elsewhere in the country.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman has raised a serious issue, however, by asking what incentive there is for the mayor to seek additional investment in London. There is an obvious incentive: the economic health and well-being of the capital city, irrespective of the revenue available to the GLA. The mayor will want to liaise closely with inward investment agencies, such as the London First centre and others, to ensure that London continues to attract inward investment even if it does not generate additional revenue for the GLA. Ultimately, a prosperous city will be well placed to provide for and to meet the needs of its citizens, as the mayor will rightly want it to.
<P>
I urge the right hon. Gentleman to ask leave to withdraw his amendment, not because of its technical deficiencies, but because it would introduce a mechanism that would be inappropriate in the wider framework of local government finance and because the mayor will not need incentives to do his or her best for London. I am sure that the mayor will do whatever he or she can to boost the economy of this city without any such incentive.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It would be wrong of me to press the amendment, as the Minister has politely drawn my attention to the fact that it is aimed at an inappropriate place in the Bill. I shall, however, remark on an irony. Hon. Members on the Opposition Benches, or at least Conservative Members, are always more interested in the increase of resources than in the nature of their distribution. Labour Members are always more interested in their distribution than in their increase. That is a happy statement of the dichotomy between us.
<P>
The Minister was kind enough to refer to the thrust of the amendment. He will be aware of a misgiving that has existed in some local authorities since the change in the distribution of non-domestic rates. Such authorities are concerned that there is no longer the incentive that there used to be for specific local authorities to work with local business for increases in resources. The necessity of such an incentive is a continuing issue.
<P>
In the light of the Minister's remarks and the manner in which he made them, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 307, in page 47, line 41, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) The instalments to be paid under subsection (3) above to a functional body shall be payments of such amounts, and shall be payable at such times, as will enable the body to meet its budgeted expenditure for the year as it falls due.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	(3B) It shall be the duty of the Authority to pay instalments under subsection (3) above punctually.
<P>
	(3C) In the application of subsection (3A) above in relation to a functional body, ``budgeted expenditure'' means expenditure which, in accordance with the calculations (or last calculations) made under section 70(4) to (7) above, the body is to meet out of payments by way of instalments under this section.'.
<P>
Clause 87, as drafted, places the GLA under a duty to pay functional bodies their share of the sums that it receives in general grants in accordance with their budgets. The GLA will make the payments by instalments during the financial year. The amendment will require the GLA to pay a sufficient amount in each instalment at an appropriate time to enable the functional bodies to meet their budgeted expenditure. That will ensure that each functional body has the funds to pay its way. The GLA will need to pay each instalment punctually, to ensure that the mayor cannot retain funds derived from general grants that are due to the functional bodies.
<P>
The amendment is small, but I hope that the Committee will recognise that it is necessary.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 87, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 88 to 94 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 95</center></H4>
<H4><center>Part IV of 1989 Act to apply to Authority and functional bodies</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 308, in page 51, line 10, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(3) In consequence of the amendment made by subsection (2) above, in subsection (1) the paragraph (bb) inserted after paragraph (a) by paragraph 88 of Schedule 16 to the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 (county borough council) shall become paragraph (aa).''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I, too, welcome you back to the Committee, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
This is another minor consequential amendment which relates to clause 95. The clause extends the list of bodies covered by the local government capital finance system in section 39 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to include the GLA and functional bodies.
<P>
Amendment No. 308 further amends that list to deal with a small problem in the numbering of its items. Clause 95 inserts the Greater London authority and identifies it as ``(bb)'', ensuring that it is placed at the most appropriate place in the list. However, the reference ``(bb)'' has already been used&#151;inappropriately&#151;for county borough councils, an item that was inserted in the list by an earlier Act. Consequently, the amendment gives the reference ``(aa)'' to county borough councils so that ``(bb)'' can be used for the GLA.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 309, in page 51, line 10, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4) In subsection (3) (bodies which may be prescribed by regulations under subsection (1)(k)) at end of paragraph (c) there shall be inserted ``or''.'.&#151;[Ms Glenda Jackson.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I, too, welcome you back to the chair, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
I said on Second Reading that in my judgment, the mayor should be given more power and flexibility to raise money if he so wished. I had in mind using the various revenue streams that will be available to him as security for further borrowing. I intended to table an amendment to that effect in the next part of the Bill, which relates to transport, but it has since been brought to my attention by London First that I should have tabled such an amendment to this clause. By the Time I realised that, it was too late to do so. I should, however, like to put down a marker; perhaps the Minister might like to reconsider the matter.
<P>
Several revenue streams will be available to the mayor. Such a prospect is no doubt being eyed by a number of organisations, not least of all the Government, as a means of financing their public-private partnership. That partnership may or may not have its problems. Either way, any mayor would appreciate the option of raising funds by, say, bond issues, which happens in the United States and New York in particular. I should have thought that a Government who were having difficulty in getting a public-private partnership up and running would also be attracted to the idea, and it would have to form a part of the clause.
<P>
It is far too late for me to table an amendment to that effect, but this would be the place in the Bill in which to do that if the Ministers chose to return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, back to the Chair. I associate the Liberal Democrat Members with the remarks of the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway). We, too, received notification from London First about the possibility of tabling an amendment in this part of the Bill to give the mayor power to raise capital on the back of revenues that would be generated from congestion charges and non-residential parking levies. It seems a sensible way forward in line with the Government's thinking.
<P>
London First drew our attention to the experience of the metropolitan transit authority in New York. The authority is allocated a share of certain state and city taxes for future years, and on the basis of that allocation it is able to borrow in year one so that it can make sensible investment decisions and plan for the future. Authorities which do not have that power are unable to plan properly.
<P>
Those right hon. and hon. Members who have visited London Transport and spoken to past and present chief executives will have been told that London Transport has traditionally been unable to plan for the long term because it has not had a two, three or four-year planning horizon. I know that the Government are hoping to get round that problem using public-private partnership. However, if that partnership has problems getting off the ground, as the hon. Gentleman suggested it might&#151;we may wish to raise that point later in the Committee's proceedings&#151;this is a sensible alternative that has been tried out elsewhere. We commend it to the Government and ask them to look at it again and come back, perhaps on Report, to see whether this is a way forward.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I pay tribute to London First for its assiduity in informing not only Opposition Members, in the form of the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), but the Government about its proposition that the GLA should be completely free to borrow upon the security of revenues from the new charges and levies which the Government are proposing to introduce in the Bill. As I have had occasion to say before, the amounts raised from road charging and a private non-residential parking levy will be used exclusively for transport in London.
<P>
Local authority spending funded by borrowing counts as public expenditure, and that is why we have to regulate it. That is why we must bring the GLA within the normal capital finance system that applies to all other local authorities. There cannot be a separate system for the GLA.
<P>
The sort of security offered for a loan makes no difference to the public expenditure effects. London First may not realise that its proposal would undermine a long-established rule that all borrowing by local authorities should be charged in differently on all the revenues of the authority. Loans have never been secured solely against the revenues associated with a particular service or project. That gives lenders to authorities the greatest possible safeguard.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton touched on the issue of bonds and referred to Government thinking. The Government thought long and hard about the best of all possible ways, in the public interest, and providing best value, to attract into our underground the sort of capital investment that it needed. May I say to the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Croydon, South that they really should not believe everything that they read in the newspapers? The Government are experiencing no difficulty with regard to our PPP. It is on target, but, as my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has said, we will not be tied by the political ideology that was expressed by the previous Administration, and insist that our proposals must work to a finite date. As far as the public-private partnership is concerned, we are interested in ensuring that it gives best value to the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister mentioned that the Government are not being tied by the political ideology of their predecessors, and for that we are very welcome.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Grateful, surely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister, from a sedentary position, corrects me.
<P>
Can the Government go further in breaking with the ideology of their predecessors in terms of Treasury rules? Other countries have experimented with setting up quasi-commercial bodies that are able to borrow on the private markets without state guarantee and use those funds to invest in capital projects such as transport bodies. In her reply, the Minister quoted the typical Treasury public accounts ideology. Liberal Democrat Members believe that as the Government are setting up an innovative new body, that body should have an innovative financing process.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I find it odd that the hon. Gentleman should castigate the Government in that way, because this Government have broken one of the oldest Treasury rules: that is, the rule about hypothecation. Hypothecation will ensure that money is raised from congestion charging and a private non-residential parking levy. That will improve transport in London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Government have also broken the normal rules by underwriting the issue of a vast bond flotation for the Channel tunnel rail link. That will have major implications for public expenditure.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members' interventions are straying beyond the business of the Committee&#151;and they have been rather long.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> In the light of my previous responses, I now turn specifically to clause 95, which brings the GLA and the four functional bodies within the local government capital finance system. However, subsequent provisions modify the controls in certain respects.
<P>
The capital finance system was established by Part IV of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. It has effect in respect of the finances of most local authorities in England and Wales and a number of other public authorities. It regulates the amount of borrowing and other credit a local authority can incur, requires provision to be made for the repayment of loans and other debt and controls local authorities' capital spending.
<P>
I hope that members of the Committee agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be extremely brief. I accept the Minister's explanation as to why the proposition can be accepted.
<P>
I should like to remark on a relevant experience that occurred nearly 40 years ago. At that time, when British Oxygen had a near monopoly in this country, Air Products, from the United States, entered the market. It was a much smaller company, and did not have the resources to mount a major attack. Nevertheless, its attack was most effective. It generated massive efficiencies in British Oxygen simply by agreeing with major industrial companies that it would build industrial gas plants immediately outside the plant and, on the basis of the contract, would then have the money to build the plant. There are good private-sector reasons for using future revenues for that type of financing purpose. I hope that the Government will, in due course, look at the issue again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have two points that follow on from the Minister's reply. First, her right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made innovative proposals regarding private finance for public transport. We have always argued in favour of that and we welcomed the proposals. However, I am not yet clear whether those proposals will fall outside the normal Treasury rules in terms of national transport investment. I do not shadow the Secretary of State, but I understand, from what I have heard him say, that that is his intention, with the aim of securing more investment for the public transport infrastructure. If that is so, the same logic should apply to a railway system that is run by a lower tier of authority than the Government. The Government may define citywide government as local government, but most local governments do not run railway systems.
<P>
Secondly, even if that were not the case&#151;we are only at a round the houses, first debate stage, because amendments have not been tabled&#151;would the Government accede to the proposition that borrowing should be permitted against the revenue stream, even if they held to the traditional Treasury rules in terms of public sector financing? Perhaps the Government would be perfectly happy for a future GLA to borrow&#151;although they would, of course, have to be satisfied, if they kept to the old position, that the money was borrowed within the total added up for the purpose of total public expenditure. Perhaps the Minister will consider, first, the larger position and, secondly, the more limited position, but which still accedes to the proposition that the power be given to the GLA.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> On the hon. Gentleman's last point about borrowing against revenue, I have already said that we do not deem that necessary. Nor do I believe that the private sector would deem it necessary to provide protection for those who lend to borrowing authorities in that way. He touched on the larger issue and cited the example of a national railway. The Government have made it abundantly clear that we believe in public-private partnerships&#151;the combination of the public and private sector. We want to ensure that the national infrastructure, which is in all out best interests, can be modernised and developed, given the grievous lack over 18 years by the previous Administration of any serious attention being paid to our national resource.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is attempting to compare a national railway infrastructure with our specific proposals for the modernisation of the London Underground. It is our perspective that the national railway structure is suffering from the fragmentation that a previous privatisation visited upon us. We must start to reintegrate that national infrastructure.
<P>
We considered long and hard how best to attract investment into our underground system because of a grievous lack of sufficient investment over years. It was, and is, our perception that the best way forward is a PPP to ensure that nothing&#151;I repeat, nothing&#151;will be sold off and privatised, as happened to our railways under the previous Government. The hon. Gentleman is right: we are anticipating long-term contracts, especially for the infrastructure of our underground, which will revert back to the public sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am not anticipating the later debate about public-private partnerships. I have heard the Minister's strong argument on the matter but if, like us, the hon. Lady is an advocate of integrated public transport, the logic of integrating the London transport system with the rest of the national network suggests that there should be a similar financing system for both. If the system in the capital city is to be integrated with that of the rest of the country, the same financing system should be available for both.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman fails to acknowledge that an integrated system&#151;my example was the underground&#151;which, although a vital transport resource for people living outside the Greater London authority boundary, cannot compare with a national surface railway structure. It brings millions of people within the GLA boundary, but takes them out infinitely further. It would be non-productive to accommodate what, in some instances, might be different priorities on the basis that the hon. Gentleman has proposed this afternoon.
<P>
The surface railway plays a major part in London's infrastructure within the GLA boundary, which is why we have outlined clearly the role that the mayor will play in the financing or improvement of those services. I trust that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 95, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 96 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 97</center></H4>
<H4><center>Aggregate credit approval for Authority and functional bodies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 336, in page 51, leave out lines 40 to 45.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 337, in page 52, leave out lines 1 to 6.
<P>
No. 341, in clause 99, page 52, leave out lines 32 to 40.
<P>
No. 342, in clause 100, page 53, line 33, leave out from `approval' to end of line 35.
<P>
No. 343, in clause 106, page 57, line 4, leave out from `year' to end of line 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I tabled amendments Nos. 336 and 337 as probing amendments. The Committee will be aware of the four categories of credits available to the mayor&#151;categories A, B, C and D. The amendments would eliminate categories C and D.
<P>
Clauses relating to categories C and D give the mayor exceptional powers to spend major sums on projects at his discretion. Despite the reference to ``expenditure for capital purposes'' as the mayor ``may see fit'', the clause is effectively a licence to spend at will. Category C allows the mayor to raise credits for functional bodies in relation to particular categories of expenditure. Category D is more relaxed and covers general purposes at the mayor's discretion.
<P>
When the Minister replies, I hope that he will tell me that the Secretary of State will have ultimate control over the mayor's credits and that the mayor's credit approval powers effectively have some cap or limit. I should grateful if the Minister would confirm that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the amendments are unacceptable to the Government because they undermine an important principle of the Bill. They relate to the issue of credit approvals&#151;the mechanism by which the Government will allocate resources to the GLA and its functional bodies for capital spending. Aggregate credit approvals will be issued to the mayor once a year and will allow the GLA and its bodies to use borrowing or credit to meet their capital needs. Additional credit approvals may be issued for the same purpose during the financial year.
<P>
Each such credit approval will specify one or more amounts of credit. A specified amount will be either for use by a specified authority or for allocation by the mayor. Where the mayor has power to allocate an amount, he will also play a role in deciding the purpose for which the credit be used.
<P>
The amendments would require the Secretary of State to earmark each amount in the credit approval for the use of a particular body. Discretion for the mayor as to the allocation of any amount would be entirely ruled out, and he would have no say in the purpose for which credit could be used by the functional bodies.
<P>
The amendments no doubt reflect the opposition on Conservative Benches to the mayor's strategic influence over capital spending amounts and priorities. Some believe that the finances of the GLA and its functional bodies should be entirely separate and self-contained. However, that would be inconsistent with our conviction that the new London government framework must be able to take an overview and should be able to reallocate resources between separate bodies to achieve efficiences. That is compatible with the principle of a strong mayor.
<P>
I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Croydon, South that in the first year of the GLA the lion's share of the aggregate credit approval will be earmarked by the Secretary of State, who will decide what amount of credit is to be specified for each of the new authorities and the purpose for which it is to be used. But it is vital to preserve the mayor's discretion in future years to determine some of the allocation of credit approvals within the overall framework of the GLA.
<P>
The clauses will ensure that the Secretary of State will have discretion to decide each year what proportion of the total credit allocated to the new London authority is to be allocated by him and what proportion is to be left for distribution by the mayor.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied that there is a safeguard against irresponsible or extravagant expenditure by the mayor, but also that is is necessary and appropriate for the mayor to have a degree of discretion and that it is right and proper for such discretion to be available to encourage efficiency. I hope that he will therefore withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My modest probing amendment produced an accusation from the Minister that it was ideologically grounded and compatible with our vision of the assembly, but I simply wanted to extract from the Minister an explanation of precisely how the assembly would work.
<P>
I detected one inconsistency in the Minister's remarks. He confirmed what he has said on many occasions&#151;that the mayor will be a strong mayor. However, I was pleased to hear also that the mayor will be subject to the Secretary of State's control, which is how we have always seen the Government's vision of the mayor. Nevertheless, contained in the Minister's answer was the kernel that I sought: the answer is yes. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I rise to make a brief comment on the Minister's answer to the hon. Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
The Minister spoke about the mayor's discretion in the allocation of credit approvals, but suggested that that discretion would be curtailed. The whole system set up in this and the following clauses is extremely limited. Local government is used to a fairly complicated and centrally controlled system of basic and supplementary credit approvals, but the Bill will get rid of that and replace it with a far more complicated system, in which the tentacles of Ministers and Whitehall civil servants will range even wider.
<P>
The Bill allows for credit approvals for every functional body on the GLA. Within each of those credit approvals are listed credit approvals A, B, C and D. In addition to those are additional credit approvals. I am not sure whether they, too, will be divided into A, B, C and D between the functional bodies: perhaps I should read the following clause in more detail.
<P>
From that brief outline, one can see that the clause sets up a system of huge complexity, simply to give the Secretary of State total power over the allocation and spending of capital. The notion that the mayor has any discretion is shown to be false by that very complexity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The Liberal Democrats have once again displayed their funadmentalist tendencies. They simply do not recognise that there are checks and balances in any system of government. They would love the local government tier to be entirely free of any checks, so that it could spend whatever it wanted&#151;and even develop its own foreign policy&#151;but they will not allow central Government to exercise proper restraint over local government.
<P>
We believe that the Bill strikes an appropriate balance between the different tiers of government. As I made it clear to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, the Secretary of State will take an overview, but the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton clearly fails to understand that the mayor quite properly has a degree of discretion. That is why there are four categories of spending. Categories A and B are subject to the Secretary of State's prescription; categories C and D are subject to the mayor's discretion.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the mayor would have no discretion, but that is totally wrong. The mayor will have discretion, but it will be within a framework that seeks to ensure proper safeguards and a prudent approach to public expenditure. We have no doubt in adopting that view. We believe in taking a prudent approach to public expenditure in order to achieve good value for money. We wholly reject the Liberal Democrats profligate and irresponsible approach to public expenditure. I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 97 should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This group of amendments follows on from the previous group. I hope that the Ministers here this afternoon will not take the amendments personally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> They are deeply offensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I thought that I might get a reaction.
<P>
In considering the mayor's discretion and the overriding powers that the Government will retain, as we discussed in relation to the previous group of amendments, the decision will be made by Ministers of the Crown, which the amendments would replace with ``The Secretary of State''.
<P>
We had a lot of fun debating this on the Floor of the House, and accusing one another of being useless, but, by and large, I am the first to acknowledge that the Ministers in Committee have displayed the necessary competence required to do the job, and I am sure that they will carry out their duties satisfactorily.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
These are serious matters, possibly involving huge sums of money. Three of the functional bodies, Transport for London, the London Development Agency and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, come within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and the police come under the responsibility of the Home Secretary. The present regime for local government&#151;[Interruption.] We are having a musical accompaniment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I tactfully ignored the first interruption, but I must request that we do not have any further such interruptions. If the cause of the interruption can be removed, the Committee would wish that it were.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I prefer vibrations myself.
<P>
At present, in local government, power is exercised by the Secretary of State, and we should be grateful if either Minister would explain why the status of those who can make these decisions is being lowered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I pass quickly over the deep affront that the hon. Member for Croydon, South has caused to my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London and myself by seeking to remove the very modest powers that we are given by the proposed legislation. I shall, however, try to persuade him that it is appropriate that the powers should rest in any Minister of the Crown rather than being restricted to either a Secretary of State or, in the case of amendment No. 339, simply to the Home Secretary.
<P>
The amendments would place unnecessary restrictions on the issue of additional credit approvals. These are the credit approvals that the Bill provides may be issued at any time, for example, to deal with an urgent capital requirement of the GLA or one of the constituent bodies. In that respect, they correspond to the supplementary credit approvals which may be issued by Ministers to other authorities. But, like the aggregate credit approval, the additional credit approval may be issued for specified authorities or for unspecified authoritis for allocation by the mayor.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 338 and 340 provide that these credit approvals could be issued only by the Secretary of State and not by Ministers. However, that would be inconsistent with the arrangements applying to other authorities, and there seems to be no particular reason why a restriction should apply to the Greater London authority, but not to any other local authority. It is important that the Government should have the same degree of flexibility in the issue of credit approvals for the new London authorities as it has for all other credit approvals.
<P>
Amendment No. 339 would allow an additional credit approval for the police authority to be issued only by the Home Secretary. In practice, of course, that is what happens at present in relation to credit approvals for existing police authorities, and it is not desirable to modify the capital finance system in that respect for its application to the new London authorities. In the first place, it is not necessary because, as a matter of administration, the Home Office is the Government Department responsible for the police. But, also, no credit approvals are required to be given by a specified Minister, and there can be no justification for introducing a measure like this for policing in London and not for any other local government functions. Therefore, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not sure whether I fully understand that answer. Nevertheless, I do not wish to continue the perceived insult to the Minister, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4) In the case of a category B credit approval issued in respect of expenditure which is treated as expenditure for capital purposes of a relevant authority by virtue only of directions under section 40(6) of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, the approval must specify an amortisation period and the maximum amortisation period which may be specified shall be seven years.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We heard earlier that London First wisely circulated its notice not only to the Liberal party but to the Government. The Government had an answer ready then, so I hope that they have one ready now. The amendment is supported by the Association of London Government, in which the Minister has placed a fair degree of reliance&#151;I am thinking of the famous letter of sometime in December.
<P>
The clause will give the Secretary of State a fair amount of discretion over amortisation periods on items that he or she has defined as capital expenditure. Under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, the Secretary of State was given the power to define various items as capital expenditure that would not normally be considered as such. However, that power was tempered by the requirement to specify an amortisation period of no more than seven years. That requirement was stripped away under the Local Government Finance (Supplementary Approvals) Act 1997. The result is that increased&#151;some might say excessive&#151;discretion has been given to the Secretary of State and, possibly, consequently to other Ministers. The Government's proposal will extend that approach into the new structure of London government.
<P>
The clause will mean that the Secretary of State can define something as capital expenditure and determine whether or not an amortisation period is required and, if so, its length. That leaves open the possibility of abuse. Pet projects might be given favourable amortisation periods, with damaging effects on the long-term financial health of the authority and, therefore, on the required level of the GLA precept. The amendment would apply the original provisions of the 1989 Act to the GLA, so protecting the council tax payers of London.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am delighted to have the opportunity to explain the detailed provisions of clause 100 to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, especially as I had a similar pleasure of explaining it to his colleagues 18 months ago in debates on the Local Government Finance (Supplementary Credit Approvals) Act 1997. I understand that that proposal caused a certain amount of difficulty, but I hope that, on this occasion, I can make it absolutely clear why what we are doing is right and appropriate.
<P>
Clause 100(4) deals with credit approvals issued in very special circumstances. They are intended to permit borrowing for revenue purposes. Credit approvals may be used in connection with capital expenditure only. So the Secretary of State will issue in parallel a capitalisation direction, allowing the review expenditure to be treated as capital. Such assistance is given only in exceptional circumstances to authorities facing especially serious revenue problems. Those problems are generally to do with local government reorganisation, unexpected or large redundancy obligations or similar measures, but, of course, they can be found in other circumstances.
<P>
The clause will allow the Secretary of State to specify in such a credit approval an amortisation period&#151;the time during which the body using the approval must set aside annual amounts out of revenue sufficient to repay any borrowing undertaken on the strength of the approval.
<P>
The amendment would require an amortisation period of no more than seven years to be specified in all such cases. I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman suggests that period; his colleagues suggested exactly the same one 18 months ago. That rule applied to other local authorities until 1997. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we repealed it in the Local Government Finance (Supplementary Credit Approvals) Act 1997.
<P>
We considered that the seven-year requirement was too stringent. If, for example, the credit approval was for &#163;700,000, the authority would have to set aside &#163;100,000 from its revenue resources in each of the subsequent seven years. As I said, we would only issue such a credit approval to an authority facing severe revenue pressures. It would be unreasonable to expect the authority to start making that level of revenue provision right away.
<P>
We thought it better to allow each case to be treated on its merits. If no amortisation period is specified, the authority is still required by other rules in the system to make provision out of revenue at the rate of at least 4 per cent. of the net outstanding debt to be set aside annually. That, of course, is when no specific provision is made. The Secretary of State may make provision if he feels that it is appropriate to do so.
<P>
It is a sensible technical measure that is designed to help local authorities facing exceptional revenue pressures. It allows a degree of flexibility to set an amortisation period that will enable them to deal with the problem, rather than compounds the problem by an over-rigid rule, such as applied previously, requiring repayment over a limited period of seven years.
<P>
That is the logic for it, and why we rejected the Opposition amendment 18 months ago. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment, if the hon. Member for Croydon, South decides to press it. Preferably, I hope that he will recognise the common sense of what we are saying and will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I take the Minister's point, but I wonder whether I can press him on another matter. If the Secretary of State exercises his discretion or his power, will be publish his reasons for doing so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I have already made it clear, the measure will apply only in exceptional circumstances. When the Secretary of State determines the amortisation period, the authority will be informed of the reasons for it. If no specific provision is made by the Secretary of State, the extant rules of the capital finance system will apply and the authority will know that it has to meet at least 4 per cent. of the outstanding debt each year as part of its repayment. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's question had been answered. A reason will be given if a specific date is provided, and if no specific date is provided, the basic rule of at least 4 per cent. per annum will apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The differences between the parties has become clear from our exchanges, but I shall not press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provided that no such payment may be directed to be made by a body other than after that body's debts have been fully repaid.''.<P>

<P>
You will note, Mr. O'Hara, that I have tabled amendments Nos. 361 and 362 to clause 104. I imagined that they would be grouped together, but you obviously felt that they merited separate discussion. For the convenience of the Committee, I shall touch on the points in the subsequent amendments, thereby perhaps saving a later debate.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that receipts of the functional bodies are used to settle outstanding debt before being directed to other purposes, and to enable the assembly to scrutinise the mayor's proposals to shift capital receipts from functional bodies and to make grants for both capital and current spending. The Government's proposals in clause 103 give a great deal of discretion to shift capital receipts from the functional bodies to fund the capital spending of the other bodies. Clause 104 refers to the authority paying grants for capital spending, and clause 105 refers to grants for current spending.
<P>
A degree of flexibility is desirable&#151;I am sure that everybody in the Committee agrees with that&#151;but these proposals could be open to abuse. The mayor could raid the capital receipts of one body for favoured projects elsewhere. Such expenditure could be incurred without adequate scrutiny. The mayor would be able to make grants for current spending and reduce the incentives to maintain a reasonable grip on spending.
<P>
Rather than giving yet more powers to the Secretary of State, the amendments would improve scrutiny of the assembly. It would be dangerous if the assembly were the arbiter of the mayor's activities, as the Liberal Democrats want. The Minister will have to justify those powers.
<P>
The mayor will have some flexibility&#151;notably the 10 per cent. fluctuation range for transfers of capital receipts&#151;but he will have to make his intentions clear to the assembly during the planning process. There is also a financial safeguard so that no functional body will find its capital receipts raided before its debts are repaid. The mayor will behave sensibly and with integrity, although there is always the possibility of a maverick mayor putting his fingers in the till. The amendments should therefore be considered seriously.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I wonder whether the amendment brings additional clarity to clause 103(1), to which I award the university of Greenwich prize for gobbledegook. Its language is not very felicitous&#151;there is a superfluity of bodies lying around the place. I am not clear whether the reference is to parts as fractions or precentages. The proposal is over-specified and I am tempted to report it to the Plan English Campaign. Perhaps the Minister will make it clearer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): Our view is that the amendment would have unfortunate consequences. It would further restrict the ability of the Greater London authority to be flexible. Yet again, an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South seeks to restrict the GLA operating for the benefit of Londoners, yet he and his hon. Friends present themselves as wanting to give the GLA greater flexibility so that it is clear who is accountable to the people of London.
<P>
In respect of component budgets for the revenue side of the GLA, we argued earlier for flexibility between the various functional bodies and to be able to consider the budget in the round. In the context of producing the capital plan, and considering the resources available to the authority, the amendment would deny the mayor the flexibility needed to do his or her best to provide good-quality services efficiently and effectively and to ensure that capital investment is targeted where it is most needed, which does not happen under the grant system, as the Secretary of State, whomsoever he may be, is not a perfect being. A mayor who is democratically accountable to Londoners should have the flexibility to take decisions about different parts of the capital programme. We reject the amendment because it makes the clause even more inflexible than it is already.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> As the hon. Member for Croydon, South has formally introduced the three amendments perhaps it would assist the Committee if I underlined the fact that the assembly and the mayor, have a strategic role to play. Therefore, the offices of the functional bodies within and in delivering those strategies are extremely important.
<P>
As I am sure all hon. Members know, clause 103 gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations under which the mayor would be allowed to redistribute the capital receipts of the functional bodies. I stress how important that is as a reserve power. There are no immediate plans to make such regulations and there may never be a need for them. 
<P>
Clauses 104 and 105 enable the bodies to redistribute resources between themselves by voluntary agreement, subject to the mayor's consent. If these arrangements are used responsibly it may never be necessary to invoke the power in clause 103. But clause 103 ensures that the mayor can be empowered, if necessary, to secure an efficient distribution of capital resources, thus enhancing his or her ability to decide priorities and improve efficiency and value for money for the GLA and the functional bodies as a whole.
<P>
Clause 103 enables us, in making such regulations, to impose a wide range of safeguards, in particular on the maximum percentage of receipts that a body can be required to give up and on arrangements for notifying bodies of the mayor's decision to use that power. A body giving up capital receipts on one occasion would sooner or later benefit from a redistribution of receipts depending on the relative needs of the functional bodies for capital resources.
<P>
Each body's capital receipts will remain ring-fenced for its own use until regulations, if any, are made. If this power was conferred on the mayor it would not allow him or her to take away from the functional body capital receipts derived from particular disposals of assets.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 359 is unclear. It would mean that a body could be required to give receipts for redistribution by the mayor only if it was free from debt, but nothing would be done to require or encourage the body to take any steps to discharge its debt. In any event, debt redemption is not always the most prudent way of using capital receipts. We have recently revoked the rule that authorities must set aside part of their non-housing receipts for debt redemption. The capital finance system has other mechanisms for ensuring that authorities make regular provision out of revenue for debt redemption. The amendment would make it difficult for the power in clause 103 to be exercised sensibly and effectively. Indeed, it would probably make it unworkable.
<P>
I turn now to amendments Nos. 361 and 362. The powers of the new London authorities to pay capital and revenue grant to each other are exercisable at any time during the financial year. These amendments, in requiring all such payments to be determined before the start of the financial year, would remove the discretion and financial flexibility&#151;the point made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)&#151;that the powers are intended to confer.
<P>
One of the main benefits of the grant-making powers in clauses 104 and 105 will be that surplus capital resources or revenue resources of one functional body do not have to lie idle if they can be used by the GLA or any of the other functional bodies. One body might have surplus capital receipts but be in urgent need of revenue expenditure. A second body might have surplus revenue resources that it planned to use for capital spending. Using these powers, the bodies could agree to swap their resources, subject always, of course, to the mayor's consent. In essence, the amendments would seriously undermine the value of the powers that the functional bodies will hold and those of the mayor. In the light of that I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
Others wiser than myself have pointed out a possible defect in the amendment. To use the police to reinforce enforcement of the charging regime requires negotiation, a condition that Westminster city council discovered when it recently embarked on its pilot roadside random testing of vehicles for pollution. If the GLA started with a simple form of area licensing, such as a windscreen sticker, part of the enforcement would involve stopping vehicles for spot checks, which only the police can do. London First will, I think, be publishing a report on the practical application of road pricing in time for the main Committee discussion on clause 200.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> With customary understatement, my hon. Friend has introduced an amendment of considerable importance&#151;although whether this is the appropriate point at which to do so is more debatable. Is not the import of the amendment crucial for Londoners? It would ensure that revenues derived from parking charges that are levied on employers and from charges on motorists who travel into work will ``normally'' be retained by Transport for London. I am not convinced that parking charges or charges on motorists per se constitute good policy&#151;we can debate that later. However, the use of ``normally'' could induce the circumvention of what should be a total and complete requirement. We know that the Government will impose such a requirement on the GLA for the first 10 years, if Parliament agrees to the charges, but those charges should go in perpetuity towards the betterment of transport in London, and they should therefore go to Transport for London.
<P>
As is sometimes the case, my right hon. Friend is too magnanimous. I was brought up in the hard school of West Yorkshire politics, and I like things to be battened down tightly. I should not have included the first few words in the amendment&#151;it should state that Transport for London ``must'' retain any income.
<P>
Mt right hon. Friend has done the Committee a great service by bringing the issue to the Committee's attention at this stage, and I am sure that we will have an opportunity to return to it again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Like the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), I congratulate the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) on moving this incredibly important amendment.
<P>
At a rather late hour on Tuesday evening, I moved an amendment that would have had a similar effect&#151;it would have ensured that any new money raised from congestion charges and from non-residential parking levies goes towards transport investment. It would have ensured also that the transport grant, which will constitute part of the funds that are invested in London's public transport system, will be maintained in real terms and not cut back when the congestion charges revenues start flowing.
<P>
Amendment No. 382 would ensure that the authority will not transfer between the different functional bodies any extra funds that could be said to be new charges rather than substitutions.
<P>
On Tuesday night, the Minister gave a welcome response to my amendment. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We gave made it clear that the revenues from new charges will be additional revenue for transport spending in London.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 9 February 1999; c. 434.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the hon. Lady did not give much detail, although it is important to nail down that claim in the way that the amendment would do. We agree with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that perhaps ``normally'' should not appear in the amendment. We must ensure that Londoners know that the new funds will be entirely ring-fenced for the purposes of improving London's transport system.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Concern about this matter is clearly still shared by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood and&#151;despite my response to his amendment on Tuesday night&#151;the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I suspect that that demonstrates yet again what I underlined at our previous sitting, namely, that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton suffers from short-term memory loss.
<P>
Let me deal with the concerns that have been expressed in their different ways about the revenues raised via congestion charging and the private non-residential parking levy. We are looking at amendments to schedules 13 and 14 to put our commitment to the intention of charging revenues beyond question. We did, however, make it clear on Second Reading that 100 per cent. of the net revenues from net charges would be ring-fenced and spent on transport in London.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood raised the point that such revenues should in perpetuity be spent on transport in London. As I am sure he will remember, we have already said that the system will be reviewed in 10 years. I am encouraged by his endorsement of the Government's proposals for improving transport in London via an integrated transport system, with a dedicated income stream from congestion charging, and so on. However, we are looking to this revenue stream to improve transport for London&#151;to transform transport in London. Surely it would not be the best use of public moneys to preclude a mayor and assembly, decades down the road, from using such money in other ways, when transport had been improved beyond all recognition, and to say that the money must gold-plate something that is doing extremely well in solid silver.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I do not think that in our wildest dreams we imagine that the Northern line or, more particularly, the Metropolitan, Central and Piccadilly lines, along which my hard-pressed constituents have to travel, will ever be gold plated. That is especially true, given that, according to the Financial Times yesterday, the partial sale of the tube faces delays of up to 18 months.
<P>
The timetable of the public-private partnership which the Secretary of State is trying to put to industry, has been knocked askew by hard reality. Londoners will want to know that, rather than relying on the vagaries of the Treasury or the investment decisions of the private sector, if they have to have these god-forsaken charges imposed on them, they might as well go on the betterment of transport, for ever and aye.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I had occasion to point out to the hon. Member for Croydon, South that he really should not believe everything he reads in the papers, and I say it now to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. There is no delay with the public-private partnership.
<P>
I understand the concerns of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood about the Northern line, which runs through my constituency. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would have welcomed the announcement by London Underground that the City branch is about to have very necessary repairs to its track. That will improve journey times and ensure that the new trains will ride infinitely more smoothly and quietly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister says that we should not believe everything that we read in the newspapers. Can she therefore confirm that the PPP will be in place on the original target date of May next year?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson :</B> I can say to the hon. Gentleman, as I have had occasion to say before, that we and my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister have made it abundantly clear that we will not be tied to delivering a final date for the PPP because that does not produce best value for the public.
<P>
The story which has been referred to is about one of the first stages of the PPP being delayed. I must tell members of the Committee that it is inaccurate. It is not correct. But we will most certainly not be taking the approach that the previous Administration took with regard to rail privatisation. That process had to be completed by a certain date, and we are living with the realities of that. The point of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood is unfortunate, given that today's Office of Passenger Rail Frachising report shows that there has been no marked improvement as far as the privatised rail service is concerned.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Minister is clarifying some very important facts, and the travelling public in London will be most interested. The points are extremely germane to the amendment under discussion. Can the hon. Lady therefore make it absolutely clear that, notwithstanding the report in yesterday's Financial Times sufficient finance will be available for the modernisation of London Transport in the financial year 2000-2001? That is the year in which the Treasury subsidy is due to be withdrawn from the underground. It looks to Londoners as if there will be a black hole.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman, who always takes his constituents' interests seriously, should argue that. He has ignored the fact that the Labour Government, in marked contrast to his own, have managed to find &#163;365 million. That has ensured that the underground has &#163;1 billion to enable it to begin to tackle the ghastly backlog of line maintenance that results directly from the failure for more than a decade of the hon. Gentleman's Government adequately to fund the underground.
<P>
Our public-private partnership is not being delayed, despite what the newspapers say. It will bring into the underground system the billions of pounds necessary to ensure that the process can be continued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have no trouble with the Minister being proud that the Government will spend &#163;1 billion on London Underground during two years, which is &#163;500 million pounds a year. She went on to say, however, that that was in stark contrast with the poor record of the previous Government. During the last 10 years of the previous Government's time in office, they spent &#163;7 billion on London Underground. That is &#163;700 million a year, some 40 per cent. more than the present Government are spending.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman should hang his head in shame when he attempts to rewrite his Government's record on London Underground. He knows perfectly well that the money to which he referred was targeted mainly towards the Jubilee line extension. He well knows that from 1979 to 1997, his Government slashed core funding for London Underground by 15 per cent. As I said, one of the Government's first actions on coming to office was to find &#163;365 million to ensure that &#163;1 billion was available for London Underground to spend during two financial years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister gives the impression that I am plucking figures out of thin air. I am quoting London Underground's own figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): Ten years out of date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> They are the only figures available. If the hon. Gentleman cares to read the report of the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee, he will see that they go back from 1997 to 1987. Those are the figures that I currently have to work on. They show that funding under the previous Government was dramatically superior to that under the present Government.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I have not accused the hon. Gentleman of plucking figures out of the air. He is tossing them around like a juggler, however, in the hope that swiftness of the hand can deceive the eye. It deceives neither the eye nor the ear. Londoners are living every single day with the failures of his Administration to tackle the real necessities of improving and modernising the underground. The first thing that we did on coming into office was to find the funds necessary to ensure that requisite money was available for two financial years; that is &#163;500 million a year, which is all that the underground can spend in any one year on improvements and maintenance while keeping the system running.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster mentioned enforcement, which is a vital part of traffic management in London. He was trying to find out whether such activities could be a justifiable target for revenues raised by congestion charges. Traffic management involves ensuring that bus priority networks are kept clear and that the journey times of London buses improve. If those forms of management are part of the mayor's transport strategy and part of a borough's integrated transport plan, they will be relevant calls on the revenues raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to catch the Minister before she finishes to ask about the date for completion of the public-private partnership. If she is generous, she will interpret my remarks as supportive. I hope that she will remember that in the Liberal Democrats' view, it would be in everybody's interest if no final agreement were made by the Government until after the GLA is in existence, and that the mayor and the assembly can participate in the final stages.
<P>
Earlier today, the Minister for London and Construction made the welcome announcement that the GLA would come into existence half-way through next year. Given that, many people would be reassured if the Government were able to say, ``Of course we cannot promise that the deal will be there by May next year; indeed, we are happy to say that it will not be completed until the end of next year.'' That would mean that the final agreement on PPP would involve a far more open process.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I trust that I am always generous. In some instances, I am almost over-generous with regard to the ideas that are presented to the Committee by the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is arguing the obverse of the policy that was adopted by the previous Administration. Driven by political ideology, that policy was artificially to meet a date regardless of whether that was in the public interest. We are still living with the realities of that&#151;the gross waste of public assets that resulted from their having been sold for a fraction of their real worth. The Government are not going down the path of selling off anything that is in the public sector. We are entering into a public-private partnership&#151;that is, negotiating competitive deals with the private sector. Setting an artificially distant date is as much against the public interest as setting an over-pressured immediate date. One should not believe what one reads in the newspapers. We are being driven not by the artifices of time but by the best interests of the public.
<P>
In the light of that, I urge the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton for their kind words about my amendment. However, I must disappoint the latter by saying that the amendment did not derive, in any degree, from his earlier, no doubt seminal, thinking.
<P>
The Minister seemed to be troubled by the fact that Opposition Members are still pressing the Government about the uses to which these funds are to be put. She should allow for the anxieties that were provoked by the Government's original posture on the matter, which gave rise to the debate outside the Committee, to which the Government have in turn responded. I share the enthusiasm of those who hunted the Snark in the company of the Bellman, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``What I tell you three times is true.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The more often that the Minister says something, the more confident we are that we shall be able to tie her down.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I was not aware of the phrase, ``If you say it three times it has to be true.'' However, it was certainly the case in my previous work experience that unless you said something three times nobody understood what you were saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> That was very graciously done. I do not claim that anyone other than the Bellman takes the view that I described, but his companions in ``The Hunting of the Snark'' found it reassuring.
<P>
The Minister referred to enforcement. I used the word ``normally'' in my amendment to protect myself from the charge that I had forgotten, or ignored, where the costs of enforcement would lie. As the Minister has assured me that the word ``normally'' is unnecessary and that the charges fall naturally within the process, I am able to jettison it and thus win the approval of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood.
<P>
We have had a good run around this course, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amdendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 105 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 106</center></H4>
<H4><center>Form and contents of capital spending plan</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 363, in page 56, line 45, leave out `minimum' and insert `estimated'.
<P>
I am probing. I want to draw the Committee's attention to the mayor's capital spending plan. Subsection (4)(a) prescribes that in section B of this capital spending plan the mayor should set out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the minimum amount of grant which the Mayor has decided that the Authority is to pay to the body''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the functional body&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``under section 104''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the clause prescribes a minimum it does not mention a maximum, which means that it is not subject to the assembly's scrutiny. As the Minister well knows, at this point the assembly has some relevance to the mayor's activities.
<P>
The amendment proposes to replace the word ``minimum'' with the word ``estimated'', which is no more perfect, but at least it would allow the assembly an idea of what the final figure in the capital spending plan is believed to be.
<P>
<B>Mr Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South said that he was probing. That made me ponder the origin of the word ``reprobate'', which probably has a similar source. I do not accuse the hon. Gentleman of being a reprobate, but I shall throw his probe straight back at him.
<P>
Section B of the capital spending plan sets out the capital resources which the functional bodies can count on receiving so that they can plan their capital programmes. It is important, therefore, that they should know the minimum level that they can expect. The plan is, of course, being prepared before the mayor will necessarily be able to confirm the precise sum. The provision is therefore designed to be helpful and to enable the bodies to plan ahead in a positive way.
<P>
The amendment would substitute the word ``estimated'' for the word ``minimum'', which could leave the mayor in an extremely difficult position if it subsequently transpired as the budget developed that he was not in a position to deliver the figure that he had estimated. We therefore think it right for the focus to remain, as in the Bill, on the provision of a minimum figure. If the mayor is able to give further grants during the financial year as resources become available, that would be welcome to the bodies concerned. The key point, however, is that during the planning process they should know what the minimum amount will be. That is why the clause is so drafted. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I take the Minister's point. Under the circumstances, would he accept an amendment which required a minimum and an estimated maximum?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not think that there is any particular merit in an estimated maximum. As I stressed to the hon. Gentleman, the point is that the bodies should be able to plan in the knowledge that they will certainly get the minimum figure. Any additional money would be a bonus, which I am sure they would welcome. It would, however, be odd to set an estimated maximum before the mayor is in a position to know what resources will become available and therefore what he can set.
<P>
In case the hon. Gentleman is worried about a possible lack of clarity or accountability, I stress that if additional resources became available and the mayor was able to offer them, it would be reported in the mayor's monthly report to the assembly, so there would be a full opportunity for the matter to be scrutinised. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that and will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I detect a Freudian subplot. The Minister automatically assumes that the assembly will want to see an increase in expenditure. That may be the case for the Labour party and is certainly the case for the Liberal party, but it is not necessarily the case for the Conservative party. The Minister said that increased expenditure would be a bonus, but that is not necessarily, so.
<P>
Nevertheless, I have probed the issue enough. Under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 366, in page 57, line 28, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7) Section E of a capital spending plan made for any financial year (``the relevant financial year'') other than the first two financial years following the commencement of the Authority shall consist of&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) a statement of (i) the amount of the body's total capital spending in the preceding financial year and (ii) the total amount of expenditure which the Mayor had expected the body to incur in the capital spending plan for the previous year;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) where, in subsection (7)(a) above, the amount in (i) exceeds the amount in (ii), statement of the reasons for this and a proposal for reducing the capital spending plan for the relevant financial year by the amount of the excess.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 366 is to guard against systematic overspending on capital items by publishing a comparison of each functional body's outturn and planned capital spending in each of the previous two financial years. The amendment maintains the process of introducing greater visibility into the authority's spending. It reinforces the disclosure requirements that were proposed in earlier amendments.
<P>
To guard against systematic overspending, the amendment requires the publication of a comparison of the capital spending outturn and the planned level of spending for the same period. Where it reveals an overspend in relation to the plan, the body must give reasons and make a proposal to claw back the amount that was overspent. That would protect the people of London from the profligacy and waste that are one of the dangers of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is obsessed with profligacy and waste. He completely misinterpreted the purpose of the arrangements that the Government put in place for the capital programme that we debated under the previous group of amendments. Under those arrangements, any body that is waiting to know what it has to spend will want to know the minimum amount and might welcome a little additional flexibility. That is not profligacy or waste, but good planning.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman seeks to create a bureaucractic nightmare in the form of a fifth section in the capital programme. He wants to impose an unduly rigorous framework to claw back money that might have been overspent. He does not recognise the proper framework that the Government have put in place to encourage sensible and prudent spending and to provide the flexibility for resources to be reallocated where necessary.
<P>
The mayor will draw up the capital spending plan in consultation with the functional bodies for the benefit of those bodies and of the GLA as a whole. Clearly, it is important that each of those bodies should stick to its plan for incurring capital expenditure. The role of the plan is not, however, to put the new bodies in a straitjacket regarding their capital spending. A functional body's actual spending and the way in which it is met out of the credit and grants that are made available have to be decided by the body concerned. It is, after all, responsible for the discharge of its functions and has to respond during the financial year to changes of circumstance. It might, for example, be in a position to spend more than expected because it unexpectedly obtains a large capital receipt.
<P>
Accordingly, clause 108 is intended to confer on the mayor a flexible discretion, for the purpose of preparing the capital spending plan, to take account of such factors as appear appropriate to him or her. That includes the extent to which capital spending by a functional body departs from the mayor's expectation. The significance of that factor for the current plan is, however, entirely a matter for the mayor, and will depend on all the circumstances and on the weight that the mayor attaches to them. That will involve careful consideration of the facts and consultation with all those involved. The mayor needs the freedom to exercise discretion responsibly, and it would be wrong to prescribe in legislation the factors that he or she is to take account of in preparing the capital spending plan.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's proposal is unnecessary, unduly bureaucratic and restrictive. I urge him to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I make no apology for being concerned about profligacy and waste&#151;too little attention is paid to them at times. Again, I am not entirely satisfied with the Minister's response. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Minister tell us about the Government's thinking on capital programmes and the information to be made available to local authorities&#151;in particular, to the GLA&#151;about the Government's intentions for more than one year's capital grants and borrowing permissions? For the purpose of revenue support grant and the revenue funding of local authorities, the Government have introduced a three-year planning basis. That has been not entirely but generally welcomed within local government as giving a greater degree of certainty to planning of revenue services, and so on.
<P>
The Government could use this opportunity to implement a similar regime for capital expenditure. Effective capital expenditure requires longer planning horizons. An annual programme, in which what grants will be available is known only for one year ahead, makes effective use of resources much more difficult in many cases. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that issue, which is of interest not just to the GLA but to local government in general.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B>
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South is right to be concerned about waste and profligacy. After all, his Government, with their privatisation programmes, demonstrated just how wasteful and profligate they were, and cost the taxpayer a fortune. Perhaps Conservative Members are seeking to guard Londoners against their profligacy, rather than anyone else's.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made a fair point about the Conservatives' obsession with profligacy and waste in view of their own abominable record. It is against that background that we want a sensible, prudent framework for capital spending, allowing a degree of certainty.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam generously acknowledged the Government's progress towards a three-year framework to help bodies to plan ahead more purposefully than was possible under the previous annual regime. He will know that in our local government White Paper we announced a wider review of the overall capital spending framework. Of course, I cannot anticipate the outcome of that review&#151;it will be thorough and serious, and the issues involved will be fully and properly researched. It would be wrong for us to seek to introduce measures that anticipated the review's conclusions. So I cannot respond to the hon. Gentleman's request for such a move at this stage, but he will know that the Government are open-minded. We have been prepared to consider new ways of doing things, and we do not have the hide-bound approach that the Conservative party displayed when in power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The review process is welcome and I accept it. The Government have elsewhere produced three-year plans. If we are to have a four-year administration, as is intended for the GLA&#151;both mayor and assembly&#151;the logical thing would be to have a four-year spending envelope. Obviously, a new administration must inherit a budget for its first year, but it would then run from the beginning of year two to the beginning of the first year of the next administration. That might be a logical extension of the three-year envelope that the Government are now considering for other capital expenditure programmes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hear the hon. Gentleman's point, but we cannot set in place a capital framework for the whole country on the basis of what might be appropriate for the Greater London authority. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's point will be considered during the review.
<P>
The clause sets in place appropriate provisions for the capital spending plans of the Greater London authority in each financial year, and defines the form and content of the plan. I urge that it should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> With your permission, Mr. O'Hara, I should like to do what I did earlier this afternoon. Amendments Nos. 367 and 368 have been grouped together. When I tabled the amendments, I had hoped that amendment No. 369 would be grouped with them. Therefore, I should like to speak to the three amendments together.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It can be moved formally later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to secure democratic approval of the mayor's capital spending plan and to improve on its openness.
<P>
The first two amendments propose that the draft and the final version of the capital spending plan should be circulated to the boroughs and the common council of the City of London, along with the assembly and the functional bodies specified in the Bill. As the boroughs will be affected by the capital spending plan, they could have a significant input into it. Throughout the Committee stage, our premise has been that the boroughs should be involved and consulted as much as possible. Our request to involve the boroughs in the consultation process is the least that the Committee should agree to. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must request that the offending object be removed from the Committee Room.
<P>
<B>Siobhain McDonagh </B>(Mitcham and Morden): Me or the telephone?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are pressed for time and the noise is interrupting the business of the Committee. I ask members of the Committee to refrain from causing such unnecessary interruptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Amendment No. 369 would improve the openness of the capital spending plan and would bring it more into line with local government standards of openness. For example, section 14 of the Audit Commission Act 1998 makes it clear that, for the period in which a local authority's finances are under audit, there is a right to make copies.
<P>
The Bill currently refers to a right of inspection, but there is no reference to the right to make copies. That could give scope for abuse and concealment, especially with a complex document such as the capital spending plan where a careful examination may be needed to obtain a full picture of what is happening. Members of the public should be able to examine the plan properly and copy rights would be essential to that proposal. I am sure that the Minister will recognise that the amendment would increase the openness and accountability of which he has spoken so fondly in recent weeks. Even if he cannot accept the detail of the amendment, I am sure that he will recognise the principle behind it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): I understand my hon. Friend's motives in tabling the amendments. However, I confess to a twinge of anxiety about the cost implications of the suggestion. His amendments refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``each of the London Borough Councils''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know that there are many borough councils and that therefore a cost and administrative burden must be implied in even the modest request in the amendments. I wonder whether there are ways of tackling the problem other than the one that he suggests.
<P>
I applaud the implication of involvement by the boroughs in what the authority will do. When we come to debate that matter, we shall need to investigate in depth the potential for at worst conflict and at best co-operation between the boroughs and the authority and, within the authority, between the mayor and the assembly. I recognise that that debate will be for another occasion. However, what my hon. Friend said relates to that question.
<P>
I would not be surprised if the Minister's reply refers to cost. He said not long ago that he and his colleagues had had a sudden conversion to antipathy to profligacy and waste. That is despite the fact that most Labour Members spent most of their political lives worshipping at the altar of profligacy and waste. I welcome that conversion and hope that the Minister will shortly confirm it.
<P>
I am even more worried by amendment No. 369, which seems innocuous and reads attractively. I would expect that of any amendment tabled by my hon. Friend. However, it would provide that members of the public would be entitled to copies of&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have a slight procedural difficulty. I understand that the mover of the amendment referred to amendment No. 369 which I expect him to move formally later. I shall invite debate on it then and ask members of the Committee not to speak to it now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Hara, and conclude my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South for two important amendments. They highlight the difference in emphasis between the Conservatives and other parties with regard to the proposed authority. We wish the governance of London to be one of partnership between the boroughs and the authority.
<P>
In no area of policy would partnership be more important than that of capital spending. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South emphasised, many capital projects could impinge significantly and in a strategic way on the plans of individual borough councils. At the very least, boroughs should be informed of projects in advance so that their input can materially alter or influence proposals that the mayor seeks to put to the assembly.
<P>
Of the two amendments, amendment No. 367 is the more important. It would give time for the boroughs' representations to be considered by the authority and to be reflected in the definitive plans of the mayoralty, which have to be brought before the authority by 28 February. There is time between 15 February and 28 February for second thoughts to occur.
<P>
It needs to be stressed again how important it is that there be partnership not just with the boroughs but with the common council of the City of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am slightly surprised that my hon. Friend of all people should fall into that seductive use of the word partnership. I counsel him against being carried along too far, or at all, with the way in which we have been invited to introduce a new meaning of the word into the language. Does my hon. Friend not think that the very establishment of the authority will probably lead more to conflict between the authority and the boroughs than to ``partnership''? That will be true of later aspects of the Bill, especially those that deal with planning. Will he be careful not to use the word partnership too readily in that context?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> We should all heed that word of caution and I most certainly shall.
<P>
The potential for conflict between the authority and the boroughs is very great, but it would be substantially diminished if the boroughs saw the authority's capital spending plans in advance so that they could seek to adapt them. Partnership might not be an appropriate word and complementarity might be better. The Corporation of London will feel particularly sensitive. There may be jockeying of position for prestige and for the ear of the Government by the mayor of Greater London and the Mayor of the City of London.
<P>
Capital spending comes from limited resources and if the grant resources provided by central Government to the authority are high, it is likely that grant resources to the boroughs will be consequentially lower than might otherwise have been expected. It will be a sensitive matter and one where there is potential for conflict, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) reminded us. It seems that the Liberal Democrats, as usual, have missed the boat inasmuch as their amendment No. 65&#151;
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> We have not got there yet.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 65 has not been called.
<P>
There are numerous journals and newspapers in the Committee and I remind hon. Members that they should be reading them only if they are researching speeches to be made in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Yes, indeed, Mr. O'Hara, local government journals only are permitted&#151;[Interruption.] Is that the Asda catalogue? No, that is the wrong side of the Committee.
<P>
The power to influence capital spending before it is cast in stone is important, so I emphasise amendment No. 367 rather than amendment No. 369.
<P>
<B>Ms Linda Perham </B>(Ilford, North): If the amendment were to be accepted, I wonder about the time scale. Comments would be invited within 21 days. Many of us have been on local councils, and there are four former mayors of London boroughs on the Government Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> A chain gang.
<P>
<B>Ms Perham:</B> Indeed.
<P>
Given committee cycles and the presumption that councils would want to ensure that they received substantive comments on the document, I wonder whether all 32 borough councils plus the City of London would be able to submit their comments within 21 days.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall be brief. I had a most interesting experience listening to the interchanges between Conservative Members, who seemed to be not entirely of one view on the amendment. We are more in accord with the opinion of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst in that the amendment is unnecessary and likely to be an unduly expensive requirement.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Ms Perham) rightly highlighted the difficulty of meeting the time scale.
<P>
The other crucial point is that the capital spending plans cover the Greater London authority, not the borough councils. They will not affect the borough councils' capital spending, so there is no overriding obligation to ensure that the borough councils should be notified in advance of the capital spending proposals.
<P>
I urge the hon. Member for Croydon, South, not least to keep his right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) on board, to withdraw the amendment. Otherwise, I urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am astonished by the Minister's response. To say that the boroughs will not be affected by the capital spending plans of the authority is a lawyer's answer: it is accurate but absolutely useless. The boroughs do not feature in the authority's spending plans, but it is incorrect to say that they have no interest or involvement in them. The amendment, which would ensure that the boroughs are informed about the proposals, is perfectly sensible and pragmatic.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My hon. Friend has today probably received, as I have, the latest map showing the roads for which the GLA will be responsible. By looking at that map alone, he will realise the extent to which the likely activities of the GLA will, as the transport authority, by definition extend to every London borough. That is only one example, picked at random, but my hon. Friend will surely agree that it proves beyond all doubt that capital items relating to, in this instance, roads, are bound to impact on the boroughs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My right hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The network of roads in the London boroughs is probably the classic example. The comment of the Minister for London and Construction that the matter is not one that concerns the London boroughs is extraordinary.
<P>
There is an important point of principle. We believe that the London boroughs' rights and interests should be protected. It is the Conservative party that will stand up and fight the Government's cavalier approach towards and disregard for the London boroughs, and we have no intention of withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall briefly correct the hon. Member for Croydon, South. I did not say that the matter is irrelevant to the London boroughs, but that the capital spending plan is the GLA's spending plan. My point was that, unlike its revenue budget, which will have to be raised, in part, through a precept on the boroughs, there will be no immediate impact on the boroughs' capital spending plans.
<P>
The mayor will undoubtedly&#151;and quite rightly&#151;want to consult many people about the proposals. When we debate the hon. Gentleman's new clause, to which I am prevented from referring at the moment, he may find that we are far more amenable to his proposals. However, the amendment would constitute an unduly bureaucratic requirement, and would prove a costly and impractical way of involving and consulting the boroughs. We therefore urge him to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister says that the amendment would be costly. There are 32 London boroughs, and we are asking that one copy of the capital spending plan be sent to each borough&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Twice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Twice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): That has doubled the price already.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not quite sure what the cost of postage would be, but I suspect that the authority could afford it. It may require a slight increase in the level of council tax, but to spend a few quid extra on posting 64 documents does not seem unreasonable. The documents cost perhaps &#163;1 each to produce. Combined with the cost of postage, the total would be about &#163;75.
<P>
The matter is one of principle and, in the circumstances, we shall divide the Committee on it.

Amendment proposed: No. 369, in page 58, line 3, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (6) `Members of the public shall be entitled to make copies of the capital spending plan and copying facilities shall be made available to them at reasonable charge.'. [Mr. Ottaway.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> This is another amendment that troubled me somewhat. At first blush it seemed to be effective and I could see what my hon. Friends were getting at. Taking up the cue, or not taking it up, that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South suggested a few moments ago, when he uttered the immortal phrase ``just a few quid'', which made my blood run cold, I fear that the same philosophy might underlie this amendment.
<P>
 If the amendment stated that members of the public shall be entitled to copies of the capital spending plan, that would be one thing, because with the cost of printing these days that would not be too onerous. But I looked carefully at the wording of the amendment, as I hope we all do, and it reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Members of the public shall be entitled to make copies . . . and copying facilities shall be made available to them''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That strikes me as an open-ended commitment. If we are talking seriously about a guarantee in the Bill that copying facilities will be made available to all Londoners so that they will have access to the authority's capital plans, the implications could be substantial. Surely that is the sort of proposal that members of the Committee are here to scrutinise and, in my view, to seek to prevent.
<P>
If we use the Bill as a vehicle by which to provide ever more facilities, guarantees and so on to the people of London, we shall be party to making commitments on the authority's behalf before it is even set up&#151;never mind what the authority will do when it is set up, which is something that I am worried about. If we enter that conspiracy and members of the Committee, through amendments to the Bill, commit the authority in advance to such expenditure, which could be, to use a phrase of the former Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), not inconsiderable, we shall get ourselves into trouble.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South will be able to reassure me. I am sure that he will want to tell me that that was not necessarily what he had in mind or that my reading of the amendment is excessively pedantic and my worries are unnecessary. However, until I hear him say those things, I remain unsettled by the implications of the amendment, reading it carefully as I did. Unless I can be reassured that members of the public will be entitled to have copying facilities made available to them. I fear that I may not be able to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I find myself in slight difficulties, because I agree with the sentiments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, although I think that we would all agree with the idea behind the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. The problem is knowing how many members of the public would want to take up this offer of copies of the capital spending plan. If they were to be available, and if many people demanded copies&#151;they would be charged for the postage and the production cost, which would put many people off&#151;there might be a great time lag before people received them. Although I understand the problems of expense, the provision of copying facilities might be the most reasonable option. Unfortunately, no one will know how interested the people of London will be in obtaining copies of the capital spending plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My hon. Friend is a distinguished entrepreneur and business man and might be able to answer this question. If the amendment were to become part of the Bill, and my hon. Friend had to provide copying facilities to Londoners without knowing the likely level of demand, would he not be worried about the capital commitment he would have to make?
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> First, I can think of more attractive lines to stock than the capital spending plan. Secondly, copying facilities could just mean pencil and paper; we could perhaps get around the problem that way.
<P>
If the amendment is pressed to a vote, I hope that my right hon. Friend will recognise the sense of the argument advanced from the Opposition Front Bench.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Once again, the Committee has been treated to a splendid display of differences among Tory Members. The hon. Member for Croydon, South&#151;I am tempted to call him the hon. Member for Croydon, South and profligacy&#151;rides under the banner of ``Just a few quid more'', which clearly causes immense concern to the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. If I may use a phrase that was used to describe my most distinguished predecessor as Member of Parliament for Greenwich, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is a strict, unbending Tory. I am pleased to say that my predecessor did not remain so for all his life; those who know the biography of William Ewart Gladstone will recognise the reference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The phrase was a ``stern unbending Tory''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I stand corrected, as always, by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. In any case, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst would not spend a penny more and would not make copying facilities available, and the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) did not quite know where he stood between his two Conservative colleagues. I shall try to resolve his difficulty.
<P>
The Government recognise that members of the public should have access to the GLA's capital spending plans. In principle, the Bill's approach is to make it possible for members of the public to secure&#151;at reasonable cost, which is important&#151;evidence that they may wish to see to understand the workings of the GLA. We are sympathetic to that extent and, in general, we have made appropriate provision. We have not made such provision with regard to the capital spending plan, so the hon. Member for Croydon, South has done the Committee a service by highlighting that. We are concerned about the cost implications of access to an infinite number of copies of the capital spending plan, however, and we believe that further thought should be given to the matter. I promise the Committee that we will return with an appropriate amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Randall:</B> Given the advent of new technology, would it be possible for the capital spending plan to be published on web pages? That would allow interested people to obtain the plan at a reasonable cost&#151;presumably the price of a local phone call.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I assume that the hon. Gentleman does not sell those web pages from his shop because he would have had to declare an interest before making that proposal.
<P>
I undertake to give further thought to the matter and to table an amendment to make it clear that the public should have access to capital spending plans. However, it will not be phrased in such a way that it allows unreasonable financial demands to be made on an authority. I am sure that we share that objective.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We seem to have an extraordinary situation. In earlier amendments, the boroughs were denied their free copy from the authority for the sake of &#163;75, which is my estimate of how much it would cost to send two copies of the report to each London borough. The Minister generously acknowledged the Bill's inadequacy in that respect. But provision will be made for the public to have access. The boroughs will either have to queue up with the public to get their copies or, to pick up on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, get it from the internet. It is a cockeyed approach.
<P>
I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst will be most concerned that his reputation as a hardline Tory is under pressure. There is a suggestion that he may have cracked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> That is not a new suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Cracked in his principles rather than in his head. My right hon. Friend made some important points but, in light of the Minister's response, I am sure that he can put them to one side. I hope that the Minister will enlighten the Committee by responding to my question on the copyright of capital spending plans.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am not sure that I can. I am not an expert in copyright law and I would need to take advice on the precise implications. However, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am obliged. As the Minister reflects on the issue, perhaps he could send me a job lot instead of separate letters. He has been generous because he has undertaken to take another look at the matter. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want briefly&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): Those dreaded words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I seek to give colleagues some comfort by using those words&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been tolerant of good-natured banter, but we have a tight schedule to follow between now and 6.50 pm. I ask the Committee members to co-operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We strongly believe that the process of drawing up the capital spending plan should not be dissimilar to the one that the Government have recommended for the revenue plan. Why should the drawing up of the capital programme be controlled solely by the mayor and not for the assembly, either by amendment or a final two-thirds resolution, to change if it sees fit? That would be an appropriate check. It picks up on the lesson that the Government have learnt about the revenue programme, and it should apply to the capital programme.
<P>
The Conservative party's preoccupation with photocopiers would undoubtedly constitute a new section in the capital plan because the number of copies that would have to be purchased to fulfil its ambitions of spreading paper around London would be considerable. It left me thinking that, in these days of talking about reincarnation, perhaps the hon. Member for Croydon, South intends to come back some day as a photocopier salesman. On that point, I should be interested to hear from the Minister whether there is any plan to introduce some form of democracy and accountability into the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Liberal Democrats did not move amendment No. 65. Nevertheless, the idea of requiring an assembly debate after publication of the draft capital plan is sensible. There should be a window of opportunity for any consequential resolutions to be forwarded to the mayor for consideration within the three-week period allowed for comment. As the Government have been indulgent towards us over the issue of copying facilities, so they should think again about this matter before we return to the clause on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am not surprised that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam did not move amendment No. 65 but spoke on the clause stand part debate. The Liberal Democrat amendment proposed that there should be a debate and vote on the capital spending plan, at which a majority vote in favour of the assembly rather than the mayor would have triggered a general election&#151;a huge process. Among the many dark proposals suggested by the Liberal Democrats, that takes the biscuit, so I am not surprised that they did not move the amendment.
<P>
There is provision for consultation with the assembly. The clause provides for the mayor to publish a draft capital spending plan and to send a copy of it not only to the assembly, but to all the functional bodies, which will have 21 days within which to consider and submit their comments. That gives the assembly an opportunity to assess and debate, if it so wishes, the capital programme, and to comment on it before the mayor makes a final decision. So the concerns that have been expressed about the assembly not being involved are unfounded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Why is it qualitatively different? Why must the mayor draw up a capital programme only in consultation with the assembly but must submit his revenue plan to amendments and, even if the assembly manages to gather a two-thirds majority, accept amendments to his revenue plan? Why are the Government not prepared to accept that a similar process should apply to the capital programme, with the safeguards provided for in the schedules?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> For the obvious reasons that the hon. Gentleman must surely understand; the revenue implications of the capital programme will be subject to full scrutiny during the debate on the revenue budget, which has statutory status, unlike the capital spending programmes of local authorities and, indeed, the GLA. The two are separate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Is the Minister saying, therefore, that the way in which the assembly can debate and amend the capital programme is through the secondary process of debating and amending the revenue implications? Surely it would be better to have one debate and the ability to amend the capital programme, rather than doing it at arm's length through the revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I appreciate the Liberal Democrats' love of debate, and I simply ask them to recognise that the entire process must be carried out in the month of February. Given the various pressures, if there were to be separate statutory provisions for debates and decisions on, first, the capital programme, and then the revenue programme&#151;a two-stage process presumably applying to both, as a two-stage process will apply to the revenue programme&#151;it simply would not be possible to carry it through in a sensible and orderly way.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam realises that the implications of the capital programme will be seen in the revenue budget, and that will be the appropriate opportunity for the assembly to vote on the programme, if it so wishes. It will have an opportunity to comment on the capital programme, and the mayor will have to make it clear why he or she does not accept the assembly's comments. At the next monthly meeting the assembly will have a full opportunity to question the mayor on his or her reasons for departing from its recommendations.
<P>
Democratic scrutiny is guaranteed and there will be an opportunity fully to examine the capital programme, but we cannot accept an impossible series of meetings that could not be accommodated within the timetable to agree the budgets and to put them into place.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam accepts that we have outlined a sensible and pragmatic way forward, even if it does not allow for a process of continual debate, which I know the Liberal Democrats would like. I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall add just one or two words to this debate. The procedures that the Minister outlined could easily include the casting of votes, where that is appropriate, by the assembly. It is not beyond the wit of assembly members or of the mayor to construct a timetable that would facilitate the consideration of the revenue budget and of the capital programme at that crucial time of the year. That is common practice among local authorities, and I do not see why it is impossible to implement a similar procedure in this case. On that basis, we will divide the Committee.

You have not always been present at our sittings, Mr. O'Hara, which was our loss, but you might, perhaps, say that that was your gain. If we had proceeded at that pace during our earlier considerations, the Committee might not have needed to sit this afternoon.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman means to refer to amendments Nos. 370 and 371.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 370 and 371 would oblige the mayor, when setting the capital spending plans, to take account of plans for previous years and of the breakdown of amounts that have been met.
<P>
The amendments are designed to introduce greater financial accountability. Replacing ``may'', which is a discretionary word, with ``shall'', which is a mandatory word, would place a clear obligation on the mayor to consider certain matters relating to the capital expenditure programme. In particular, the subsequent rider to subsection (3)(a) places an obligation on the mayor to address the capital expenditure outturn of the previous three years, which I am sure the Minister will agree would have been taken into account in any event. Therefore, we see no harm in addressing the point in the context of the authority.

On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was moving amendments Nos. 370 and 371 and underlining the importance of comparing past capital spending plans and general breakdowns with the spending plan that is to be set. I said that that should be made mandatory by replacing ``may'' with ``shall''. That would remove discretion and place a clear obligation on the mayor to consider matters relating to the capital expenditure programme.
<P>
Both the amendments would make it easier for adjustments to be made if overspending was identified. I am sure that hon. Members appreciate that it would be much easier to identify overspending if the accounting technique that I have suggested was deployed. It is, indeed, the technique with which any senior captain of industry will run his budget. He will not examine the budget item by item, but will compare the current year with the previous year to see where increases have come from. That is, indeed, the way in which many Departments and agencies are run.
<P>
From the democratic point of view, the important point is that the amendments would increase pressure on the mayor and assembly members to face up to possible past capital expenditure overruns. That would highlight past problems. It would enable clear comparisons to be made, which everybody could understand. To that extent, I hope that the Minister accepts the principle behind the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I confess that I am slightly surprised by the wording of both the Bill and my hon. Friend's amendment. It is slightly bizarre to imagine a mayor preparing a capital plan without taking into account 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such factors as appear to him to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The wording is otiose and tautological at the same time.
<P>
More worryingly, has the Minister considered that the words in the clause might be subject to judicial review if they appear in statute? If they are not in the Bill, the issue does not arise. By unnecessarily including them, however, the Minister could be putting the mayor at unnecessary risk of a review or some kind or other. There would be almost unlimited scope for someone to argue that the mayor had not taken into account this or that factor in preparing the capital spending plan. The factor in question may not have appeared appropriate to the mayor but it might have done so to a third party. In that sense, the wording seems almost to be inviting trouble. For the life of me, I cannot see why it is necessary to include it. Any mayor who did not take 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such factors as appear to him to be appropriate''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
into account would be in gross dereliction of duty when it comes to anything sensible or reasonable. Putting the words in the Bill almost invites mischief and trouble.
<P>
I am not too sure whether my hon. Friend's amendment makes the situation better or worse. I am agnostic on the matter for the moment, but I am more concerned about the wording of the Bill than about the effect of the amendment.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reassure me, if not the rest of the Committee, on the matter. I hope that he can give us some insight into why the present form of words had to be included at all, and I also seek a response to my worries about possible judicial review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I support the amendment, but I do not take issue in any way with my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. I shall reveal to the Committee a fact that I have just shared with him. In the final days of the London county council, its IBM computer went by the name of ERIC. I shall think of my right hon. Friend daily by that new soubriquet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman tell me where ERIC went forth when the LCC ended?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Little by little, that may emerge.
<P>
I am not a lawyer, and I am not therefore in a position to argue with my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. However, I remember that when we were drawing up the guidelines for lottery distribution, my officials advised me that as long as the lottery distributors were able, if subjected to judicial review, to indicate that they had taken the matters into account&#151;although not necessarily in what way&#151;that would be a full and adequate defence. I am, therefore, not as troubled by that issue as is my right hon. Friend.
<P>
I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, as stated in the amendment, in respect of the three previous financial years. Given the way in which the Bill is constructed&#151;this may encourage my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst&#151;the mayor would not have to consult any past years at all. The phrase ``any such'' presumably implies that one could substitute the word ``none'', as zero is a digit. We would not know what advice the mayor had been given. In the case of Caligula making his horse consul, we would be able to disregard the advice, but in this instance we would not know what advice had been given. There is much to be said for adding to the Bill the words that the amendment suggests, not least because the three-year rhythm that underlies the amendment runs with the three-year expenditure projections which the Government have almost set in concrete.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> This clause has, clearly, to achieve a balance. It is right to spell out in a certain amount of detail the factors that must be taken into account because we are dealing with a democratic body and the requirement of the mayor to be answerable to the assembly. The assembly must therefore have an indication of the basis on which the mayor should proceed.
<P>
Conversely, we do not want to create too tight a straitjacket, which might unduly restrict the mayor's ability to take other factors into account or make the mayor subject to judicial review challenges on technicalities rather than on points of substance. Of course, the mayor will ultimately be subject to judicial review in the manner of any public authority if he or she acts entirely unreasonably. However, we do not want to put the mayor in a position in which they could be subject to a frivolous judicial review case on a mere technicality. To that extent, I share the concerns that were expressed by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst.
<P>
I have to say to the hon. Member for Croydon, South that I cannot imagine a captain of industry putting himself in the straitjacket of saying that he may take account only of the capital spending plans for the previous three years, which would be the effect of the amendment. In some cases it may be appropriate to take a longer view, and it would be unreasonable to rule that out. Circumstances will arise in which there will be no previous years&#151;in the authority's first year, obviously, or where the authority has a new function or programme for which there has been no previous year's capital programme. In such cases, to answer the point that was made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, there will be no previous year to take into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> If the Minister paid attention to the wording of the amendment, he would see that it allows for that contingency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was responding to the point that the right hon. Gentleman made about whether it would be possible to take no previous years into account, and explaining that such circumstances will arise. I reject the amendment for a different reason, which I thought that I had made clear&#151;namely that it is an unreasonable straitjacket to limit the obligation to a run of three years only. I accept that the amendment takes account of the fact that in the early years of the authority's existence there will not be three previous years.
<P>
We are seeking to be flexible, but at the same time to impose a reasonable obligation on the mayor to prepare the capital programme in a way that will allow him to be answerable to the assembly and subject to appropriate scrutiny. We think that we have the balance approximately right. The mayor may take into account whatever factors appear to him to be appropriate, but it is essential that he should have a free hand to consider past spending by functional bodies over any period, short or long, including how much has been spent and how the resources of those bodies have been used to meet their spending.
<P>
The amendment would unduly shackle the mayor's powers, and I urge the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am obliged to the Minister for setting out his argument in that way. His only objection to the amendment appears to be that the mayor would be shackled to merely three years. That is a fair point; the Minister has put his finger on something. Would it interest the Minister if we were to table an amendment on Report allowing for greater flexibility&#151;instructing the mayor to consider as a minimum the three preceding years, but leaving it open to his discretion to look further? The Minister talks about balance; it is right to have balance, but the word ``may'' is pretty loose and leaves a rather large loophole in the clause. I proposed the amendment in a positive spirit to tighten the wording, but also to maintain the balance that the Minister mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman has tightened it too far. Although I accept the spirit of his proposal to take matters forward, I believe that the clause as drafted meets the requirements of a balance between an obligation on the one side and avoidance of undue rigidity on the other. I would not be minded to consider further amendments on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am not suggesting that the Minister provoked me to rise, but he took up my point about ``any such'' being brought down to zero, and then cited a unique occasion on which it would be zero. The difference between us is that under the Bill as drafted every subsequent year could be zero.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly fair point, but he will be aware of the point made by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who raised the issue of judicial review. A mayor who chose entirely to disregard previous years' capital programme spending when framing the capital programme would risk judicial review. Together with the safeguard of scrutiny by the assembly, that provides the correct balance between an unduly rigid framework and one that provides for proper and sensible consideration of a budget. The Bill as drafted is satisfactory, and I urge the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I inadvertently missed out one point to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster alluded: our amendment is perfectly in order for the first three years.
<P>
We have had a useful exchange; only time will tell who is right about the balance. We do not intend to press the amendment to a Division, but I hope that the Minister will accept that we have made our point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 108 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 109</center></H4>
<H4><center>Information</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am somewhat anxious about the provisions of the clause, because they appear pretty draconian and far-reaching. It is not unreasonable for the mayor to be able to provide himself with such information as should properly be available for him to discharge his responsibilities. However, the wording of the clause goes much further even than Members of Parliament can go in discharging their duties. Hon. Members will be familiar with a reply that the Government make from time to time: ``This information would be available only at disproportionate cost''. As far as I can see, the clause contains no such saving provision, although I may be wrong and I stand to be corrected.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The clause states that information has to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the possession or under the control of the functional body.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an interesting allusion, upon which the Minister may wish to elaborate. What does that stipulation mean, and how far might it reach? It goes on to state that if the information is possessed or controlled in such a way,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the body shall supply the information''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It contains no let out, and no ability for the hapless body to say to the mayor, ``We may well have in our possession somewhere the sort of information for which you are asking, but it would put us to the most enormous expense and trouble to provide it in the form that you request''. According to the clause, the mayor is entitled to reply, ``Sorry, old boy, but I have these powers, I need this information and you will provide it, regardless of the impact on your operations, staff, budget or whatever else''.
<P>
I accept that I am pushing my argument to the limit. I do so to illustrate a useful point, and to ask whether we should pause and ask the Minister to reconsider the provision. Conflicts of view may arise between the mayor, acting as he or she perceives to be in the best interests of the responsibilities laid upon the role by statute, and anybody who possesses any sort of information demanded under the clause but who is reluctant to provide it in the form or totality requested.
<P>
I fear that the possibility of such conflicts will arise frequently as we consider the Bill. They will be based on the different view that may be taken by the authority and the mayor and by other bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My right hon. Friend makes an important point. The Bill stipulates that the body in question shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``supply the information required . . . at such time . . . as is specified in the notice''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
served by the mayor. No latitude is written into the provision on that point. The Bill goes on to state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the information shall be certified (according as is specified in the notice)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The information has therefore got to be exactly as the mayor wants it, when he wants it. If not, the body concerned could be liable to sanction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I was coming to that point. The Bill states that the information will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``required in such form and manner, and at such time, as is specified in the notice''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend is right&#151;the clause goes even further than I feared, because it allows the mayor to lay down the information, format, manner and the time, which is crucial, as he said. The mayor could impose upon a body a completely unreasonable time frame, maybe unknowingly. Perhaps a reasonable mayor would approach the body in question, specify the form that he or she required and ask how long it would take to produce the information. The financial officer could tell him whether it would take a month, or two months. The mayor might not do that, however, and might simply say, ``Here's the notice under clause 109. This is what I want and I need it in seven days' time''. In theory, the information could be required in 24 hours' time, or whenever. The mayor could cause an enormously expensive and disruptive process, based on the power and backing of statute.
<P>
The Minister may wish to reassure me, and explain that my argument is impossible, unreasonable and so on, but I look for that reassurance because the current working contains all those dangers. I suppose that what I am really saying to the Minister is that it is worth another look, in case we are building in to the provisions a means of undermining the authority in its early days or a cause of unnecessary conflict. I am sure that Ministers would want to avoid that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> If I may, I shall fill in one or two of the arguments that were so ably deployed by my right hon. Friend.
<P>
There is a real risk that in giving the mayor these draconian and potentially unreasonable powers to require information from the functional bodies, we may be reinforcing a tendency that already exists in the Bill for the mayoralty to exercise its power in an excessive and interfering manner. A delicate balance must be struck between the need for such information to be available to the mayor so that he can exercise his executive powers effectively and efficiently, and giving him unbridled authority to meddle and interfere in the internal management of the functional bodies. They need to get on with their job without him breathing down their necks. The mayor will have to exercise strategic direction and lay down policy without getting too immersed in the detail of the functional bodies. I, too, ask the Government to reconsider the issue.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> It is not our perception that the powers are either draconian or unreasonable. In essence, the powers that the clause confers on the mayor, to require the functional bodies to provide such information as he needs, are specifically for the purpose of deciding how to perform his functions&#151;essentially paying grants, allocating credit approvals, redistributing capital receipts and preparing a capital spending plan.
<P>
The scenario put forward by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, wherein the mayor arbitrarily requires any tiny piece of information that it occurs to him he might like with no regard for any conclusion, does not stack up. The right hon. Gentleman may remember this afternoon's somewhat detailed debates about the timetable that the mayor must observe with regard to examining and completing his draft capital spending plan.
<P>
I find it extraordinary that neither the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst nor the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood seem to have taken on board what is surely a salient point: these functional bodies are answerable to the mayor. I cannot conceive of any captain of industry, to refer back to the analogy used by the hon. Member for Croydon, South in an earlier debate, sitting quietly in his large office&#151;not that I am saying that the mayor will necessarily have a large office&#151;while a section of a large corporation or the head office says, ``So sorry, chief exec, but we don't feel like giving you that information today.''
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman (Chipping Barnet):</B> The Minister mentioned the mayor's office, large or otherwise. Her hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction has told us that the assembly and the mayor will start operating on Monday 3 July 2000. Can she say where they will be operating from?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is an excellent fisherman, but I am afraid that his hook has not caught the fish this time. He, like everybody else, must be patient before we make the announcement to which he referred.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood have both consistently argued that they are opposed to any kind of waste of public money. Why would the mayor wish to waste public money in this way? Each expenditure will be closely scrutinised by the functional bodies. I can see no reason why the functional bodies and, more particularly, the mayor would even contemplate the possibility of wasting money that could be used for the provision of services in a pointless exercise for information that is irrelevant in the exercise of his or her public duty.

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> A moment ago the Minister said that because this might be in the context of grant, that would be a limiting factor. I do not believe that that will be the case. However, let us take that as a case in point. I am worried about inadvertent demands being made, not deliberate or wasteful ones. My fear is that, given the nature of bureaucracy and bureaucrats and given their desire to cover themselves, to use the polite term&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Will my right hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> This is an intervention, although it may seem like a speech, so I cannot give way to my right hon. Friend.
<P>
In the process of seeking information necessary in pursuit, for example, of determining a grant, bureaucrats might inadvertently place an unreasonable burden on other bureaucrats.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> We are talking, not about bureaucrats, but about a mayor who will set strategies. Those strategies will of necessity involve the active participation of the functional bodies, and the functional bodies are answerable to the mayor. Why would the mayor, who will be working to an extremely tight timetable, wish to send people scurrying after information that is both irrelevant and useless? The idea that this is some kind of foray into an unexplored and as yet undiscovered country is absurd. We are talking about the financing of the mayor's strategies.
<P>
If a functional body fails to supply information sought by the mayor, the mayor may make assumptions and estimates. The mayor may rely on any information available to him, whether or not it is obtained from a functional body under the clause. Therefore, I argue that the mayor could have no motive other than a spiteful one to ask for anything other than the most relevant information.
<P>
If the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster wishes to intervene, I should be happy to allow him so to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I was going to intervene on a different point, but as the Minister has kindly given me the floor, I will ask my question anyway. It arises out of an exchange with the Minister on the previous clause, and this clause is about information. It would be helpful if at some stage in her remarks, the Minister could confirm that the advice given by advisers to the mayor which cannot be disclosed under other circumstances is admissible under judicial review. I ask the hon. Lady out of genuine ignorance, because I honestly do not know.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I share the right hon. Gentleman's ignorance of this matter. I will make inquiries and respond to him in writing.
<P>
In the light of what I have said, I trust that I have managed to allay the fears of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. I ask the Committee to agree that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 372, in page 60, line 41, leave out from first `the' to the end of line 45 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Chairman of Transport for London or, in his absence, the Deputy Chairman of Transport for London'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This innocuous-looking amendment is really quite a seriouse one. Clause 114 relates to the chief finance officer's functions as regards reports, and designates certain people for consultation in the preparation of those reports. Subsection (3) (3C) states that for transport the designated person shall be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the person who is for the time being designated for the purpose''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment stops what could be a climate of buck-passing in London Transport, because it ensures that the chief financial officer consults the chairman of Transport for London rather than a more junior member of staff when preparing a report on financial irregularities.
<P>
The relevance of that is that the chief executive takes full responsibility. Indeed, it would be odd if anybody other than the chief executive took responsibility for his organisation. The Foreign Secretary may be reluctant to take responsibility for the Foreign Office, but it is appropriate that the chief executive should take responsibility for London Underground. The amendment prevents the possibility of buck-passing at Transport for London.
<P>
It is more than possible that financial irregularities will arise. As the Minister for Transport in London will know only too well, huge sums of money are swilling around in transport in London&#151;in London Underground. It has happened before at London Underground. As the post of chief executive for Transport for London will be one of considerable responsibility and remuneration, it seems appropriate that the chief executive should be closely involved with investigations into financial irregularities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Is my hon. Friend satisfied that enough flexibility is built into the amendment? I can envisage circumstances in which neither of the designated and named persons are available for whatever reason: they may be abroad or the position may be vacant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> They may be underground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My right hon. Friend has just suggested that they may be underground. I cannot imagine why they should be. However, if they were not available, either because the position was vacant or because they were abroad legitimately on business, is my hon. Friend satisfied that there is enough flexibility in the wording of the amendment to make the process a practical one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My right hon. Friend is right to raise the point. Indeed, if he looked more closely at the amendment, he would see that it includes not only the chairman of Transport for London but, in his absence, the deputy chairman. There are circumstances when they could both be away, but perhaps they could work a shift system. The important point is that a senior person&#151;the chairman or his deputy&#151;must consider financial irregularities.
<P>
It is easy to criticise management in any organisation. If I were a manager in London Underground, I would feel that I had received my fair share of flak over recent months and years. The previous Government were obliged to put in the private sector to make the docklands light railway work. The system was not working at all well: it was inefficient and breakdowns were occurring. We had to bring in the man who is now Lord Mayor of London, Sir Peter Levene. [Hon. Members: ``Lord Levene.''] Lord Levene&#151;I beg the noble Lord's pardon. He is the current Lord Mayor of London, and has been touted in some newspapers as a possible candidate for mayor of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick (Poplar and Canning Town):</B> I do not want to give any opinion on any candidate for mayor, irrespective of his or her party. The hon. Gentleman referred to private ownership in connection with the docklands light railway, but it is now running more efficiently than ever, is being extended into Lewisham and Greenwich and is under the control of my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Yes, but it took a Tory Government to set it up in the first place. [Hon. Members: ``No.''] The Government know that we made the right decision on the railways. They know that investment in the railways is now at a level that those running London Underground would die for. By the end of this Parliament, or in three, four or five years' time, the railways will be in a very good state. The problem for the Labour Government is to make it look as if they have saved the railways from the Tories' wicked policy. Railway summits took place last year and will take place this year. There will be some movement around the deck chairs, and the Government will take the credit. If I were in government, that is exactly what I would do. The truth is that the Conservative Government took the right decision, which has resulted in an unprecedented level of investment.
<P>
I shall return to the amendment, which relates to who is responsible for London Underground. The docklands light railway was also the result of a Conservative Government's vision, and was implemented by a Conservative Government. We recognised that it was not working, and got it working properly; Labour Members, of course, take the credit for that, which is fair enough.
<P>
The Jubilee line was handed over to the Government on time and on budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> May I ask the hon. Gentleman to reconsider and withdraw that comment? The Jubilee line was not handed over on time&#151;it had already been subject to serious delays when it was handed over. As the hon. Gentleman will know, those delays were caused by many factors, including the collapse of the tunnel and problems with the Heathrow express, which set the project back by six months. It is simply not true that the project was handed over on time or on budget.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I believe that the hon. Member for Croydon, South said that he would return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My amendment is pertinent, as it relates to who should take responsibility for London Underground. As for the Minister's intervention, he may regret wandering onto the territory of his colleague the Minister for Transport in London. When I asked her about the timetable in June or July last year, she said that she had thoroughly reviewed progress on the Jubilee line and she gave a categorical assurance to the Committee and the House that it would be ready this spring. She must therefore have been perfectly satisfied with the contracts that had been handed over to her.
<P>
The Government took their eye off the ball, they lost control, and as a result they have had to bring in Bechtel. For the second time, London Underground's management has not been considered by the Government to be up to the job of managing a major infrastructure project. London Underground has been bypassed&#151;the Government clearly have no confidence in its ability to deliver&#151;and the Minister for Transport in London has now given a late autumn deadline for the completion of the Jubilee line. Who is the face of London Underground? Who will accept responsibility? The amendment highlights the significant question of where the buck stops.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My hon. Friend has highlighted the difference in approach of the Conservative party and the Labour Government towards the responsibility for financial reporting by important functional bodies. For Londoners, few functional bodies are more important to their daily lives than Transport for London. They will look to the authority for an improvement in transport services. That is what they were promised in the Labour party's election manifesto and subsequent speeches in this place over many months. We will see whether, from 3 July 2000, it is forthcoming.
<P>
Londoners would want the responsibility for financial reports to rest at the top of the organisation. The concept that it could be fulfilled by a member of staff, as the Bill suggests, does not meet the requirement that acountability should go to the very head of the organisation. There is an apparent contradistinction&#151;the Minister will put me right if I am wrong&#151;between the requirement for the chief executive of the London development agency to be responsible for financial reporting and the concept that a member of staff can be responsible for the financial reporting of Transport for London.
<P>
We could split the difference and agree that a board member of Transport for London, such as the finance director, could be responsible, I might concede that, but the principle that the buck should stop at the top is right. I am sure that Londoners would not be happy with anything else.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am interested in the final remark of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood&#151;that the buck must stop at the very top. That seems to be Conservative party ideology on this matter. It is a pity that the former Home Secretary was not aware of that requirement. No resignations were offered for the scandalous activities in our prisons. Nor did a previous Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer offer his resignation; indeed, he was elevated&#151;a bizarre description&#151;to another place for his gross mishandling of a European form of currency in 1992.
<P>
Before I address the main issue raised by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, it is necessary to set the record straight. The hon. Gentleman said that London Underground would die for the investment that is going to our railways. I think that British Rail would have died, gone to heaven and asked to be returned had it received from the previous Administration the amount of public money post privatisation that is going into our railways. I believe that the railways receive &#163;400 million a day and they have yet to deliver the service that we were promised.
<P>
	As for the Jubilee line extension, my hon. Friend the Minister for London castigated the hon. Member for Croydon, South for his assertion that when his party left office the Jubilee line extension was on time. If I remember correctly, the handover was in May and the response to the questions was given some months later. It is undoubtedly the case that the longest single delay on the Jubilee line extension was the six months&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The two points have been fully addressed, as I am sure the Minister will agree.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am grateful for your advice, Mr. O'Hara. The hon. Member for Croydon, South wants to hear about the matter, and I have little doubt that, during the Committee's later deliberations, he will have heard about it so often that he will be sick of it.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The issue that the hon. Gentleman has raised is an important one. In essence, it relates to the possibility and prevention of unlawful expenditure. The chief finance officer of a relevant authority will have a duty to ensure that, where the authority has incurred, or might be about to incur, unlawful expenditure, a report should be completed and presented to the full authority. Before completing the report, the chief finance officer will be required to consult with the head of paid service and the monitoring officer. That requirement seeks to ensure that there is agreement among the authority's officers on the legality of the action being taken and that all the relevant facts are clear.
<P>
The Board of Transport for London will include executive members. The structure of the body may not follow that adopted generally by local government, and the body may not choose to appoint a chief executive. However, it is important that the body has members or officers who are specifically designated to fill the posts and who are responsible for ensuring probity in the running of the body. Provision has been made for the appointment of a member or officer to the post of chief finance officer.
<P>
The chief finance officer will carry out the responsibilities attached to the post in accordance with the provisions contained in the Local Government Finance Act 1988, including the completion of reports to the body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am just about to touch on the point that, I trust, the hon. Gentleman is about to raise. The requirement is dealt with in clause 113, and will also apply to the LDA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Minister referred to responsibility for financial reports in cases where there are allegations of financial malpractice. One can wholly understand and applaud the vesting of that responsibility in a designated board member. However, why does clause 114(3) allow for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a member of the staff''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to be consulted on such matters? That is surely an inadequate way to deal with matters of such importance.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The clause is drafted in that way because it could well be that a member of staff has particular expertise or qualifications in, for example, matters of financial probity or accountancy. However, it is important that, where the chief finance officer completes a report on the actions of Transport for London, the report must be considered by the body at a full meeting of the board.
<P>
The requirement contained in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South for the chairman&#151;or the chairman's deputy&#151;alone to be consulted before the report is finished could therefore prejudice the chief finance officer's independence in cases relating precisely to the actions or role of the chairman. Indeed, that could raise doubts about whether the board was giving appropriate consideration to matters that might involve unlawful expenditure.
<P>
For the reason that I gave in response to a question from the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, we consider it appropriate that TFL should have the discretion to appoint whomever it thinks fit to fill the consultation role. In the light of that, I trust that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not wholly convinced by the Minister's response, but given the time, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 114 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 115</center></H4>
<H4><center>Duties of Authority or functional body as regards reports</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 374, in page 62, line 39, at end insert,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and where any recommendation carries the support of a majority of members of the Assembly voting on that recommendation, the Mayor shall comply with that recommendation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment ensures that when a financial report on unlawful activities is submitted, action is not taken wholly at the mayor's discretion. The Goverment's White Paper said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the assembly will provide an essential check and balance to the power of the Mayor.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment brings the GLA into line with that undertaking and with every other local authority. In addition to the duty to take account of any views, the mayor would be required to comply with any resolution of the assembly passed by a majority. Why should the largest local authority be the one with the least democratic accountability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I support my hon. Friend's amendment. We must reinforce, again and again, what we believe to be the assembly's vital role of providing a check and balance by overseeing the mayor. The wording proposed by my hon. Friend's amendment emphasises that point, gives it clarity and ensures that it is fixed in the Bill at every appropriate stage. That is the only way to ensure the correct balance. We must persist in that argument all the way through the Bill so that it is not overlooked and is beyond any doubt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I also put on record my strong belief that my right hon. and hon. Friends are absolutely right to demand accountability in respect of reports on malpractice and recommendations to put things right. That function of the assembly should be spelled out. People should not allow any possibility of the mayor being judge and jury. That is why I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> In response to the contributions made by the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Ruislip-Northwood, and the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, I must say that this is not the first time that the opposition have presented to the Committee their desire to see a completely different sort of citywide government to the one that we proposed to the people of London, and which the people overwhelmingly endorsed in a referendum. A balance is achieved by the fact that it is the mayor who is responsible for the strategic direction of the GLA and the functional bodies. Therefore, it is the mayor who must decide what action, if any, to take in respect of a report completed by the chief finance officer.
<P>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South would require the mayor to comply with any recommendations supported by a majority of the assembly in respect of any report published by the chief finance officer of the GLA. That would constitute a total reversal of the proposals that we presented to the people of London and which they endorsed. Under our proposals, provision has been specifically made to require the mayor to attend the meeting at which the assembly considers the report and, furthermore, the mayor must have regard to any views or recommendations of the assembly at that meeting. I repeat, the mayor must retain the final responsibility for deciding how to respond to the report. That is the balance that the people of London expect us to endorse and, indeed, that is our intention for the GLA. The mayor will be the motivating power and the assembly will have the right of scrutiny. In the light of my remarks, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I certainly am.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> And she is confirming that fact. So much for Labour's promise that the assembly will be much more than a talking shop; it seems that that is exactly what the Minister wants it to be. The extraordinary thing is that the Government are obliging us to vote for something that they included in their White Paper, but they will vote against it.

<H4><center>Clause 117</center></H4>
<H4><center>Application of the Audit Commission Act 1998</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 375, in page 63, line 19, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3) Within three months of the end of the fifth financial year after the commencement of the Authority the Audit Commission shall make and publish a report on the standards of performance (including by reference to the criteria of cost, economy, efficiency and effectiveness) of the Authority and of the functional bodies in the first five financial years of the Authority's existence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (4) It shall be the duty of the Authority and of each of the functional bodies to provide the Audit Commission with such information as it shall require which is reasonably necessary to enable it to fulfil the obligation in subsection (3) of this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important amendment, but, sadly, there is not much time in which to discuss it. Its purpose is to provide for a full Audit Commission report on the first five years of the GLA's activities. It is extraordinary that it should be necessary to table such an amendment.
<P>
The Bill will establish an entirely new form of authority based on a mayor with a level of personal power and patronage unprecedented in the United Kingdom and an assembly whose relationship with the mayor will be entirely untested. We are venturing completely into the unknown. The authority will be staffed by people who have never before staffed such an organisation. It will be manned by people with no concept or experience of the separation of powers between the executive and the legislature. Everyone will be in the dark, flying by the seat of their pants.
<P>
I was told the other day that the first leader of the GLC&#151;I am sure the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) will correct me if I am wrong&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is too much noise in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The first leader of the GLC during the 1960s&#151;the GLC that the hon. Member for Brent, East ultimately led&#151;and the chief executive died within a year or two of leaving office, such was the stress of their first four years. I do not know whether the first mayor of the new authority will die within the first year, but it will be the toughest and most stressful job in British politics.
<P>
I predict that the first mayor will not be re-elected as he will be unable to live up to expectations. Many corners may be cut, and it is a sound and proper proposal for the Audit Commission to be involved. A close, dispassionate review of the functioning of the authority and its financial probity and structural viability should take place when it has had a chance to overcome the inevitable teething problems and to run consistently for a reasonable period. After the first five years, an Audit Commission report would achieve that end, enabling Londoners, the boroughs, the Government and the House of Commons to judge the functioning of the authority properly rather than through anecdote.
<P>
We know that expectations will be raised and every pressure will be put on the staff and mayor of the assembly to live up to those expectations. They will tend to exaggerate and to give the impression that all is well when all may not be well. The authority is untried and untested, and it is absolutely essential to scrutinise it properly. I therefore urge the Committee to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I shall be brief. We agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> That is the best speech yet that the Liberals have made in the Committee.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South caught my imagination when he used the delightful metaphor of people flying around in the dark by the seat of their pants.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The people of London need a serious, independent appraisal of how well the GLA is performing on their behalf. They may want the whole GLA experiment to be brought to a halt. However, that might be extremely difficult if by some mischance the Labour party&#151;perhaps with support from the Liberal Democrats&#151;remained in power beyond the next general election. It might by very difficult to bring it to a halt, but that might be the best thing to do.
<P>
There will be many lessons to be learned from the GLA's first term. Its second term of office should begin with a process of reappraisal, which should give everyone concerned&#151;not least the members of the GLA and the people of London&#151;the chance to take stock.
<P>
The amendment is admirable in every way, and I hope that the Government treat it with the seriousness that it deserves, despite its rather graphic introduction by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendment is unnecessary, and it will not achieve the purpose that the hon. Member for Croydon, South described. He will be aware that his proposal requires the Audit Commission to take no action until the fifth financial year after the commencement of the GLA. His time scale, which refers to the first mayor, will have ended by the time that that duty comes to bite.
<P>
In practice, the GLA will be subject to the audit requirements that apply to all local authorities. The Audit Commission will appoint auditors who will examine most rigorously and carefully all the GLA's financial activities. The auditor will be able to identify areas in which the authority could take action to improve the delivery of services, and its efficiency, effectiveness and economy. Those matters can be highlighted in the annual management letter.
<P>
The authority will be expected to take suitable action within an agreed period of time and the auditor will subsequently monitor progress. Should an authority refuse to take action, the auditor could use his powers to make a public interest report to the authority which it would have to consider at a meeting, subject to the openness provisions of the Local Government Act 1972.
<P>
The existing audit arrangements are already more than adequate. They are capable of identifying weaknesses in systems and of encouraging the greatest efficiency, effectiveness and economy. For those reasons we believe that the amendment is unnecessary, and we hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am persuaded by the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
