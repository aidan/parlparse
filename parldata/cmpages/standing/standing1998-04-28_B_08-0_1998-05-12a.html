</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Alun Michael):</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. It may help the Committee if I explain how I propose to deal with the tabling of Government amendments. I have already written to Committee members to explain the purpose of the Government amendments that were tabled last Friday, and my hon. Friend the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office will write to members of the Committee about amendments relating to Scotland.<P>
This morning I have written to members of the Committee about the amendments that we are tabling today. The letter also gives details of the new clause providing new police powers to pick up truants, which, as a consequence of the Prime Minister’s announcement yesterday, we hope to table later in the week. The Committee’s co-Chairman, Mr. O’Hara, is keen for explanations to be available to Committee members rather than on pieces of paper that are passed around the Room. Therefore, letters will be on the Letter Board by the end of this morning’s sitting.<P>
I appreciate that hon. Members would prefer to receive notice of all Government amendments at once, and I would have preferred to have provided it on one day early in the Committee’s proceedings. However, that was not possible, so I thought that hon. Members would prefer to be briefed on amendments as they are tabled. That is better than delaying a letter until I am able to include an entire list of Government amendments. We shall try to complete the tabling of Government amendments as early as possible, so that there are no surprises for Committee members later in our proceedings.<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. May I say through you that we are grateful for the Minister’s helpful explanation. I know how he must have struggled with himself to bring amendments before the Committee at a late stage, because I know from previous experience just how strongly he condemns the practice of Government pulling amendments out of a hat. The Committee would also find it helpful to know whether the Government have given us the full monty or whether there is a little bit more to come.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. we are following a tapering requirement. I have asked officials, who are labouring diligently, to complete the necessary work.<P>
The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that we could not consider the power on truancy until the recommendations of the social exclusion unit had been examined. The Government’s response was made only yesterday. However, hon. Members from both sides of the Committee have commented on that important issue in earlier debates, so it would be a pity to miss the opportunity to deal with it in this Committee.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Committee is grateful for the Minister’s explanation.<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Child safety orders; supplemental</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment no. 99, in page 12, line 22, after ‘may’ insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>’,subject to the provisions of the 1989 Act and providing that grounds under section 31 of the 1989 Act exist,’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment no. 100, in page 12, line 29, at end insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>’, but before making any such care order under (a) above or any such order under (b) above, a magistrates’ court shall obtain and consider information about the child’s family circumstances’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It may help the Committee if I say that I do not intend to speak to amendment No. 100.<P>
I wish to make a brief but important point about amendment No. 99. One of the sanctions to be used when a child safety order is breached is the making of a care order. However, It appears from the Bill that the sanctions available in the event of a breach of a child safety order will be somewhat slim. The only options that a court will have are to cancel or vary the original order or to make a care order. That is a departure because, since 1989, the only route into care has been through the provisions of the Children Act 1989, which streamlined the care system and the grounds for making a care order. It brought the provisions for making a care order together and applied tightly defined criteria that related to the welfare of the child. That was the paramount consideration of the court in making a care order. Now that there is a second, rather different route into care, other than that contained in the Children Act 1989, will the Minister assure us that the courts will take the same approach as they do under that Act? Will the welfare of the child be the paramount consideration, as required under section 1 of the Children Act?<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful for the helpful way in which the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) has spoken to the amendment, and for his statement that he will not move amendment No. 100.<P>
I am aware of the importance of Children Act and its emphasis on the interests of the child. The child safety order is intended to nip offending behaviour in the bud. It is an important form of early intervention, which provides the family proceedings court with new powers to address the problem of young children sliding into a life of crime.<P>
The new order will allow the courts to impose requirements tailored to the nature of the anti-social or potentially criminal behaviour of the child. Those requirements will be monitored and supervised by a responsible officer, either a social worker or, less frequently, a member of the local youth offending team.<P>
It is clearly important that the requirements are adhered to by the child, but if they are not, it is equally important that the responsible officer has the right powers to take remedial action. Clause 13 gives the responsible officer those powers. An order can be varied or discharged as set out under subsection (4), or the responsible officer can apply for breach proceedings under subsection (6).<P>
If the court is satisfied that the child has failed to comply with any requirements included by the court, then the court can either vary the order if it thinks that that is the best way to deal with a breach, or it can discharge the order and make a care order under subsection (1)(a) of section 31 of the Children Act 1989. Those provisions give the child safety order its teeth.<P>
Subsection (7) of clause 13 modifies the 1989 Act so that the conditions mentioned in section 31(2) of the Act need not apply. Those conditions refer to the court being satisfied that the child is suffering, or is at risk of suffering, from significant harm and that such harm is attributable to the care that it is receiving, or is likely to receive, or that the child is beyond parental control.<P>
The conditions are absolutely right in the context of straight applications for care orders. The child safety orders deal with something different, and it is right that the conditions should be modified in such cases.<P>
I stress that the child safety order is intended to nip in the bud offending and anti-social behaviour, which would be criminal in an older child. Its ambit is therefore somewhat wider than the existing welfare provisions, and that wider focus, which includes the effect of a child’s actions on the wider community, differentiates the child safety order.<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere is correct in saying that the paramount consideration is for the care of the child. The orders will also allow consideration of the impact of the child’s behaviour, which could be damaging to its victims and to the wider community. Such behaviour could be damaging to the child, if there was no intervention to stop it.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his courteous reply. He has told us that the care of the child is the paramount consideration. When the courts consider whether to make a care order relating to a child who is in breach of a child safety order, will the welfare of that child be the paramount consideration? Will the Minister give the Committee a simple assurance on that matter?<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman might be asking the wrong question; I hope that I can give the right answer. As the trigger for a care order under the clause would be the child’s original behaviour, followed by the breach of an order made under the Bill, the court would have to have regard to that, as well as to the care of the child. In this context, it is not just a focus on the care and interests of the child that triggers a care order; the fact that the behaviour affects other people is a consideration. The court would have to give prime consideration to the child’s interests in deciding what order to make, but the trigger for the process would be different.<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): It may be that the Minister is unaware why my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is so concerned about the use of the word “welfare”; perhaps he has just received guidance from his officials. In decision after decision by higher courts, right up to the House of Lords, the view that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration has been hallowed in family cases. I appreciate that the Minister’s remarks related to an, as it were, criminal sanction, but it is important, particularly in the light of the decision in Pepper v. Hart that his words may be used as guidance, to establish exactly how the phrase “the welfare of the child” fits into the context.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I understand the point and that is why I made clear, I hope, the importance of the court’s consideration of the child’s welfare. However, I am sure that hon. Members will accept that the trigger for a care order would not be evidence about the welfare of the child, but the breach of an order made under the Bill to stop behaviour that would, in someone aged over 10, be criminal. The child’s welfare would be neglected by our not stopping such behaviour. Allowing the development of a habit of behaviour that would be criminal on reaching the age of 10 is not in the interests of a child. That is why I do not see a conflict between the two aspects of the matter.<P>
Section 1 of the Children Act 1989 applies where the court has to determine any question with respect to the upbringing of a child. The reference to “court” in that provision means a family proceedings court. That does not give rise to conflict in the present context. I appreciate why the hon. Member for Hertsmere raised the matter. I do not think that he intended to suggest that a stress on the welfare of the child should lead to the court’s disregarding the breach of an order under the Bill, in which case there is no difference between us on the importance of the welfare considerations.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister’s courteous reply, which was helpful up to a point. I thought we were nearly getting there, but we did not quite make it in the end. My point is that the provision deals with very young children—those under 10 years old. For the purpose of deciding whether to take such children into care, the Children Act 1989 should be married up to the Bill. We do not want any disjunction between them, such as a route to care under the Children Act quite different from that established under the Bill. It would marry the two together if the Minister made it clear that the welfare of the child should be the court’s paramount consideration when deciding how to exercise its powers in the event of a breach.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could explain what he means by “paramount”. Does he mean that the considerations of the welfare of the child might in theory lead the court to disregard the behaviour that led to the original order under the Bill and the breach of that order? I do not think that the hon. Gentleman means that. However, I must place that interpretation on his words, if he insists on such a strict application of the word “paramount”.<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was not trying to make a debating point about the word “paramount”. As my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr Hawkins) suggested, the phrase is well known to the courts. It is enshrined in section 1 of the Children Act 1989. It had been part of the philosophy of the courts that deal with children’s care cases for many years before that Act was passed. The phrase is well understood by the courts. Of course, we cannot disregard a breach of a child safety order. However, when a court exercises its powers in relation to that breach and decides what to do with the child, we believe that the welfare of the child should make the welfare of the child the paramount consideration in every decision. A matter of realism and a question of philosophy underline the legal argument. Courts and authorities that do not ensure the welfare of young children are not acting in the best interests of society to stop those children re-offending.<P>
We are worried that there is a disjunction between the Children Act and the Bill. We cannot make progress unless the Minister accepts that simple point.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Perhaps I might return to the point by explaining how the two pieces of legislation fit together. An order made under the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Bill is the trigger. If the order is breached the matter comes before the court. The court must pursue the requirements of the Children Act in its consideration. The Children Act will apply because family proceedings apply in relation to a child safety order. Clause 12(6) of the Bill refers also to section 13 of the 1989 Act. Therefore, the point is covered fully.<P>
I trust that the hon. Gentleman was not suggesting that the child’s behaviour and the breach of the order should be disregarded. There is no difference between us if he shares my belief that involvement in activity that gives rise to the order and any subsequent breach is a deeply troubling matter of child welfare. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Children Act 1989 and the paramount consideration of the child’s welfare apply. There is no conflict between the requirements of the Bill and the 1989 Act.<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw amendment No. 99 because it would restrict the use of a care order when a child safety order is breached. It would reduce the powers of courts to deal effectively with such breaches. Other consequential amendments would be needed to remove subsection (7). Those amendments have not been tabled, so amendment No. 99 is technically defective.<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman’s prime reason for probing this point is to ensure that the requirements of the Children Act 1989 apply. I assure him that they do.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I think that we are making a little more progress. Will the Minister confirm that section 1 of the Children Act will apply and that the child’s welfare will be the court’s paramount consideration? Those requirements should apply to the operation of child safety orders under the provisions of the Bill. Provided the Minister gives that confirmation, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I think I have said that. There is no difference between us, provided that the hon. Gentleman is not implying that a breach of an order should be regarded as unimportant or as inconsistent with the Children Act. I have been trying to tease out the implications of the hon. Gentleman’s question. If it is as simple as it appears to be, then there is no difference between us. Section 1 of the Children Act applies to clause 12(6) of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have got there. People who read this debate in Hansard will understand that the Children Act’s requirement that the welfare of the child should be the court’s paramount consideration applies to the Bill. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Local child curfew schemes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move amendment No. 355, in page 13, line 5, after ‘considers’, insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘that there are exceptional circumstances which make’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
We are trying to make the best of a poor proposal for child curfew schemes. We want to add additional requirement for “exceptional circumstances”. The basis for a scheme, as set out in clause 15, is faulty because powers already exist under the Children Act 1989 for the police and other authorities to deal with young children in various circumstances. We are also worried that the curfew scheme is so cumbersome that it will not achieve its stated objectives. When a group of youngsters is out on the streets causing a problem, speedy action is required but the processes set out in the Bill could take such a long time to be gone through that the problem might already be resolved.<P>
We are also concerned about the 10-year-old cut-off point. If the ringleader of a group happened to be 10 or 11, it would be possible to take out most of the youngsters but leave the ringleader free. The geographical cut-off is also a matter of concern because a problem could simply be displaced from one area where a curfew scheme applies to another where it does not.<P>
Our main objective is to the policing of the schemes. If sufficient police were on the ground in a particular area, that would in itself resolve the sort of problem that the clause is addressing. To bring in a curfew scheme without sufficient policing would be pointless; bringing one in with adequate policing would make the scheme itself pointless because the policing would bring out the desired effect.<P>
We are especially worried about the impact on specific communities in which the presence of youngsters on the streets is a cultural issue; it is the norm in some areas but not in others. The exceptional circumstances envisaged in the amendment would ameliorate some of the problems caused by introducing the generic scheme envisaged in the clause.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for moving the amendment, which seeks to narrow down the application of the clause in a way that would make it unworkable. Nevertheless, he has raised useful questions about the intentions behind the application of child curfew orders. I shall reply in that spirit.<P>
It is interesting to reflect on the progress during the past two years of the debate about child curfew orders. When our proposals were first debated, they were discussed in the press as if they were part of a major draconian exercise that would mean sweeping from the streets all children who spent any time outside the family home. Of course no such scheme was envisaged. Despite the initial expressions of concern, when people who work with children—youth and community workers and others—started to engage with what we were trying to achieve and with the problem that we were seeking to address, they rapidly warmed to our scheme because they realised that the checks and balances was there.<P>
The hon. Member for Hallman mentioned that in certain areas it was the cultural norm for children to be out on the street. I ask him simply: is it right that children as young as seven or eight should be out on the street at midnight or in the early hours of the morning? The answer must be no, except in circumstances such as a family event, circumstances which the order does not seek to address. Youngsters who are around unsupervised that late at night are often, in effect, abandoned onto those streets. They are unlikely to turn up to school the next day and take advantage of the educational opportunities, and it does them no favours. I should be interested to hear an example of a cultural pattern of youngsters aged seven and eight being out as late at night as I have suggested which the hon. Gentleman could defend.<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I would cite my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) who, when discussing this with the Liberal Democrat home affairs team, said that he was happily playing cricket until 10 or 11 at night in those long northern summer evenings with other eight or nine-year-olds and found that perfectly acceptable. The Minister talked about midnight but the curfew orders are a lot earlier than midnight. That is an extreme case.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is interesting that the right hon. Member for Berwicck-upon-Tweed follows the pattern of party leaders of looking back to the halcyon days of their youth. There would be no need to apply the curfew order to happy little well-brought-up children enjoying the long summer evenings. I notice that the hon. Gentleman draws us in both in terms of age and time. One must draw a line somewhere, although there can always be arguments about half an hour either way.<P>
We have sought to set a time period that will make it obvious that a considerable breach is not a marginal issue, but means children out at times when it makes no sense at all for them to be so. That is why I gave the example I did. One then has to come from that example, which I rather divined that the hon. Gentleman agreed would be unacceptable, to the point where one draws the line and makes it possible for curfews to apply.<P>
A number of other hurdles have to be jumped before a curfew is introduced. A scheme must be in place locally: the police, the local authority and other interested bodies must have talked about how the curfew provisions would be used in that area. That gives an opportunity to take into account any cultural requirements, as well as making sure that proper arrangements for consultation can be put in place. It is then possible to trigger the use of the curfew order which also required co-operation between the police and the local authority and consultation with the community.<P>
The views of the community are quite important. This is a concept for the empowerment of parents, for giving them the authority to intervene in a way that good parents should to control the behaviour of their children and when they are out of doors in a group.<P>

<P>

<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Last night, at a meeting in my constituency, local residents and the police discussed the measures in the Bill, including the curfew and a range of measures to deal with youth crime. They welcomed them greatly because they dealt with the practical problems that they all knew about and understood and because they provided them with a range of measures to deal with the very problems that caused much of the crime and nuisance. I hope that other hon. Members would accept that too.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful for my hon Friends comments. It illustrates that we are dealing with problems that arise in our constituencies but which we have no mechanisms for dealing with.<P>
I have another example, similar to my hon Friends: I was asked to attend a meeting in my constituency with the police, local councillors and the head teacher of the local school, at which the nuisance behaviour of young children was discussed. Someone said that children should not be out late at night and that the parents should do something about it. One of the mothers stood up and said, “You are talking about my Johnny and his friends.” Other mothers said, “Oh no, he’s all right.” But Johnny’s mother said, “No, since his father left, I find it difficult to get him to behave and to cone in at night when I want him to. He says ‘Everyone else is still out on the street, why should I come in?’. We need a way of saying when it is reasonable to expect children to be in.”<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That was a plea for a structure in which to support parents in asserting reasonable authority. There are occasions when children test their parents; many members of the Committee will empathise with parents in such circumstances. All my children, the youngest of whom has now reached 18 and relieved me of that responsibility, at various times argued about whether they should be home at a particular time of night. They said, “Oh, we’re going  to an all-night party,” to which I replied, “Oh, are you indeed!”. Very often, the more middle-class parents who have the wherewithal to deal with such situations can use the telephone to ring around, and can sometimes identify the challenge to parental authority of their children’s peer group and nip it in the bud. Those parents can re-assert their instructions, to the effect that if they say that the children must be in by a certain time, they must be in at that time.<P>
The more difficult the circumstance, the more vulnerable the parent, the more difficult the child, the more difficult the area, the more ingrained the habits of the peer group of staying out later and later at night, the more need there is for some measure to allow parents to reassert their authority. In other words, parents should be able to act as their own peer group, with the support of the police and the local authority. Of course, there are hurdles to be overcome; and the powers should not be used gratuitously, or at whim, but when the interests of the children and of the wider community demand that something be done to take a grip of the situation. We intend that action should be taken with the support of the local community. For example, the sort of meeting to which I referred might end up with a discussion about whether a curfew is necessary. It is possible that with the agreement of the community to set a standard, the threat of a curfew might be lifted, because the community can deal with the matter once the problems have been identified and discussions and consultations have taken place.<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister seems to be implying that the proposal is a tool for the parents. Does he envisage that those seeking a curfew will be the parents of the children involved, or might one group of residents seek an order against other residents’ children?<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I would envisage circumstances in which some residents were content for their children to be out of the house as long as they were not bothering them, and others said that the children’s behaviour was affecting them, and was unacceptable. In such circumstances, the authorities would need to discuss the problem first to see whether it could be resolved.<P>
In the circumstances that I have described, when parents welcome, and perhaps even ask for, an order as set out in the Bill, several processes must be gone through before a curfew order is made. I agree that that means there will be a delay, but that will be to good effect: it will allow people to become engaged with the suggestion that the curfew order might be used. The community will have to consider other ways forward, such as the possibility of mediation and consultation, changing patterns of behaviour and giving greater consideration to the interests of other people, and of other children.<P>
I hope that I have made it clear that the delays are for a good purpose. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the possibility of a problem being solved before the process for establishing a curfew had been completed. So be it. the need for a curfew may be avoided, but beginning the process to establish it may be helpful.<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that the provision is not ill considered or crude, but affords an opportunity to support and enhance the way in which communities, especially parents, handle the difficult job of setting effective limits for their children. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We are grateful to the Minister for clarifying the fact that the clause deals with a specific, targeted issue, rather than a general power. We still fundamentally object to the introduction of a new power to ban a whole group of citizens from the streets, even when those citizens happen to be children. However, that matter is best left to the stand part debate, when we will seek a Division on the clause. In order to reach that point more quickly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 102, in page 13, line 8, leave out ‘(under 10)’.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 140, in page 13, leave out lines 27 and 28.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Under the Bill, any local child curfew scheme would be restricted to children under 10. We are worried by the Government’s strange preoccupation with the crimes committed by children under 10. We take seriously the anti-social activities of children under 10, but we wonder why the Government focus entirely on them, and not on older children and teenagers. We are not surprised that all the responses to the consultation paper that commented on the age range of the local child curfew scheme stated that the provisions should not be limited to children under 10, but should be extended. We share that view. <P>
We have two main anxieties. First, restricting the age to 10 severely limits the effectiveness of any local child curfew scheme in dealing with disorder, potential disorder or sub-criminal behaviour, and the sort of behaviour that the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) described as having made an impression on her constituency.<P>
The Government’s White Paper described the local child curfew scheme as a method of tackling anti-social activity and disorder—I was going to say “crime”, but, of course, children under 10 are incapable of criminal responsibility. The White Paper suggests that a local child curfew scheme would deal with the problems caused when<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“young children were regularly congregating at night in the public spaces of a housing estate, making residents’ lives impossible through vandalism, pilfering and abusive behaviour.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Conservative Members think that a local child curfew scheme restricted to under-10s would not meet the objective. Are the Government saying that children aged over 10 would not behave in those ways? Is not it far more likely that although some children aged under 10 might engage in vandalism, pilfering and abusive behaviour, most such behaviour will be caused by older children? That would accord with the everyday experience of people in the type of areas to which the Minister has referred and which was also detailed in the White Paper. If the local child curfew is restricted to under-10s, how do the Government propose to deal with the problems caused by 11, 12, 13 or 14-year-olds?<P>
There is not much evidence about the operation of curfews, but there is some limited evidence from north of the border. In south Lanarkshire a local curfew scheme has operated since October 1997 for youngsters of up to 16 years. I have seen the figures up to the end of January—the Minister might have more recent figures—which suggest that in 77 per cent. of cases of intervention because of the curfew the youngster concerned was over the age of 10. some of the remaining 23 per cent. of cases of children aged under 10 involved very young children, who were taken home for their own welfare, not because they were causing problems to local people. there were reports of children as young as four, who were found some distance away from their homes.<P>
It seems clear from that evidence that the greatest value of curfew schemes lies in dealing with problems caused by children and teenagers who are over the age of 10. Conservative Members cannot understand why on earth the Government want to restrict such schemes to the under-10s. That would not deal with disorder.<P>
The restriction seems even stranger because the Minister told us in an earlier debate that anti-social behaviour orders will not normally be sought against the older age group, even though such young people will be eligible for them. The Government are taking a considerable power to tackle the problem of local disorder, but they are restricting it to very young children. There are no alternative powers to deal with the over-10s, leaving them unhindered by any curfew. Will the Government reconsider these inherently flawed proposals to control local disorder?<P>
Our second anxiety is that the job of the police might be made more difficult. Under the proposals, if the police were dealing with any mixed group of under and over-10s, they would have to sort out the under-10s from the over-10s. In many such situations, the immediate instinct of the police would be to deal with the problems caused by the group as a whole, rather than separating out the younger children while the older children might continue to misbehave.<P>
There have been many comments from consultees on that matter. One of the objections to the age limit came from a police authority. Others who are involved in the field cannot see the logic of the proposals and realise that they will create difficulties for the police. The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“It is difficult to see it as a good use of police time to sort out the nine-year-olds and the 10-year-olds in such a group and to take the former home.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That adds very little to the powers of the police to protect a child. Under section 46 of the Children Act 1989,<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Where a constable has reasonable cause to believe that a child would otherwise be likely to suffer harm, he may significantly remove the child to suitable accommodation.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The age restriction will cause the police serious difficulty. The Opposition are concerned about the use of police time. The police are in the front line fighting g crime and we want them to do that. The order concerns part of that job, and we appreciate that the police have a child welfare function, but, we wonder whether sorting out under-10s from over-10s in any group is a good use of police time.<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment no. 140 relates to clause 15(6), and it is quire important. The local child curfew scheme is already restricted to children under 10, but subsection (6) restricts it further, by providing:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“A notice given under a local child curfew scheme . . . may specify different hours in relation to children of different ages.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
What on earth are the Government thinking about, envisaging such a power? Are we to conclude that they contemplate sub-curfews for younger age groups: six-year-olds to be in bed at 6 o’clock, seven-year-olds at 7 o’clock, eight-year-olds at 8 o’clock and so forth? Opposition Members have used the expression “nanny state” in Committee sittings, but this really would be it. The police would be turned into nannies, searching out children of different ages to see whether they were in breach of a curfew at different times. That is an even bigger nonsense than the age limit of 10, which makes a mockery of the Governments objectives and, like subsection (6), would make the job of the police harder.<P>

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): Very briefly; would the police be meant to identify a child’s age? Would it be up to them to make an assumption about it and for the child to prove otherwise: or if the child said, “I am over 10” would the police have to walk away? Perhaps the child would have to carry proof of age to be sure of being able to go out in the street.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) on being the only Member of this Committee or any other that I can recall—who has kept so strictly to a promise to be brief.<P>
There is always a difficulty for the police in determining age, such as in the case of purchases that can be made only by persons of 16 or 18. That difficulty would also occur with the age limit of 10 for the curfew or with the limit of 14 proposed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. Simply raising the limit would not remove the problem, but would change its focus. I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman thinks that that would be simpler.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister said that my amendment stipulated an age limit of 14, but amendment No. 102 would merely delete the age limit of 10. It would not specify an alternative age, which means that the matter would be left in the hands of local authorities, as is the case in Scotland where such curfews already exist.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am always willing to be corrected by an experienced barrister like the hon. Gentleman. However, the amendment would limit the age to under 14. The reference to children in clause 15(2) attracts the definition of child in clause 104(1), which refers to<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“a person under the age of 14”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
If the hon. Gentleman did not intend to introduce such a limit, he should have drafted the amendment with greater care.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that the Minister’s explanation does not become too technical because he might find himself in deep waters. I am not an expert on definitions. However, if he is going to rely on a definition of children and young persons that refers to an age limit of 14, I hope that he is not suggesting that we are dealing with a criminal measure that adopts the same definitions as criminal legislation. Let us not get too technical, however, because I am sure that the Minister understands the practical point that I make.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> These are not merely technical matters. The amendment would enable curfews to be imposed on those over the age of criminal responsibility, which is 10. We chose the age of 10 to avoid that problem.<P>
It is entertaining to see the Conservative party in action in opposition and the hon. Gentleman’s ability to move amendments with a straight face. It is good to see enthusiasm for this Government’s proposals, given that such measures were not even entertained when the Conservative party was in power. We should welcome the one sinner who repents and not carp about his attitude.<P>
We have introduced a measured and carefully designed proposal, which I was pleased to explain in detail when I responded to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan). However, the attitude of the Conservative Members is odd. They want to raise the age limit to 14—perhaps they even want the age limit of 93 or over—so that it appears that they are doing more than the Government. They also want to extend the provision to a far wider group of children.<P>
The police identifying ages is a problem, but it is one that is well understood. We have chosen the limit at the age of 10 because that is the age of criminal responsibility. We shall later deal with the doli incapax rule, which deals with children just over the age of 10 and places a limit on their responsibility. Youth offending teams will take action on young offenders. A limit of 10 is therefore not only logical but answers some of the points made by the hon. Member for Hallam who expressed concern that the power is a radical innovation that could be misused.<P>
We must strike a balance. Our proposal is careful and limited. If, in the fullness of time, it is seen to work, Parliament may wish to consider whether the age limit has been set too low. However, we have taken a logical approach that should command general support. The opposing approaches of the Conservative party and Liberal Democrats confirm our views that we have got the solution about right.<P>
More needs to be done to prevent children under the age of criminal responsibility from turning to crime. Early behaviour may effect the likelihood of offending later in life. Research shows that the younger a child begins to offend or become involved in anti-social activities, the more likely they are to continue offending. We know of neighbourhoods, such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North, where people are troubled by the criminal and anti-social activity of unsupervised young children late at night. The younger the age at which it starts, the more likely it is to develop into the teens and the more it is seen as scandalous by local people. That is why we want to take a step forward and deal with youngsters who are most at risk themselves—on the welfare criteria used by the hon. Member for Hertsmere—by placing a limit on their capacity to be outside late at night.<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The Minister mentioned research and wondered whether he knew of any that showed the importance of the time of day. The intention of the curfew is to prevent young people from going into crime, but crime might be committed not after 9 o’clock at night but on the way home from school or when not attending school.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. As to the issue of missing school, that is precisely why we are taking measures to deal with truancy, and we shall have an opportunity to debate them shortly. There is an element of displacement, but being out late at night might be causing a nuisance to the community and damaging young people’s opportunity of engaging with their education—their best route out of difficulties and likely future offending. That amounts to a double whammy of problems that the curfew order is intended to address. It is not intended to deal with other issues such as schooling, parenting and other social problems. I accept the hon. Gentleman’s point in that respect, but the curfew does deal with the problem that it is intended to address.<P>
Local child curfews will form one optional part of a wider community safety strategy and will be applied at the instigation of the local authority when it believes that there is no other way of dealing with the particular issue of unsupervised young children. Removing the upper age limit, as in amendment No. 102, could mean in theory that any person up to the age of 14 may be affected.<P>
However, one of the main thrusts of the youth justice reform programme is to seek earlier, more effective intervention to prevent young people from engaging in anti-social and criminal activities in the first place. Far too little has been done to target and prevent the first steps taken by young children into criminal behaviour. The local child curfew is one measure intended to turn off children below the age of 10 from being drawn into anti-social activity. The Committee has already discussed in some detail the proposals for anti-social behaviour orders which, in certain circumstances, can apply to those over the age of 10.<P>
Moving on to amendment No. 140, subsection (6) gives the local authority flexibility to adjust the conditions of a curfew notice so as to meet the needs of the local community and local circumstances. the local authority can set different hours of the curfew period for different age groups. The local authority might want to set a later hour in the summer for the older children—for example, the eight and nine-year-olds—than for those under the age of eight. The grandchildren of the right hon. Members for Berwick-upon-Tweed can continue to play cricket in the summer evenings up to a reasonable time. But the distinction between the age groups does not have to be made; the provision merely provides the local authority with some flexibility. Relevant factors working against making any age distinction could be considered by the local authority as part of its consultation.<P>
I hope that with that explanation the hon. Gentleman will accept that the amendment is inappropriate. Our proposal is carefully targeted at stopping under-10s from engaging in anti-social behaviour. We want to ensure that appropriate discipline is in place and that authority is given back to parents to enable them to give their children a decent start in life. We need to monitor how it will work and ensure that other measures advocated by the Government are appropriately applied.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister’s response but it fell below the standard of some of his other responses and is not what we expect to hear from a Minister. Our proposal was put forward as a constructive amendment to improve the Bill. It was not tabled as an opportunistic political opposition for the sake of it. Our duty on a crime and disorder or criminal justice Bill is to consider it in a constructive and sensible way, whatever others may have done in the past when they were in the same position.<P>
I am not satisfied by the Ministers response. I do not want to be technical; I am thinking of how the measure will work in practice, but if the Minister wants to get technical about it, he will see that there is no definition of a child in the Bill. If he is adopting the definition of a child for criminal purposes, his debating point may have worrying implications for example, he might in effect be labelling all the children in an area as criminals. The Minister will know that there are other definitions of a child in the law, and I naturally assumed when I read the Bill that that is what the Government were using, not the criminal definition.<P>
I am concerned about what happens in practice. I cannot for the life of me see how the proposal will be of practical help in tackling the problems caused by children in an older age group.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman should avoid a scattergraph of allegations about what the Government are doing. Our proposals are sensible, coherent, self-contained and reasonable and provide an opportunity to tackle real public mischief.<P>
If the hon. Gentleman wants to get technical, I point him to clause 104, line 41 on page 85 of the Bill, which states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“‘child’means a person under the age of 14”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That should be clear enough for the hon. Gentleman<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If the Minister wants to get supertechnical, perhaps he will explain to those of us who did not peruse page 84, clause whatever it is, why the chapter of the Bill has a definitional section in which it defines child safety order, curfew notice, local child curfew scheme but not child. Is this another example of the Government trying to hide something away in a different part of the Bill? I do not want to be technical about the issue—<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Yes, you do.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> No, I do not, because we are concerned about what happens in practice. We want to help local people and local authorities—those who have to administer a child curfew scheme—and those who may benefit from one. We want to help them with what happens in practice. We cannot believe that the proposal will fulfil the Governments objective to tackle disorder generally. Yes, of course it may deal with problems caused by the under-nines and under-10s, but they are not the only source of disorder. I look to the Minister to tell me if it is really his experience that children under the age of 10 are responsible for most of the mischief made by children as a whole. I look forward to the Minister telling me that he thinks the under-10s get up to more mischief than, for the sake of argument, under-14s.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman is getting really silly now. Of course I am not saying that mischief undertaken by under-10s is greater than that of the over-10s is greater that that of the over-10s. What I am saying is that children under the age of 10 are below the age of criminal responsibility and therefore not subject to the variety of sanctions and measures available to the police, local authorities and others to deal with problems that arise. The Government recognise that there is a problem. A few minutes ago, the hon. Gentleman asserted, rightly, the primacy of care in considering the interests of those under the age of 10. Up to now, the Government of which the hon. Gentleman was a member for at least part of their 18 years in office did not allow the intervention of the order that we are introducing in to nip things in the bud in resect of those under the age of 10. We are tackling that problem; we are dealing with the mischief. We deserve the hon. Gentleman’s support, not his technical interventions or his slightly absurd attempts at sarcasm.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Those who read Hansard will see that it was the Minister who introduced technical matters. He is in danger of slipping back into an oppositional mindset, wanting to make debating points. It would be regrettable if the Minister were to carry on in that tone.<P>
The proposal will not achieve the Government’s objective. They talks about helping housing estates, where residents’ lives have been made intolerable by vandalism, pilfering and abusive behaviour, but the measure will not help; it will make the job of the police more difficult. Although we take a constructive line on these matters, we cannot for the life of us see the sense of this proposal. We do not want to pass legislation that is unworkable and flawed.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman holds his life very cheap if that is set against his capacity to understand what we are saying. It must be palpably obvious to anyone who thinks about this for a moment, let alone anyone who has had experience of working with youngsters in the problem areas that are described in the consultative document to which he refers, that if things are nipped in the bud with children under 10, they can be stopped from getting into patterns of behaviour which worsen as they get older.<P>
Police officers up and down the country have told me that they increasingly have problems with children under the age of 10 but that nothing can be done. These children are let out by their parents late at night and no one seems to care about them. This Government cares. The hon. Gentleman seems to want to introduce an element of confusion into this well-targeted measure. I cannot understand what he thinks he is playing at unless he has been told that whatever common sense the Government offer in response to this crazy amendment, he must insist on pushing it to a vote. If he does not he is simply being party political and opportunistic.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is getting ridiculous. He said that it must be clear to anyone with any experience. It was not clear to Rugby borough council, Labour crime lawyers, the city of Coventry, Nottinghamshire county council, the Sussex police authority and many others. They were consultees and were not persuaded.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I understand that. They did not have the benefit of my explanation to the Committee, stimulated by the constructive probing of the clause by the hon. Member for Hallam earlier. The hon. Gentleman has had that opportunity. That is why I am so surprised by his approach today.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am surprised that the Minister described the Liberal Democrats’ approach as constructive; they have been entirely consistent about this. They will vote against the clause and we will not. The Minister is falling out with us; we are just trying to make it a bit more workable, yet we are accused of this strange political opportunism of trying to make any trouble we can which we share with Labour lawyers and all of those local authorities. Some of them may be Conservative but others are definitely not.<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend is not aware of the current realpolitik. The Liberal Democrats are potential coalition partners and we are not.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. Even if the Liberals vote against the Government, the Government are still nice to them. We are doing our level best to be constructive and practical. If we see something impractical, we will vote against it. We are not persuaded by what the Minister has said and we will vote against the amendment.<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> - on behalf of the Howard League.<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No. I want to say a few words on behalf of Barnardos. Is that a suspect organisation nowadays in the Labour party’s view.<P>
All members of the Committee would be horrified at the thought of their children playing alone or with a group of other children on the streets, on estates or in the countryside without parental supervision after dark. Whatever the experiences of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed in his halcyon youth, we know that playing cricket on a beautiful twilight evening in north London is different from people’s experiences on the estates of, for example, Sheffield.<P>
We should press the Government about the child curfew schemes. It is impossible to vote against the principle of the schemes, because a problem exists, but will the schemes make a difference? Will they solve the problem of children who play on the streets and terrorise communities? What good will it do for a policeman to pick up a child and take him home to a mother who lives alone in inadequate housing, and cannot cope? The problems are caused by deeper rifts and disasters in society than a child curfew scheme can tackle. It would be foolish to believe that the schemes were anything more than a tiny band-aid on a gaping wound.<P>
Let us consider some of the problems with child curfews. Barnardos feared that there might be local variations, and was also worried because the schemes would be left to local authorities, which might be inexperienced in such matters.<P>
Apart from anecdotal evidence, what proof exists to show that under-10s terrorise communities? What evidence shows that returning them to a home where they may suffer violence or abuse, through alcohol or drug misuse, will solve the problem? Does the Minister have evidence to show that existing legislation is inadequate? Section 28 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 enables the police to take children home. Why does that section not work in this instance? The police have powers to take children home if they find them in unsuitable places.<P>
Barnardos also mentioned sections 46 and 47 of the Children Act 1989. The police and local authority social services already have the power to investigate children at risk and, where appropriate, to take them to a place of safety. That Act received widespread support. It puts the welfare of the child at the centre of the consideration by the police and local authorities. Why is that not adequate? These children are under the age of 10: they are extremely vulnerable children who may have had a difficult time at home. What is the evidence—I do not just mean anecdotal evidence that there is problem on the estates—that a blanket curfew will provide the protection that they need?<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government must come clean here. To what sort of neighbourhoods will these curfews apply? They will apply not to middle-class areas but to estates and disadvantaged communities. The expert that Barnardos produced, Bob Holman, a national expert working with disadvantaged communities, said that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“although a curfew would probably be welcomed by a lot of tenants it would be no solution. What the ‘problem families’ need are resources, places to go, friendlier neighbourhoods, not to be confined in claustrophobic and barren houses.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
What are the answers to the points that have been made? The general point that I want to impress on the Minister, with which I am sure he disagrees, is that it is vital that we consider children not as members of a group but as individuals who need to be looked after and cared for, particularly if they are under 10. Many of these problems result from poverty, but we must ask why, despite the fact that we are so much more prosperous a society than we were 20 or 30 years ago, let alone 40, 50 or 60 years ago, the problems are so much more serious than they were when people were much poorer.<P>
One solution, if it was a solution, lay in the traditional make-up of families which was much stronger, particularly before the second world war, than it is now. Moreover, local policemen were prepared to walk the streets on the beat. They knew everyone and were prepared to take immediate salutary action with children. We all know what that was. No one suggests that that would be the right solution now. No one is prepared to table an amendment to the Bill to that effect, but we must be realistic.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain what he is talking about?<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister knows perfectly well what I am talking about. Policemen were knowledgeable about their districts and were looked up to as strong authority figures. To put it simply, children were frightened of them. When I was a boy I was scared stiff of these people in uniform and would not dare go near them. I am not saying that I was ever hit around the ear—I was not that naughty—but I want to bring a note of realism into our debate. There is no point in having a party political ding-dong across the Committee, kidding ourselves that giving the police another power which they apparently have already to take children back to their totally inadequate homes will solve the problem in any shape or form. If the Minister can convince me that there is hard evidence that it will, I will be more convinced about the point and the usefulness of the clause.<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I support much of what the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) said. However, I would stress that there are still perfectly good and decent children out playing cricket late at night on estates in Sheffield. Being a child in a poor area of town does not necessarily mean that one is a trouble maker. We would defend the rights of children to go out to play at a reasonable time of an evening. We do not wish to see that prevented or to see them all stigmatised or characterised as being of a particular type.<P>
The question is not whether there is sometimes a job to be done: In certain circumstances, there will be a job to be done in dealing with the problems caused by certain groups of youngsters, but we question the scale of the problem and whether this is the right tool with which to tackle it.<P>
In our view, specific problems with specific youngsters—whether single ones or a group—can be dealt with by  existing measures. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) set out various measures relating to children that could be used to deal with the problem.<P>
Policing the situation properly is the key. Moves towards greater community policing are taking us in that direction and could be taken much further. The curfew is not the answer. Policing and the engagement of the appropriate authorities, including social services, will lead to a solution that may begin to deal with some of the underlying issues that have been discussed.<P>
The Government are slightly misguided in stressing good parenting. They say that parents should take responsibility by telling their children, “Don’t go out—it’s your bedtime.” However, they also say that an external tool is needed to deliver the message, “Don’t go out because a policeman will stop you.” There seems to be a conflict between stressing parents' responsibility for dealing with the situation and bringing in a big stick from outside.<P>
Under such circumstances, we do not believe that more legislation is the answer. That is not about being soft or not wanting to deal with the matter. This is not a partisan issue and it should not be tackled as such. We must decide how big the problem is and how to deal with it appropriately.<P>
We believe that telling a group of citizens that they cannot go out on the streets because of how they are categorised is a huge step in civil life. That applies whatever the part of town in which those citizens live and whatever their age group. We do not believe that the step is justified in the way in which it is set out in the Bill. We want powers under the Children Act 1989 and under other pieces of legislation to be used more effectively in conjunction with better policing. We will therefore vote against the clause.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall respond briefly. I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Hallam will vote against the clause, but I understand the reasoning behind his decision.<P>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that most children grow up in a healthy manner. They are caring and responsible and can look forward to a positive future. However, the hon. Gentleman seems to agree that some situations give rise to problems. There are pockets of difficulties.<P>
I wish to clarify that the measure is one among many. We are trying to ensure that a range of measures will be available for different age groups and for different circumstances and which can be triggered when they are needed.<P>
I agree that parents should not need outside help. However, sometimes they do need that help—indeed, sometimes they are crying out for external assistance to enable them to exercise their parental responsibilities. That is especially true when there are peer group pressures on their children. There may also be peer group pressures among parents when some parents do not take their responsibilities as seriously as others. Discussing the possible introduction of a curfew may assist debate within the peer group of parents about how to set limits for their children.<P>
In some ways the hon. Member for Gainsborough must have found it difficult to make a speech that displayed internal tensions. He seemed to want torecognise the pressures of social causes in misbehaviour, in crime and disorder and in the neglect of children. That concern has not been heard from Conservative Members for 18 years. I was happy to note that he respected the police as a child and to learn from his delphic reference to police behaviour that he retreated from the possibility of physical intervention. He may be interested to know that such matters were debated in much the same in the 1920s as they are now.<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about the need to treat children as individuals. However, I believe that there is a need to treat the child as an individual and that there is a need to deal with children as a group. Peer group pressures among children can often be the most significant pressures on an individual.<P>
If a police officer returns a child found in breach of a curfew order to his or her home and is not satisfied that the child can safely be left there, the officer can use the existing powers under the Children Act 1989. Section 46 of the Act states that the child can be taken into police protection. Therefore, it is wrong, to suggest that the police could be putting children at greater risk. Police and social service departments already have powers to deal with children who are at risk.<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough said that we were discussing very vulnerable children. In some cases, they will be vulnerable in those circumstances. In other cases, if seven and eight-year-olds were out on the streets until midnight and later, they would be exceedingly vulnerable. That is becoming a problem in some areas and that is why we are introducing the measure.<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Do not the powers exist already? If the police saw a seven-year-old out in the street after midnight, do not they already have the power to assist that child?<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> One of the problems is that sometimes the police think that something needs to be done, but it is not part of the common arrangements that they operate with social services. One of the underlying themes of the Bill is that problems should be identified locally as part of the crime and disorder audit, and that appropriate steps should then be taken to deal with them. Individual cases involving the care of a child, or the need for protection of a child are covered by the 1989 Act. It is much more difficult for the police to deal with more general problems. That is why we need to consider the powers relating to truancy and we shall be discussing those in a later amendment.<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The Minister’s response to my intervention seems to be to quote from another clause, or another Act. He is not dealing with the management of the situation or the resources to manage it.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> We want to ensure that there are a range of options for those who have to deal with the problems. I accept that the evidence is largely anecdotal, but the police and others, including me, see that there are problems with youngsters in a vulnerable age group being out at a nonsensical time.<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> We have narrowed it down. The police have adequate power to intervene if they think that a child is at risk. They can take him home and ensure that he is looked after.<P>
We are now discussing children who are not at risk to themselves, but who are a risk to other people. These are children under the age of 10 who are potentially acting in a sub-criminal way—if I may use the terminology favoured by the Committee. It is no good for the Minister to say that he is not making criminals of such people. His word is not good enough. They are being drawn into the net of the state. The state is not looking after children because they need protection from themselves or from others, but because society needs to be protected from them, although they are under the age of 10. The Minister would be more honest if he admitted that, and said that the Government’s view of Britain now is that society needs protection from children under the age of 10.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> If children under the age of 10 are acting in a way that causes a nuisance to other people, the Government believe that society should deal with that problem. We must protect the victims, but we must also protect children from the consequences of developing such patterns of behaviour at an early age. There is much evidence to show that the younger that children are involved in anti-social behaviour, the more likely they are to become involved in increasingly anti-social and criminal behaviour later in life. That destroys their own lives as well as being bad for their victims and for the community as a whole.<P>
Society and Governments have closed their eyes to their responsibility to deal with such issues. The Government have made it clear that we shall keep the age of criminal responsibility at 10. However, we have a responsibility to intervene to prevent children under the age of 10 from being drawn into the precursors of criminal activity. The first responsibility lies with the parents, but there are also responsibilities for schools and for social services in individual cases.<P>
There are circumstances in which the application of the powers under the curfew order will assist in dealing with a peer group of youngsters whose pattern of behaviour in an area leads to a problem. I hope that that is clear to the hon. Member for Gainsborough; I appreciate his wish to find ways of critically examining every part of a sentence, but it all hangs together.<P>
There is something odd if the hon. Gentleman believes that children of seven or eight are not at risk if they are out at midnight or later. It should not require the exercise of powers under the 1989 Act to nip that pattern of activity in the bud, which is what we propose.<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a consistency among Government members of the Committee in supporting this type of measure; there is an inconsistency in hon. Gentleman’s talking about a piece of band-aid stuck on the gaping wounds in society. For the past 18 years, we have been pointing out the consequences of some of the previous Government’s social policies. We believe that if behaviour causes a problem to society we must deal with both the behaviour and its underlying causes. That is what we mean by being tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. The hon. Gentleman must look at what he says in our sittings to consider whether he is being either at present.<P>
The question whether local government has the right approach is dealt with by requiring the Home Secretary to approve a scheme. We do not need anecdotal evidence of children terrorising neighbourhoods; all we need to do is to say that there is evidence that children are out at night, causing a nuisance to others and placing themselves at risk. Our proposal is sensible and straightforward; it can be applied when it is needed when the circumstances are right, in consultation with the local community and in agreement with the police and the local authority. If it is not needed it does not have to be used, but it is there to be used in those circumstances which are appropriate in accordance with our description of the measure and the circumstances that should trigger its use. I commend the clause to the Committee.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> There we have it. We now have a Minister saying, as we approach the millennium, that in our society children under 10 are engaging in behaviour that is inconvenient, or threatening to society, or that could lead to their becoming criminals—<P>
<B>Mr. Michael rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I shall finish my sentence and then give way to the Minister.<P>
Not even in the darkest days of the middle ages, when they were hanging everybody for virtually any crime, did anyone think that children of seven or eight could be considered as criminal. But here, as we approach the millennium, we have a member of the new Labour Government admitting that. I find that intensely threatening.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would accept what I say and not seek to distort or misrepresent my words. He entirely misrepresents what I say by stating that acts committed by those under the age of 10 will be criminal acts. We do not say that; we say that children under the age of 10 are below the age of criminal responsibility and are vulnerable. Does the hon. Gentleman deny that the action of children under the age of 10 sometimes give rise to problems and concern by people in the wider community, and act as a signal to be concerned about those children?<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Of course the actions of children may cause concern, but children must be viewed purely as vulnerable individuals who must be looked after as individuals, not as part of a group or as a threat to society. The Minister is playing with words, using semantics. Whatever he may say, he knows that he cannot get away with criminalising children under 10 in the European Court, or with those who express a civilised opinion.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> In a moment. In order to get around that problem, the Minister says that he is not criminalising children, but effectively he is doing so. He admitted that these children are a threat to society and that their behaviour could lead to their becoming criminals in later life. That is playing with words. The Minister may now intervene if he wishes to do so.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He should not misrepresent me, and that is what he is doing. It is perfectly correct to say that there are patterns of activity and behaviour by those under the age of 10 which act as predictors of criminal activity later in life. If he talks to a nursery school teacher or anyone else involved in the early learning or welfare of children, he will be told that indicators of later criminal behaviour can be found in early behaviour. That is quite different from the suggestion that the behaviour of under-10s is criminal. By definition in law—the only context for such a definition—the behaviour of youngsters under the age of 10 is not criminal behaviour. Attempting to do something about such behaviour—because it is damaging to the youngsters as well as those affected by them—is not to criminalise it.<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am not sure now whether I am intervening on the Minister or he on me. I have made my point and we all know about indicators of criminal behaviour in young children. That was not my point. The Minister is now slapping curfews on very young children: for the first time, the state is taking upon itself a broad and general power to give to its local executive agencies the power to remove children from public places and take them home. That may be something about which we should not worry. However, the Minister is defending it purely in terms of the language of the Children Act 1989—that children should not be under threat from other people, that they should not be out in the street so late at night, that they are in danger—which is all well and good, but I suspect that many will recognise that the sub-text is very different.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall say one thing only. If the hon. Gentleman believes that we should not intervene at all in the behaviour, however bad, of children under the age of 10, he must clearly vote against the clause. That seems to be his purpose, but I believe that he is wrong.<P>

<H4><center>Meaning of “racially aggravated”</center></H4>
<P>
</FONT><B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 356, in page 21, line 28, after ‘victim’s’, insert ‘actual or presumed’.<P>
We welcome clause 25, which would increase protection for racial groups and send out a signal that society deplores racial motivation in crime, in particular. It would enshrine in law society’s refusal to tolerate it. We hope that the clause and the penalties established in connection with it will help to reduce racially motivated crime.<P>
The amendment is intended to ensure that it would not be possible to use as a defence under the clause the fact that the victim was not a member of the race that the evidence of racial motivation implied. We want to remove any escape route for defendants who, while racially motivated, mistook their intended target. I hope that the Minister will clarify that no such escape route would exist, or, if he cannot do that, accept the amendment or draft another to similar effect.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I recognise the intention behind the amendment and am pleased to confirm my view that it is not necessary. I agree with the hon. Gentleman; the clause is intended to cover cases in which the victim is of a different racial group from that against which the attacker has shown hostility. The fact that a Bangladeshi was the victim of abuse that was intended to be directed at Pakistanis should not let the perpetrator off the hook.<P>
I shall consider the matter further, but our current view is that clause 25 covers the eventuality envisaged by the hon. Gentleman; the perpetrator would be guilty of the offence if he was shown to have demonstrated racial hostility or motivation, regardless of whether he correctly identified the victim’s race. The important factor would be that he was motivated by racism or demonstrated racist hostility, however misinformed he might be.<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine will accept my view, as I think that we agree about what should be achieved.<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I welcome the Minister’s assurance that he will continue to consider the matter, as his answer did not suggest total confidence about the effect of the clause. I understand what the Minister intends, but perhaps it would be worth considering on Report whether a loophole might exist. The Minister’s answer left a seed of doubt about that.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am certainly happy to consider the matter further. If the hon. Gentleman has points in mind that lead him to feel concerned, perhaps he would write to me. I shall take into account any support he might offer for his view. However, we examined the clause in the light of his amendment, and believe that it is safe. I hope that he will therefore withdraw the amendment.<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> With that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 349, in page 21, line 34, after ‘race’, insert ‘religion’.<P>
My right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary carefully set out the Opposition view on the important and sensitive subject of racially aggravated offences on Second Reading. Courts have regarded a racial aspect of a case to be an aggravating factor, and judges have taken account of it in passing sentence. The clause will put the matter into the hands of a jury and it will have to return a verdict on a separate offence.<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment deals with our general concerns. A new approach to dealing with the racial element in offcences is being introduced, but we must be careful that it does not create new anomalies and new problems. To avoid that, it is important to take account of offences that have a religious motivation. The definition of “racial group” in the clause does not refer to religion. However, we should make provision for religiously, as well as racially, aggravated attacks.<P>
Many respondents to the Home Office consultation paper on racial violence and harassment thought that religion should be considered in this context. In particular—although not exclusively—organisations representing the Muslim community were concerned that religion should be included in the definition of a racial offence. <P>
Some attacks are prompted by hostility towards a victim’s membership of a religious group. Some attacks may have a mixture of motives. Racially and religiously motivated attacks would be caught by clause 25(1)(b) which refers to cases when<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the offence is motivated (wholly or partly) by hostility towards members of a racial group”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
When an offence is based on a mixture of racial and religions motives, will the Minister confirm that the religious motive will be caught by that provision and that it will be dealt with as a racially aggravated offence?<P>
Other attacks are motivated exclusively by religious hatred, with no evidence of racial motivation. What is the Government’s approach to such attacks? In particular, will the Minister tell us whether an offence will be treated as an aggravated offence if it is motivated by hostility towards membership of a religious group? We are entering important and sensitive territory and we look for the Minister for a considered response.<P>
I do not want to anticipate the Minister’s response, but he might tell us that religion was not included in previous legislation’s definitions of racial offences. He might refer to the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986 and the offence of stirring up racial hatred. The definition of “racial” in this Bill bears a close resemblance to that in the 1986 Act. Has the definition come from there? It would be fair for the Minister to make such a comparison, but matters have moved on since 1986. Voices have been raised in favour of bringing religion within the ambit of existing legislation on such offences.<P>
The Government are introducing a new way of dealing with a variety of racial offences, but a later amendment questions whether their approach goes far enough and deals with all potential offences. Nevertheless, the Government have taken an across-the-board approach that embraces different offences.<P>
We understand the concerns of those who fear that offences involving religious hatred will not be treated with the same seriousness as racial attacks because they are not covered by the Bill. Robust criticisms of the Bill have suggested that the Bill will cause problems. We acquit the Government of that charge; we do not believe that the Bill stirs up problems for specific groups. However, we must ascertain whether the way in which the Bill tries to tackle racial problems creates anomalies and difficulties.<P>
Many voices in the consultation paper come from the Muslim community, from which other members of the Committee as well as me may have received submissions. Will the Minister explain precisely the position of Muslims under the Bill, especially with regard to racially aggravated offences? Would an attack on a person solely because he or she was a Muslim be regard as a racially aggravated offence?<P>
After studying some of the submissions from the Muslim community, I understand the anxiety that exists about the Bill, especially since Muslims have specific, identifiable cultural characteristics. The Muslim community is worried about a phenomenon that it perceives as Islamophobia. I hope that the Minister will respond to the Muslim community’s worries and to those of other groups on the important subject of religion in relation to racially aggravated offences.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I acknowledge the need to deal positively and sensitively with one of the great issues of our time. Racism is a cancer in society; it destroys families and communities and does pernicious long-term damage to society as a whole. A close relationship often exists between a community’s ethnic origins and its religious beliefs. I share the hon. Gentleman’s view that we must deal with the problem of Islamophobia and gain the best possible understanding of how the law can be applied equally to all communities, irrespective of people’s race and creed.<P>
Trying to deal with such matters is difficult and sensitive, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has sought to build on the consensus that racism needs to be tackled. I welcome that positive element of the debate.<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about an attack on a Muslim. If an offence is motivated partly by hostility to a racial group, that is enough to fulfil the requirements of clause 25(1)(b). An attack is often motivated by a mixture of racial and religious reasons.<P>
The definition of “racial group” as<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
is not new. The same definition is used in both the Race Relations Act 1976, which deals with racial discrimination, and part III of the Public Order Act 1986, which deals with incitement to racial hatred. That answers one of the questions.<P>
We considered carefully whether the offences in the clause should be extended to cover religious as well as racial groups. But the aim of the clauses is to deal with the specific problem of racial crime because of its scale and the impact that it has on society. To include religion explicitly would extend the scope of the offences considerably, and would risk diluting the emphasis on race and the strength of the message that the Bill sends to the victims of racial violence and harassment.<P>
There are difficulties in defining “religious aggravation” which are not addressed by the amendment. References to “religious belief” or “faith groups” do not define the extent of “religion”—hence there are technical as well as general problems. An attack motivated by religious hostility, as opposed to racial hostility would, of course, still be covered by the existing law, so there is no question of condoning any such behaviour. It is also open to the courts to consider whether an attack on a person, because of his, religion should be considered as an aggravating factor in sentencing. The hon. Member for Hertsmere is right to say that in the past the courts considered matters such as racial elements as aggravating features. It is important that such matters are not only dealt with by the courts as in the past but are seen to be matters about which Parliament has explicitly held a view and built into statute.<P>
It is also important to note that as a result of case law arising from consideration of the definition of a racial group under the Race Relations act 1976, some groups are covered by the definition of “racial group”. The Jewish community has been concerned about these matters—understandably in view of the history of this country and elsewhere—but it is covered by the “racial group” definition, as indeed are Sikhs. In future, other groups may be identified as falling under a similar category and will be treated similarly under the law.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am listening most carefully to the Minister’s courteous response. He is right about the Jewish community, and we welcome his comments. However, the Committee may be interested to know that the Inter-Parliamentary Council Against Anti-Semitism believes that religion, and damage to religious sites, should be included. That shows how many different organisations are likely to believe that.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I want our law on violence committed against religious groups to be as strong as it is for dealing with violence against racial groups. However, we must be careful to ensure that any legal instrument hits its intended target. I referred a few moments ago to the definition of religion and faith groups. It is clear that the Jewish community has a specific religion and that it is classed as a racial group under the law. For other groups, such as new organisations that spring up from time to time from other countries, definitions in law can cause problems. It is easy to identify mainstream religions groups such as Christians, Muslims, Sikhs and Jews but it is more difficult to identify others.<P>
We also condemn violence between different religious groups—whether between Muslim and Sikh or any other combination—and I assure the Committee that the law will not “protect” the Sikh who attacks a Muslim or vice versa. In some cases, closer inspection will establish that an attack on a “Muslim” is in fact motivated not by the victim’s religion but by his race. That situation would be covered in the Bill.<P>
Amending the definition of what constitutes a racial group would have consequences beyond the scope of the Bill and would have significant implications for the most important piece of civil legislation dealing with this matter, namely the Race Relations Act 1976, which is an inappropriate vehicle for such a step. The Government are aware of various concerns. I draw the Committee’s attention to the fact that the Home Secretary has already announced research into the scale and nature of religious discrimination and I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will agree that that is in the spirit of the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will that research include religious attacks within the framework of the Bill?<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> They will be considered as part of people’s experience of discrimination. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is important to consider such matters.<P>
As far as the new offences are concerned, many incidents that appear to be religiously motivated turn out, on closer inspection, to be racially motivated. We will highlight that in guidance to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service because it is important that they are alert to such possibilities.<P>
The Bill goes a long way to address some of the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised. We want to go further: that is the point of the research set in train by the Home Secretary, and we shall keep these matters under review. The clause is intended specifically to target racially motivated crime, and this will protect those identified as racial, groups that fall within the law now and which will continue to fall within the law in future. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment, although we shall continue to debate the important issue that it raises. <P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his courteous and considered reply. These matters need to be dealt with in a temperate and sensible way.<P>
There is a degree of common ground between us. The Minister accepted much of my understanding of how the Bill will operate. I accept that when there is partial racial motivation, offences that have a mixed religious and racial motivation will be covered by the Bill. I am anxious about exclusively religious attacks, cases in which the only evidence that exists shows a religious motivation, with no evidence of racial motivation. Sadly, such attacks take place, especially on members of the Muslim community, which feels strongly about the matter. As the Minister knows, people from many different racial groups belong to the Muslim community. Many have cultural characteristics—the men may sport beards, and the ladies wear head dresses—which mark them out as Muslims, irrespective of their racial group. It is those characteristics which, in the eyes of the Muslim community, sometimes give rise to attacks. If the only evidence available suggested that someone was attacked because he or she was a Muslim, and there was no evidence of another reason for the attack, the case would fall outside the Bill’s provisions.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman’s point, but in most cases a purely religious motivation for the attack is unlikely. As I said in response to an earlier amendment, if the attack is undiscriminating in respect of the specific racial origins of the person being attacked, the case would fall within the provisions of the Bill as drafted. I will look at the matter again, but I believe that that is correct. Therefore, although in a sense such an attack could be defined as not being racial because it was an attack on a group which includes a number of different races, it would be racial if the motivation was such. I shall certainly reconsider the matter and write to the hon. Gentleman about it. The circumstances that he has described may be covered, as we intend.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not think so and I therefore beg to differ with the Minster. What he says is true if there is a mixed motivation, but not if there is no motivation and if there is no evidence of such motivation. As the Minister will know, these are criminal matters, in which evidence will have to be proved to a criminal standard if there is to be a conviction. The only evidence might be a religious motivation. That might be the truth. There are depraved people who attach others because of their membership of a religious group. If someone is attacked only because of his religion, he will not be covered by the measure.<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman’s last point. The amendment deals with race. However, it is more likely that the attack would be more general. It could be upon a community which included a number of races, but which shared a specific religions belief and form of dress. That would be covered under the Bill, as I understand it, although I repeat my undertaking to reconsider the matter and to come back to the hon. Member for Hertsmere.<P>
If there is a specifically religious motivation, the courts could and would take that into account as an aggravating factor in deciding upon the sentence.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That brings me to my next point. Before we leave this one, I am grateful for the Minister’s offer to write to me and would ask that he respond to the following question. If an offence is motivated exclusively by religious hatred—say, towards a Muslim, because there were a number of such examples in the consultation paper—will he state specifically whether that would fall within the provisions? Would it be treated as an aggravated offence?<P>
The Minister says that even if such an offence does not fall within the Bill’s provisions, it could be dealt with under the existing law. That brings me to the next problem with the Government’s approach. The Minister said that the Government have gone a long way towards addressing such concerns. Other Ministers have spoken about sending out a signal. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine also mentioned that matter. We all wish to send out signals about racial attacks.<P>
It is all very well to say that we are sending out signals about racist attacks and erecting a new system, but there is then a problem for people in other groups who have to be dealt with under the existing laws. They feel that they are being left out of the new system. Members of the Muslim community have put forward that point of view.<P>
I chose my words carefully and hope that hon. Members will realise that I tried to choose the right words to describe the reaction of the Muslim community. I have seen publications from the Muslim community which contain descriptions of the Bill that are way off the mark. It is not legitimate to attack the Bill in some of the ways that I have seen, and I would acquit the Government of some of the claims that have been made.<P>
The Government have adopted a new approach for certain types of offence, but the victims of other offences feel left out. They might not only be members of religious groups, but could be in other categories. That is the problem that arises if one particular type of offence is regarded as an aggravated offence, to be taken out of the hands of the judge to be dealt with in a special way. What about all the other people who are victims of an offence that they rightly regard as equally aggravated? The Government must address that problem. They have created a new system, but they must take care not to create new difficulties and anomalies, which will cause resentment.<P>
<B>Mr . Michael:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the purpose of the amendments is to address a long-standing cause of concern, namely the racial element in attacks? That involves various forms of criminal behaviour. That focus of the amendments would be diluted and complicated if we included other issues. If there are other forms of prejudice, based on religion or lifestyle, which lead to aggravated offences, society must deal with that and such features would certainly be taken into account by the courts. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that these clauses should go through Parliament with a clear signal of Parliament’s objection to the racial element in harassment and in attacks? We wish to condemn racial harassment and to work to eradicate it from our society.<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We all share the Minister’s objectives and want to improve the law as much as is practicable to deal with such attacks. However, the Minister must confront the problem of how the matter is perceived by others in different groups. Inevitably, that will give rise to difficulties. Other countries have more widely ranging legislation to deal with what are sometimes described as hate offences. I am not advocating that step, without giving the matter more thought than is possible under the present circumstances. However, the Government must think carefully about the question of religion, and consider why religion could not be brought within the systemthat they are creating. They must do that in view of the serious concerns that some religious groups, including Muslims, have about the Bill’s provisions.<P>
I will think carefully about what the Minister has said. I will not press the amendment to a vote. However, it raises what I regard as a serious subject. I want to consider how the Bill can be improved so that it deals with the matters that I have outlined. I do not think those matters have been addressed sufficiently. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
