						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000405"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b>
Mr. Bayley, I trust that, like the rest of us, you are
refreshed after our short break.</div>
					<a name="08022725000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
requires local authorities to arrange learning difficulty assessments
for young people with statements of special educational needs who are
expected to leave schooling during or at the end of the current school
year. Every Child Matters and Youth Matters signal the
Government&#146;s commitment to giving local authorities
responsibility for Connexions services, and those assessments are
currently carried out by Connexions.</div>
					<a name="08022725000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a statutory transition
planning process for young people with special educational needs
statements beginning in year 9 and continuing until the young
person leaves school. Connexions, and specifically
personal advisers, take the lead in supporting young people with
learning difficulties at key points of transition. For example, the
personal adviser might decide that a young person with learning
difficulties would benefit from school-college link courses, or from
work placements. Personal advisers also make sure that young people are
aware of the various learning options, such as diplomas or the
foundation learning tier, available to them.</div>
					<a name="08022725000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Carrying out a learning
difficulty assessment is part of supporting and planning for
transition, working closely with professionals supporting young people
with special educational needs to ensure that all the young
person&#146;s needs are fully met. In completing the assessment, the
Connexions personal adviser works closely with the professional service
that has been supporting the young person through school, and other
specialists help. The personal adviser also works closely with the
young person and their family and/or carers to ensure that the learning
difficult assessment adequately reflects that young person&#146;s
needs. Once a young person has started a new course, Connexions will
also follow through to check that the provision is suitable.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column694" />Column number: 694</div>
					<a name="08022725000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The transfer
of legal responsibility for the assessments to local authorities would
put local authorities&#146; accountability for them in law on a sure
footing. The Bill widens the circumstances in which the assessments
should be carried out to cover not only those who are leaving school at
the end of their compulsory schooling, but those who remain in school
after the age of 16 but subsequently leave to pursue education or
training elsewhere. That might be the case if a young person wishes to
remain in school to improve his or her GCSE results, for example, and a
year later, having done so, wishes to attend college. Or it might be
that a young person simply changes their mind about what provision best
meets their needs.</div>
					<a name="08022725000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The extension is a necessary
measure arising from our reforms of 14-to-19 learning and the proposals
to raise the age of compulsory participation in learning. It means that
those young people who are subject to a statement of special
educational needs who leave school to pursue further learning at any
point after the end of compulsory schooling, rather than at the end of
year 11, will have their future needs
assessed.</div>
					<a name="08022725000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
requires the assessment to be carried out at any point during a school
year. For young people who have very clear long-term plans, the
assessment would ideally be carried out in the autumn term of their
last year of schooling, to support applications to colleges and other
forms of higher learning. That will be set out in guidance to local
authorities. However, some young people change their minds and decide
to go into further education or training quite late in the school year,
so it is right that the local authority should carry out the assessment
at whatever point in the year is sensible for the young person
involved. Stipulating a certain time in the year when the assessments
need to be carried out risks local authorities missing hundreds of
young people who make the decision to continue in learning after that
point.</div>
					<a name="08022725000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is intended to ensure that if young people with special educational
needs in their last year of compulsory education change their plans at
short notice, the duty to arrange an assessment applies. I am delighted
to tell the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that this is
already the case and that the amendment is therefore unnecessary. If a
young person is of compulsory school age, the local authority is
already under a duty to arrange for the special educational provision
set out in a statement. It does not matter whether that provision is
delivered in a school or in other appropriate settings, although the
statement may need to be amended to take account of the new
environment. During year 11, if the young person intends to carry on in
further education, training or higher education, they will receive a
learning needs
assessment.</div>
					<a name="08022725000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to remember that the local authority must arrange for an
assessment to be conducted at some time during a young person&#146;s
last year of compulsory schooling. That duty applies whether the young
person has clear, fixed long-term plans or makes a decision, or changes
their mind, in late August, say after their GCSE results. In the latter
case it might be that, for practical reasons, the assessment is not
carried out until early September, but that does not stop the duty to
arrange the assessment from applying.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column695" />Column number: 695</div>
					<a name="08022725000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment, as worded and as
positioned in the clause, would apply only to young people in
compulsory schooling. However, I am also happy to reassure the hon.
Gentleman that, should a young person beyond the age of compulsory
schooling decide that school is no longer the right environment in
which to learn and transfer to alternative provision, either
immediately or at the beginning of the next year, the duty will still
apply. Again for practical reasons, if the young person leaves school
at short notice, the actual assessment might take place after they have
left and quite possibly are already undertaking alternative provision.
That does not stop the duty from
applying.</div>
					<a name="08022725000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis
of that fairly full explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						<a name="08022725000406"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I am
grateful to the Minister for his response. I am reassured that the
circumstances envisaged by the amendment are already covered by
existing legislation. However, the clause as drafted seems to say that
new section 139A(2) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 will apply only
if the local education
authority</div>
					<a name="08022725000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;maintains a
statement of special educational needs for a person,
and...believes that the person will leave school, at the end of
his last year of compulsory
schooling&#148;.</div>

if those two conditions are met will the requirement

					<a name="08022725000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">apply.</div>
					<a name="08022725000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister briefly explain why the duty still applies and why the
person who is staying on to the sixth form will still get an
assessment? If the young person is not leaving school, I would have
thought that the condition in proposed new subsection (1)(b) would not
apply and that, therefore, the assessment under subsection (2) would
not be required. I am happy to rely on the Minister&#146;s assurance,
but it might be clearer if that particular point of principle was
addressed, if he is able to respond to that
point.</div>

second, I am sure that my swift reading of the clause will
help.</div>
					<a name="08022725000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
best thing for me to do would be to write to the Committee, reiterating
that staying on in sixth form with a statement lasts until 18. I will
signpost for the Committee exactly how that works in the wiring of the
Bill, because I do not have that immediately to
hand.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Gordon Marsden</b> (Blackpool, South) (Lab): I beg to move
amendment No. 160, in clause 65, page 35, line 22, leave out
&#145;may&#146; and insert &#145;must&#146;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column696" />Column number: 696</div>
					<a name="08022725000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Bayley, I
apologise for my late arrival at the sitting.</div>
					<a name="08022725000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say at the outset that the
proposed amendment is probing; I will not be asking the Committee to
vote on it this afternoon. Also, some of the ground covered by the
amendment has been covered previously in Opposition amendments. I was
encouraged by some of the assurances that my hon. Friend the Minister
was able to give and the importance that the Government attaches to the
position of young people with special educational needs in the context
of the Bill and specifically in the context of assessments.</div>
					<a name="08022725000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment comes from the
Special Education Consortium. I emphasise that the
fact that it is a probing amendment in no way diminishes the importance
of the subject matter. The purpose of the amendment, which deals with
some of the issues we have discussed from a different direction, is to
give local education authorities, which, through the transfer process,
are taking on onerous responsibilities for the first time, a duty to
conduct a school-leaving assessment for all young people who have
learning difficulties, not just those who have an SEN
statement.</div>
					<a name="08022725000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
already heard, currently the Bill contains only a power for LEAs to
assess those young people with SEN but without a statement. It was the
poet Stephen Spender who said that power ends in weariness and duty,
but in the context of the amendment, power and duty are separate:
power, is only a pale imitation of duty. It is the concern that that
power will not empower young people with special
educational needs that brings the various organisations in the Special
Educational Consortium, including Barnardo&#146;s, I CAN, the Royal
National Institute of Blind People, the Royal National Institute for
Deaf People and the National Autistic Society to voice their concerns.
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry) and I expressed
those concerns when the Bill that became the Education and Inspections
Act 2006 was going through Parliament, so this is not new territory for
me.</div>
					<a name="08022725000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consortium is
concerned because the proposal to extend to the age of 18 the
requirement to stay on is a crucial one for disabled pupils and pupils
with special educational needs. It is decidedly not the case that all
those young people who fall into the category of having special
educational needs have statements. We have heard again some of the
arguments for that. For example, the Disability Rights Commission found
in a 2003 survey that non-disabled young people are twice as likely as
their disabled peers to transfer to sixth form or college at 16-plus.
That has a significant impact on their life chances. According to DRC
statistics, by the age of 19, 9 per cent. of non-disabled young people
are not in education, employment or training, whereas three times as
many, 27 per cent. of disabled young people, are NEET. Because of this,
disabled young people and young people with SEN have the most to gain
from participating in education and training between the ages of 16 and
18.</div>
					<a name="08022725000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The former Select
Committee on Education and Skills considered those matters. We have
heard previously how important it is that the support that is given to
young people with special educational needs is continued post-16 in a
way that it has not been in the past. The direction of Government
policy is to reduce reliance on statementing. The guidance issued by
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column697" />Column number: 697</div>Department for Education and Skills in 2001
highlighted all the advantages of that approach, but the Department
showed its concern about the statementing by asking the Select
Committee to look again at the question of separation of funding from
statementing. We have heard in a previous debate about some of the
pressures that may bring some local authorities to duck out of
statementing.</div>
					<a name="08022725000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall,
however, there is no doubt that new legislation needs to support and
not undermine the cultural shift against statementing. LEAs do vary in
their policies on issuing statements. It is not always the case that,
for example, young people who come under School Action or School Action
Plus have missed out of statements. It is not as simple as that; the
process is much more complex. Furthermore, there is great variation in
LEA statements in practice. I can confirm that from the evidence that
was taken in the Education and Skills Committee&#146;s SEN
inquiry.</div>
					<a name="08022725000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I am
asking the Minister to do this afternoon is to reflect further on some
of the points that have been made and to go away and talk with his
officials about how some of the guidance might be beefed up. There is a
real concern in the SEN community that, as an unintended consequence of
the transfer process, the situation in which we have first-class and
second-class special educational needs young people&#151;those who go
through a proper assessment process and those who do not&#151;could,
in some cases, be at risk of expanding. I know that that is not the
Government&#146;s intention, nor the intention of anyone on this
Committee, but because those concerns exist in the community, I ask the
Government to reflect further on what more they can do to ensure that
those fears do not become a
reality.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000410"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> My hon. Friend the Member for
Blackpool, South seeks to amend the clause to extend the duty on local
education authorities to arrange for learning difficulty assessments to
be conducted so that all young people who appear to an authority to
have a learning difficulty, whether or not they have had a statement of
special educational needs, are assessed. The extended duty would apply
to young people who are in their last year of compulsory schooling or
who are over this age but not yet 25 and are expected to undertake
further education, training or higher
education.</div>
					<a name="08022725000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate my hon. Friend on consistently championing the cause of
young people with special educational needs. Earlier this month at
departmental questions, he pressed my ministerial colleagues and me on
what more could be done to improve provision for young people over the
age of 16 with special educational needs. I understand that the
amendment is supported by the Special Education
Consortium.</div>
					<a name="08022725000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I set
out in an earlier discussion, I do not think that it is in the best
interests of all young people with learning difficulties to put them
through a formal assessment automatically, when one might not be
necessary. Obviously, I will reflect on what my hon. Friend has been
saying and discuss it with ministerial colleagues. We do not want the
two-tierism that he and some others fear in which different individuals
get different treatment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column698" />Column number: 698</div>
					<a name="08022725000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Children who are the subject of
a statement of special educational needs have the most severe and
complex needs. Therefore, it is right that the local authority has a
duty to carry out a learning difficulty assessment when they leave
school if they are moving into further education, training or higher
education. However, even though young people with learning difficulties
but without an SEN statement are not covered by the duty, the local
authority has the power to arrange for such a assessment. There will be
many instances in which it will be appropriate for such young people to
receive an assessment, and where a young person would clearly benefit,
the local authority would be expected to arrange for an assessment
using that power.</div>
					<a name="08022725000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local authorities could be
legally challenged if there is an unreasonable failure to exercise the
power to arrange for an assessment that the clause gives them. We will
issue statutory guidance to support local authorities in their decision
making in this area. In effect, we will have something that feels a lot
like a duty and a power but is judged on a case-by-case basis and with
the sort of flexibility that some hon. Members on the Committee would
want. I do not believe that it is right that we should compel
assessment for every person. It is right that we should take a
case-by-case approach.</div>
					<a name="08022725000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis of what I have
said and my promise to continue to listen to the arguments and discuss
them with my noble Friend Lord Adonis, who is responsible for such
matters within the Department, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw
his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08022725000414"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> We are back to where we left off this
morning, discussing careers education. Clause 66
amends part 7 of the Education Act 1997, which requires state schools
to provide all pupils with a programme of careers education,
appropriate information and up-to-date reference materials related to
career options. Section 44 of the 1997 Act requires schools to provide
access to external careers advisers to provide careers advice and
guidance to pupils.</div>
					<a name="08022725000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 66(2) requires all
secondary schools to present careers information in an
&#147;impartial manner&#148; and to provide careers advice that is
in the &#147;best 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column699" />Column number: 699</div>interests&#148; of the pupil, and not to promote the interests of the
school or of &#147;other persons or institutions&#148; in a
way that is &#147;contrary&#148; to the pupil&#146;s interests.
Subsection (3) requires that the information and reference materials
provided represent a &#147;full range&#148; of learning career
options and not to &#147;unduly promote&#148; one option over
another. Subsection (4) requires schools to have regard to guidance
issued by the Secretary of State that is intended to support them in
delivering all of the above. Those comments refer to the Education
Skills Bill as introduced in the House of Commons on 28 November 2007.
Those, effectively, are the duties in part 7 of the 1997 Act as amended
by subsections (2) and (3) of clause 66.</div>
					<a name="08022725000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments are designed to
ensure impartial careers advice. As I said, clause 66 amends part 7 of
the 1997 Act, which requires state secondary schools to provide pupils
with appropriate careers advice and appropriate information of the sort
that I have detailed.</div>
					<a name="08022725000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 58 would leave
out paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed new subsection (2B) to section
43 of the 1997 Act. How can those giving careers advice in schools,
many of whom kindly take up this extra responsibility, know exactly
what is in the best interests of pupils with regard to their future? In
many schools, only those who give up time in addition to their teaching
responsibilities are able to provide advice and guidance to pupils, but
they cannot always do so with the degree of expertise, and therefore
empiricism, that should be required by the law and is certainly needed
by pupils.</div>
					<a name="08022725000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The legal
requirement is that all options should be made known to pupils. The
information should be made available to them. Proposed new subsection
(2B) states
that</div>
					<a name="08022725000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any such
information must be presented in an impartial
manner&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022725000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both things are
more likely to happen if we are clear now about the expertise and
impartiality required in every type of school and every set of
circumstances. That is what the amendment is designed to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="08022725000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
amendment No. 46 would remove paragraph (b), because if careers advice
is both full and impartial, it clearly will not be promoting the
interests of a particular school or institution. By definition, it is
likely to offer a range of options, detached from those narrow
considerations. My suspicion is that the paragraph was inserted as a
result of the Government&#146;s desire for more pupils to take up the
new diplomas.</div>
					<a name="08022725000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
support for the diplomas is known; indeed, in Committee I
welcomed them on behalf of the Opposition. It is important that we do
all that we can to ensure that diplomas are a success, but we will not
do it by skewing the advice that pupils are given to promote diplomas
rather than letting them stand on their merits, with people choosing
them because they feel that they are the right option.</div>
					<a name="08022725000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are worries about the
future status of A-levels and how advice might play a part in that.
Those worries have been broadcast in the media and I will deal with
them, perhaps more appropriately, when we discuss amendments Nos. 47
and 48. At this juncture, however, it is worth saying that certainty
about the empiricism of advice would to a large extent assuage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column700" />Column number: 700</div>fears that A-levels were likely to be undermined by a Government
determined to make diplomas work at all costs.</div>
					<a name="08022725000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to say more than
that at this stage, but I hope that the Minister will give an
unequivocal assurance that he is as committed as I am
to professional, independent and empirical advice and guidance being
offered in
schools.</div>
					<a name="08022725000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000415"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Clause 66 aims to ensure that schools
discharge their statutory duty to provide careers
education impartially. If the intention of the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings is impartiality, we are as one in that
respect.</div>
					<a name="08022725000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools
should not seek to promote their own interests over those of the
pupils, and that is the clear intention behind the clause. As the range
of learning options increases in the coming years, and particularly as
the set of qualification choices distils down, by and large, to
A-levels, diplomas and apprenticeships, it will be important that young
people are provided with high-quality and, importantly, impartial
advice on the full range of options that are appropriate to them as
individuals. Research evidence suggests that some schools are not
acting impartially and are, for example, directing pupils into their
own sixth forms, where they might not be able to pursue a full range of
learning
options.</div>

							<b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): Does the Minister concede
that the existence of league tables sometimes encourages schools to act
in such a perverse way that is perhaps in the interests, not of the
pupils, but of the school, the perception of the school, and perhaps
the career of the head
teacher?</div>
					<a name="08022725000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000417"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> We are talking about careers advice and, in that
regard, about choices that are made at 16. League tables, in so far as
they are published by local and national newspapers that rank the
assessment and attainment tables that the Department publishes, focus
largely on GCSEs rather than on post-16
qualifications, so I do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point, interesting though it is, necessarily applies in this
case.</div>
					<a name="08022725000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000418"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I am not sure that I accept that the media focus
entirely on GCSEs. When I was in my previous shadow ministerial role,
August was ruined for both the Minster and me because we had to comment
on a succession of exam results. I think that he would probably agree
that there was far more media interest the day before and the day of
the A-level results, when we were both on duty from about 5.30 in the
morning until after midnight. That was not the case for GCSE results a
week
later.</div>
					<a name="08022725000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000419"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Indeed, the media take a huge interest in
broadcasting images of attractive young women opening A-level result
envelopes. That is a truism that will continue for many generations to
come, I am sure. I am not saying that the media are any more or less
interested in A-levels over GCSEs, but on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
specific point about league tables, there is a difference between how
A-levels and GCSEs are used.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column701" />Column number: 701</div>
					<a name="08022725000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
requires information given to pupils to be impartial and that any
advice promotes the pupil&#146;s best interests above those of the
school, as I have said. Amendment No. 58 would remove entirely the
specific duties placed on schools when giving advice. There would no
longer be an explicit duty to give advice promoting the best interests
of the pupils over those of the schools. That strikes at the heart of
the intention of impartiality behind the
clause.</div>
				
					<a name="08022725000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

					<a name="08022725000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000420"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Minister implies that, unless
instructed to do so, schools and teachers will not give high quality
and impartial advice, is that right? He suggested that only by
stipulation is that degree of impartiality likely to prevail. That is a
bit of a snub to the head teachers and teachers throughout Britain, is
it
not?</div>
					<a name="08022725000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000421"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Naturally, I would love to believe in the notion
that every school will act perfectly. However, as I
said earlier there is evidence&#151;a departmental research report, a
National Foundation for Educational Research report for the Nuffield
review of 14-to-19 education and training, and a further departmental
research review&#151; showing that there are schools that do not act
impartially in their advice and guidance, and put the interests of the
school over those of the individual pupil. Therefore, regardless of
whether I would like to believe that everyone will act in the best
interests of the pupil over the school, the evidence is to the
contrary.</div>
					<a name="08022725000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to remove only paragraph (b) of proposed new subsection
(2B). The intention of the inserted paragraph is to clarify the
importance of presenting pupils with advice covering all the options
available to them, rather than those available only at the institution
at which they are
studying.</div>
					<a name="08022725000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
some relationship to the new 14-to-19 curriculum and set of
qualification choices that we are offering. We have said that the full
entitlement that will be available from 2013 to every 14 to 19-year-old
of all 14 diplomas plus the new three that will also come on stream and
the new expanded apprenticeship options, will not be deliverable by one
institution alone. We have always been explicit about that, even when
describing only the original 14 diplomas. It is therefore important
that we make it absolutely clear to educational institutions that they
should not be partial in favour of an
institution.</div>
					<a name="08022725000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment substantially reduces the degree to which impartiality is
defined by the clause by removing the paragraph that makes it explicit
that schools, in giving advice, must not seek to promote their own
interests over those of the pupil. We believe that the paragraph that
would be removed is a key element of the clause, as it makes clear the
type of impartiality we are seeking to address. Its removal would have
no benefit and would undermine the potency of the clause. I am sure
that, as a potent politician, the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings will therefore wish to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022725000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000422"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Minister is not entirely convincing on the
matter. The general secretary of the National Union
of Teachers&#151;a gentleman for whom I know that the Minister, like
other members of the Committee, has the highest possible
regard&#151;states:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column702" />Column number: 702</div>
					<a name="08022725000081"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If there is a major
educational reform, then the professional judgment of teachers has to
be trusted. You can&#146;t put a set of restrictions in there about
their judgment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">He was
speaking specifically in relation to the clause and to this
matter.</div>
					<a name="08022725000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
doubts about whether the purpose of the Bill, as it
is currently drafted, will deliver the impartiality&#151;the
empiricism, as I described it earlier&#151;that the Minister says
that he wants, or whether it is designed, in its critics estimate, to
slant the system towards a particular outcome that the Government
want.</div>
					<a name="08022725000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the view
of some parliamentarians. From the discussions that I have had with my
hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I think that
he has doubts in that regard. It is certainly what a number of people
in the media think. In no less a paper than <i class="I">The Times, </i>a
headline on 14 January stated, &#147;Teachers told not to promote
A-levels&#151;Ministers accused of favouring new diplomas&#148;.
Again, that is specifically in relation to the clause and to the
Minister, so it is
worrying.</div>
					<a name="08022725000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000423"></a>Jim

Gentleman that he really should not believe everything he reads, even
in <i class="I">The</i>
						<i class="I">Times</i>. Even in &#147;The Thunderer&#148;, they
sometimes get it wrong and they got it wrong in this case. The hon.
Gentleman quoted the NUT. I would reply by quoting the CBI report
&#147;Shaping up for the Future&#148;, which
says:</div>
					<a name="08022725000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
a worrying bias. This is particularly the case in schools with sixth
forms which promote academic options above other post-16 routes of
progression.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is an advocate of vocational learning; he should surely
understand that there is evidence of impartiality and he should
withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022725000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000424"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> How things change. How we are truly now the
people&#146;s party. The Minister quotes the CBI, and that must be
taken into account. But I do think that our shared
ambition for high-quality, independent advice is best guaranteed by the
quality of those offering that advice. As I said when I moved the
amendment, it is critical that both the people giving and receiving the
advice are made aware of all the options and the implications for
subsequent employment
opportunities.</div>
					<a name="08022725000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">To that
end, I will go with the Minister as far as to say that I have little
doubt that he believes in vocational education as strongly as I do. I
hope that by the end of our considerations, he will share a faith in
A-levels with a similar passion to that of my hon. Friend the Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. If we can reach the balance in
Government that we already have in Opposition, we will have travelled a
very long way indeed. In hope, rather than expectation, therefore, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000428"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> This set of amendments is very much on the same
theme. Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 suggest that the advice that is given
to young people in respect of their educational
options should include encouragement to study one or more A-level
courses, provided such courses would be in the best interests of the
pupil concerned. So it is a &#147;caveated&#148; amendment, because
clearly, it would not be in the best interests of all pupils to study
one A-level. Indeed, the Minister has alluded to this, so I will rise
to the challenge and say that I am strongly in favour of a vocational
route with the same rigour, integrity, transparency and accessibility
as the well-established academic route.</div>
					<a name="08022725000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said, there are
doubts about the Government&#146;s commitment to A-levels, and, both
in the Government&#146;s interest and certainly in the
nation&#146;s interest, those doubts should be assuaged. The
Government have done themselves no favours in this
respect, by introducing the so-called academic
diplomas. The Minister said in response to the previous debate that
&#147;he was a great advocate of vocational education, so what was I
talking about?&#148; That was the gist of what he said, but in a
slightly more elegant way&#151;I do not want to undersell him.
However, he really should have drawn attention to not vocational
diplomas but the academic diplomas, which will be direct
competitors to A-levels.</div>
					<a name="08022725000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000429"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I hate to seek to correct the hon. Gentleman,
especially when he has been so generous in giving way, but we do not
recognise such a thing as &#147;either&#148; academic
&#147;or&#148; vocational diplomas. They all will offer
both.</div>
					<a name="08022725000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000430"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> It is the tragedy of the Government&#146;s
unwillingness to accept the integrity of vocational learning, that, in
their view, to have legitimacy the subjects must be academicised. The
Government have so little faith in practical competence, so little
belief in the idea that the acquisition of practical skills could
deliver individual worth and do good for the country, that they have to
dress them up as quasi-academic qualifications. I do not buy that any
more than William Morris or John Ruskin would have bought it, both of
whom the Ministers should see as people who inspired their side of
politics when it was a more noble thing than it is
now.</div>
					<a name="08022725000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister does
himself no favours when he admits that the qualifications will not be
rigorous, vocational ones, but some kind of halfway house between
practical and academic subjects. That is why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column704" />Column number: 704</div>we have tabled the amendments. If people want to study an academic
subject, it is much better that they go by an academic route towards
well-established, highly-regarded, already-accepted
A-levels&#151;accepted by both the world of work and the world of
learning.</div>
					<a name="08022725000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
amendment deals with Oxbridge. That is an interesting subject about
which I have interesting things to say. The Minister is a product of
Cambridge university. With the greatest respect, Mr. Bayley,

						</b> I am from a red brick university and am proud of
that. The university of Nottingham is an Ivy League red brick
university, but it is not Oxbridge. Nevertheless, I am more than happy
to emphasis that Oxford and Cambridge universities are widely regarded
as being among the best in the world. Yet, we read once again in <i class="I">The
Times</i>&#151;the Minister has said that he is not a great fan of
<i class="I">The Times</i> &#151;that there are alarming
misconceptions in state schools about the
opportunities that exist for pupils at Oxbridge. It
said:</div>
					<a name="08022725000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The MORI
survey of 500 teachers was commissioned by the Sutton Trust, an
educational charity committed to increasing university intake from
deprived backgrounds. It found that nine in ten teachers underestimated
the number of Oxbridge students from state schools. Sixty per cent.
thought that fewer than 30 per cent. of Oxford and Cambridge students
were from state schools. The correct figure is 54 per cent.</div>
					<a name="08022725000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">More than half thought that it
was more expensive to study at Oxbridge, although both charge the same
tuition fees as most other English universities, and offer generous
bursaries.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The take-up
of bursaries is a problem, however, which it is not appropriate to go
into now.</div>
					<a name="08022725000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
disturbingly, and highly relevant to the amendment is the fact that
while 54 per cent. of teachers said that they always or usually
encouraged their most able and gifted children to apply to Oxford or
Cambridge, 25 per cent. of the teachers surveyed said that they would
very rarely do
so.</div>

						</b> Absolutely. It is vital that we broaden access to
higher education and my hon. Friend is a persuasive advocate of that
cause. The Government and the Opposition share that
objective, but access should be broadened not by imposing curious
sociological targets on universities, but by providing the right
information and support to young people early on about the
opportunities that are available. If young people&#146;s expectations
are changed, mountains can be moved. If we combine that with a more
creative approach to modes of learning&#151;part-time study, modular
study 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column705" />Column number: 705</div>and so on&#151;we can broaden access in a much more effective way than

now.</div>
					<a name="08022725000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 48
states that any advice offered in respect of the obligations in the
Bill should include, where appropriate, advice about studying for a
degree course at Oxford or Cambridge. Much more must be done to dispel
the myth, which is prevalent among many young people and, according to
the study that I have described, among many others including those who
are advising young people, that Oxbridge is for the very few
and are not the sorts of places that disadvantaged young people should
aim to go to, as my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster mentioned. I
think that this amendment will at least oblige the Minister to consider
that. If it is pressed, it could have a legislative effect. However, at
this stage let it be taken as a means of doing the former, not the
latter.</div>

Williams:
						</b> I shall speak briefly to amendments Nos. 47 and
48. Despite what the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
said about the parity of esteem that exists in his own mind between
vocational and more traditional academic courses, that is not the
signal that is sent by the amendment. There is a lack of consistency
compared with his normal logical strain of
argument.</div>
					<a name="08022725000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite his
mention of William Morris and his interest in arts and
crafts&#151;perhaps he should have mentioned Pugin in this
setting&#151;I find it rather strange that the hon. Gentleman is
asking to put in the Bill the deliberate promotion of one course of
study that is open for somebody aged 16. If that proposal was framed in
the legislation, it would suggest that that course is held in higher
esteem than all other courses open to young people now and in 2013 when
the provisions will become law. I have heard him talk many times with
passion and interest about apprenticeships and diplomas, which is
probably quite out of character compared with most of his colleagues,
so I am rather surprised that he is seeking to promote one course of
study over another in the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022725000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have more
sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve with
amendment No. 48. I would have even more sympathy if he had included
Bristol and Nottingham and not just Oxford and Cambridge in the
proposal.</div>

							<a name="08022725000436"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Before the hon. Gentleman moves on to discuss his
sympathies, I wish to ease his doubts about supporting the amendment. I
remind him that it specifically talks about the course being</div>
					<a name="08022725000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in best interest of the pupil
concerned.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worded

							<a name="08022725000437"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I had noted that caveat. I read the amendment
several times, and I wished to support it&#151;we have been fairly
consensual so far. However, if such a caveat were in the Bill, it would
send the wrong signal to young people at 16 that a course of study
should be specifically promoted over and above all other level 3
alternatives that will be available by 2013, when compulsion kicks
in.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column706" />Column number: 706</div>
					<a name="08022725000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 48 would promote
Oxford and Cambridge universities. I would perhaps have more sympathy
if it promoted my own university, Bristol, or the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s, Nottingham. There is still a mystery,
Mr. Bayley, as to where you went, but I gather that you are
not going to enlighten us on that. Perhaps it was York, which is a fine
university.</div>
					<a name="08022725000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that we agree that the advice that should be offered to young people of
whatever age should be as aspirational as possible to ensure that they
aim high and that they are stretched to their full potential. They
might not spot that potential in themselves, and perhaps some of their
teachers or their own family would not spot it. However, quite
often&#151;the hon. Gentleman is right whether he is citing <i class="I">The
Times</i> or any other source&#151;young people are held back not by
their own limitations, but by the limitations that are placed upon
them, perhaps by the community that they come from or because of their
family background.</div>
					<a name="08022725000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some empathy. As the hon. Gentleman and other members of the
Committee may know, I come from a deprived community in south Wales. My
father was road worker and my mother was the school dinner lady. It was
considered almost heresy in my school in the south Wales valleys when I
rebelled against what was traditionally expected and applied to English
universities. The teaching staff in my school had been to
either Swansea or Aberystwyth. They are undoubtedly fine
establishments&#151;I do not wish to denigrate them in any sense
whatever&#151;but if I had gone to Swansea or Cardiff, I might have
had to live at home. Part of the attraction for me at the time was
going away from home to study at another institution and at a top-rated
history department, which Bristol university certainly had. The advice
and support that I got at the time was sorely lacking. That was 20
years ago, so I hope that the situation now would be different for
somebody in similar circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08022725000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">We hear&#151;perhaps from
research from the Sutton Trust to which the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings alluded&#151;that young people can be held
back by a lack of encouragement; encouragement that they need if they
are to see those dreaming spires that they might not otherwise
recognise. Ironically, when I was at school, the only teacher who
really encouraged me to apply over the border to Oxford was the
needlework teacher&#151;her brother had been to Oxford. It will not
surprise people to learn that I did not take needlework myself; I am
vocationally self-taught in such matters&#151;being single, I had to
be. Seriously, that was the only encouragement that I was given. None
the less, I ended up at Bristol university, which certainly changed my
life for the
better.</div>
					<a name="08022725000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Twenty years
on there are still some serious issues. We have discussed them, so I
shall not go too far down this path, but when we discuss widening
participation or higher education in general in the Chamber, we find
that there are still some serious issues about the intake at some of
our top research-intensive universities. I have some sympathy with the
amendment, but I wonder whether it is right to put the measure in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000438"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> What a fascinating debate it has been reliving the
student days of members of the Committee. I obviously agree with the
intention&#151;when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column707" />Column number: 707</div>I judge it charitably&#151;behind the amendments, but I would argue
that they are unnecessary. I should say in passing that I was delighted
to hear the hon. Member for Bristol, West disagree with the hon. Member
for South Holland and The Deepings, because I had begun to worry that
the Opposition parties were joined at the hip on the Bill. To hear some
disagreement is healthy.</div>
					<a name="08022725000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is designed to
ensure that schools specifically promote the take-up of A-levels if
they are in the child&#146;s best interest. It is unnecessary.
A-levels are one of the range of options on which the young person
would be provided with information. Under the clause as drafted, if the
careers adviser believed that A-levels were in the young
person&#146;s best interests, they would already be required to
advise them of
that.</div>
				
					<a name="08022725000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fear that the reality behind the amendment is that Opposition Members
are seeking to anticipate the 2013 review, which the Government are
doggedly refusing to anticipate. We remain impartial. Opposition
Members have made it perfectly clear on a number of occasions that they
are partial in respect of the future of A-levels, so they want to make
explicit provision for A-levels in the Bill. I disagree: it is
important that we approach the review with an open mind. I will
therefore resist the amendment if it is pressed, but I respectfully ask
the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings to withdraw it.
Incidentally, I agree with the hon. Member for Bristol, West that it is
inappropriate to promote one qualification over others in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022725000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding advice
on studying at Oxford or Cambridge, that will, of course, be one option
available to the highest-achieving young people and will, I hope,
remain an attractive option, as has always been the case. The hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings was right: I studied at one
of those two universities. I was the product, first, of an independent
school. One of that school&#146;s reasons for being appeared to be to
get as many people as possible into Oxford or Cambridge. In relation to
getting sufficient numbers of people from state schools and poorer
backgrounds into those universities, I think that the ambition of the
school is as much a part of the problem as the efforts of the
universities themselves to attract and admit those sorts of young
people. I was delighted, when I studied at Cambridge university, to
meet the person who is now my wife, who was the first person from her
institution to get into either Oxford or Cambridge and who had a very
different educational background from
mine.</div>
					<a name="08022725000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022725000439"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): I am
wondering to what extent the type of advice that we are talking about
would cover the advice that schools of the type that the Minister
attended give their sixth formers on applying to Oxbridge. It is quite
a complicated process. There are many interviews, which need to be
tackled in a particular way, and so on, as he will know. Will that type
of advice and guidance be given in further education colleges and
similar places? It is very hard to get into Oxbridge colleges unless
someone has had that little bit of extra training on what they are
looking for in interviews and, indeed, the whole
process.</div>
					<a name="08022725000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000440"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> We certainly expect the impartial advice that
young people receive from schools and other institutions to reflect
both ambition and familiarity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column708" />Column number: 708</div>with the systems of application for Oxford and Cambridge or any other
university or higher education institution, so that every young person
is given an equal chance of successfully applying and competing
on the basis of their achievements rather than their
background. The state-maintained school that my son attends does a very
good job in that respect. It works very hard at offering trips for
young people to both Oxford and Cambridge to enable them to become more
familiar with those universities and to feel that they could be a part
of their lives, rather than something that is very distant from them
and is for different sorts of young
people.</div>
					<a name="08022725000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000441"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Will the Minister say something about the mentoring
that that implies? As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire suggested, children from the most disadvantaged
backgrounds often have the additional disadvantage of not having
parents who have been through the process. The middle-class child not
only has a school environment that is supportive of such an
opportunity, as the Minister suggested, but will commonly have a
familial link to education that is not enjoyed by working-class
children who might well have the potential to enjoy going to Oxford or
Cambridge.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000442"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It is probably common sense that the
more it is familiar and normal for young people,
through the experience of their friends, family, parents and teachers,
to have accessed the full range of universities, the more their sights
and ambitions are set at the appropriate level rather than being
artificially capped.</div>
					<a name="08022725000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proportion of students entering higher education from state schools has
risen in the last 10 years from 81 per cent in 1997 to 86.9 per cent.
in 2005. I am sure that it has increased further since then. The
statistics for the lower socio-economic class backgrounds, show that
participation in higher education has risen from 27.9 per cent. in 2002
to 29.1 per cent. in 2005. That implies that there are more families
who are experiencing higher education who can then pass on that
experience and that expectation to their
children.</div>
					<a name="08022725000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000443"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I am sure that that is correct. But what does the
Minister think about the staggering survey which showed that 45 per
cent. of teachers either rarely or never recommend pupils in their
schools to apply to Oxbridge? I know of
comprehensives with 2,000 students that send nobody, or perhaps one
pupil who has parents who are very keen on Oxford or Cambridge, to
those universities. But 45 per cent. of teachers rarely or never make
such a recommendation and a fifth of teachers would never encourage a
bright pupil to apply to Oxford or Cambridge. What is the
Minister&#146;s opinion on why teachers would hold such a
view?</div>
					<a name="08022725000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000444"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> As I have said, there is more that schools need to
do and that those who work in schools should do to raise the ambitions
and sights of young people. I do not want into be drawn, or even
distracted, into thinking too much about why such a large proportion of
teachers in that survey seemed to have ruled out Oxford and Cambridge
for their young people. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column709" />Column number: 709</div>certainly would not condone it. If it is an appropriate choice for young
people, whatever their background and whatever school they are
attending, that choice should be promoted as an option for
them.</div>
					<a name="08022725000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the clause is not to prevent teachers from promoting any particular
option or to force them to promote any other option, but rather to
ensure that the advice and information given to pupils in each case has
at its heart the pupil&#146;s best interests. I therefore believe
that the amendments are unnecessary as their intent is already covered
in the clause as drafted. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022725000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000445"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> We have had a good debate about the importance of
extending opportunity to all kinds of young people and the need to make
available to them high-quality advice about the opportunities at Oxford
and Cambridge universities. We have also discussed the need to advise
them on the right route to take in terms of A-levels or otherwise
leading to opportunities in higher education or elsewhere. These were
probing amendments designed to highlight the concerns that I have
articulated and the concerns reflected by some of the evidence that my
hon. Friends and I have brought to the Committee&#146;s attention
today.</div>
					<a name="08022725000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having made
the point, I acknowledge that it would probably be wrong to put this
information into a Bill. It is very specific. As the hon. Member for
Bristol, West argued, it might be something that would be included in
guidance, particularly in relation to the second of the amendments. I
hope that the Minister will consider that. The survey data which my
hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and I cited
are compelling. It may mean that we have to soup up the guidance to
schools about offering Oxford and Cambridge as an option to those
children whose families would not typically have a knowledge or
understanding of those options and who would not historically have
enjoyed a close relationship with those
colleges.</div>
					<a name="08022725000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000446"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> All I want to say is that the reason I ask the
hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment and why I would not consider
naming a specific university in the Bill is that I do not want a
situation where a teacher advising a young person on careers almost has
to tick a box and say, &#147;The law says that I am supposed to think
about whether or not you are going to Oxford or Cambridge,&#148; and
then they give an answer. I do not think that is the right approach. We
need to change the culture, and I do not think that we will do that
just by naming individual institutions in
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08022725000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000447"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I acknowledge the sense of that comment. However,
we need to reflect closely and carefully on how we can counter some of
the misapprehensions that are clearly abroad about the
opportunities on offer at Oxford and Cambridge universities, so
that we can ensure that all those children with
the potential to do so can enjoy the very best chances.
Notwithstanding that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Nia
Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): I beg to move amendment No.
206, in clause 66, page 37, line 16, at end
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) any such advice
must challenge gender
stereotypes.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08022725000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank
you, Mr. Bayley, for the opportunity to speak to this
amendment, which is designed to ensure that those involved in giving
advice to young people not only avoid gender stereotyping in giving
their advice, but actively challenge gender stereotyping and ensure
that young people, both young men and young women, consider all the
options available to young people with their qualifications and
experience. Young people should be encouraged to consider all the
options, both those in what are traditionally thought of as male jobs
and those in what are traditionally thought of as female
jobs.</div>
					<a name="08022725000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
institutions involved have probably signed up to equal opportunities
principles, why is it necessary to challenge gender stereotypes? The
Committee has heard evidence from the further education sector that, in
some schools, there can be a tendency to push the type of courses
provided by that school; indeed, we have been debating that precise
point just now. That may happen even though it may not be in the best
interests of the pupils.</div>
					<a name="08022725000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that there are two
reasons why that happens. It may be a conscious effort to boost the
numbers in the school, so that people stay on in that school and take
the courses available there. In many respects, one can understand the
legitimacy of a teacher pushing their own subject area and wanting to
encourage and inspire pupils. However, to ensure that the advice given
is impartial, each institution should ensure that the opportunities are
there for young people to meet with and speak to advisers, lecturers,
tutors and so on coming from other institutions, who can put in front
of them the full range of
options.</div>
					<a name="08022725000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also think that this type of academic-focused advice sometimes happens
unconsciously; it is simply a matter of people reiterating their own
experiences. Those who have only ever been in a school environment, an
A-level environment and a university environment will inevitably have
some difficulty in talking to young people about the many other options
that could be available to them.</div>
					<a name="08022725000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is very easy to forget that
it is not just the careers adviser and the careers interview that has
an influence on the young person. The young person
also comes into contact with form tutors, personal tutors, mentors,
parents and other adults in their lives, who will all have a
significant influence on them. Of course, it is precisely for that
reason that clause 66 emphasises the importance of having information
presented in an impartial manner.</div>
					<a name="08022725000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Naturally, we are influenced by
our own experiences and what we have seen around us. I must tell the
Committee that I was quite shocked to hear the hon. Member for Bristol,
West suggest that he needed needlework because he was single and that
if he were not single he would no longer need to sew anything. That
certainly suggests to me that he was a product of that Welsh
&#147;mam&#148; who spoilt her son rotten and never expected him to
do anything at all in the house.</div>

							<a name="08022725000449"></a>Stephen

						</b> I shall continue to talk about the way that our
own experiences influence us. It is very important to be aware of the
fact that we all tend to reiterate the things that we have seen around
us. Of course, that can have very serious consequences for our young
people.</div>
					<a name="08022725000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to give you an example of a training exercise that I have carried out
with numerous teachers over the past few years. Surprisingly, even in
recent times, the results do not seem to be very different from what
they might have been 20 years ago. In this exercise I give out a CV of
a fictitious young person and I ask the participants in the course to
suggest what suitable courses and jobs they would offer to the young
person. Shockingly, depending on whether you give the
fictitious young person a distinctively male or distinctively female
name, the list provided by the participants in the course tends to vary
extremely. In other words, if you tell them it is a boy, they will give
you one set of suitable options; if you tell them it is a girl they
will give you a completely different set. That is illustrative of the
situation we find ourselves in at the moment. Although we are striving
to create equal opportunities, in practice we still bear the prejudices
that we have been brought up with.</div>
					<a name="08022725000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000451"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> Is the hon. Lady not confusing two things?
Obviously equal opportunities is absolutely crucial, but is it not the
case that girls may want to do some things in a job that boys do not
want to do and vice versa? It may be that we are
different.</div>
					<a name="08022725000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000452"></a>Nia
Griffith:
						</b> What is important is that all the options are
presented to every young person, because what often happens is that
young people are bundled into one area or another. Some of the research
by the Equal Opportunities Commission suggests that many young women
are shipped into placements in areas such as child care even if they
have never expressed an interest in child care. Likewise, young men are
shipped into various placements in manual work in semi-skilled or
unskilled jobs when they have never expressed any interest in those
types of work. Because we have prejudices and because we all know that
we come from a certain background and we have seen certain things in
our lives, it is important that we make that extra effort to put things
on an even keel and say to young people that they can equally well do
this or that.</div>
					<a name="08022725000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Young
people will also be subject to a fair amount of peer-group pressure
which will pressurise them into taking options which are stereotypical.
It is very difficult sometimes to be one of two or three women in a
very macho male environment or, conversely, to be one of two or three
men in a very female environment. That can lead to bullying and other
difficulties. It is important that we send a positive message about
choosing options&#151;a message that a young person should choose
whichever option they genuinely want to do, rather than something that
merely reflects other people&#146;s expectations. Just as we want
young people to aim high, we want them to challenge some of the
stereotypes that they have been brought up with. As the clause
requires, we want to give pupils the advice which will promote their
best interests.</div>
					<a name="08022725000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that so many people influence young people. It is not just
careers advisers. There is a training issue here for the many adults
who are in various ways 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column712" />Column number: 712</div>involved with the 16 to 18-year-old group, including the various support
agencies and the people in both the educational world and the voluntary

stereotyping.</div>

						</b> Does the hon. Lady share my view that we should be
optimistic about this problem? When I joined KPMG in 1984, there was
one woman partner out of several hundred partners. Now at that firm,
just 23 years later, the majority of new trainee chartered accountants
are women and there are thousands of female partners at KPMG. That is
the continuing trend. I am therefore optimistic about the future,

fifth of the places available there were open to women. We have come a
very long way. In many respects the progress has been made largely in
white collar areas of work. Where we are really falling down is on what
one might call the more industrial side, the trade side, or the more
working-class side, where there tends to be far more pressure on young
people to conform to stereotypes, and where there is far less
confidence to break through the barriers. I think that is why,
particularly in respect of the 16 to 18-year-olds we have been talking
about, we really need to push the boat out and challenge gender
stereotypes.</div>
					<a name="08022725000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
talking about the young women who do not have the confidence to say,
&#147;I am as good as any man,&#148; or&#151;for a man looking at
a more female-type job&#151;&#147;I can do this just as well as a
woman.&#148; It is very important that we give them those
opportunities, and that we do not just say, &#147;Oh well, what do we
do with this one? Let&#146;s shove her into this option, because that
is what we have done with girls before.&#148; That is what I think we
are trying to challenge in the Bill and in this clause in particular.
It is a serious issue, which affects not only the choices young people
start off with, but their whole life, because so much of our pay
structures are clearly linked to initial options that people take in
courses and jobs.</div>
					<a name="08022725000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had equal pay legislation for some time, but we are still seeing
the problem of an enormous pay gap, quite simply because those jobs
known as traditionally male jobs very often attract better wages than
those known as traditionally female jobs. I have, over the course of
many years, met many women who have simply not pursued skills, training
and careers in trades and technological areas, because they were
steered away from them.</div>
					<a name="08022725000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">This problem has been
particularly highlighted by the YWCA, which does excellent work with
some of our most disadvantaged young women. It is not easy to be one of
the only two or three in an environment, and that is why it is
important that we work towards achieving critical mass and give young
people proper opportunities to take part in placements where they feel
they are with a good mix of male and female, rather than with two or
three females in a big male macho environment, or vice versa.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column713" />Column number: 713</div>
					<a name="08022725000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we have made progress,
it is very worrying that some very recent research, done in 2005 by the
Equal Opportunities Commission, has shown that we are still directing
young people in very stereotypical ways. For this
reason, the amendment is very important. It is absolutely essential
that guidance and training on the implementation of the Bill should
include guidance on how to tackle gender stereotyping and how to give
advice that is genuinely in young people&#146;s best
interests.</div>

Watkinson:
						</b> I find that I jumped to completely the wrong
conclusion when I first read the amendment, because I thought it
referred to the gender stereotyping of the young people themselves.
Having listened to the hon. Lady&#146;s presentation of the
amendment, I realise she is referring to gender stereotyping among
teachers and careers advisers, which rather dismays me. I recall the
only careers advice I ever received at my co-educational grammar
school. One day the girls were all herded into the hall and told that
there were only two respectable occupations for girls: teaching and
nursing. Anyone who did not choose either was considered to be a lost
cause.</div>
					<a name="08022725000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rejected
that advice. So did my youngest daughter, who is a
member of the London fire brigade, and has been for about 10 years. A
more male-dominated working environment one could not imagine. She is
also very philosophical and of independent thought. That is an example
of an occupation which is unlikely ever to attract 50:50 applications
from men and women, simply because it is a job that does not appeal to
large numbers of women. It also requires a lot of physical strength,
which some women could not achieve. We would not say that all men are
physically stronger than all women, but it is probably true to say that
most men are physically stronger than most women. My daughter is 6 ft
tall and well able to do the job. She has survived in a very
male-dominated environment. I am the only woman in the Opposition Whips
Office, so I, too, am used to dealing with a male-dominated
environment.</div>
					<a name="08022725000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
extremely dismayed to hear the hon. Member for
Llanelli. I wondered why she felt it necessary to have
&#147;must&#148; in the Bill. Would &#147;may&#148; not meet
the requirements? However, I started with the bare presumption that it
was the students themselves who were limiting their own opportunities
by not looking more widely at the whole range of career of
possibilities. I changed my mind while the hon. Lady was speaking. I
hope that all teachers and Connexions advisers will ensure that all
ranges of opportunities are made available to young people, including
things that they might not normally have considered. There may be
predisposition in the genders towards certain careers, but the
opportunities should be as wide as possible. I thank the hon. Lady for
tabling the
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Sir
Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab): I rise to support
my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli and to respond to the comments
of the hon. Member for Upminster. The gender stereotyping that needs to
be challenged is encountered both in young people
themselves and, in some cases, sadly, in those who advise them. Others
have talked about personal experience; I speak as the father of three
girls. I was angered and saddened 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column714" />Column number: 714</div>when my eldest daughter was advised, not that long ago, that physics was
not something to be studied by a girl. Frankly, she was in the
position&#151;confident enough, coming from a middle-class
background&#151;to be able to challenge that and to go on and
successfully take a physics degree. However, it might have been very
different had she not come from that sort of background, had she not
had that sort of confidence and had she wanted, for example, to take up
a building apprenticeship. She may well not have had the confidence to
ignore the advice that she was given and, to some extent, the peer
pressure that was there as well, which stereotyped that degree as
unlikely to be appropriate for her as a
girl.</div>
					<a name="08022725000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Gender
stereotyping is often as much a problem for boys as it can be for
girls. It can limit what boys and those who advise
them see as appropriate career options as much as it can girls. In
education, we only have to look at the comparatively small proportion
of primary school teachers who are male to recognise that gender
stereotyping can cut both
ways.</div>
					<a name="08022725000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
very much hope that the Minister will give a sympathetic hearing to the
amendment. If he cannot accept the amendment, he might at least assure
us that the guidance, which will go with the Bill once enacted, will
give clear encouragement to all involved in advising
young people not just to avoid gender stereotyping, but to
challenge
it.</div>

them.</div>

							<a name="08022725000458"></a>Stephen

						</b> Despite the hon. Lady teasing me about the
teacher at my school who was a needlework teacher&#151;I nearly said
my needlework teacher&#151;I have considerable sympathy with her
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022725000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my role, I get to visit lots of universities and further education
colleges. When I visit universities, it is very apparent to me that 57
per cent. of undergraduates now are female. The medical profession, the
accountancy profession&#151;which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton mentioned earlier&#151;and the legal profession
will in the future be dominated by women. That is a marvellous
thing.</div>
					<a name="08022725000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">When visiting
further education colleges, however, what with usually being shown the
bricklaying or plumbing courses and the hairdressing salon, it is
noticeable that gender stereotypes are certainly active. They do not
usually have much luck suggesting services to me in the hairdressing
salon&#151;probably not to the Minister for Schools either. They
often offer to wax my legs, which I have had to decline many times.
Gender stereotypes seem to have fed their way through into the more
vocational courses that people take at further education colleges. If
the hon. Lady were to press her amendment, I would support
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000459"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I started my adult life&#151;I remember it
well&#151;thinking that men and women were probably more alike than
was generally supposed. Having reached the age of 49, I have now
concluded that men and women are probably less alike than people
generally suppose. That is reflected in the choices they make and the
aptitudes they have.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column715" />Column number: 715</div>
					<a name="08022725000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Llanelli has
tabled a useful amendment, on which we have had a useful debate. What
is absolutely clear is that the options available should not be
tarnished by prejudice. However, we should not be surprised if, even
with the sort of objectivity that the hon. Lady wants in the advice
that is offered, a preponderance of one gender or the other go in a
particular direction. I want to ensure that if women choose to be
bricklayers, plumbers, or any of the other jobs that are usually
mentioned in such discussions, there should be no bar to them, and we
should celebrate that fact. Similarly, if men want to go down one of
the roads that stereotypically tends to be associated with women, there
should not be any restriction or bar to their so doing. None the less,
I would not be surprised if, notwithstanding that, there were
differences in the numbers involved in different professions based
around their gender, nor would I be even slightly worried about
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000460"></a>Nia
Griffith:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman think that that is
perhaps what people thought about medicine years ago&#151;that it was
something that only men did, and that women would never
do?</div>

							<a name="08022725000461"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>My deafness is so profound today that I did
not pick up a word of that. I am sure that it was extremely apposite to
the debate and my contribution to it.</div>
					<a name="08022725000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only other comment I wish
to make is that in making such advice available, it is critical that we
take account of expectations, which we discussed earlier. It is likely
that expectations are set much earlier than the point at which people
reach college at 16-plus. They are often formed in primary school. You
and the Minister will be pleased to know, Mr. Bayley, that
my seven-year-old son wants to go to Trinity college, Cambridge. That
is because we live in the fens, and Cambridge is in the fens. He does
not want to have to stay in college for hot dinners. He wants to come
home and have his story and be tucked in at night. He knows that if he
goes to a different university that might not happen. He has already
set out his ambition. Whether he can achieve it with our help remains
to be seen.</div>
					<a name="08022725000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
illustrates the fact that children get ideas very early. Those ideas
may be gender reinforced at primary and secondary
school. Therefore, even if the amendment were successful and the spirit
which inspired it were to be reflected in what happens in schools,
there are other issues which have a bearing on the sentiments expressed
by the hon. Member for Llanelli and others in its pursuit. I believe
that all those with potential should be able to fulfil it and not be
prevented from so doing by the prejudices around gender. I am
completely confident and entirely happy that men, because they are men,
will tend to choose one direction and ladies a different one. That is
the way the world is and the way that I want it to
be.</div>

Knight:
						</b> What a wonderful debate, led by an excellent
contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli and supported
by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South. We heard the hon.
Member for Bristol, West waxing lyrical briefly and, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column716" />Column number: 716</div>having had concerns earlier in our deliberations about the personal
details of Mrs. Hayes, we have probably now heard more
personal details about Hayes Junior than he would like to be on the
public record if his classmates were to read the Committee&#146;s
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="08022725000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Naturally, I completely agree
with the intention behind my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment and I
welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue, which I have
also discussed with the YWCA. It is often the case that the sectors
that pay the highest wages, provide the most hours of training and have
the best future job prospects are those that are overwhelmingly
male-dominated. At the same time, we know that there is an urgent need
for more men to enter traditionally female careers, such a child care.
My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South made that point well.
The Connexions service and schools, as well as employers and parents,
have a role to play in providing young people with information and
guidance about future career choices. As the Secretary of State
outlined on Second Reading, it is important that young people have the
chance to consider all the options. For example, evidence shows that
many potential apprentices make stereotypical choices and tend to be
influenced by tradition and peer pressure in terms of the industries in
which they work.</div>
					<a name="08022725000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
needs of a modern economy are such that we cannot afford for the
talents of young people to be closed off because of stereotyping. This
is an extremely important issue and we want to ensure that, as we raise
the education leaving age, the problem is tackled head
on. Traditional gender stereotypes and other
stereotypes, such as those concerning race or sexual orientation, must
be broken down if they stop young people fulfilling their
potential.</div>
					<a name="08022725000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;there is always
a &#147;however&#148;&#151;although I agree with the intention, I
do not think that the amendment is necessary. As well as requiring
schools to deliver impartial careers advice that provides young people
with information on the full range of options available to them, we are
also using clause 66 to introduce a requirement on schools to have
regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. The guidance,
which was referred to by my hon. Friends the Members for Llanelli and
for Leicester, South, will include a set of core principles, one of
which will state explicitly that students should be helped to challenge
all stereotypes and widen their career aspirations. If women want to
enter the fire service, they should feel free to do so; it is an
honourable tradition. The first female firefighter to die in a fire was
Fleur Lombard who died in a fire in Gloucester. Such women, who have
provided extraordinarily good service to this country though the fire
service, have provided good role
models.</div>
					<a name="08022725000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, young
people should feel free to make choices about diplomas. Next year we
will introduce the hair and beauty diploma, which is not one that I
will be engaging in, waxing or otherwise. However, some extremely
high-earning hairdressers are men and it is a choice that men should
think about seriously. I fear that the hair and beauty diploma may be
ridiculed by some of our friends in the media as not being substantial
in comparison with engineering. That will simply display their
prejudice; such views are perhaps also informed by gender
prejudice.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column717" />Column number: 717</div>
					<a name="08022725000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, the recently
published children&#146;s plan outlines measures to present young
people with more exciting and challenging careers education in schools.
There will be opportunities such as taster sessions and other
experiential learning that will help to open young people&#146;s
minds to different ideas and challenge traditional learning and career
routes. I hope that this range of measures demonstrates the importance
that we attach to the issue. The amendment is unnecessary and I invite
my hon. Friend to withdraw
it.</div>

					<a name="08022725000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil and I tabled the amendment to provoke
a discussion on when will be the appropriate time to offer independent
advice and guidance. By 2013 when the legislation will kick in, the
educational landscape will be quite different. We presume that there
will still be the traditional academic pathway of GCSEs leading through
to A-levels, but diplomas, whether they are the original 14 lines
or the additional diplomas that the Government have announced,
should have been rolled out nationally and there will also be
apprenticeships and other vocational pathways for young people to
choose from, albeit in a compulsory
environment.</div>
					<a name="08022725000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
advice given to young people will be crucial, not
just at 16, but at a much younger age. I cannot
remember whether you were in the Chair, Mr. Bayley, but in
the evidence sessions I asked several witnesses, including those
representing Connexions, what they felt was the appropriate age at
which to start giving full independent advice and guidance to people
who will be affected by the legislation. When I asked Connexions
directly what was the main focus of its work at the moment, it said
that it was 16-year-olds looking forward to leaving compulsory
education and deciding whether to follow a career choice or go on to
further study. The concentration of its resources is in advising
children in year
11.</div>
					<a name="08022725000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">By 2013, it will
be more appropriate to concentrate that advice on children in year 9
because the choices that they make at that stage will require
independent and impartial advice. They could be deciding what they will
do in years 10 and 11, whether to exercise their choice in another
educational setting such as a local college or whether to achieve their
diploma through a combination of the two. As we have said during
debates on earlier amendments, that advice must exist in every school
in the country.</div>
					<a name="08022725000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Government can assure us
that the full range of independent advice and guidance will be
available to students in year 9, who are likely to be aged 13. That
advice should be not just on the courses and pathways 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column718" />Column number: 718</div>that are suitable for them, but on the settings so that there is no bias
in favour of staying in school if that is what the school advisers
want.</div>
					<a name="08022725000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
evidence session, we heard from Connexions that the main focus of its
work is currently aimed at 16-year-olds. If the ambitions that the
Government have for this legislation and through their support for the
Leitch programme are to be achieved, the career and educational choices
that people make at age 13 will be crucial. There is no point in giving
them that advice when they get to 16 if they have made a wrong decision
at 13 because their pathway in life will to a great extent already have
been determined.</div>
					<a name="08022725000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
looking for an assurance from the Minister that the focus of the
independent advice and guidance that is provided for in the Bill will
shift to a lower age. It should still be offered at 16, but also at 13.
I am looking for an assurance that sufficient resources will be in
place to ensure that Connexions, local authorities and schools are able
to provide that vital impartial
advice.</div>

Knight:
						</b> The amendment seeks to extend the relevant phase
of a pupil&#146;s education during which he must be
provided with a programme of careers education so that it should start
from 13, rather than 14, as originally specified in the Education Act
1997. I should make it clear&#151;it is an understandable
oversight&#151;that the age range has already been extended in
England to include pupils in school years 7 and 8, for 12 and
13-year-olds. That was done by regulations made under section 46 of the
1997 Act: for those who are interested, it was the Education (Extension
of Careers Education) (England) Regulations 2003, which came into force
on 1 September 2004. That means that section 43 of the 1997 Act, as it
currently has effect in England, already includes 13-year-olds in its
scope. To that extent, the amendment is unnecessary. Of course, the
resources go with the extension of the age period down to year 7, so I
hope that that is an adequate answer.</div>

to draw his remarks to a close. I hear what he says about regulations
that were passed before I became a Member of Parliament, but could he
assure me that there will be sufficient emphasis on that early advice
in the guidance that his Department prepares for Connexions or whoever
provides the independent advice and guidance, because Connexions told
us during the evidence sessions that the current set-up is geared
mainly towards 16-year-olds and those in year
11?</div>

						</b> It is certainly the case that the activity of the
Connexions service does not kick in until someone has reached 13. It is
only at that point that they are notified of the individual&#146;s
existence through the data transfers that we discussed last Tuesday.
However, the wider obligations for careers education, as set out in the
Education Act 1997, do apply from year 7, so schools would take forward
those obligations. Certainly, the guidance will make it clear that the
obligations in law extend from year 7 onwards. On that basis, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will be happy to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

that there is a paucity of advice in schools. It is variable, of

number of times. It states
that</div>

is right about that, too&#151;because most of its work tends to be
focused on post-16.</div>
					<a name="08022725000381"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08022725000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the House of
Lords Select Committee and others have argued, Connexions penetration
of schools is limited and, as I suggested earlier today, it may mean
rethinking our whole approach to careers advice and guidance in the
longer term rather than relying on Connexions. That might mean having
an all-age careers service alongside Connexions, as I suggested in
debates on earlier aspects of the Bill. At the very least, it would
ensure that we give advice that does not preclude opportunities, shut
down options or drive people in the wrong direction&#151;all things
that happen now.</div>
					<a name="08022725000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment may be probing&#151;I do not know&#151;but it is useful,
and it covers a subject to which we should return. I am not sure that
we have it right in the Bill. When debating these matters this morning,
I thought that the Minister was a little complacent about advice and
guidance and that he underestimated its significance in the Bill. I
have come to the conclusion that unless we can get advice and guidance
right most of the other provisions will flounder.</div>
					<a name="08022725000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair to the Minister,
rather than being indicative of negligence, that complacency may be
merely an illustration of the Government&#146;s failure to recognise
that the current system for advising and guiding young
people&#151;the current careers system&#151;is not up to scratch.
Connexions is fine for what it does best, which is providing
high-quality and wide-ranging 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column720" />Column number: 720</div>support to those young people who need a multi-faceted approach. I am
not sure that it is best at providing high-quality careers advice to
the majority of young people who do not need that kind of broad-brush
approach, and I am not sure that it is as effective as it might be in
the early years to which the hon. Member for Bristol, West pays
attention in his amendment. It is a pity that the Minister was not more
comprehensive in his winding up, but it is for the hon. Gentleman to
decide what to do next.</div>

							<a name="08022725000469"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> First, I thank the hon. Member for South Holland
and The Deepings for agreeing with the underlying purpose of the
amendment. I heard the Minister&#146;s assurances&#151;he cited
various regulations&#151;that everything that is necessary is already
in place. The purpose of the amendment was simply to get on the record
the fact that the Government recognise that if the legislation is to
succeed, full and independent advice needs to be offered much earlier
in the young person&#146;s educational journey.</div>
					<a name="08022725000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the Minister was giving me that assurance, although he seemed to be
hiding behind regulations that he said would already achieve that aim.
None the less, during our evidence sittings, we heard full confidence
being expressed in the fact that people are adhering to those
regulations. However, we still have some years to ensure that we get it
right. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="08022725000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

is a subtle but important difference between &#147;must&#148; and
&#147;may&#148;. &#147;Must&#148; implies that the Government
will tell schools and teachers&#151;the professionals&#151;exactly
what they should do and how they should do it. &#147;May&#148;
represents the Government facilitating good practice throughout instead
of forcing the great, clunking, centralising Labour fist&#151;that is
what I have written in my notes; it is a rather partisan remark. When
preparing for this debate, I must have been feeling rather spiteful,

something that we all agree is necessary and desirable. In
practice,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column721" />Column number: 721</div>schools could disregard the guidance, as long as they met the duty to
provide impartial careers advice. If, however, they disregarded the
guidance and were subsequently found to be failing in their duty, it is
likely that questions would be asked as to why they had chosen not to
follow it. In many ways, the amendment is therefore
unnecessary.</div>

ensure that schools are under a duty to have regard
to guidance that includes a set of core principles. That has been
supported by key stakeholders we consulted on the Bill. Along with
other measures, I believe that it will drive up quality so that
students receive high-quality and impartial careers advice and
information. On the basis of my assurances, I hope that the hon. Member

Hayes:
						</b> The amendments relate to clause 67, which, as the
explanatory notes state, amends sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Learning and
Skills Act 2000 to ensure that the Learning and Skills
Council</div>
					<a name="08022725000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is under a duty
to provide proper facilities for apprenticeships for 16 to 18 year olds
and reasonable facilities to those over the age of 19...The wording of
the clause makes clear that it covers both employment under a
traditional contract of apprenticeship with an employer, and the modern
form of apprenticeships with the involvement of a separate training
provider as well as an
employer.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
of the amendments is to ensure a return to
traditional employer-based apprenticeships, rather than apprenticeships
based with an independent training provider. We believe that all
apprenticeships should be
employer-based.</div>
					<a name="08022725000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government recently published a review of the apprenticeship system,
and the Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and
Skills, the hon. Member for Tottenham, and I have already had some
exchanges on the matter. I presume that he will speak
at some length on the clause, as it is important to
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column722" />Column number: 722</div>success of the Bill. He knows that I welcome some aspects of that
review, not least because it responds to criticisms of the
system&#151;made not only by me, I hasten to add. It is helpful that
it redefines what should comprise an apprenticeship with a stronger
emphasis on mentoring, workplace-based training and, indeed, employer
engagement of the kind that I just mentioned. Although some of the
detailed recommendations in the review are welcome, my criticism is
that it will reinforce the Government&#146;s bureaucratic approach to
the provision of skills training. The Under-Secretary, whom I imagine
will respond to the debate on this group of amendments, knows that my
central criticism is that by reinforcing the role of the Learning And
Skills Council and reducing the role of sector skills councils in the
management and funding of apprenticeships and skills more generally,
the review, like the rest of Government policy, fails to meet the
central charge in the Leitch report that we need a demand-led
system.</div>
					<a name="08022725000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Leitch
made it clear that centrally driven bureaucracy must be streamlined if
it is to deliver a system that is more responsive to employer demand,
but the review means that most apprenticeships will be delivered by
agencies rather than by employers. Essentially, the Government prefer a
nationally planned, target-driven approach to the flexible and dynamic
training provision that is necessary in an ever more advanced economy.
We believe that employers must lead the apprenticeship system if we are
to raise the skills level. The continuation of a centrally driven,
target-based model will fail to ensure that all apprenticeships result
in greater employability, which is the ultimate test of the
system&#146;s effectiveness.</div>
					<a name="08022725000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
elaborating a little on the scale of the problem that we face in
respect of apprenticeships. There is a shortage of apprenticeship
places owing to a lack of employer engagement. As a result, the
Government have consistently missed their targets for apprenticeship
numbers. In 2003, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is now
Prime Minister, announced that apprenticeship numbers would rise to
320,000 by 2006. In fact, there were only 239,000 apprentices in
training in 2006-07, and numbers are falling. The figures released in
December show a decline in apprenticeship numbers at both level 2 and
level 3.</div>
					<a name="08022725000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">At one time,
all apprenticeships were a level 3 qualification, equivalent to an
A-level. Indeed, most people&#146;s picture of an apprenticeship is
of an eager young learner gaining a practical competence at the side of
an experienced craftsman that is bound to lead to enhanced
employability. Usually, because such apprenticeships were linked
directly to an employer, people went straight into a job. Although that
is still true of many apprenticeships&#151;there are some excellent
apprenticeships abroad&#151;it is not true of all apprenticeships. By
changing the badging of training, and calling many things
apprenticeships that do not match that traditional model, we have
risked the brand. That is why I welcome some parts of the review, which
begins to address those concerns.</div>
					<a name="08022725000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the end of the day, the
problem with the creation of level 2 and programme-led apprenticeships,
is that that has disguised the fact that we are training fewer people
at level 3 than we did 10 years ago. The decline in numbers in the past
year, which I mentioned, is part of a steady decline in the number of
trainees in level 3 apprenticeships. The number of level 2
apprenticeships 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column723" />Column number: 723</div>has grown over the same period, but one wonders how many of those
apprenticeships deliver the goods or do what is
intended.</div>
					<a name="08022725000382"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="08022725000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apprenticeships
are not what they used to be, and declining employer involvement has
meant that many apprenticeships are much more classroom-based and have
their origins in the youth training schemes of the past. The
House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee reported last summer&#151;I
have referred to that report a number of times&#151;that most of the
increase in apprenticeships over the years is the result of converting
Government-supported programmes of work-based learning into
apprenticeships. All that new training has been below level 3.
Lower-level training has increased at the expense of higher-level
training. Of the 239,000 apprentices I mentioned, only 97,000 are at
level 3.</div>
					<a name="08022725000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The essence
of our concerns, as embodied in the amendments, is that the Government
have failed to provide an apprenticeship system fit
for purpose, largely because of their supply-driven approach. The vast
majority of apprenticeships are delivered by training providers rather
than by employers. Work-based mentor training is often limited. In its
last report, the adult learning inspectorate warned that some
apprenticeships could be achieved without the
apprentice</div>
					<a name="08022725000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having to set
a foot in a
workplace&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022725000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bureaucratic funding mechanism for apprenticeships means that, as the
Economic Affairs Committee concluded, employers
are</div>
					<a name="08022725000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;marginalised at the
end of a long chain of
administration&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022725000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
expert witness told the Lords
inquiry:</div>
					<a name="08022725000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is a key
problem for both the young people and the employers in terms of finding
each other...for quite a lot of employers, they do not actually know
how to really access the
system.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
apprenticeship review is, in a sense, the final nail in the coffin for
the Leitch report. One of Lord Leitch&#146;s key recommendations was
that the Government should move forward from a supply-side to a
demand-led skills training system. The Leitch report concluded
that</div>
					<a name="08022725000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;history tells us
that supply-side planning of this sort cannot effectively meet the
needs of employers, individuals and the economy. The Review recommends
a fully demand-led approach, with an end to this supply-side planning
of
provision.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently,
Lord Leitch recommended
that</div>
					<a name="08022725000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;planning bodies,
such as the LSC...will require a further significant
streamlining.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
review reinforced supply-side planning by proposing the establishment
of a national apprenticeship service. That service is part of the
Learning and Skills Council&#146;s responsibilities, and the LSC will
be responsible for the achievement of the targets set by the
Government, including the determination and publication of the strategy
for expanding places by region, sector and age group, consistent with
the Government&#146;s published national plans. Such an approach is
not consistent with a demand-led
system.</div>
					<a name="08022725000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must be bolder in responding to local and sectoral demand as required,
rather than simply working a system around a series of national,
predefined, Government-set targets. I am not sure that the Government
have even begun to grapple with that problem. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column724" />Column number: 724</div>Leitch review recommended a much larger role for sector skills councils,
which would be part of the demand-led system that Lord Leitch
described, and which I support. Leitch argued that the councils should
be responsible for approving vocational qualifications, as well as
taking a lead role in collating and communicating sectoral and
labour-market needs.</div>
					<a name="08022725000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following the apprenticeship
review, the National Apprenticeship Service&#151;in other words, the
Learning and Skills Council&#151;will be responsible for determining
the qualification level of apprenticeships. The role of sector skills
councils will be reduced, and their role in funding, commissioning and
managing information on apprenticeships will be taken away. The
creation of the National Apprenticeship Service adds to the confusing
array of organisations with overlapping responsibilities
that crowd the skills sector. The NAS will be
responsible for a national information and marketing service for
apprenticeships, which will exist in addition to the careers and
training advice provided by schools and colleges, local authorities
through Connexions, and the proposed adult careers service and skills
brokers to be introduced as part of Train to
Gain.</div>
					<a name="08022725000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2001, the Cassels review of apprenticeships recommended that the system
be led by employers, with training providers acting only as
apprenticeship agents with a clearly defined role. In 2002, the LSC
accepted that recommendation but it was never implemented. The notion
that training providers are better placed to deal with those matters
than employers themselves is fanciful. Under the apprenticeship review,
training providers will continue to have responsibility for
co-ordinating apprenticeships, which means that employers will be
marginalised at the end of a long chain of administration. As an aside,
with your indulgence, Mr. Bayley, the review says very
little about the further education sector, which is still waiting for
deregulation, years after the Foster report, which preceded the Leitch
review, recommended that FE colleges be set free with a radical
programme of deregulation&#151;a view which I enthusiastically
support.</div>
					<a name="08022725000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are essential for two reasons. First, apprenticeships are
central to driving up the national skills level, as the current system
is simply not fit for purpose. Secondly, although I acknowledge that
the Government have taken steps towards addressing the problems in the
apprenticeship system and I recognise the Minister&#146;s personal
commitment to doing so, I still do not think that they have grasped the
core message that lies at the heart of all of the reviews of the
apprenticeship system and of the Leitch report, which is that we need
to move to a less bureaucratic, less target- driven, less centralised
and more responsive system, with employers in the driving seat and
sector skills councils, which are employer-focused, playing a critical
role.</div>
					<a name="08022725000340"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Unless we
do so, we will not get the apprenticeship system that we need and
deserve. Without that, the Bill will falter, because many of the young
people we want to engage should be travelling down the route through
an apprenticeship to employment. I believe
passionately in the principle of apprenticeships, and I know that the
Minister does, too. I just want to have a frank debate&#151;a
non-partisan debate, in fact&#151;about how we can get
apprenticeships right. I do not claim to have all the answers, but I am
certain that the system must reflect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column725" />Column number: 725</div>genuine employment need and the best way to determine and deliver that
objective is to have employers as the central component in the
system.</div>
					<a name="08022725000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000476"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and
Skills (Mr. David Lammy):
						</b> I am pleased to be
able to take over from my hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and
Learners to talk about apprenticeships. The last time I was in your
constituency, Mr. Bayley, I was looking at
apprenticeships at York Minster. I am pleased, too, that the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings has come closer to the
Government position on apprenticeships since the publication of the
apprenticeship review. I agree with him that this should be a
non-partisan issue on which we can agree. I set my comments very much
in the context of the apprenticeship review, which was in turn informed
by our plans to raise the participation age following the Leitch review
on skills and the introduction of an entitlement to an apprenticeship
place for every suitably qualified young person in 2013.</div>
					<a name="08022725000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 67 is a small but
important step in moving towards our ambitions for
the apprenticeships programme, including the apprenticeship
entitlement. Apprenticeships are implicitly included in the Learning
and Skills Council&#146;s existing statutory duties, as laid out in
sections 2 and 3 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, to secure the
provision of facilities for education and training. However,
apprenticeships are not mentioned in the legislation, so the clause
addresses that omission by making explicit the Learning and Skills
Council&#146;s duty to furnish provision for apprenticeships that is
the same as the provision for other post-16 education and training
options. I hope that everyone welcomes
that.</div>
					<a name="08022725000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
great deal of debate this afternoon about Oxbridge and independent
schools. I am pleased to return to another group of young people who
deserve our attention and our efforts to make the system more equitable
on their behalf. In the context of raising the participation age, the
clause is a signal to the system that the Government are
serious about apprenticeships as a route that young people can take to
fulfil the duty to participate. The effect of the clause will be to
drive the way that the Learning and Skills Council funds provision and
engages with employers in meeting the 2013 entitlement. For adults, we
are equally clear that apprenticeships form a key part of our response
to Sandy Leitch&#146;s recommendations.</div>
					<a name="08022725000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments undermine the
clarity and intended effect of the clause. Apprenticeships funded by
the LSC can involve an individual in a contract of
apprenticeship or a contract of employment, and the inclusion in the
clause of</div>
					<a name="08022725000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;training
provided in connection with a contract of
employment&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">is a
recognition of that fact. That does not mean that every employer has to
provide training, nor does it imply that every contract of employment
must include training provision. It simply means that
apprenticeships are covered by the LSC&#146;s duty to secure the
provision of facilities for education or training. The majority of
people engaged in LSC-funded apprenticeships participate under
contracts of employment, rather than contracts of
apprenticeship.</div>
					<a name="08022725000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be
as comprehensive as possible, the Bill includes both forms of contract,
and our intention is to legislate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column726" />Column number: 726</div>in a forthcoming Bill to remove the legal ambiguity
surrounding apprenticeships. The effect of amendments
Nos. 49 and 50 would be to remove the duty on the LSC to secure the
provision of facilities with regard to apprentices employed under a
contract of employment, and I am not sure that is what Opposition
Members want. They have stressed many times during our debates and
elsewhere their support for apprenticeships as a major route for young
people and adults alike. Furthermore, amendment No. 51 would remove one
aspect of the clause that is crucial to increasing the number of
quality
apprenticeships.</div>
					<a name="08022725000383"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08022725000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
67 provides that the LSC&#146;s role in encouraging employers to
participate in training should encompass the kind of situation covered
by apprenticeships. That provision will complement the wider measures
to engage employers set out in the &#147;World-class
Apprenticeships&#148; strategy. May I say very gently to the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings that he made an unfounded
assertion about workplace provision? I understand his concerns, but I
want to reassure him about the position, as he has got this wrong.
Apprenticeships and advanced apprenticeships meet the requirements laid
down by the modern apprenticeship advisory committee, chaired by Sir
John Cassels. Those requirements are that apprenticeships involve
on-the-job training; engage a young person to earn while learning, and
closely involve employers. As I have explained previously, both in
Committee and in the House, people on programme-led apprenticeships are
not counted&#151;I repeat, not counted&#151;as being on an
apprenticeship until they have a contract with an employer.</div>
					<a name="08022725000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) will
recall the evidence that we heard from the Prince&#146;s Trust,
Barnardo&#146;s and other organisations, and I hope that he
acknowledges that there is a role for programme-led apprenticeships for
young people who are not quite ready for a fully fledged apprenticeship
with an employer. Those young people may not have the soft skills that
we have discussed in Committee. Nevertheless, they can get on that road
with a programme-led apprenticeship. Such apprenticeships are not
counted within the figures, but the young person can move on to another
apprenticeship for which they are prepared.</div>
					<a name="08022725000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000477"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I entirely acknowledge that there are many young
people unprepared to take up an apprenticeship because of the absence
of skills. Indeed, the House of Lords Select Committee report to which
I referred earlier says that there are 300,000 such young people, who
often lack core and soft skills. However, in respect of work-based
training, the adult learning inspectorate
warned:</div>
					<a name="08022725000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
apprentices can potentially achieve the full requirements of the
apprenticeship framework without having to set foot in a
workplace.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does the
Minister think that the inspectorate said that? If I have got
the wrong impression about apprenticeships, it has
too.</div>
					<a name="08022725000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000478"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> I asked my officials to scour the extensive House
of Lords Select Committee report to find that quote. We were able to
find expressions of concern that the Adult Learning Inspectorate still
had about programme-led apprenticeships, particularly in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column727" />Column number: 727</div>engineering. However, the suggestion that most
apprenticeships do not involve an employer is just wrong. The hon.
Gentleman will recall that when I put that suggestion to some of the
individuals who gave evidence to the Committee, including the
principals and the Campaign for Learning, they were staggered by it and
indeed they said that they just did not recognise it. They said that
apprenticeships must involve an employer.</div>
					<a name="08022725000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore think that there is
confusion here, and I know what lies behind
the confusion. As the hon. Gentleman said, we have sought to
ensure that we have a statutory definition of apprenticeships
in the apprenticeship review. While we do not include
programme-led apprenticeships in the figures, we acknowledge that we
need to make a clear distinction between programme-led apprenticeships
in a college, which are sometimes undertaken as preparation for an
apprenticeship, and full-blown apprenticeships. I think that the
problem is confusion about descriptions, but it is not the reality of
the experience of our apprentices as we understand
it.</div>
				
					<a name="08022725000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000479"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> It is important that we clarify this matter. I do
not want to delay the Committee unduly, but there are two points to
explore. The first is the issue that was identified by the adult
learning inspectorate. Let me say, for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
benefit, that the reference is from July to August 2006. I am happy to
provide it for him so that he will not have to scour any further.
The inspectorate is concerned about those
apprenticeships in which there is no workplace element. There is a
second, parallel, concern about employer engagement and what
constitutes an employer. It is right that many apprenticeships have a
significant and implicit relationship with employers. Among the best
apprenticeships are those run by Rolls-Royce and Honda. Many of the
employers concerned are training providers. I am interested in the
Minister&#146;s view on what constitutes an employer and how an
employer is defined in that
context.</div>
					<a name="08022725000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000480"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has made that point before, and
I have inquired into it in some detail. It is not possible for an
apprentice to achieve an apprenticeship if they are based solely with a
training provider&#151;by that I mean someone whose main activity is
education and training. Some employers, usually large employers such as
BAE Systems or Honda, set up separate training arms for their
apprentices. It is important to acknowledge that trend among some of
our larger employers. At a time when the Government and the Opposition
are keen for apprenticeships to increase, we would not want to see that
development end. That is not the same as the apprentice merely spending
his time at a local college. The large employer is able to become the
training provider because of the financial means that they have and
because of the staff that they can employ to do the training. Again,
there is some confusion about descriptions that has led some to suggest
that one can get an apprenticeship solely by spending time at a
training provider. That is not the case. An apprentice has to be with
an employer.</div>
					<a name="08022725000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings will also know that in the
review, we recommend group training associations, which is something
that he called for. Implicit in that recommendation is the
understanding that it can be very difficult for small businesses to
offer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column728" />Column number: 728</div>apprenticeships, and that the relationship that they have to have with
the learning and skills council is something that they may find
daunting or some way removed from their usual pattern of business. That
is why we recognise the desirability of the model of a group training
association, whereby a group of small employers hand over the necessary
bureaucracy and accreditation that go with an apprenticeship to a
central hub.</div>
					<a name="08022725000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Group
training associations already exist. I have visited the Birmingham
electrical group training association that provides that part of the
west midlands with a lot of its electricians. That might be described
as an apprenticeship with the training provider, but such a description
is not accurate. It is the training provider working in partnership
with electricians in the west midlands. I hope that
that answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points and that we can move on
from some of the confusion, understanding that the Government&#146;s
desire is to get the statutory definition right, to bring clarity and
to ensure quality in the apprenticeships
offered.</div>
					<a name="08022725000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has expressed concern that a new national apprenticeship
service will be a supply-driven, centrally based, target-oriented
model. I want to reassure him that that is exactly the opposite of what
is envisaged. For the Government to count training as an
apprenticeship, an apprentice must have spent a period of time as an
employee and have the status of an employee at the time of completion.
In addition, the role of the sector skills council in articulating
employer demand will be central to everything that happens as we roll
out our ambitious apprenticeship
plans.</div>
					<a name="08022725000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;World-class
Apprenticeships&#148; makes it clear that the new national
apprenticeships service will work in partnership with sector skills
councils. Indeed, the report introduces a set of new and revised
functions for sector skills councils, including promoting the take-up
and spread of apprenticeships, branding national
completion certificates, maintaining a bank of qualifications from
which frameworks will be formulated, working with the national
apprenticeships service to communicate quality-assurance messages and
information on apprenticeships to employers, and sharing information
management.</div>

						<a name="08022725000481"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I am grateful to the
Minister for giving way for one of my rare appearances in this
Committee. I do not want to be argumentative and I hope that he does
not think that I am being argumentative, but how will we benchmark
whether our apprenticeships are world class? That is an over-used
phrase. Could we not use more modest language and say that they will be
very good apprenticeships? In that way, nobody would be disappointed if
they do not end up being world
class.</div>
					<a name="08022725000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000482"></a>Mr.
Lammy:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but
it is right that we have bold ambitions for the young people who take
that learning and employment option. We have spent much of this
afternoon talking about Oxbridge; I want that same level of aspiration
for the group of young people who take the apprenticeship route. We
want to encourage quality and to legislate for quality. We will be able
to do that as a result of the apprenticeship review and we can aspire
to world-class apprenticeships. Frankly, if Germany and Australia are
able to have apprenticeships that most of the world 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column729" />Column number: 729</div>look to and say that they are good, I am quite sure that we can extend
the tradition of companies such as Rolls-Royce and British Telecom and
set up such apprenticeships as our
ambition.</div>
					<a name="08022725000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
is but one of the building blocks that we need to put in place on the
road to rolling out the entitlement in 2013 and expanding
apprenticeships to meet the ambitions set out in response to the Leitch
review. The apprenticeship review said that we will go further in
legislative terms to give statutory force to the 2013 entitlement. The
clause supports that direction of travel. The amendments would exclude
the majority of apprentices from the duties on the LSC and cloud the
message that we are sending to the system. I hope that the hon. Member
for South Holland and The Deepings is sufficiently reassured that he
can withdraw his
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08022725000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000483"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> We have had a long debate on apprenticeships and I
do not want perpetuate it longer than the Committee will tolerate, so I
will abbreviate my remarks. I only want to pick up on one thing that
the Minister said&#151;although I could no doubt debate the issue
with him all day and all night&#151;about group training
associations. He is right to say that the Government emphasised them in
the review. I called for that in my party&#146;s mid-term policy
review; they are a useful way of involving small and medium-sized
enterprises, which we did not talk about earlier in this regard, but
which are vital to the success of the policy. Many of the young people
that the Bill deals with will find their training opportunities and
their employment opportunities in SMEs. I never waste an opportunity to
elevate their calls in our considerations. Group training associations
provide a very effective way of allowing such businesses into this
network.</div>
					<a name="08022725000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2) The Secretary
of State shall commission an independent report into the funding

in the diploma
programme.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08022725000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
68 requires local authorities, when they are drawing up their school
transport policy for young people of sixth form age, to take into
account journey times as well as journey costs and distance. There can
be no quibble about that. The real concern is the statement in the
impact assessment that says, on page 34, paragraph
6.10:</div>
					<a name="08022725000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do
not expect this change to place any additional cost burdens on local
authorities.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column730" />Column number: 730</div>
					<a name="08022725000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s argument is that
local authorities already spend about &#163;900 million a year on
educational transport, funded by the formula grant from central
Government and through the council tax. To quote from the impact
assessment:</div>
					<a name="08022725000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;councils are
free to use the funding in line with the wishes of their electorate and
taking into account their statutory
responsibilities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Bill increases those very statutory duties and responsibilities,
and it does not appear that the Government have
matched those increased responsibilities with increased funding. The
Local Government Association has expressed its concern and said in its
briefing to the
Committee:</div>
					<a name="08022725000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is a case where we remain unconvinced of estimated costs to implement
sufficient provision given the nature of

					<a name="08022725000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">education. The LGA
points out that many young people of sixth form age, studying for a
vocational qualification, might need to travel to different
sites.</div>
					<a name="08022725000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
the Government&#146;s Green Paper sets out their original thinking on
the transport implications of raising the participation age to 18 in
paragraph 5.17,
stating:</div>
					<a name="08022725000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Currently,
in relation to pre-16 education, the local authority is required to
provide free home-to-school transport for young people where it
considers this necessary to facilitate the young person&#146;s
attendance...From September 2008 young people from low-income
families will be entitled to free travel to one of their three nearest
schools, where this is between two and six miles from their
home&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022725000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">We dealt with that
in the Education and Inspections Act 2006. The next paragraph of the
Green Paper, 5.18, goes
on:</div>
					<a name="08022725000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As part of
these proposals to introduce compulsory participation, we will consider
whether changes to the post-16 transport policy would be required,
including meeting the cost of any new burdens on local authorities. We
will consider and consult on, for example, whether to extend and adapt
the current pre-16 school transport regulations, and could also
investigate the feasibility of providing subsidised transport to 16-18
year olds who are in education or
training&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022725000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, when
one looks at the Government&#146;s paper &#147;Raising
Expectations: staying in education and training post-16: From policy to
legislation&#148;, which is in effect the White Paper leading to the
Bill, one sees that the only reference to transport is in paragraph 5.6
on page 26, which
mentions:</div>
					<a name="08022725000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
clarification of local authorities&#146; existing duties in relation
to transport, ensuring that, in devising their transport policies for
16 - 18 year olds, they consider travelling
time.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022725000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is all that
is said. No mention is made of meeting the costs of any new burden on
local authorities or of investigating the feasibility of providing
subsidised transport for 15 to 18-year-olds, which is why the impact
assessment shows no additional costs to be incurred by local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08022725000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
also why the Association of Colleges has expressed its disappointment
that the Bill</div>

strengthen the obligation on local authorities to ensure that

strongly
that:</div>

							<a name="08022725000485"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I rise to support the aim of the amendment,
which is the same as that of amendment No. 158, which we shall come to
shortly, although perhaps from a slightly different direction. I think
that the Government have massively underestimated the funding that will
be necessary to ensure that transport is in place so that the roll-out
of diplomas and meaningful choice at 16 will be available to everyone
across this country.</div>
					<a name="08022725000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already seen, with the
welcome introduction of free bus travel for those of
pensionable age, that that has unforeseen cost consequences for many
local authorities in different parts of the country&#151;for example,
seaside towns and cities that are tourist attractions, such as my
constituency in Bristol. The funding that is in place for that is not
adequate, despite what the Government said when they introduced the
concessionary bus travel scheme. In those circumstances, we do not want
to see a further cost burden on local government.</div>
					<a name="08022725000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite what the Government say
in their regulatory impact assessment, people do travel across
boundaries to go from one college to another and they do live and study
in different authority areas. We do not want to find that certain local
authorities are placed under much heavier cost burdens than others in
2013. I broadly support what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton argued, but I will stop my remarks there as I have more
to say when I speak to the next amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000486"></a>Angela
Watkinson:
						</b> I support of the amendment, as I feel that it
is essential that the Secretary of State should commission an
independent report to establish the funding requirements for the
provision of transport. I speak as a former chairman of the school
transport sub-committee of Essex county council, in my days as a county
councillor. Our job was to establish the statutory entitlement of
applicants to free transport. Once a month, the sub-committee used to
get in a minibus and be driven around the county to the homes of the
families that were applying for free transport. We often walked from
the home to the school to see whether it was feasible and a safe
walking distance and whether entitlement to free transport
could be established. Elements such as distance and the
existence of lighting and footpaths came into our discussions, and we
frequently crossed railway lines and farmyards to establish that the
route from home to school was not suitable to be walked by a
child.</div>
					<a name="08022725000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">If 16 and
17-year-olds are to be entitled to free transport, there will be a huge
additional cost. The cost of transport to education authorities is
already 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column732" />Column number: 732</div>enormous. If older children are to be included, the cost will be much
higher. The provisions of the Bill also encompass special needs
children, including those with mobility problems. Education authority
budgets will not be sufficient to take that additional burden. For that
reason, I strongly support the amendment. An independent report is
needed to establish the real cost of free school
transport.</div>

						</b> As we heard, the amendment would
require the Secretary of State to commission an
independent report on the funding requirements necessary to enable
local authorities to provide transport so that pupils or students could
access their entitlement to participate in the diploma programme. In
many ways, I entirely agree with its aim. In fact, I agree so much that
I am pleased to inform the Committee that we have already commissioned
York Consulting to undertake research into transport needs stemming
from the introduction of the 14-to-19 reforms, including diplomas. That
report, due to be published in June, will consider a range of transport
factors, including the funding costs of transport available to local
authorities, in order to ensure access.</div>
					<a name="08022725000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree with
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton so much that not
only have we commissioned a report from York Consulting, but we are
also conducting research on the delivery of the diploma in rural areas.
It is in rural areas, of course, that transport issues feature more
prominently. An interim report was published last November, and we plan

children were entitled to free transport was that in many cases there

number of cars in the drive will be taken into account.</div>
					<a name="08022725000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reports on diploma delivery
in rural areas, to be publishing shortly, will show that it is
important to consider access in a wider context than simple transport
solutions. For instance, e-learning, common timetabling, peripatetic
teaching and mobile provision are existing ways to ensure access to
provision without asking young people to travel long distances.
However, I have sympathy with the idea of free or subsidised transport
for young learners. Some local authorities already provide it, which is
another reason for it being quite difficult, in the relatively early
days of diploma delivery, to make blanket
announcements.</div>

							<a name="08022725000495"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I am delighted to have anticipated the
intervention from the hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire.</div>
					<a name="08022725000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of my
two concerns about requiring all areas to have free or subsidised
transport for young learners, one is that it may not fulfil its purpose
in helping the young people who most need help. Making transport free
is fine, as long as there is provision for them to use it. However, if
the bus does not travel through their village or does not travel at a
time that allows them to access education, it is not necessarily the
answer. We may need to be slightly more sophisticated than merely
allowing for free provision, attractive though the headlines might
be.</div>
					<a name="08022725000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, local
authorities are currently responsible for transport for 16 to
19-year-old learners, and it is important that they retain some
discretion in how they spend and target their funding. As the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned, we would need
proper consultation on the proposals might be brought forward as a
result of the various reports and pieces of research that we have
commissioned to inform our policy as we roll out diplomas and tackle
transport concerns. I am delighted to give way to the hon. Member for
Broxbourne.</div>
					<a name="08022725000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000496"></a>Mr.
Walker:
						</b> The Minister is a real gent. Would free travel
extend, in more urban and suburban seats, to rail and
tube links, for example? I know that, in my constituency, youngsters go
out of Enfield, into Cheshunt, and back to Enfield using train
routes.</div>
					<a name="08022725000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000497"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I want to make it clear that the hon. Gentleman
has not heard me say that I am committing to free transport. I have
said that I have some sympathy with the idea of free or subsidised
transport. That is something that the Youth Parliament campaigns on
strongly. I have held meetings with its members, and, as with other
matters that they raise, such as sexual relationship education, it is
important that we listen carefully to what they have to say. On whether
the proposals on transport will apply in suburban areas, we will have
to have a model ensuring that every young person has good access to the
range of provision that they need to fulfil their duties in part 1, and
therefore to the range of diplomas to which they will be entitled from
2013.</div>
					<a name="08022725000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light of
the fact that we are doing what the amendment asks us to do, I hope
that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will be happy
to withdraw
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000498"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I am slightly encouraged. The amendment goes to the
root of the policy of raising participation to 18, particularly in
rural areas. It is disappointing that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column734" />Column number: 734</div>the final &#147;Delivering 14-19 Reforms in Rural
Areas&#148; report, which is due shortly, was not available before
this debate. I hope that it will be available before Report, so that it
can inform the House about the precise implications of the duty on
transport to and from the various colleges and sixth form settings for
young people to whom the new duty will
apply.</div>
					<a name="08022725000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
strange that although the Green Paper, &#147;Raising
Expectations&#148;, stated that</div>
					<a name="08022725000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we will consider whether changes

the cost of any new burdens on local authorities...We will

					<a name="08022725000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
phrasing and statement of intention is missing from the White Paper.
That is a major gap in the cohesiveness of the
policy.</div>

semi-assured by the Minister&#146;s response and I

					<a name="08022725000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have just considered the affordability for local authorities of the
changes that will be brought about if the Bill is enacted. The purpose
of the amendment is to consider their affordability for the individual
student. We have spent much time this afternoon discussing the
importance of independent advice and guidance for young people to make
sure that the Bill is successful. Transport and its adequacy and
affordability are also essential if this brave new educational world
which we are being invited to enter is to
succeed.</div>
					<a name="08022725000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill as
drafted would add time to the existing provisions in local authority
transport plans, which already include cost, distance and the need to
ensure that there is choice in educational provision. However, it does
not specifically deal with affordability. That is quite different
because bus fares, train fares or whatever vary enormously around the
country, as do individual incomes. The affordability as well as the
cost of fares needs to be borne in mind.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column735" />Column number: 735</div>
					<a name="08022725000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000502"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct. Those worst affected
are likely to be in places that are very rural and sparsely populated
and where average incomes are low&#151;areas with low-skill, low-wage
economies such as Lincolnshire and South Holland and The Deepings. The
difficulty is that to access opportunity, people have to travel long
distances and often cannot afford to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08022725000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000503"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
He makes an entirely valid point. Movements between different parts of
cities are another factor. I do not represent the area, but south
Bristol has pockets of extreme poverty and many of the educational and
employment opportunities are in the north or on the north-west rim of
the city at the M4-M5 interchange. Bristol has the most expensive
public transport bus fares in the country. So there are cost barriers
within urban areas
too.</div>
					<a name="08022725000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once the full
roll-out of diplomas has taken place in 2013, it is quite obvious that
14, 15 and 16-year-olds will travel around much more than they do under
the existing educational offer. For the purposes of the Bill we are
considering provision beyond the age of 16. When compulsion is
introduced, many more people will be travelling, whether they are doing
the advanced diploma, A-levels, apprenticeships or work-based training.
The unavailability of public transport will be a source of constant
frustration to many people around the
country.</div>
					<a name="08022725000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
mentioned before the comment made by my right hon. Friend the Member
for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) that the nearest further
education college to Berwick-upon-Tweed is 50 miles away. Transport
will clearly be a consideration in his area. Although the Bill
considers time, or adds time to the existing list of considerations
that local authorities will bear in mind, that might be regarded as
somewhat ironic in many parts of the country. I have already mentioned
Bristol where, ironically, it can probably take longer to travel from
one side of the city to the other than it may take to travel from
Berwick to Alnwick or any other part of Northumberland. Time is not the
same in all parts of the country, whatever the laws of physics say. It
is certainly not the same when it comes to public
transport.</div>
					<a name="08022725000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
a shame if people&#146;s choice was limited by the public transport
offer available to them, such that choice was only able to be
meaningfully exercised by those who have access to a car. One of the
unforeseen consequences of the Bill might be to encourage more
17-year-olds to put pressure on their parents to let them learn to
drive at perhaps too young an age, which could lead to other
unfortunate consequences.</div>
					<a name="08022725000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the evidence-taking
session at the start of the proceedings, and in subsequent information
given to me, the Association of Colleges said that 87 per cent. of
further education colleges currently already feel that they must
subsidise their students to ensure that they can travel to the courses
offered by those colleges. The provision currently available from local
authorities or from the pockets of individuals is not sufficient to
meet the current requirements of further education. The average cost
per further education college is a staggering
&#163;305,000&#151;that is the average cost out of the existing
budget that a college needs to find to subsidise its students&#146;
travel plans.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column736" />Column number: 736</div>
					<a name="08022725000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Various solutions have been put
in place in some parts of the country. In my own area, across the old
county of Avon and Somerset, local authorities and the local bus
companies have put together a youth rover ticket, which costs
&#163;420 a year. In London, public transport is to some extent
subsidised for younger people.</div>
					<a name="08022725000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000504"></a>Nia
Griffith:
						</b> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the increase in
the number of people that we are talking about participating under the
Bill is a very small percentage of the whole number of young people in
the cohort? Any additional expenditure will be a very small percentage
of what he describes.</div>
					<a name="08022725000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000505"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> The percentage of the cohort not in education,
employment or training, at whom the Bill is largely directed,
is&#151;depending on who you believe&#151;somewhere between 10 and
15 per cent. That is not an insignificant increase in the number of
people who may be travelling around. However, not only will more people
be caught directly by the provisions of the Bill, but the educational
landscape will change considerably over the next few years as diplomas
are rolled out. That change in the underlying structure of the courses
that people have access to will, in itself, cause many more people than
that 15 per cent. to travel around.</div>
					<a name="08022725000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, the hon. Lady and the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings, who often says this, all
want the diplomas to be a success, but if they are a success, more
young people will travel about the country than is currently the case.
It is not just about a narrow number, whether that is the 10 or 15 per
cent. of the current cohort; it is that many more additional journeys
will be made in the next few years, irrespective of what happens under
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022725000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see that
the clock is crunching down on me, but the main purpose of the
amendment is to ensure that when York Consulting provides its
independent report on transport plans to the Government, it will look
at affordability as well as the other factors currently within local
authority transport plans. I hope that the Minister will give the same
assurance to me as he gave the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton on a previous
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022725000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000506"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I have enjoyed the debate. Time is not the same in
all parts of the country&#151;certainly, those listening to our
debate this afternoon may have agreed with that sentiment. I was
reminded of a previous Public Bill Committee where another
representative of the Liberal Democrats told me that in part of Devon,
the sun rises in the south. That was equally bizarre.</div>
					<a name="08022725000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">To get to the point, I agree
with the hon. Member for Bristol, West that access to timely and
affordable transport is integral to helping young people to access
education and training, but I do not believe that the amendment is the
answer to those challenges. Local authorities already have a duty to
draw up a transport policy statement under section 509(1) of the
Education Act 1996. The policy statements relate to young people
travelling to school or college. The statement must set out the
provision of transport that they consider necessary to facilitate the
attendance of people of sixth form age in
education.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column737" />Column number: 737</div>
					<a name="08022725000385"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7 pm</div>
					<a name="08022725000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
preparing the statements, local authorities must take a number of
factors into account: cost is one, but the distance between home and
school and the need to ensure choice in education are equally
important. Local authorities must also consider the needs of students
who would not be able to attend a particular education or training
establishment without help or support&#151;the hon. Member for
Upminster mentioned that. Finally, the transport policy statement must
set out any arrangements for help with travel expenses that the
authority considers necessary. Those duties should already ensure that
transport costs do not prevent young people from attending school or
college.</div>
					<a name="08022725000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accepting the
amendment would not solve the problem of the absence of transport
infrastructure. That is important to ensure that people access
education provision, which we are all seeking to do. Cost is not the
only factor that we should bear in mind. Beyond the reassurances that I
gave on the previous amendment on the work that we are already doing to
inform policy on the matter, let me say that affordability and cost are
factors in the work that York Consulting is carrying out. I shall not
dwell on the technical issues raised by the amendment about how to
define affordable transport.</div>
					<a name="08022725000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Learning and Skills Council
makes &#163;32 million available through learner support hardship
funds to colleges and school sixth forms for that age group. Around 35
per cent.&#151;more than a third&#151;of that funding is used to
help individual students who have particular difficulty meeting the
cost of transport. The LSC also offers, as we know, support to that age
group through the education maintenance allowance. That is not
specifically aimed at transport&#151;far from it&#151;but
households and students can receive up to &#163;30 a week from the
EMA. An element of that might be used toward transport costs, but it
would not be reasonable to expect a young person to use all of it for
those costs. It is certainly worth bearing in mind that important
Government
innovation.</div>
					<a name="08022725000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000507"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I certainly supported the introduction of the
EMA but, as I understand it, it was meant to be an incentive to people
to participate in education rather than to meet transport costs. If the
Minister thinks that everything is okay at the moment and that no
further work needs to be done, why does he think that 87 per cent. of
colleges feel the need to subsidise their students&#146;
transportation
costs?</div>
					<a name="08022725000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000508"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I am not necessarily saying that everything is
completely rosy and we have commissioned further work on the matter.
Various obligations and duties are placed on local authorities by the
Education Act 1996 and others in respect of learner support, as I said,
so that people can access transport. Those powers will be used, but we
clearly have more work to do on cost levels, what is affordable, and
what is the right form of transport, if we are going to succeed in the
policy aim of raising participation. The crucial thing is the powers,
which are set out in the 1996 Act, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw the amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022725000509"></a>Stephen
Williams:
						</b> I listened carefully to what the Minister had to
say. I am not sure what my unspecified hon. Friend meant when he said
that the sun sets or rises or whatever it was in the south. That seems
to be rather a bizarre statement.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column738" />Column number: 738</div>
					<a name="08022725000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that
time and distance were not the same. We cannot have an exact equation
in all parts of the country because travelling a short distance in the
city of Bristol may take longer than travelling a long distance in a
rural area. Those things are not as simple as they
seem.</div>
					<a name="08022725000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
particularly reassured that the Minister takes on board fully the fact
that affordability is a major factor for some people. That is why
colleges must spend on average &#163;305,000 out of their budgets,
which is intended for other purposes, on transportation costs. None the
less, we eagerly await the findings of York Consulting. I am sure that
we will have to return to this topic at a later date when we have read
the report, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

							<a name="08022725000511"></a>Jim

						</b> The successful delivery of 14-to-19 education
depends entirely on there being a collaborative approach within a local
area. The local authority, the learning and skills council, employers,
higher education institutions and providers of pre and post-16
education need to work together to ensure that the full range of
curriculum and qualifications can be delivered. We said in the 14-to-19
education and skills implementation plan published in 2005 that we
expected all areas to set up 14-to-19 partnerships that would be led by
the local authority and local LSC. We know that that has happened on a
voluntary basis, and there are many strong examples of 14-to-19
partnerships, such as the one in south Gloucestershire near the
constituency of the hon. Member for Bristol, West. Such partnerships
are driving developments locally.</div>

few years will be crucial for the local planning of the infrastructure
needed for 14-to-19 delivery. We need to be confident that 14-to-19
partnerships are consistent, secure and able to have a strong voice in
their localities. The clause will strengthen and underpin the
arrangements that local authorities have set up for local co-operation
in 14-to-19 education by placing a legal duty on them to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column740" />Column number: 740</div>make the necessary collaboration arrangements. It will also ensure that
