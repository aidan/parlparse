Amendment proposed [2 June]: No. 59, in page 2, line 42, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) The Chapter I prohibition does not apply--
<P>
(a) to agreements constituting trade associations, or
<P>
(b) to vertical agreements in being prior to the coming into force of this Act.'.--[Mr. Boswell]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendment: No. 63, in schedule 1, page 43, line 46, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Trade Associations
<P>
 5A. Agreements constituting trade associations which appear to the Director to represent 50 per cent. or more of a given sector shall be treated as if they were designated professional rules within the meaning of Schedule 4.'.<P>

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): At the end of our previous sitting, we were discussing trade associations and paragraph (a) of the amendment. I now want to draw the Committee's attention to paragraph (b), which deals with vertical agreements. On several occasions, the more eager Opposition members of the Committee have accused my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) of being a wet. I fear that that accusation, first made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), will now extend to me.
<P>
I can understand why the Government might resist an amendment that would exclude en bloc new vertical agreements. No doubt there will be vigorous discussion later in Committee about some of the vertical agreements that govern, for example, the brewing industry and the pharmaceutical industry. It would not be unreasonable for the Under-Secretary to argue that it would militate against the spirit of the Bill to exempt new vertical agreements, not least because it would be difficult to distinguish between new vertical agreements and new horizontal agreements. If new horizontal agreements were caught automatically and new vertical agreements were not, people would no doubt exhibit the ingenuity that one would expect of the private sector and its lawyers--entailing huge compliance costs, of course, but that is a separate matter--to structure what would otherwise have been horizontal agreements as a multiplicity of ingenious vertical agreements.
<P>
It is not the purpose of amendment No. 59 to exempt or exclude new vertical agreements; it would exclude those vertical agreements that are already in force. By weakening the amendment in that way, we have not only made it possible for the Under-Secretary to accept it, but have significantly strengthened the argument in favour of it--an argument that is extraordinarily difficult for the hon. Gentleman to refute.
<P>
By and large, vertical agreements have been in force inter alia over the past year, the period during which the present Government have been in power and, except in a few cases, no action has been taken against them. People have come to rely on them; they have been an ordinary part of the course of business. It is presumed that they have not been doing great damage to the British economy. Indeed, on inspection, many of the agreements turn out to pre-date the previous Government and go back to previous Labour Administrations. Some of them have been in place for decades.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): My hon. Friend may be aware that most agreements that are concerned with petroleum retailing embody undertakings that were given to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1966, so they have already been running for 30 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend explains with his customary learnedness exactly the sort of agreement to which I was referring. Governments of different hues have considered the matter seriously and have all come to the conclusion--I adopt the Under Secretary's all-embracing phrase--that the agreements in question do not constitute a distortion of trade.
<P>
The dictum of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham at the start of the Committe's proceedings, that it falls to the Under-Secretary to describe exactly what he is trying to achieve if he wants to change the law, has particular application in such cases. If agreements that have subsisted for many years are to be overturned, or made liable to further investigation to which they were not previously liable, it falls to the Under-Secretary to explain which industries he is concerned with and exactly what sort of effect he wants to have.
<P>
I draw the Under-Secretary's attention to the fact that that is in line with his own logic. When he awoke from his slumbers during an earlier sitting, he pointed out to me that I had missed an amendment that exempted for certain purposes items which had received a section 21(2) direction from the director general.
<P>
<B>That Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry </B>(Mr. Nigel Griffiths): I specifically said that the hon. Gentleman was not a bore. Which of his other hon. Friend's did he think was boring me so much that I was slumbering--which I was not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that, although I suspect that, in my better moments, I may have bored him.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that he had quite properly exempted for certain purposes those agreements that had been registered under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 and which had received the appropriate direction. In the case of vertical agreements, we are dealing with something similar. I realise that many such agreements have not been registered, but they have the implicit blessing of the competition authorities. They stand in exactly the same relationship to the competition authorities as those agreements that have been registered and which have received approval. A blind eye has been turned on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): In the light of the Under-Secretary's continued procrastination on the subject of vertical agreements, does not my hon. Friend agree that that famous observation of Sir Winston Churchill, made in another context, is supremely apposite? The Under-Secretary has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent.''--[Official Report, 12 November 1936, Vol. 317, c. 1107.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If Sir Winston Churchill had not said that, my hon. Friend would doubtless have done so.
<P>
In his better moments, the Under-Secretary accepts the logic of my argument. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham never fails to point out, the President of the Board of Trade also seems to accept that logic because she, too, has said that many of the vertical agreements should be excluded.
<P>
The Opposition seek merely to simplify the task of that extremely long-running and apparently aggravated task force by excluding those agreements that, barring any special mention by the Under-Secretary, the Committee has no reason not to exclude--all those agreements that have, over the years, received the implicit blessing of the competition authorities. That is the sole and modest purpose of paragraph (b) in amendment No. 59.
<P>
If the Under-Secretary wishes to reject the amendment--it would be to the great detriment of the work of his own task force if he did so--he must explain clearly which pre-existing vertical agreements he thinks he ought to have been taken to task during the past year that, either through lack of energy of lack of legislation, he has been unable to take to task. That would be the only rational basis on which to object to paragraph (b) of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have had a useful debate. I was troubled by the Under-Secretary's response on Tuesday night because it exemplified several persistent misconceptions that Ministers have brought to the Committee and that we are trying to remove. The first was the confusion between international trade, which is the remit of articles 85 and 86, and the application of that broad philosophy to domestic legislation and domestic economic activity. That means a widening of the scope and, as we have tried to show, some extension and modification of the law, for reasons that have been well exemplified in the exchanges on definition that we have heard. It was highly significant that the only case of anti-competitive action in connection with a trade association that the Under-Secretary could cite was an international glass container case, rather than a domestic case. On reflection, I am aware of a few cases when that may have happened in domestic legislation without an international application. However, the sweeping-in of trade associations seems unnecessary and inappropriate.
<P>
Some interesting observations appeared in The Times on Tuesday in an article by Alasdair Murray about trade associations. I confess that in my preparations for Tuesday, I did not have a chance to read it until Tuesday night. The article rightly said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Trade associations should provide a vital link, sharing best practice across a sector and helping small businesses to make the most of developments such as new technology.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We would all agree with that. We are--or want to be--broadly friendly to trade associations. However, confirming what we have argued, the article suggested that trade associations may be threatened because we--and malicious competitors--will need to consider whether they are compliant with the new chapter I prohibition. The article cited circumstances such as the offer of cheap insurance, which could lead a disgruntled competitor to force a referral. It also mentioned the Association of Consulting Engineers' anxieties about its ability to offer legal advice to its members.
<P>
<B>Dr. Phyllis Starkey </B>(Milton Keynes, South-West): How many trade associations have been caught by restrictive trade practices legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am aware of at least one--I think that I declared an interest in agriculture earlier, but I do so now in case there is any doubt--the National Farmers Union, as a result of a policy that it might have subsequently regretted that advised its members to refrain from marketing cattle in the 1970s. That was the case that I had in mind.
<P>
Cases are limited, but we are trying to explain a problem. Such cases might have taken place and attracted the attention of the Director General of Fair Trading, who might have made a referral or considered the matter himself, but that procedure would have applied ex post and could subsequently have been considered. However, in this case, all trade associations undertaking any such activities might be at risk. They might not be caught, but they will need to consider with their lawyers--who do not come cheap--whether they might be caught and whether they are fully compliant and are seen to be fully compliant.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's argument that no one has been caught turns out not to be an argument in favour of changing the legislation because it does not catch anyone. Rather, it supports our argument that it is not necessary to change the legislation, at least for what lawyers would call settled cases, or settled understandings about how practices should take place, unless and until the director general can find a case for doing so.
<P>
In the amendment, the problem of trade associations is parallel to that of vertical agreements. As I predicted, the Under-Secretary started by giving the Committee the mantra that if trade associations were not indulging in anti-competitive action, they had nothing to fear because they would not be caught. In saying that, he showed no understanding of the practical problems faced by businesses in determining whether their current activities would be subject to sanction. The need to have recourse to lawyers, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)--who has temporarily left us--so eloquently argued, would ratchet up the compliance costs far beyond the Government's estimate.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not just a matter of getting advice; there is also the potential risk of legal challenge by third parties, which could be used to subvert the position of an agreement between small manfacturers and their distributors, as distinct from a large and integrated manufacturer which, by definition, would not need an arm's length agreement with the various sections of his business. The Opposition and the Government agree that there are tensions in the area and that things may not be easy. The Government say with one breath, ``There will not be a problem because vertical agreements will not be caught,'' and with the next breath, ``But we would like to exempt them anyway, just in case.'' At the end of his remarks, the Under-Secretary said that the Government believe that there is merit in giving special treatment to vertical agreements if that is practicable. The Under-Secretary nods at that. Yet if they do not require special treatment because, as he said, people would be caught only if they were indulging in anti-competitive action, why does he approve of it? That is not clear.
<P>
That brings me to the related, second-order issue of whether, if there is to be special treatment--the Minister has implied that there will be--and the task force is working away at that, it should be placed in the Bill. Several people, for example the Newspaper Publishers Association, have said in evidence that has come in since our previous sitting that they want such special treatment to be enshrined clearly in black and white, rather than be relegated to unamendable secondary legislation, made when all those matters may have been forgotten by everyone but the lawyers considering them at great expense. The Government are equivocating. Either it is or it is not necessary to have special treatment for vertical agreements--the Government have not explained which position they adopt.
<P>
My third point is that the Under-Secretary made it as clear as he could that he had not the faintest idea of the nature and basis of his compliance cost estimate, which is a maximum of &#163;4&#183;4 million for chapter I and chapter II prohibitions. He did not specify--of course he can do so today if he wishes--whether his compliance cost assessment includes the possible application to trade associations. We do not know the answer to that, so it is not clear who else was included or on what basis. I checked again the pro forma basis on which he set out matters, but it throws considerable doubts on the whole exercise--doubts that were reinforced when my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham and I recently consulted a leading FTSE 100 company about its costs and were told that it had originally thought it could do the job for about &#163;25,000, but on reflection and further advice, decided that the figure was lkely to be of the order of six figures--&#163;100,000. That, of course, puts a different complexion on the Government's piffling estimate of compliance costs. The Government suggested, at a rather late stage, so that we could not introduce an amendment--I shall not stretch your indulgence, Mr. Maxton, by trying to do so now--that there may be a form of words that would exclude agreements to which only two undertakings were party, and which were connected with purchase. It may be helpful if I make that form of words available to the Under-Secretary for his subsequent consideration, and I will readily do so.
<P>
Industry has considerable doubt about compliance costs--doubt reflected in a rather heavy hitting letter to the Financial Times yesterday from Messrs. Osborne, Smith and Wheaton, one of whom I know to be a member of the Under-Secretary's task force. The letter was headlined,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Little comfort if competition Bill ends up creating uncertainty''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It expresses concern, from experience of the European situation, about the need for adequate resources and a reasonable brisk time scale for consideration. The letter concludes that in the absence of the resources to enable the system to work properly,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the UK government is imposing an unreasonable burden on business.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a sad conclusion, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will avoid doing that. I give him the credit that his intentions are good; but his execution is still out for judgment.
<P>
I remind the Committee, Mr. Maxwell-- Hon. Members: ``Maxton.''] Forgive me, Mr. Maxton.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Await the writ.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend suggests that I may receive a writ from you, Mr. Maxton. Perhaps I can immediately absolve myself by saying that my wife's maternal great-grandmother used to write the gardening notes for the Independent Labour party magazine. However, that must have been a long time ago.
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): I have been waiting for a suitable moment to intervene. I have been following the hon. Gentleman's argument most carefully. He may correct me if I am wrong, but surely, were the amendment to be accepted and trade associations excluded from the Bill, any body likely to be involved in an anti-competitive agreement would simply form itself into a trade association to escape the Bill's provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am prepared to discuss the exact drafting of our amendment with the hon. Gentleman, but we are seeking to give grandfather rights to trade associations and to existing vertical agreements, so that they could continue unless and until challenged by the Director General of Fair Trading.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Redwood </B>(Wokingham): My hon. Friend won that exchange hands down. It has been explicitly stated that every trade association will now have to go to its lawyers to review all of its current practices and policies because the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) and his colleagues want trade associations to be covered by the Bill. As my hon. Friend clearly stated, we have in mind that when a trade association acts as such in the normal way, it shold not have to go to expensive lawyers every time that it sends a letter to its members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My right hon. Friend makes the point clearly. We need to consider such matters and get the provision right. Trade associations are a central part of the commercial life of this country. They are an important part of improving the productivity of British industry and commerce. While large intergrated companies may have access to the very best, expensive legal advice and make their own arrangements, where there is more fragmented competition, trade associations may strengthen the position of smaller competitors by giving them a degree of countervailing power to balance the influence of larger players, and therefore contribute to the overall objective of competition.
<P>
I remind the Committee that vertical agreements are no minor matter. Some of them are complex and difficult to read--they are probably read only when the relationship breaks down, or when a competitor seeks to attack them through the processes available in legislation--but they are the absolute stuff of commerce. They involve distribution, long-term supply, exclusive purchasing, dealerships, franchises, tied houses, technical co-operation, intellectual property and so forth. They cover a range of industries, such as enfranchising fast food, office services, retailing motor cars, petrol stations, pubs, car rentals and many others.
<P>
We are talking not about a walk-on part or an esoteric set of problems, but about the central relationship of supply and service chains affecting all British industry and commerce. The Under-Secretary admits that there is a problem--at least, he does when he wakes up to remember that he admits that there is a problem. Part of his answer is that an agreement will be caught only if it is anti-competitive.
<P>
The problem is that it is necessary for operators and undertakers--either those in trade associations or those with vertical agreements, not all of which are caught by existing European prohibitions under articles 85 and 86--to run their agreements past their lawyers. Even if they have done that and believe that they have acted innocently, they are still at risk. That presents a huge difficulty: it increases the compliance costs and diminishes any notional benefit to competition and economic welfare. The Under-Secretary should be uneasy about that, and he should accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I shall be brief. I did not speak in this debate during the previous sitting, except to intervene once or twice on the Under-Secretary, who replied very courteously. He said that the task force, with which we are all familiar, is still sitting. Given the fact that such matters go back to last August and September, we are concerned at the delay in coming to conclusions.
<P>
Of course, every Government contains indecisive Departments--no names, no pack drill. Certainly those of us in the Government in which I served knew perfectly well that, if we asked certain Departments for a reply because we wanted to settle a dispute between two Departments, it would take them four times as long as any other Department to reach a decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In view of our joint interest in education, perhaps my right hon. Friend would agree--I am being charitable to the Government in saying this--that there are certain cases for, if not masterly inactivity, at least measured progress in certain Departments. Indeed, I think he will remember the position of Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator, who saved the Romans' bacon by delaying matters. Perhaps we could be generous and say that, if the Board of Trade gets it right at the end of its deliberations, it would be reasonable recompense for the delays that we and the British industry have endured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Of course, I, too, admire Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator. I said, ``No names, no pack drill''. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and I had the great privilege of serving the late Lord Joseph. I suspect that there was a race between us for which of us had the greater admiration for him. I do not wish to imply in any way indecision on the part of the late Lord Joseph--de mortuis nil nisis bonum--but even my hon. Friend would agree that there were periods when the late Lord Joseph appeared to be permanently on the battlements of Elsinore. It was the job--even of an Under-Secretary, such as myself--occasionally to dart from a turret, tug at his sleeve and say, ``Secretary of State, the moment has come to make a decision''.
<P>
I shall propound Brooke's law in the context of this debate. From the literature that the Library has helpfully provided, I notice the total antithesis in the views of the Confederation of British Industry, given in response to the consultation of September last year, and in those of the National Consumer Council. Brooke's law is, essentially, that the Department of Trade and Industry, as presently led, is a rabbit paralysed between two headlights and that one of the headlights belongs to the CBI. In other words, if the CBI represents part of the argument, but someone else argues powerfully on the other side, the DTI cannot make a decision for a long time. I realise that the task force is still sitting, but my plea is that such matters should be resolved while the Bill is still before Parliament. We should not simply read about it in secondary legislation.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I should like to contribute to the debate in support of my right hon. and hon. Friends and to talk specifically about vertical agreements.
<P>
I must say at the outset that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) is a celebrated figure and a parliamentary legend in his own lifetime. I could not possibly compete with him, so I shall make no attempt to do so. Suffice to say that there is a touch of Kafka about the situation in which we now find ourselves. Eight months on from the statement made by the President of the Board of Trade, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset rightly pointed out, I have had occasion several times to highlight, we are none the wiser.
<P>
Try as we have done to establish the Government's position on vertical agreements, we seem, rather like the character in the castle, to be ever further away from the destination. It is not unreasonable for us to ask what are the Government's intentions. If the Under-Secretary is unbothered by the fact that we are not being told what the Government intend, I hope that he is not unbothered by the fact that thousands upon thousands of legitimate enterprises the length and breadth of the United Kingdom have not been apprised of the Government's intentions.
<P>
We want to exempt existing vertical agreements from the chapter I prohibition. The President of the Board of Trade said last August that most of those vertical agreements were benign and that there was a good case for their exclusion, which she went on confidently to assert would be welcomed by business. Yet, we have not heard what the Government intend to do. I want to flush out from the Under-Secretary whether he believes that all existing vertical agreements are benign. Is he satisfied that none of them is anti-competitive or damaging? If so, why cannot he state categorically, especially with the advantage of eight months' work on the subject, that existing vertical agreements will be granted a block exemption from the chapter I prohibition in the Bill?
<P>
If we deduce from the Under-Secretary's steadfast stonewalling that he is not convinced that all existing vertical agreements are benign, it is incumbent on him to tell us which ones are anti-competitive or damaging. I recognise that the Under-Secretary always has pressing business on his mind, but if he can pay attention, in the midst of his other duties, it would be greatly welcomed by members of the Committee--Conservative Members, in particular.
<P>
Are there existing vertical agreements that the Under-Secretary thinks are damaging either to other businesses or consumers? Do they lead to an increase in prices in ways that are unnecessary, unfair or uncompetitive? If so, which agreements are they? If he believes that they constitute a majority, presumably he is not persuaded by the case for a block exemption. If, on the other hand, they constitute a small minority, cannot he offer an assurance that the majority of existing vertical agreements will be eligible for a block exemption from the terms of the Bill?
<P>
If the Under-Secretary wants the matter to be considered on a case-by-case basis, it is not entirely clear what the purpose of the established task force is. The task force was established some time ago and I am not aware that its composition has been publicly revealed. If I am mistaken, no doubt the Under-Secretary will tell me, but there is uncertainty about who is serving on the task force and grave uncertainty about the precise terms of reference that have been ascribed to it. We do not know the intended timetable for completion of its deliberations. Moreover, we have been given no information by the Under-Secretary about the task force's progress, which is a matter of the utmost seriousness. What have been its deliberations to date? Have written or oral representations by Ministers been made to it? Do Ministers attend every one of its meetings? Why cannot we see what has been produced so far? Is not it possible--indeed, desirable--on this vexed issue, which need not be party political, to have a public debate? Where do we stand? When can we expect a result? Which agreements has the task force considered? Which interests from the private sector has it consulted?

<P>

<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> If a member of a supply chain has a monopoly position and that supply chain is ultimately constituted into a vertical agreement that restricts access to other companies and supply chains, does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is an unfair practice? If so, a simple test to show that a vertical agreement is not anti-competitive is the existence of similar vertical agreements in the same marketplace, providing similar types of supply chains. Garages and their supply chains were suggested as an example. As many of those exist, it is clearly not an uncompetitive practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> An abuse of dominant position is covered by the terms of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is aware of the multiplicity of vertical agreements in operation across a range of sectors throughout British industry. If he has attended to the detail of those agreements and has established whether they are exclusive or monopolistic so as to deprive entry to the market to other players, it escapes me why he has not communicated that important knowledge to his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who is having great difficulty reaching a decision on these matters.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman can assist the Under-Secretary, he will be doing us a signal service. First, the hon. Gentleman might prevent the need for the further consideration and pressing of the amendment. Secondly, he would be helping the Under-Secretary, who is having the gravest difficulty performing in this Committee. Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman would no doubt satisfy his long-held ambition to move to the Government Front Bench. I do not know why we are waiting.
<P>
Do the Government intend to make no public statement about their intentions until after the European Commission has completed its investigation of vertical agreements? If so, I should welcome the Under-Secretary's confirmation. It is deeply unsatisfactory that when the terms of the Bill are being considered in Committee, and when we are seeking, public-spiritedly, to improve it, the Under-Secretary is effectively closing off debate on an extremely important aspect of our concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that in the brewing industry, the brewing companies individually have had to file cases and suits in Brussels, some of which have continued for four years? No brewing company in this country yet has a cast-iron guarantee that its practices are permissible under the Brussels regulations. We are now advised by the brewing companies that if the Bill is passed unamended, they will have to go through exactly that same process once again under the new United Kingdom law. Is not that tremendous double jeopardy involving great expense?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Not only is my right hon. Friend correct; he has helpfully reminded me that I was informed of that concern only a week or so ago by one of my constituents, a gentleman who served for 40 years in the private sector. He worked for Whitbread and rose from a junior position to become the company secretary. It may be of interest that my constituent lives at 7 Redwood Drive in Buckingham. He has told me of the widespread concern in the brewing industry about the uncertainty that my right hon. Friend describes. When will the Under-Secretary resolve the problem? When will he tell us when the task force will report? Why can we not know exactly who is on the task force? Why can we not be told the state of its current deliberations? Will the Under-Secretary guarantee that we will receive further particulars about the Government's intentions before the conclusion of the European Commission's investigation? Answers, answers, answers are needed; none have been forthcoming thus far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is also reasonable to ask the Under-Secretary to give us those answers before parliamentary consideration of the Bill is concluded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely correct. I had hoped that I had made that point, but I obviously did not make it sufficiently strongly. We are entitled to know when considering the Bill what its ultimate effects are likely to be.
<P>
Some consequences of legislation are unpredictable, but we are at least entitled to know whether there will be a bloc exemption, what progress the task force has made and what is the present drift of Government thinking. It is a profound parliamentary impertinence for the Under-Secretary and the lick-spittles who assist him in Committee to expect us to go through all the deliberations on the Bill without being told what the Government intend to to about vertical agreements.
<P>
We know that the Under-Secretary does not have a high opinion of Parliament; we know that the Government are not terribly interested in Parliament's opinion. The idea that whole swathes of British industry and commerce should remain in suspended animation until the Bill is passed and then be told what is to be done is wholly unacceptable. That denies Parliament its right and duty to study in detail policy that will impact upon thousands of commercial enterprises.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will take the criticisms that have been made in good part. He has preserved a reasonable good humour in Committee so far. If he can today give us details and offer reassurance to put my worried mind at rest about the future of agreements between oil companies and filling stations, between tour operators and travel agents and between brewers and tied pubs, I will pat him on the back and congratulate him. I will be grateful to him, and thereby for ever damage his political prospects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I would not have spoken in this debate had not the Under-Secretary made some remarks during our fourth sitting on Tuesday afternoon that prompted me on reflection to realise that there is a problem with what he has told us. It was the Under-Secretary's remarks about trade associations that first worried me. He appeared to contend that if the amendment were passed and trade associations--or agreements constituting trade associations, to be more accurate--were excluded, there would be a risk that trade associations could engage in anti-competitive activity. In the same speech, the Under-Secretary contended that the reason why the prohibition had to be applied to trade assocations was that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 had been ineffective. Yet the Under-Secretary is saying that the ineffectiveness of the Act has not stopped anti-competitive activity. He draws no illustration, by reference to domestic UK trade associations, that that so-called ineffective regime has led to anti-competitive activity within or by trade associations. Indeed, he implied the opposite by commending trade associations for the propriety of their activity and their pro-competitive benefits.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary went on to suggest that, given licence, trade associations would rush down the path of engaging in anti-competitive activity. The inherent problem is that the hon. Gentleman has adduced no benefits from applying the prohibition to trade associations because he can adduce no examples of when trade associations, using the relative ineffectiveness of the present regime, have engaged in anti-competitive activity. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham have talked about the costs and risks that arise for trade associations.
<P>
However, those costs and risks are underestimated by compliance cost assessment. I am not talking only about the risk of penalty because, in specific instances, the Government have acknowledged and given some limited immunity from penalty. It is probably not the penalties that would be the principal risk against which trade associations would have to defend themselves with legal advice, but the risk of their agreements being voided and the risk of third parties engaging in actions to seek damages. We are dealing with a prohibition that would lead to strict liability. If it were found that an agreement entered into by a trade association, without the object of distorting competition but with the effect, subsequently proven, of having done so, someone could through the principle of strict liability go to court and claim for damages against the trade association.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> When reading the report of our previous sitting, I was struck that the Under-Secretary had not said whether he interpreted such matters in the way suggested by my hon. Friend. Can he say whether strict liability would obtain? Does he regard the voiding as retrospective--a question that is material to my hon. Friend's point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That applies to trade associations, but we are dealing with a matter that we shall return to in another context. If the Under-Secretary could clear up the issue now, it will dramatically inform our debate. I suspect that his answer will be that agreements would be voided technically retrospectively back to the point at which they were made. When strict liability applies, it is likely that damages would be applied going back to the point at which the effect on competition that was proven to have infringed the prohibition could be demonstrated to have occurred. In strict liability, it is a case of saying that the prohibition has been infringed, so damage will have occurred and, if it can be quantified, compensation will be paid. I am not a lawyer, but that seems to be what would happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend is on a most important point. Does he agree that the nature of the retrospectivity is especially important because the only thing that would need to be shown is that the object constituted a distortion? It would not have to be voided from the moment that the effect became known, but from the moment at which it had the object, which would be from its initiation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that comment, but I shall not debate it with him--although I think that he is right. If we intend to present that point on the Under-Secretary and ask him to give us an answer, there is no point in debating it now.
<P>
We can demonstrate that trade associations and those who combine within them face substantial risks. We all know, from working with those bodies, that they rarely enjoy substantial assets; they rest essentially on the assets of the companies that comprise them. If significant dangers face companies wanting to become members of trade associations, they may be inhibited from joining.
<P>
Trade associations subject to such risks could incur substantial legal costs, which would bear heavily upon them. I know from personal experience that trade associations do not normally incur substantial costs, and that companies often look extremely sceptically at proposals made by trade associations. Anything that increased the cost to companies of membership of trade associations and that had the potential to diminish the benefit of membership might substantially reduce trade association activity.
<P>
I come next to vertical agreements. I was prompted to speak in this debate not by what the Under-Secretary said on Tuesday, but by his inability to respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) on the extent to which vertical agreements had been outside the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976. The Under-Secretary seems to be saying that we do not need to worry about vertical agreements and that we shall be told why at some point. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) said, that seems to be an odd way of proceeding. The Under-Secretary also said that where there is a section 21(2) direction, schedule 3 will grant an exclusion.
<P>
That argument falls down on two grounds. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made clear, no all vertical agreements were given section 21(2) directions. Some were excluded from the scope of the RTPA because they were held to have a generally pro-competitive character and therefore would not benefit from the schedule 3 exclusion amendment moved in another place.
<P>
Secondly, the schedule 3 exclusion has many qualifications which the director general can use to bring many of those agreements back within the scope of the prohibition. Because of that clawing back, many of those presently participating in vertical agreements will need to seek legal advice, and probably notification and guidance from the director general on how he intends to exercise that further power.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in discharging the duties of a director, it is necessary to show due diligence and to ensure the company's position in the way that the law is approached?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend is probably right. The duties of directors are onerous and include the requirement to protect the company against legal challenge; indeed, directors are bound to the company not only legally, but commercially.
<P>
It seems that risks apply to vertical agreements even if the agreements are extant. Can the Under-Secretary demonstrate that the anti-competitive practices engaged in by trade associations or that are the result of existing vertical agreements are such that those groups should be denied the exclusions given in clause 3? They should have that certainty, but it is removed by the clawback provisions of schedule 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend's point is entirely reasonable. The Under-Secretary may believe that it would be wrong for him to name those companies that he thought were guilty of anti-competitive practices, but it would assist the Committee if he were to identify in which industries such anti-competitive practices are taking place. He does not need to identify culprits, simply inform the Committee of his belief that there are culprits. That would assist us by showing the broad thrust of the Under-Secretary's thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, it is for the Under-Secretary to justify his resistance to the amendment. He has not yet shown sufficient justification for that resistance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Just to add to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, it would of course be open to the Under-Secretary, if he did not feel confident about some area of practice, to initiate proceedings under the existing regime. He could seek advice from the director general on that matter before the Bill is passed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, he could. That returns us to the issue of the compliance cost assessment, which I will not dwell upon, as I did so last Tuesday. The Government's estimate of the benefit to be derived from the Bill--of the welfare lost to the UK economy by anti-competitive activity--is an indeterminate one of several billions of pounds. That amount is not broken down in any way; we can see the costs, but we cannot disaggregate the benefits. The Under-Secretary must tell us to what extent the benefits of removing anti-competitive activity relate to existing trade associations and vertical agreements. I suspect that there is little relation between them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is right about that. My worry about the Bill goes in the other direction. If we combine the public policy exemption and the exemption for revenue-producing monopolies, we will allow much anti-competitive practice, which is highly concentrated in a few sectors, to remain in the economy. There is little, if any, problem elsewhere, but other sectors will be paying heavily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right; the compliance cost assessment rests upon broad economic analyses of welfare losses to the economy as a whole arising from imperfections in the market. It is not in any sense qualified with reference to the Bill and the extent to which regulated monopolies and other imperfect markets occur with the sanction of Government. When we consider that, we realise that a substantial part of the welfare loss attributed in the compliance cost assessment to anti-competitive activity that will be challenged by the prohibitions will not be covered. Overall, the benefit will be much smaller.
<P>
Just to conclude my point about vertical agreements, I will reiterate the point made about trade associations, which also applies to pre-existing vertical agreements. They too, by virtue of the clawback provision in schedule 3, are subject to the risk not only of penalties but of voiding of agreements and third party actions. Although agreements may have been registered under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act and have received its protection, under the Bill they will be subject to any unnecessary risk which is much greater than that which they ran under that Act. Agreements that may have been varied under that Act may be voided under the Bill. Companies may incur significant penalties and may face significant actions for damages.
<P>
When we weigh the downside of vertical agreements--as we must in the commercial context--we see that in some cases it will become much greater if companies are held on an effects basis to have infringed the prohibition. We can assume that companies will not have entered into such agreements with the object of distorting competition; otherwise the Government or the director general should have sought to have the agreements registered under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act and challenged in the courts. The Under-Secretary must answer a range of questions that he has up to now failed to answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> This is perhaps our most instructive sitting so far, because it has exemplified the difference between a forward-looking Labour Government and an Opposition who look to the past 21 centuries to the time of the Romans and have not evolved. It is little wonder that on 1 May last year, we came, we saw and we conquered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> No.
<P>
The Bill makes generous provision for existing vertical agreements to ensure a fair and orderly transition to the new regime. As a matter of principle, the Government do not accept that existing vertical agreements that may be anti-competitive should be let off the hook because of weaknesses in the current regime, which we inherited. Nor would it be right for new vertical agreements to be discriminated against because of the laxities and failings of the present system.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The Opposition offer three views on vertical agreements and on the work of the task force. About half a hour ago, the hon. Member for West Dorset said that the task force should be wound up. His distinguished colleague, the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminister said that it should make speed in its deliberations. That contrasts with the argument presented in the other place by the Opposition spokesman, who emphasised the dangers of proceeding too quickly, the need to avoid creating loopholes for anti-competitive agreements, and the need to take account of the European Commission's review of vertical restraints. Lord Kingsland's advice was that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``this is one of the areas where we need to make haste slowly. If we rush ahead too much, we may find that we have to change everything that we have done in the light of what the European Commission has done.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 30 October 1997; Vol. 582, c. 1188.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Opposition present three different views--what is new?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shall generously give way if the right hon. Gentleman will allow me to cover the additional points that hon. Members have raised, to which it would be discourteous not to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Member for Daventry was asked how many trade associations agreements and recommendations had been caught by the restrictive practices legislation. He said that, to his knowledge, there was one--the National Farmers Union. He is, of course, a farmer, so he would know that the NFU was indeed caught. However, as a shadow Minister and as a former Minister of some experience, he should know that the impact has been wider than the NFU and the industry with which he has been associated. The figure is not one, or two, or even a dozen--there are 183 trade association agreements, but the hon. Member for Daventry seems to be aware of only one. The shadow Secretary of State, who intervened on his colleague, also did not seem to be any the wiser.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way; I had almost given up trying to intervene, because he seemed to be so reluctant to give way. As he has done me the courtesy of mentioning me specifically, will he concede that I thought of that myself, on reflection after the Committee? Whereas he could name none when last challenged, he has now wisely consulted his officials and has been able to provide the extremely interesting figure of 183. Perhaps he will now address the issue on which I sought to intervene a moment ago, and which my hon. Friends have been consistently pressing. How many existing vertical agreements that are thought to be anti-competitive and causing concern are not tackled under existing legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It is no wonder the hon. Gentleman wants to get away from restrictive trade practices legislation and the number of trade associations. Having had the benefit of the days since Tuesday to study the matter, he has come up with only one association--he does not know about all the others, even though he has had 48 hours or so to do his research. I am not surprised that the hon. Member for Buckingham tells the Committee that he is none the wiser. It is beyond my powers--or, indeed anyone's powers--to make him wise at all. The same goes for the amendment. It shows the chaos in the Opposition. They do not even seem to know who is on the task force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> No.
<P>
The task force includes the CBI--
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Wind it up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman want it to be wound up now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Here comes the cavalry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Under-Secretary will be aware that Lynda Martin Alegi, who represents the CBI on the DTI vertical restraints review group, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The consensus of economic opinion is that vertical restraints are under most circumstances beneficial. So to include them in the legislation is to attack a primarily benign group of agreements.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, why will not the Under-Secretary accept our amendment?

<P>

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Clearly, the companies that operate in the United Kingdom and in Europe are used to dealing with such agreements. The present regime is insufficiently robust to deal with abuses of vertical agreements. It is not an excuse for the fact that we have had to put up with weak legislation, which has been accepted as such, since the Conservative Government first introduced the subject in 1989 and published a Bill in 1996--when no attempts were made to exclude vertical agreements wholesale. This is a Johnny-come-lately amendment, tabled because of the principle of opposition--a principle so ill-informed that Conservative Members cannot agree with each other about it. The only reason why we are having this debate today--members of the Committee will know that we are revisiting the issue--is because the right hon. Member for Wokingham had to scribble notes for his speech on the next group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way. I thought that I would have to wait until eternity. Will he tell the Committee, without reference to particular companies, which existing vertical agreements are anti-competitive? He has given a feeble and inadequate response so far. I ask the question politely and invite him to answer it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not know, because of his inexperience, that no Minister with responsibility for competition matters would give such an example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> If the right hon. Member for Wokingham, when he was a Minister, would have given examples, I should be interested to hear that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> It is quite permissible for a Minister with responsibilities for competition to identify an industry in which he fears there are anti-competitive practices, and then to refer it through the usual channels for a proper investigation. My hon. Friends are asking whether there are industries that the Under-Secretary would be minded to see referred for investigation if the old law continued. If so, we assume that they would be the ones that he wishes to catch by the tougher legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I have no intention of naming an industry or sector that, hypothetically, might be damaged by it being cited as an example. The right hon. Gentleman knows that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman has had his chance. In the 48 seconds since his previous intervention, I do not think that he would have improved on the 48 hours he had previously, when he came up with just one example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I want to make progress. I will not give way again. My hon. Friends will need no urging from me to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I mean no discourtesy to the Under-Secretary, but earlier he suggested that he would give way to me if I was willing to remain seated while he developed his argument. As that did not happen, will you allow me to make my point now, Mr. Maxton?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is entitled to make a speech if he so wishes. The debate has not finished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> As the Under-Secretary accused me of not knowing the Opposition's stance in the other place, I shall read what my noble Friend Lord Fraser of Carmyllie said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``My Lords, I have certainly achieved my objective in obtaining a full and helpful statement from the Minister as to where we have reached in the deliberations on finding an exclusion for vertical agreements. For that I am extremely grateful to him. I suppose I did not expect to get a clear indication of a precise timetable from him, but I repeat that if it were to prove possible to bring forward an amendment on an exclusion for vertical agreements at Third Reading, I give him the clear assurance that he would receive no complaint from us that it had appeared rather late in the passage of the Bill through this House.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 9 February 1998; Vol. 585, c. 903.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that direct quotations from speeches made in the other place are not allowed in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the Under-Secretary at least admit that this is another instance of trying to incorporate European legislation directly into United Kingdom law and finding first, that it does not fit UK domestic circumstances, and secondly, that it is difficult to find a way to depart from EU law in order to match it to UK domestic circumstances?
<P>
Richard Whish, an eminent competition lawyer, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If it's a matter of domestic law, you shouldn't treat it the same as the Community would. After all, the most precious part of Community law is the desire that no behaviour should have the result of dividing up the Common Market. But that's not a policy we need in the UK.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Community has taken the attitude that vertical restraints may have the effect of dividing up the Common Market, whereas in this country, although those same vertical restraints may segment the market, they are not necessarily anti-competitive in their effect. It does not follow that to secure competition benefits in this country we must have legislation that is devised for the EU's purposes of protecting the Common Market, when we have no difficulty with our domestic market being segmented as long as that is to the benefit of consumers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Under-Secretary has a reputation for being one of the cheeky chappies of the Government, but on this occasion his response to the debate is not a joke, it is seriously inadequate. I have two concerns that I want to place on the record. First, the hon. Gentleman has played hide and seek with the Committee in a way that is unacceptable and borders on the offensive. He might not have intended that to be the case, but it is. My right hon. and hon. Friends will recall that he has refused to specify companies that he believes to be guilty of anti-competitive practice. I do not criticise him for that. However, a few moments ago I asked him--without naming companies, which he might think it invidious to do--to specify sectors in which anti-competitive behaviour was taking place that would justify treating existing vertical agreements under the chapter I prohibition. The Under-Secretary declined to do so, and claimed that he could not possibly be expected to do so.
<P>
The position is even worse than that. Not only will the Under-Secretary not name sectors in which anti-competitive agreements are judged to be taking place, he will not even say whether, during its eight months of deliberations, the task force has concluded that any existing vertical agreements are anti-competitive and should therefore be subject to the chapter I prohibition.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
All that is required from the Under-Secretary is a simple movement of the head--he needs merely to nod or to shake his head. Has the task force so far concluded that some existing vertical agreements are anti-competitive--yes or no? We do not need to know the names of companies involved; we do not require to be told in which sectors those companies are operating. Our request is modest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I am not, as a Minister, receiving interim reports from the task force. The task force will issue its final conclusions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful for that informative response. The Under-Secretary has now put on record in the Committee that he is entirely ignorant of the present thinking of the task force on a matter being considered by the Committee in the context of the Bill. That strikes me as extraordinary. The Under-Secretary says, ``I'm ignorant guv. Don't ask me; I'm only the Minister.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend may have noticed that the Under-Secretary's Department is joined with the task force, which does not operate independently. Indeed, a letter that I received from the Under-Secretary dated 1 June confirms that, ``We''--that is, the Department--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``are considering carefully with the CBI and others on the task force whether additional flexibility in the Bill is desirable for the treatment of vertical agreements''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Under-Secretary cannot claim that he is considering the matter and at the same time walk away from such consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Under-Secretary should probably abandon his nescience. He has deployed for the Committee an assumed state of ignorance--I believe that that is the dictionary definition of nescience, but I am happy to be corrected if I am mistaken. If the Under-Secretary does not know the present thinking of the task force, even though, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry points out, the Department is adjoined to it, we are bound to conclude that departmental officials are unwilling to divulge their knowledge about the deliberations to the Under-Secretary for fear that he will not understand them or cannot be trusted. Or have other Ministers who are privy to the task force's current thinking been unwilling to share it with the Under-Secretary? In other words, is the Under-Secretary to all intents and purposes disembodied from the Department which he respresents in this Committee?
<P>
The Under-Secretary is a pitiful figure if he cannot answer such straightforward questions I regret that. He has an agreeable disposition and is, in many ways, a pleasant individual; and he is not an unintelligent man. However, he is not discharging his responsibility to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend should understand something about how the Government work. It is no longer a question of being sidelined, but of being Sandlined. We will circulate the text of today's proceedings to the important industries affected by the provisions so that they can see that we tried to clarify the position for them, but that we singularly failed to obtain anything of interest or substance from the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. He reminds the Committee of what it probably knows already--that he, as shadow President of the Board of Trade is assiduous in honouring his obligations. His assiduity is a direct antithesis to the Under-Secretary's lazy approach. We are right to inform those industries that the Government are not prepared to say which of them will be affected and how they will be affected. The Under-Secretary is not offering any meaningful information to the Committee.
<P>
My second worry is that, unless I failed to hear him, the Under-Secretary did not tell the Committee when the task force would finally reach its conclusions. When will he become aware of them? It seems that he may be the last person in the Department to be told. Those who sit on the front desk at the Department, and those who perform other important ancillary duties there, will undoubtedly know before the Under-Secretary does. We have not been told when the task force will reach its conclusions, when an announcement can be expected, or whether the Government intend to await the conclusions of the European Commission's investigation into the matter before making a statement. We are not getting answers.
<P>
The Under-Secretary fails in his duty. He owes it to the Committee and to the House, but, above all, he owes it to the potentially affected industries and enterprises, to come clean and say what will happen--or at least say when a statement will be made about what is to happen.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It would be useful to put on record that the Commission has already communicated--albeit not yet in public document form--its follow up to the Green Paper on vertical restraint, so the Under-Secretary's excuse about Europe's non-response is rapidly running out of road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is right that the Under-Secretary has no excuse for saying that he knows nothing of the European Commission's thinking. It is bizarre, in my limited experience, for a Minister continually to argue that he cannot give specific answers to a Committee because he does not know the answers, and further to imply that he does not know the answers because no one has told him, a mere Minister, the drift of the Commission's thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Buckingham clarified the position. There is ample scope in the Bill to implement the task force's conclusions once the task force has finished its deliberations. Would the hon. Gentleman therefore explain his determination to pre-empt the task force's findings and act in ignorance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The answer is simple--legislation should be clear and specific on how it treats affected parties. The hon. Gentleman appears to be arguing in favour of shell legislation; he wants a skeleton. He seems to believe that it is acceptable to add flesh to the skeleton after the task force has reached its conclusions, but that is not satisfactory.
<P>
My right hon. and hon. Friends and I believe that before the Bill reaches the statute book, we should be able to answer people's questions. We should be able to answer a tour operator who asks, ``Will the vertical agreement that I have with a travel agent be excluded from the chapter I prohibition of the Bill that you spent a month or so considering in Committee?'' We should be able to answer a brewer who asks, ``Will we be secure in our arrangement with tied pubs under the terms of the Bill that your Committee has just considered?''
<P>
We are expected to provide answers to legitimate inquiries made by parties who will, one way or another, be affected by the Bill. That is my answer to the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard). I want to know now the broad thrust of the Government's thinking and, in as much detail as possible, how the Bill will affect people operating in the commercial sector who want to know how to plan for the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a further answer, which is of the utmost importance? The Under-Secretary and his colleague the Whip agreed to move that clause 1 be considered before clause 73, in the new arithmetic. He could also have moved to the end of the proceedings the consideration of clause 3 and schedule 3--the only other available slot to raise the issue--which falls to be considered at our next sitting, but he did not. Several sittings from now, we shall have passsed the point at which it is possible in Committee to amend any relevant section.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely sensible point. The Government could have decided to move consideration of clause 3 to later in our proceedings, on the basis that they do not have answers now but might then. The fact that they have not done so leads me to worry further. The danger must exist--it has not been denied by the Under-Secretary--that the Government will not have reached conclusions on their intended policy by the end of the Committee stage, and perhaps do not expect even to have received the conclusions of the task force before the end of Committee stage. If so, Ministers will probably argue that there is not much point in moving consideration of clause 3 to the tail end of Committee proceedings, because the Government will be as ignorant then as they are now about what they intend to do in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Under-Secretary's subtext--I believe that the word now used is ``object''--may be to use the wording already present in paragraph 7 of schedule 3, which allows the Secretary of State by regulation under public policy provisions to exempt such vertical agreements as he wants, and thereby to avoid--or nearly avoid--parliamentary scrutiny of the matter?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Members for West Dorset and Buckingham are beginning to stray way beyond the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I defer immediately to your guidance on the matter, Mr. Maxton. I have no wish to detain the Committee unnecessarily. I detect the smack of firm chairmanship, to which I shall of course respond. Suffice it to say that if the Under-Secretary intends to avoid proper parliamentary scrutiny of his intentions and of the Bill, would that he had the courage and candour to say so. I would be unwise to hold my breath while waiting for the Under-Secretary to confirm that that is his intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to be called again, Mr. Maxton. I want to set the record straight. The Under-Secretary apparently thought that I advocated the winding-up of the task force. I hope that the record will show that I said nothing of the kind: I certainly intended to say nothing of the kind. I am sure that it will not be wound up, and I did not hope that it would. On the contrary, I hope that it will deliberate and rapidly reach a satisfactory conclusion. I suggested that its task might be made easier if it were told that pre-existing vertical agreements did not need to be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> At this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes, at this stage. That is very different from winding it up. That would still leave us with the serious question of how future vertical agreements should be treated, which is an appropriate issue for a task force to consider. That is far from suggesting that it should be wound up.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster reminded me of the happy days when we jointly worked at what was then called the Department of Education and Science. He may recall that one of our colleagues at that time, Lord Swinton, faced a problem similar to that which my right hon. Friend improperly quoted from the House of Lords Hansard. Her found himself--as the Under-Secretary now finds himself--in a spot of local difficulty as it turned out that further education had been illegal for some years. The Government had repeatedly promised to do something about it, and he was questioned about the matter. I offer the example to the Under-Secretary as a way of dealing with the problems with the task force that my hon. Friends have highlighted.
<P>
The noble Lord Swinton was asked whether his previous statement that something would be done shortly and his present statement that something would be done soon meant that something would be done. He replied that he had no idea whether shortly was sooner than soon or whether soon was sooner than shortly, but that he was sure that it would be either shortly or soon. I think that that is what the Under-Secretary is telling us about the task force.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> On a superficial reading of clause 3, it could cover trade unions, especially in the light of our discussion on trade associations. Does my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary intend to use the powers conferred by clause 3 to exclude trade unions and union agreements from the application of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> If we are now briefly referring to matters relating to clause 3 which were not covered in our previous debate, will the Under-Secretary tell us why he believes it desirable to have a power under the clause--taken together with schedule 3--to bring mergers and concentrations back within the scope of the chapter I prohibition? Do the Government intend, at any time, to bring mergers and concentrations back within that prohibition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have had a full discussion on some detailed aspects of the clause. Will the Under-Secretary tell us in what conditions the rather wide permissive powers for the Secretary of State to proceed by order to provide or to remove additional exclusions are likely to be exercised? If we are to grant such powers, it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary were to tell us broadly what is in the Secretary of State's mind and for what cases such provision is being made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I shall deal with the key points in turn. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford that the Bill is not intended to be used as an instrument for regulating employer-employee relations. The Bill will not apply to such employment relation agreements.
<P>
European Community jurisprudence will govern the interpretation of the prohibitions. European Community competition law has existed for more than 35 years, and we are not aware of any successful challenge to an employment-relation agreement. A trade union, in representing employees in negotiation with an employer, is generally viewed for the purposes of EC competition law as not being an undertaking. Therefore, agreements between an employer and a trade union on employment conditions should not be caught under the chapter I prohibition, which applies to agreements between undertakings or associations of undertakings. Similarly, a union, in representing employees, should not be subject to the chapter II prohibition because it is not an undertaking.
<P>
Some unions, especially in the media sector, represent individuals who are technically self-employed for tax purposes. We do not believe that that would necessarily make such unions undertakings, or associations of undertakings, for the purposes of the Bill.
<P>
EC competition law looks to the substance of the matter, not its technical form. For example, a singer in the chorus of a theatre production might be self-employed for tax purposes, although he could not in substance be described as an independent economic player so as to constitute an undertaking. There are dangers in excluding matters that we do not believe are caught in the first place. Doubt can be cast on the scope of the prohibitions more generally by implying that those excluded agreements would otherwise be caught. Drawing a line around the scope of an exclusion for such agreements might be difficult to do in practice. Once a line has been drawn, those falling just outside it may feel compelled to notify their agreements even though they should not be caught in the first place.
<P>
Excluding such agreements might also be considered as a statement of belief by the UK Government that such union agreements would be caught by article 85 if they affected trade between member states. There is no need to make special provision in the Bill for employment-relation agreements, even for unions representing self-employed workers in the sense of UK employment legislation. However, if there were unexpected developments in case law that posed a serious risk to those agreements, there would be a good case for exercising the powers of exclusion under the Bill.
<P>
There is a measure of parliamentary scrutiny in the actions of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and the hon. Member for Daventry was right to draw the Committee's attention to that matter. It should also reassure the hon. Member for Buckingham that my right hon. Friend will apply fair and objective criteria within the spirit of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The statement that the Under-Secretary conscientiously read out is one of the most interesting that I have yet heard in Committee--not least for what it did not say. The hon. Gentleman did not refer to the phrase ``concerted parties''. Under a layman's interpretation, a trade union is manifestly a concerted party. Nor did he say whether an English court, when considering whether a trade union affects trade within the United Kingdom, would be considering a different matter from that which the European Court of Justice would be considering when deciding whether trade unions affect trade between member states--a much more implausible proposition.
<P>
The Under-Secretary admitted, by implication, that case law might arise in the United Kingdom that showed that trade unions were caught. In that eventuality, he said that he would want to take action, which would require primary legislation--unless he were to use clause 7. The honest answer that the hon. Gentleman would give had he been properly informed is that he does not know whether the UK courts will include trade unions. If they do--as, in my view, they may--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman's intervention is far too long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It is clear that European Community jurisprudence establishes that an agreement may be caught by article 85 only when there is an effect on trade between member states. It is unlikely that the implications for use will be as great as they will be in other countries, especially continental countries with close borders such as the low countries, where there is some labour movement. Such a problem is not likely to arise from the approach taken in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> While what the Under-Secretary said may be substantially true, he will, of course, know that we have a land frontier with the Republic of Ireland and that a significant number of trade unions based in the United Kingdom have members and agreements within the republic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Indeed. However, EC law has applied over that land border for more than 25 years, but it has caused no problem. We are aware of no successful challenge to an employment relation agreement anywhere in Europe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry that my intervention was too long, Mr. Maxton. I had thought that the Under-Secretary had finished and that I was making a speech.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has reiterated an unclear interpretation. For the record, I shall state how I view the matter. The Bill deals with trade within the United Kingdom. That differentiates it utterly from article 85, now article 81. They deal only with trade between states, so their applicability to trade unions is limited.
<P>
I accept the Under-Secretary's point about the low countries, although it is interesting that trade unions tend to be nationally based. It is difficult to show that they affect trade between states, whereas they clearly affect trade within the United Kingdom--if they do not, what else are they doing? It also seems clear that they are, or could be, construed by English courts as being concerted practices. I do not know what a concerted practice would be if it were not a trade union.
<P>
Clearly, there is a presumption that, if nothing is done, the Bill is likely to engender legal challenge in the courts by the trade unions. That will create case law. I suppose that the Under-Secretary is asking his hon. Friends to rely on the fact that the Government will take action in that eventuality. Of course, it is not known whether a future Government would want to take such action. A future Government might consider that trade unions should be outlawed under the Bill. I doubt that that is this Government's intention. However, how will the Government act in those circumstances?
<P>
I presume that the Under-Secretary is telling us that the Bill contains an all-purpose safeguard in paragraph 7 of Schedule 3, under which the public policy provision will allow him to act by order. He said that there would then be parliamentary scrutiny. However, I understand that such scrutiny would be by negative resolution.
<P>
I think that the Under-Secretary is trying to tell us that he does not know whether the clause will have the right effect on trade associations. He does not known whether it will have the right effect on vertical agreements, because the committee on such matters will not have reported before the Committee finishes considering the Bill. He does not know whether the clause will affect trade unions.
<P>
The Under-Secretary does not mind whether the Bill will have the right or wrong effect because the clause will allow him to undercut many of the Bill's effects in a way that virtually escapes parliamentary scrutiny. That is, constitutionally, a deeply dangerous precedent. The Under-Secretary has alerted--perhaps unwittingly--the Committee to that pattern. When we consider schedule 3, we should be alert to the possible use of paragraph 7.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Enactments replaced</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 10, line 22, leave out `Sections 2 to 10 of'.
<P>
This is a probing amendment, and I hope that it receives a rapid response and that we can move on. Its purpose is to discover why the Government want to retain various elements of existing legislation in parallel with, or in addition to, the Bill, which, it has been claimed, is based entirely on European law, the European treaty and European jurisprudence.
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, a consequential new clause would be needed to deal with one or two provisions that both the Government and the Opposition would want to continue. For example, we would not want to end the grant-making power under section 20 of the Competition Act 1980.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Why did not the right hon. Gentleman table an amendment to that effect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I understand that the normal order of proceedings is that new clauses come at the end of a Committee's deliberations. Were this amendment to have been accepted, we would have had time to table a new clause. I mention it now, before the Under-Secretary raises the matter, to show that the Opposition were fully aware of that when we considered how we should tackle the Bill.
<P>
The purpose of our probing is as I have described. The Bill has been advertised by the Government as a means of sweeping away two different competition jurisdictions--a British one and a European one--and replacing them with a single, amalgamated jurisdiction. It is the Opposition's case that that has not been done cleanly or well, because elements of the old law will have to remain in force.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way before he develops his argument. The consistent theme from the Opposition Benches has been to reduce the burden on businesses. Is not it particularly important that we should reduce that burden even more rigorously in view of this morning's news that interest rates have been raised yet again?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I have just been told of that big event, which bears out what we have been saying--that Labour is bad for business and that a lot of damage is now being done by their economic and commercial policies. However, I shall not delay the Committee; I shall shortly go to express my views elsewhere. I know that you, Mr. Maxton, would not want me to go on at length about those other events.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The right hon. Gentleman claimed that as new clauses are tabled for the end of a Committee's proceedings, he did not need to ensure, as a matter of priority, that section 20 was retained. So why has he already tabled a number of new clauses? They were a priority, but this was not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> We space our work according to the Committee's timetable. I have just told the Under-Secretary that were the amendment to be pushed to a vote and were it to be carried--two events that are not very likely--we would then table the new clause. We may discover later this morning either that the amendment is not put to the vote or that it is not carried, in which case I would have wasted my time tabling a consequential new clause. I have exposed the fact that the Under-Secretary is, as always, playing silly political games instead of listening to the substance of the debate about the structure of the Bill.
<P>
We believe that it is extremely difficult to adapt rules and treaty obligations governing inter-state trading for intra-state trading. That is the main burden of our critique of the big idea behind the Bill. One cannot do that and create a completely streamlined law without running the risk of double jeopardy. The Under-Secretary, by his deeds, shows that he accepts that proposition.
<P>
The Bill still includes elements of the old British competition law, implying that even the Under-Secretary believes that he cannot construct a complete competition law, uniting British and European law in a single Bill. He is asking the Committee to approve elements of the old law and elements of the new law; and, of course, we always live under the treaty law, which remains a separate jurisprudence, whatever the Under-Secretary might wish.
<P>
Clause 17 shows the muddle of the legislation. Clause 1, which we were not allowed to debate at the start of our proceedings, as would be normal, repeals certain elements of existing British law. Clause 17, which, in new Labour arithmetic, follows clause 3, is another clause containing a partial repeal.
<P>
The schedule of comprehensive repeals, schedule 14, provides for other elements of the Competition Act 1980 to perish, but, because of the logic or order that the Under-Secretary is following, it is not referred to at this stage of clause 17, but instead comes up elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As my right hon. Friend said, we are now debating clause 17. Does he think that there is any particular significance in the Government's reluctance to debate clause 4?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> No, I do not think that it is conspiracy; it is just muddle. The Government are getting used to the extraordinary muddle in both the construction of the Bill and in how the Committee is being guided by the majority group on it.
<P>
We have some questions that we want the Under-Secretary to answer. Why has he been unable to sweep away all existing British competition law? If he believes that Euorpean law is more severe and better, why cannot he simply get rid of all the old British law and draft suitable legislation reflecting the principles of European jurisprudence? Does the Under-Secretary agree with our main point that he is unable to do that because the treaty is not sufficient for the conduct of a full domestic competition policy and that the main purpose of the Bill was misconceived?
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary give the Committee a little more guidance on why he thinks the measure will remove double jeopardy when we see separate problems developing? We have already noted the double jeopardy element because of the British and European content to the law--two jurisdictions will remain in place. There will be ECJ and the Brussels Commission on the one hand, and the competition authority and the British legal system on the other.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I am following the right hon. Gentleman's argument carefully, but I cannot understand how he intends to probe the Government's intentions on inter-state trading by tabling an amendment for the courts to repeal the Government's powers on intra-state trading? Does the right hon. Gentleman believe that attempting to remove the Secretary of State's powers to order an investigation into pricing or monopolies helps to probe the Government's attitude to European law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman is doing the Government's job. He has shown that this measure cannot simply replicate European legislation; there must be a separate British element. Therefore, the question of double jeopardy remains. The Under-Secretary says that the European law is deficient; that it would not be sufficient simply to have the treaty articles and the Competition Commission set out in a different part of the Bill, and that there are other elements from the old system that must be maintained by only partial repeal of the RTPA and competition legislation. The weakness of his case is why the Bill needs to be introduced in the first place and whether it will be less or more difficult for business to deal with.
<P>
We are very worried about the double jeopardy aspect. We think that business will have much more hassle because elements of the old system will remain. We accept that the Under-Secretary understands that every company will have to review its existing practice to see whether it meets the new legislation, but there is a big divide in the Committee about how onerous a task that will be and how much it will cost.
<P>
Our probing amendment illustrates that the Under-Secretary has failed to make our law entirely dependent on and compatible with European law, and we shall be interested to hear his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> What will astonish members of the Committee and those who read our proceedings is the fact that the right hon. Member for Wokingham has known about the problem from the time he was a Minister--indeed, he held this post. For eight years, the previous Conservative Government were aware of the grave concerns industry had about the failings of the competition regime. More than that, the view of British industry was that the Competition Act 1980, which the amendment would repeal, had deficiencies that were beyond redemption and that there was a pressing need for wholesale reform, which could not be done in a minor way tinkering with the 1980 Act. That was clear when the right hon. Member for Wokingham was a Minister in 1989 and he did not dissent from it then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Yes I did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The right hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that he did, but I do not think that the record will show that. It is not something that he screamed from the roof-top of No. 1 Victoria street.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary should judge me from my actions. Had I thought that the law was in need of fundamental change, I should have introduced new legislation to the House of Commons. I did not because I did not think it necessary to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The right hon. Gentleman certainly expended enough time in considering the matter and forcing business to do so. His successor, as President of the Board of Trade, introduced proposals, a White Paper and a Bill in 1996. Business was working hard and waiting in anticipation for legislation, so it now welcomes this Bill to reverse almost a decade of Conservative thinking on the matter--which created more uncertainity in business than the right hon. Gentleman could imagine.
<P>
When my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade introduced this Bill, it was widely welcomed. The notion that the right hon. Gentleman can now table an amendment that he calls a probing amendment, which as my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) so eloquently pointed out, would remove some of the Secretary of State's critical and vital powers, takes us back to the past when the regime was so unsatisfactory. The Office of Fair Trading took years to reach a conclusion on Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiries. Companies were driven out of business. Consumers were forced to pay higher prices. The behaviour was patently anti-competitive, yet no proper sanctions could be imposed.
<P>
From 1989 onwards, the right hon. Member for Wokingham did not modify his Government's proposals to take account of that. It appears that he did nothing. He did not respond to the pressing demands of the CBI for new and better legislation. He did nothing. The matter was left until 1995-96 when the then President of the Board of Trade introduced proposals that we have modified, but which remain substantially the same. I look forward to the right hon. Gentleman explaining the critical differences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Is the Under-Secretary giving way or has he finished?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am giving way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary should know that during my time as a Minister with responsibility for competition, the CBI never once came to see me to demand a fundamental revision of competition law. It regularly saw me on other matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I suspect that the CBI knew that it would be a complete waste of time to talk to the right hon. Gentleman about this issue--or, indeed, anything else--because he has never been seen as a friend of business.
<P>
I want to speak about the consequences of repeal in two areas, although my hon. Friends may want to raise other areas.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I realise that I am a mere lick-spittle, but perhaps my hon. Friend can help me. What is the amendment intended to probe? My hon. Friend has been accused of trying to make British law identical to European law. I heard my hon. Friend say that he wanted our law to be in line with European law, but that is not the same as wanting to make it identical. Had my hon. Friend wanted to make our law identical to European law, surely he would have simply repealed all British laws on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> What my hon. Friend says is quite true. It is because of a failure to listen to that point, which has been made regularly since last summer, that not just the hon. Member for Buckingham but the whole of the Opposition are none the wiser.
<P>
I want to refer to two important sections of the Act that are to be repealed. Sections 11 and 12 provide for references to the MMC to investigate public sector bodies and examine their efficiency, service and possible abuses of monopoly power. Since 1980, there have been a number of substantial references of that nature--including several during the right hon. Member for Wokingham's tenure of office--involving bus companies, railway companies, coal companies, steel companies, and the Post Office. The then Secretary of State provided a list of areas which he considered it in the public interest to refer to the MMC. Therefore, I do not understand how the right hon. Gentleman can table such an amendment and hope to retain any credibility.
<P>
Sections 21 and 24--especially section 24--contain provisions for amending parts of the Fair Trading Act 1973 to modify arrangements for the performance of the MMC's functions. They have been valuable in allowing the Secretary of State to ensure that where a merger was likely to be referred, and the MMC had established a working group to examine it, it did not examine such a reference once the proposal appeared to have been abandoned. That has cut down bureaucracy and the need for the companies and parties involved to spend money on legal experts for a fruitless investigation. That is a rather useful anti-bureaucratic measure. If the Act was repealed as the right hon. Gentleman wants, he would saddle businesses with unnecessary costs.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman now well knows the consequences of repealing section 20, although I suspect that when he tabled the amendment, they had either not been thought about or were deliberately sought. Far from being a probing amendment, it is a wrecking amendment that would turn the clock back, when we wish to turn it forward.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I fail to see how the amendment can be described as a probing amendment, given that it would repeal important powers of the Secretary of State. What gross discourtesy it shows for the people involved in organisations such as the National Consumer Council and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. The shadow Secretary of State said that he would table another amendment but, when he tabled amendment No. 60, he should also have tabled one that would retain the Secretary of State's powers in another form.
<P>
The work of an organisation that is of such tremendous value to the citizens of our country should not be cast aside. My constituency post bag is full enough now. Goodness knows how full it would be without the citizens advice bureaux doing most of the work in areas with which we often have to deal. To table such an amendment shows great disrespect for such good organisations.

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That was a foolish attack. We do not want the grant-making power removed. I have given the Committee my word that, were the amendment to be accepted, we would table the necessary consequential amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> Do I understand from what the right hon. Gentleman said that that is entirely consistent with the way in which he has been attacking the Government for not dotting every ``i'' and crossing every ``t'' in the White Paper?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> It is entirely consistent because there is a big difference between the Under-Secretary and me that is relevant at this juncture: he commands a majority in the Committee and can achieve his ends, whereas, to date, I have been unsuccessful in every Division. It is more important that the hon. Gentleman does his homework in good time and lets us know his full intentions. I have made it clear to the Committee that I intend to table a suitable new clause, were amendment No. 60 to go to a vote and were it to be passed--both eventualities which, I believe, are unlikely. If the Committee will bear with me for a moment, I shall explain why.

<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster </B>(Hastings and Rye): Perhaps we are being unkind to the right hon. Gentleman by suggesting that he is against such organisations. Perhaps it was simply inadvertence on his part in that he forgot that the Competition Act 1980 provided such powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That remark was a little kinder than the other foolish criticism, but it is untrue. When I introduced the amendment, I said that it was a probing amendment, I then said immediately that, were it to go to a Division and be accepted, we would table a consequential amendment. I did not have to be prompted by the Under-Secretary to say that. It was clear from the Competition Act 1980 that section 20 was an exception to the general rule that the Act is all about competitive matters.
<P>
For once, however, we have achieved something with a probing amendment. I wanted to demonstrate to the Committee and the world beyond that it is impossible, in my view and that of the Under-Secretary, to have comprehensive competition law that is based on two simple prohibitions derived from articles 85 and 86 of the treaty of Rome. We have proved that point and the hon. Gentleman cited two examples of powers that were needed and have been useful in the past, which he believes need to be continued by omitting from the repeals schedule such sections of the Competition Act. The case is proven that there needs to be an additional British element to the law to capture such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> By saying that he has proved something to me, is not the right hon. Gentleman taking on the role of an advocate who was not involved in a case saying in a pub afterwards that the conclusions were reached properly by the court because another advocate had put the case well. We have been putting the case for reform of the 1980 Act since before the election and subsequently, and we accept those premises, yet the right hon. Gentleman gets up today and claims to have proved it. He is agreeing with what we have always stated. We are not making a big political point; although he shakes his head, we all know the truth of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> If, in due course, the Under-Secretary refreshes his memory by reading the words of the President of the Board of Trade in debate or by going back to the original consultation, he will see that the prime intention was to simplify the law, to remove double jeopardy and to remove the conflicts between the European and the British systems. We now know that the Bill cannot do that. Business will remain at risk from there being two separate jurisdictions; there will be elements of European law and of previously existing British law, as well as strong elements of the new British law, if the Bill is passed.
<P>
That was the point that we wished to illustrate, and we have done so admirably. We have also managed to get the Under-Secretary to revise his criticism of me over the introduction of the Bill. On more than one occasion, he claimed that I wanted to change the law in 1989 and that I had now changed my mind. I put it to him that the CBI had never lobbied me to change the law, and he replied that it would not have done so because it knew that it would be wasting its time.
<P>
The Under-Secretary now clearly accepts that, even in 1989, I did not want to introduce legislation like this. I have not changed my mind since. I have been consistent throughout. The Bill is badly drafted, it is messy and it will be expensive for business. We would rather keep the old legislation until something better can be produced, but we have achieved our main purpose. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman,</b> being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendment proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</B><P>
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abuse of Dominant Position</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 10, line 38, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) Nothing in this section prevents--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) offering bulk discounts or promotional discounts,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the operation of existing contracts that have been cleared under previous competition legislation,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) specifying the manner in which a brand is to be supported by retailers, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) franchise agreements.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We come now to the second of the Bill's great prohibitions, the abuse of dominant position. It will be necessary, with your leave, Mr. Maxton, to take some time on this other heart of a two-hearted Bill. We are probing it to see whether it is also a big-hearted and well-meant Bill.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 61 is to offer some reassurance to business that existing business practices, which we and they think are reasonable--and more important, which the existing competition authorities think are reasonable--can continue. Clause 18, especially subsection (2) about selling prices, limiting production and so on, is a little too wide ranging and could jeopardise or worry people going about normal business practice. The amendment would clarify or modify the four grounds given in subsection (2), to offer business some reassurance.
<P>
The first case where reassurance is needed is that of businesses which offer bulk discounts or promotional discounts. We first debated the matter in connection with so-called predatory pricing. We would not wish businesses to be unwilling, for fear of legal action, to offer a traditional discount to someone who wanted to buy more and which therefore offered a better deal from the supplier. Nor would we wish to get in the way of promotional discounts, launching new products or developing the market share of a product.
<P>
We hope that, in replying to the debate, the Under-Secretary will either welcome the amendment or at least place it clearly on record that there is no intention in the present strict drafting of clause 18(2) to prevent that sort of legitiate business practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> How does the right hon. Gentleman's view fit with the Michelin case, in which such practices were found to be anti-competitive?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary is worrying me a great deal. If he is saying that he wants to live in a world in which it is not reasonable for a substantial business to offer customers bulk discounts, people will be most disappointed by the results of the Bill. He is right to say that there must be a way for the competition authority--currently, the director general and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission--to make inquiries to discover whether a bulk discount has gone beyond the point at which it is a reasonable business practice and has become threatening or predatory.
<P>
We need a reassurance from the Under-Secretary, preferably written into the Bill, that in most cases bulk discounts are a perfectly reasonable business practice. The Under-Secretary has worried me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is not the danger that unless that is clearly understood and put on the record by the Under-Secretary, we may well lurch into an American Robinson-Patman situation, which may ultimately have inimical effects on competition, and certainly on the consumer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary might want to reconsider that before replying to the debate.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I shall just deal with this point, and then I shall give way. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to reassure business that normal bulk discounts will remain reasonable practice under the Bill, as they are under existing legislation. Of course, we should leave in place or create a structure to enable investigation into whether bulk discounts were reasonable or an anti-competitive practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I can spare the right hon. Gentleman anxiety. Of course there is no intention to tackle the ordinary practice of bulk discounts given by so many businesses that benefit consumers so much. We intend to tackle only anti-competitive practices, such as that in the Michelin case, which should not be exempt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> We are making progress. That assurance from the Under-Secretary is now clearly on the record, although we still think that it would be better if it was made clear in the Bill. I do not accept the Under-Secretary's view that including the reassurance that he has just given the Committee in the Bill would prevent the Competition Commission pursuing a case in which it thought that a bulk discount had tipped over the edge and become predatory or in some other way anti-competitive under the terms of the prohibition.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has now put the position on record, but surely it is already clear in the Bill. The Bill makes it clear that price must reflect the cost of supply. If someone supplies in bulk, the cost of supply is reduced, and it is clear from the Bill and from European jurisprudence that price can be reduced to reflect that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> If the hon. Gentleman rereads paragraph (2)(c), he will see that it specifically prevents a business
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is room for interpretation of those words. It could be said that they would prevent bulk discounts, because a company could bring a case that it was unfair that, because its competitor was five times its size, it was buying at a much more beneficial rate. It is by no means clear how a court would decide such a case under the Bill, although the Under-Secretary has given us the modest reassurance that he thinks that a court should take the view that a normal bulk discount is a reasonable business practice, and that it would just be the smaller company's bad luck if it were not able to buy in larger volume.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I challenge the right hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the clause. Surely the key factor is that if someone buys a tonne of goods, he must offer the price for supplying it to whoever wishes to buy it. The size of the supplier to whom he is selling does not matter; if someone buys in bulk, he must offer the same terms and conditions, as the Bill specifies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is one interpretation of the words; I have offered another. It is by no means clear how a court would determine the matter or how the Competition Commission would view it in different cases. We have some reassurance in that the Under-Secretary seems to be of the hon. Gentleman's mind that bulk discounts are reasonable. If so, what is the objection to making that crystal clear in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene. I suspect that the clue may lie in the word ``equivalent'', because if items are to be deemed equivalent, they must be subject to a test, numerical or otherwise. I suppose that it could be argued that they be subject to a test of value, but the Under-Secretary might say that items of the same bulk quantity--the tonne cited by the hon. Member for South Thanet--might be regarded as establishing a similar case. It is important to tease that out, so that everyone understands whether such discounts by quantity are covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The case rests on paragraph (a) of our proposed subsection (2A).
<P>
We suggest in paragraph (b) that the Secretary of State might like to give comfort in the Bill to parties to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``existing contracts that have been cleared''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under existing competition legislation, which, were the amendment to be passed, would become ``previous competition legislation''. The business community has tried and tested many agreements and practices under existing competition legislation--in itself an expensive but necessary task in its day. Would it not be a good idea to reduce the transitional costs and to reassure business by saying that if an existing contract has been cleared under the present regime, It should have a grandfather or grandmother right to automatic clearance under the new legislation? Again, the amendment is an attempt to do so.
<P>
The amendment would not prevent the new Competition Commission from investigating such practices at a future date and determining that, for future cases, a practice would not constitute reasonable conduct. We are trying to prevent unpleasant retrospection in the Bill in such cases, and to reassure business that something that is deemed reasonable today--by the Under-Secretary, because anything permitted today has his express approval--should continue, unless and until people are given time to adjust and a new determination is made by the new authorities. That is a welcome suggestion, which the Under-Secretary might like either to adopt in this form, or to return to Committee with words of his own that achieve the same or a similar effect.
<P>
The third proposal embedded in the amendment is to permit some brand management, allowing manufacturers to specify how their brands should be promoted and supported by retailers. The practice is common; most people regard it as perfectly reasonable for the development of good brand management and for informing the customer.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): For clarification, will the right hon. Gentleman confirm whether the purpose of paragraph (c) of his amendment is to exempt selective distribution agreements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The primary purpose of paragraph (c) is to provide some interpretation and modification of subsection (2)(d), which makes illegal supplementary obligations to contracts. I am worried that some types of brand management will fall foul of that subsection when, at the moment, the competition authorities think that the practices are reasonable.
<P>
Selective distribution raises some interesting competition issues; the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) is right to raise them. Again, on some occasions such practices may be reasonable; on other occasions, they may be anti-competitive. They should be investigated case by case if, and when, it is felt in the country that they may be anti-competitive. That system has been operating for many years. At times, I have thought that certain selective distribution arrangements were unreasonable and wanted them overturned while, at other times, I considered that other arrangements were reasonable and were in the interests of the customers as well as those of the brand and the manufacturer. It is important to deal with the arrangements case by case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Am I right to understand that the right hon. Gentleman's thesis is that he prefers to remain in a position where, as in the past, anti-competitive practices are examined on a case-by-case basis? That acts against the spirit of the Bill, which is to introduce prohibition measures across the whole tranche of activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is slightly bolder language than I would go in for. I am not happy with the spirit of the Bill because I do not like retrospection nor large fines being placed on people who are carrying out their business activities in the way in which they have done in the past without the forewarning that the regime has changed and that their business practices are no longer reasonable. I accept fully that there are anti-competitive practices which, from time to time, need rooting out. They are best examined and then stopped if the competition authorities discover them to be unreasonable.
<P>
Later in our proceedings we shall table new clauses and amendments that would increase competition in markets on a case-by-case basis. We shall specify examples of industries where more competitive conditions could be created. That is the correct way in which to proceed. The proposed subsection (2A)(c) would provide some comfort for certain selective distribution arrangements, but it would be limited by the Bill's overall spirit. It would still be open to the competition authorities to deem the practice anti-competitive over and above the comfort offered by the amendment, which would allow reasonable brand support. Selective distribution is one of the cases on the edge of whether brand support is reasonable or unreasonable.
<P>
At present, Britain has some limitation on the distribution of newspapers through retail outlets. It is not possible for everyone to buy newspapers for distribution purposes. I do not know whether the Liberal Democrats say that the Bill introduces a welcome end to that practice and that they are happy with the consequences that that might have for rural and small newsagents. If the hon. Member for Eastleigh wishes to clarify that, I shall give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I cannot but accept the right hon. Gentleman's generous invitation. He will know that it is not permissible for me to make a speech during an intervention. No doubt, I shall have an opportunity to respond to him in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I think that that means that the hon. Gentleman is a little embarrassed by the hard line that he took on the issue. He said first that selective distribution was wrong. Now that I have come up with a difficult case for him, he seems to be moving back rapidly in my direction by saying, ``Well, perhaps exceptions will have to be made''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Member for Eastleigh has just displayed an uncharacteristic reticence. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the hon. Gentleman might not wish to place on the record a view of distribution arrangements because that will probably depend on the person or interest to whom or which he is speaking at the time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That was a slightly uncharitable remark. I understand what motivated it, however, as I, too, have experienced Liberal Democrats saying one thing in one place and another thing in another place. Such practice is not unknown for that party. As for the Government, they uniformly say one thing, but uniformly do another--which is also a fairly undesirable way in which to proceed.
<P>
I come now to the fourth point of the amendment. It is also important to give some comfort to those in franchise agreements, many of which would fall foul of one or more of the four paragraphs of subsection (2). It would be welcome if franchise agreements could be offered such comfort. In normal circumstances, such an agreement would be deemed to be a reasonable way in which to proceed. Again, we do not wish to impede the competition authorities in investigating and banning elements of a franchise system.
