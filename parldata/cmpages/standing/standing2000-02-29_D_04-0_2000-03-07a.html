<P>
<B>Mr. Crispin Blunt </B>(Reigate): I beg to move amendment No. 108, in page 26, line 23, after ``131'', insert ``or 205(1)(ea), (eb), (g) or (h)''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 109, in page 27, line 33, after ``131'', insert ``or 205(i)(ff), (h) or (i)''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> It is always nice to begin a new sitting with a debate on small but helpful amendments, which are likely to be warmly welcomed by the Government because they deal with lacunae that the parliamentary draftsmen have overlooked. I look forward to the Minister either accepting the amendment or explaining why my understanding is incorrect. We had a slightly unfortunate exchange during the previous sitting. The Minister advised me that the amendments that I had moved were unnecessary, given that sections 131 and 205 of the Army Act 1955 applied and that those involved were civilians. However, I may have been misdirected and we may have to return to that matter on Report.

<P>
In examining clause 6, I found a reference to section 131 of the 1955 Act, which alerted me to a potential oversight in the Bill. Under clause 5(1), new section
75J(2)(b) states:

<P>
if he is subject to military law only by virtue of section 131 or 205(1)(ea), (eb), (g) or (h) of this Act, may be required to comply, before release or later, with such requirements as appears to the judicial officer or judge advocate.
During the previous sitting, the Minister advised the Committee that sections 131 and 205 of the 1955 Act covered civilians, so I withdrew the amendments that I had moved. However under clause 6(1), new section 75K(6)(a) states:

<P>
the accused is subject to military law only by virtue of section 131 of this Act
Therefore, I am concerned that section 131 is not linked with section 205(1)(ea), (eb), (g) or (h), as it is in clause 5. We are trying to ensure that the clause covers the appropriate people, so I am not entirely sure why section 205(1)(ea), (eb), (g) or (h) of the Army Act 1955, or section 205(1)(ff), (h) or (i) of the Air Force Act 1955, are not referred to in clause 6. I have considered that matter carefully and, as far as I understand it, the reason might relate to the custodial duties of senior officers, other than commanding officers.

<P>
I simply suggest that there has been a drafting oversight in relation to those subject to military law under sections 205 of the Army Act 1955 and of the Air Force Act 1955, if taken into military custody under the powers of arrest during proceedings in clause 6. The amendment would ensure that the clause covers all those who should be covered, as under clause 5. I hope that the amendment will be accepted.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr. Lewis Moonie):</B> I have an early start at this sitting. As the clause is closely linked to clause 5 and we went round the houses on that clause at the previous sitting, I will explain more fully what is involved. The hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) spoke about the people who will be caught by the Bill. My direction at the previous sitting was correct, but I sowed some confusion through my misinterpretation of the amendment, which suggested to me that the hon. Gentleman wanted to reduce the required sentence. Reading the amendment again, I discovered that that was not the case and I am happy to accept that. However, that was not the substance of our later debate, and it might therefore be helpful to go through clause 6 in full and put our thinking on the record.

<P>
Confusion arose mainly in relation to officers in the Territorial Army or reserve forces. To ensure that there is no further confusion, I will describe precisely which categories of persons will be caught by the new offence. The first category comprises those being tried under the service discipline Acts for offences committed while those persons were subject to service law. Ex-regular soldiers are a simple example of persons in that category. Section 131 of the Army Act 1955 and of the Air Force Act 1955, and section 51 of the Naval Discipline Act 1957 provide that such former service personnel remain subject to service law only for the purposes of arrest, custody and trial, although they have ceased to be subject to it generally.

<P>
The second category of persons consists of those who are descirbed in the four relevant paragraphs of section 205(1) of the Army Act 1955 and of the Air Force Act 1955 and in section 111 of the Naval Discipline Act 1957. In the Army, that means every officer of the Territorial Army who is a special member when in permanent or full-time service or undertaking any training or duty, whether in pursuance of an obligation or not. I stress the word ``special'' because those officers constitute a specific category of Territorial Army officer and are to be distinguished from ordinary Territorial Army officers who are subject at all times to service law and do not fall within the groups of persons under discussion.

<P>
A further category of persons covered by the offence comprises every officer of the Army reserve in permanent or full-time service, undertaking any training or duty--whether in pursuance of an obligation or not--or serving on the permanent staff of the Army reserve.

<P>
Every warrant officer, non-commissioned officer and man of the Army reserve in permanent or full-time service, undertaking any training or duty--whether in pursuance of an obligation or not--or serving on the permanent staff of the Army reserve is also covered by the offence.

<P>
The final category includes every warrant officer, non-commissioned officer and man of the Territorial Army who is in permanent or full-time service, called out for home defence service, undertaking any training or duty--whether in pursuance of an obligation or not--or serving on the permanent staff of the Territorial Army.

<P>
Permanent service applies when staff are called out under the provisions of the Reserve Forces Act 1980. Full-time service is when they make a commitment to work full-time for the services. Home defence service applies to those members of the TA whose call-out liability is limited to the defence of the UK. Liability for deployment is limited to the UK. The phrase ``undertaking any training or duty'' refers to the minimum number of days that staff are obliged to undertake by virtue of their membership of a reserve force. Of course, they can volunteer for additional duties.

<P>
Persons on the permanent staff are known as non-regular permanent staff. They are similar to those of the reserves who have signed up for full-time service, but their terms and conditions differ slightly. I am trying to give as full a response as possible to show that the clause covers every possible circumstance; I hope that I am not creating more confusion.

<P>
The reason for a distinction between the types of volunteer reserve officer arises from the creation of a new category of reserve: those who enter employee agreements under part V of the Reserve Forces Act 1996. They are referred to as special members. The provisions in that Act enable civilians to work in support jobs which would require their services and operations. People taking those jobs agree as a term of employment that that particular post includes a liability for call out and training, and they become a special member of the reserve force. As I explained, because the call-out liability is related to the job, and they are not volunteer reservists in the ordinary sense, they are not subject to service law at all times as an ordinary reserve officer would be.

<P>
We are satisfied that regular soldiers and/or serving commissioned officers who are released from custody pending trial can be given a lawful order by the commanding officer to attend a future hearing. A subsequent failure to attend could result in such service personnel being charged with a service offence. However, individuals, who fall outside that specific, albeit large, category of personnel are not necessarily subject to a commanding officer's command and control at all times prior to the trial. Accordingly, in respect of the other individuals, it is necessary for the Bill to create an offence of non-attendance at a hearing after a person is released from pre-trial custody. Without a specific provision for those two categories of personnel, the Bill would be defective, in that such personnel could never be sanctioned for not attending a subsequent hearing.

<P>
I hope that I have given the Committee a sufficiently full explanation. I should be happy to give way if hon. Members wish to raise other points.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> That explains why the provision is in clause 5. I understand and accept that that is necessary in respect of section 205. However, if such a proposal is in a clause relating to release from proceedings and an offence is created if the person fails to show up when he or she is asked to do so, which is understandable, why does it not need to apply to those subject to arrest during proceedings under clause 6? It could lead to the odd situation of someone who is subject to court martial in military law under section 205 of the Army Act 1955 being in the peculiar position of not being liable to arrest during the proceedings, because clause 6 does not refer to section 205. It would be sensible to accept my amendment, so that clause 6 is consistent with clause 5, arrest during proceedings is on the same basis as release from custody, and there is the offence of not turning up when required.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moonie:</B> That is a fair point. I accept that the amendment is intended to be helpful and to close a procedural loophole, but we are aware of the problem and when I explain what is covered by clause 6, the hon. Gentleman will realise that the amendment is unnecessary.

<P>
As drafted, clause 6 inserts a new section into each of the discipline Acts, under which either the commanding officer or a judge advocate can order an arrest if he is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that the accused would otherwise fail to attend a hearing, commit an offence, injure himself, interfere with witnesses or obstruct the course of justice. The provisions are as follows: the new power of arrest is considered necessary because the powers currently contained in the services discipline Acts do not apply in these circumstances. It applies to two categories of persons who are charged with an offence or who are awaiting sentence for an offence, but who are not in custody. The first category comprises those who are subject to military law generally and the second, those who are subject to military law only by virtue of section 131 of the Army Act. Those persons have ceased to be subject to military law, except for the purpose of trying an offence that they allegedly committed while still subject to military law. The clause already covers those persons who fall within the paragraphs of section 205 that are listed in the amendment. Those people are either subject to military law because they have undertaken one of the activities described in section 205, or they are subject to military law only for the purpose of trying an offence, under section 131. Either way, they fall within the ambit of the provision and can be arrested during proceedings.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
It may help if I give an example. Under section 205(1)(h), a non-commissioned officer in the Territorial Army would be subject to military law if called into permanent service during a crisis, as some were during the Gulf conflict. If he was court-martialled for committing an offence, the power of arrest could bite in two ways. He would either be subject to the provisions because he was in permanent service because of the call-out, or, if his deployment had finished, he would be liable to arrest because he fell within the category of persons described by section 131.

<P>
I hope that I have fully explained the situation and that the hon. Gentleman will realise that his amendment is unnecessary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> If everyone who could be arrested during proceedings under clause 6 is covered by section 131, why does the same not apply under clause 5 to someone who is released once a trial has begun?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I think that clauses 5 and 6 apply at different points in the progression from offence to trial. Both clauses are needed to cover every eventuality in proceedings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Key </B>(Salisbury): Could the Minister explain whether section 205(1)(h) applies not only to overseas service but to home defence for Territorial Army officers?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I think that the section applies in both situations.

<P>
I will mention again that we are dealing with two categories. The first covers an individual who has left, for example, the regular Army, and who is later believed to have committed a service offence while in the Army. He can be arrested and held in custody pending trial, as if he were still a regular soldier. If he is released from custody before his trial, because the conditions on which custody was granted no longer exist, he will be released back into the civilian environment, and he will have no commanding officer. However, the judicial officer may require him to attend any future hearing, with the threat of a penal sanction for failure to attend.

<P>
The second category is less straightforward. In relation to the Army, we identified four types of personnel that are subject to military law at only certain times. They include officers of the TA who are special members and who are in permanent service. If such personnel commit a service offence while subject to military law, they can be arrested, charged and held in custody pending trial. If they are then released before trial, they might find themselves in an environment in which they are subject to military law, although only for a short finite period, or in a civilian environment. In both cases, we want to require those individuals to attend any future hearing. The penal sanction in the Bill fufils that requirement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for going through the details. On the basis of his reassurance that the Bill will not create a loophole in the law through which, in extraordinary circumstances, someone might jump, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Last Thursday--at a time when you were not in the Chair, Mr. Benton--there was a rush of conscience from Opposition Members about declaring interests. My young and hon. Friend the Member for Reigate said that I need not have any such conscience as I am over 50. However, I am now declaring that I was once an officer cadet with the Royal Air Force. I am immediately reminded of your own distinguished service in the Royal Air Force, Mr. Benton, and am relieved to recall the matters of conscience probably do not apply to you either as you have reached the wise age of 50.

<P>
I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would clarify a couple of matters relating to the clause. Clause 6 was amended in the other place so as to devolve responsibility or jurisdiction to other people in instances in which contacting an individual at short notice might be problematic. Baroness Symons, the Minister for Defence Procurement, explained:

<P>
As drafted, after finding out but before sentence, the courts martial may direct the commanding officer of the accused to give orders for the accused's arrest. However, if the court adjourns for any reason, it may disperse temporarily. Therefore, to avoid the obvious difficulties of recalling all three--or more--members solely to direct arrest if it seems necessary, the amendment vests the power of arrest with the commanding officer.
We accept that, and have no problems with it. Baroness Symons continued:

<P>
The second change arises from a potential difficulty which may arise ifthe judge advocate decides to direct the commanding officer to order the accused's arrest. In practice, it is unlikely that the accused's commanding officer would be present at the trial. It may be very difficult to contact him, especially if he is based overseas. Therefore, the amendments widen the provision to give the power of arrest to those who are already empowered under these Acts to arrest someone for committing an offence.
Again, we have no difficulty with that flexible and sensible argument.

<P>
Baroness Symons concluded:

<P>
Finally, the amendments have been made to ensure that any direction for the arrest of the accused will remain valid, even though the court has subsequently had to be dissolved for whatever reason.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 342.]
Why is the accused still kept under arrest if a court martial has been dissolved? I am sure that there is a straightforward explanation which, however, eludes me.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman referring to circumstances in which a court martial has been dissolved and is no longer proceeding?

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Yes, and also to circumstances in which it has adjourned. I have no problem with the latter scenario. However, I believe that Baroness Symons was referring to circumstances in which a court martial has been dissolved, wound up or concluded.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That would apply only if another offence were to be taken into account.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Surely, the offences would be heard at the same time? An accused would not be tried for one offence with another hanging over him.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should finish before I respond.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> All right, I shall carry on.

<P>
Clause 6 is another example of what might go wrong if the system becomes too complicated. In the other place, there was a great deal of discussion about rough justice which, as we all know, sometimes happens. As the Under-Secretary explained, the clause is designed to cover the accused if he fails to attend a hearing or injures himself.

<P>
In the other place, Lord Bramall spoke about NCOs taking matters into their own hands if disciplinary problems arose in cases in which the Bill's burdensome procedures affected morale. He said:

<P>
Try transposing all that to the remotest theatre of operations where judicial officers are in short supply, if they exist at all, and where commanding officers and adjutants have as their first priority operational matters; then try to assess the extra time-consuming administrative burden that will be thrust upon the unit, to say nothing of the slowing up of justice, which is not necessarily in the interest of the accused, let alone in the interest of the regimental unit. Consider the general uncertainty about discipline that will prevail and, above all, the undermining of the commanding officer's standing and authority at a time when his leadership and the confidence that he engenders are all important to the unit's professional performance ...

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>What a licence that would give to what I may describe as the barrack-room lawyers and to the unofficial punishments behind the gym which we have done so much over the years to stamp out--[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; vol. 607, c. 677.]
No one in the Committee will be unaware of the issue to which Lord Bramall referred when he spoke about unofficial punishments.

<P>
My noble Friend Lord Attlee, who is himself a Territorial Army officer, and who served in Bosnia, said in that debate:

<P>
The worry is this: if NCOs find out that their commanding officer or officer commanding cannot effectively operate a disciplinary system, they will inevitably resort to illegal alternatives. There will not be the court martial option for them.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 694.]
I should be grateful if the Minister would elaborate on what assessment the Ministry of Defence has made of the likelihood of that happening. I too fear that in cases where a service man is accused of an offence but is seen to be using the system to delay or thwart his punishment, NCOs, or even his comrades, depending on the circumstances, may be tempted to take matters into their own hands and administer a punishment of their own. No doubt the Minister will say that such actions would be illegal, as of course they would be; but we live in the real world and in the pressure cooker environment of active service, perhaps even under fire, a beating for an insubordinate might have to suffice where once there would have been a properly administered summary punishment from the CO. The implications for morale are clearly grave.

<P>
The Minister is aware that formal proceedings tend to be the last resort in a unit. The tender guiding hand of the senior and junior NCOs will most likely have been applied before any formal proceedings are used--often because the unit has not managed to correct behaviour by informal means. The officer will often ask the NCO to sort out a problem and will not inquire in too much detail about how that has been achieved. I expect that my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate could give the Committee endless examples of that sort of thing. An Army unit does not operate structures in the same way as civil institutions. Often it is thought better to have a misdemeanour rectified informally than to damage a soldier's record. That is an important point: soldiers would rather not have it on record. I realise that the Ministry of Defence had difficulty getting right the balance between the implications of introducing the Human Rights Act 1998 into military law and not disturbing the sometimes centuries-old traditions of discipline and self-discipline that are faced daily. If we complicate and reduce the effect of the current system with over-regulation, we risk more aggressive measures being taken in an informal environment. I am hoping for the Minister's assurance that he is confident that that is unlikely to occur and that the Ministry of Defence has got the balance right. After all, the other place had second thoughts about amending the clause.

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I shall cover the two main points as fully as possible. The hon. Gentleman asked about dissolution of a court martial. A court martial is an ad hoc court which has a specified number of members who are specially appointed to deal with a trial. If a member dies, the court martial must be dissolved and reconvened with new members. If that happens, all orders and directions made by the court martial will also be dissolved. We do not want that to happen where a court martial has ordered that a person be arrested during proceedings that are later dissolved, so there is an extra provision to cover those circumstances.

<P>
On the point about discipline, I do not believe that the culture of unofficial punishment is as developed as the hon. Gentleman suggests, especially regarding the violent cases that he described. Acting in that way would be not only improper, but highly detrimental to discipline. Taking the law into one's own hands is never a good idea. One of the main reasons for making the Bill as watertight as possible is that a secure legal framework provides the best assurance against the return of outmoded practices.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
The current service chiefs do not belive that those problems will happen. Furthermore, the Bill will not be unduly cumbersome. Additional resources will be invested, where necessary, to cover additional burdens. Obviously, only time will tell how many cases will arise. As to the point about barrack room lawyers, the present circumstances offer them just as much temptation, if not greater, than in future under the Bill. A secure legal framework is, as I said, far better than an insecure one that has to be tried and tested in a European court. Our aim is to escape from that by regularising the process.

<P>
Overall, individual discipline and unit morale in the armed forces is high enough for the cases mentioned by the hon. Gentleman not to occur. There have been some problems in the past--isolated cases of racism, for example, which have been widely reported, as the hon. Gentleman well knows. That sort of problem is taken seriously by all the armed forces. We believe that we have largely managed to stamp it out and we shall continue to bear down heavily on any individuals within the armed forces who try to take matters into their own hands.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> These are important amendments. Let us be clear that the armed forces do not want the Bill; it is being imposed on them. They have been sold the idea that it is necessary in order to keep the military justice system compliant with the European convention on human rights. That is the real reason: it has nothing to do with improving the administration of justice as seen by the chiefs of staff. It is the product of our misfortune in lacking the ability to reserve our judgment on the European convention. We will have to address that crucial issue later because of the damage that will be done by the Bill--and perhaps future Bills, as we seek to wrestle with the essential problem of trying to make the armed forces discipline system compliant with something with which it is not compliant. A system of justice cannot be administered independently when commanding officers are required to exercise a substantial element of discipline through summary discipline procedures.

<P>
It adds insult to injury to impose the Bill on the armed forces at a cost--in accordance with various Government estimates--of £6.5 million to £9 million and £2 million of start-up costs, and then to tell them that they will be invited to pay those costs. We are talking about substantial sums of money, a salary bill of about a battalion of infantry. The sum of £9 million is no flea bite. At our previous sitting, the Minister told us that the Ministry of Defence has a large budget and can shop around to find £9 million from somewhere else. He misunderstands the situation. I hope that the debate will make him examine the pressure that the MOD is under and to consider some of the issues that will cross his desk and those of his colleagues in the immediate future about the long-term properties and the negotiations on the comprehensive spending review.

<P>
In 1994_95 we undertook an exercise called ``Front Line First'' where we examined the whole Ministry of Defence, turning it upside down to find every conceivable saving in the support area. Over 30 studies were carried out and we found a substantial amount of savings but some of them turned out not to be satisfactory ways of saving money. There were bound to be mistakes in an exercise of that scale. It produced a substantial sum of money but it added to the pressure that has been put on the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces since the introduction of annual efficiency savings targets in 1988. The Department now bears a huge level of efficiency savings.

<P>
To claim that the MOD is £6 billion a year more efficient than it was in 1988 is not credible. The MOD has taken cuts to its output through its efficiency savings programme. They have been disguised as efficiency savings and that is the essential problem. One must congratulate the Chancellor of The Exchequer for his wisdom in negotiating with the Secretary of State for Defence who, by all accounts, was totally unprepared. The Chancellor agreed to give him the SDR and not to complain about all the details that are in it, as the Treasury usually does by picking up the fine print, and trying to unbundle any proposals from the MOD, but he ramped up the efficiency savings targets from 2 per cent. to 3 per cent.

<P>
In public terms that is fairly innocuous, but it is really painful for the Department, the armed forces and the budget holder areas right down to the lowest level. It adds up to hundreds of millions of pounds a year by the fourth year of the efficiency savings programme--about £500 million in total--and increases an already unsupportable burden. The Minister tells us that it is a big Department and that it can find another £9 million. It is already finding £2 billion, yet the Government have been unable to explain to the Defence Committee or the House what those efficiency savings are. They cannot give us a comprehensive list of the 1,300 measures that they have taken to save money in this financial year. They cannot because most are not efficiency savings at all, but cuts. This annual burden of an extra £9 million to the defence budget will mean more cuts and for a Bill that the armed forces do not want.

<P>
This amendment gives the Committee an opportunity to say that it is not appropriate for the MOD and each of the three armed forces to take up this burden. It is being imposed on them because of our commitment to the European convention on human rights. The Government have decided to produce a Bill, the last two thirds of which is unnecessary given the judgments, but that is how they are choosing to present it.

<P>
The first part of the Bill, which relates to custody, is directly driven by judgments in the European Court of Human Rights. It is the Government's choice to subject this country's armed forces to the European convention on human rights; it is for us to leave the treaty and renegotiate a reservation in respect of our armed forces, as seven of our NATO allies have done. Parliament is imposing a widened system of discipline on our armed forces--

<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): Can the hon. Gentleman tell us how many countries have abrogated the treaty? How many have left it so far?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> It is not a matter of abrogating the treaty, but of negotiating a reservation. No one suggests that our country should not be subject to the European convention, of which we were one of the architests. The convention was drafted to ensure that people living in countries that were unfortunate enough to have some form of socialism--either authoritarian socialism or national socialism--imposed on them, would have resort to a court of human rights. The liberal democracies, with Great Britain at the fore, brought the convention into being. The hon. Gentleman must understand that in 1951, as Lord Peyton made clear in another place, no one expected the armed forces to be subject to the convention as it is now because of court judgments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I take it that the hon. Gentleman is confirming that no country, having adopted the provisions of the convention, has then left it. The reservation that the hon. Gentleman mentioned was adopted when countries joined the convention; it is not a question of abrogating it or leaving it. No other country has done that. What the hon. Gentleman proposes is a unique model.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right, it would be a unique course of action to abrogate the convention. However, he must remember that the only other serious military player in the European Union is France. The Germans do not have a system of military justice, they run their armed forces through the civil justice system; that is one reason why the German armed forces are, frankly, not up to scratch with those of France and the United Kingdom. We should give our armed forces a system of justice that allows them to be deployed around the world and to go into action with the backing of a robust military system of discipline that works in all circumstances. When France, the other serious military power in Europe, signed up to the convention it wisely obtained a reservation for its armed forces. We did not do so because we signed up in 1951, and did not envisage the present situation.

<P>
The position now is that the Government wish to impose the convention on the armed forces as and when judgments are made; there was the 1996 Bill and now there is this one, and the real issue is who should pay for it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Does my hon. Friend agree that, although we signed the convention in 1951, it would be unreasonable, and, indeed, folly, for a Goverment to say that they will always abide by the decisions of that convention, no matter how they affect the availability and serviceability of our armed forces? Amendments may be tabled in future that are incompatible with the availability of our armed forces, and we may wish to seek derogations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend is right. That is the problem with the process that generated the Bill; progressively--step by step and case by case--the ability of our armed forces to administer their own discipline, which they see as their vital ground, is being undermined. Armed forces legislation is an edifice to protect that vital ground, but, bit by bit, it is dismantled by judgments in the European Court of Human rights. The problem is that the lawyers in the European court are not interpreting cases as we anticipated that they would when we joined the convention in 1951.

<P>
Who will pay for the great armada of lawyers? Why will 35 extra lawyers be imposed on the Army, which is understaffed, when it could have 35 doctors, for example? More to the point, what about the expenditure? It is not just a matter of appointing 35 lawyers but that 35 doctors will be replaced by 35 laywers. That adds insult to injury in the armed forces; they do not want the Bill.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
The Minister will tell us that the Chief of the Defence Staff has given him a form of words with which he wants the discipline system to be compliant. It is based on legal advice from the armed forces department that benefits significantly from the proposed changes: the judge advocate general's and the chief naval judge advocate's department. It is their empire that will be increased, and the Bill is based on their advice.

<P>
My amendment would make the Lord Chancellor responsible for the appointment of judicial officers and, most importantly, he would provide the funds for their maintenance. As the Bill is an imposition by the Government and the lawyers on the armed forces, it should be for the Lord Chancellor's Department to provide the funds for the Ministry of Defence to make the measure work. In the estimates each year, based on the strategic defence and comprehensive spending reviews, the Government and Parliament make a judgment about the amount of money required to support the armed forces. Now we are told that there will be £9 million less, and the costs will have to be borne by the Ministry of Defence. If the amendment were accepted, the costs incurred by the judicial officers would fall to the Lord Chancellor; the funds would therefore flow from his budget, not from that of the Ministry of Defence.

<P>
It is only fair that the Lord Chancellor should pay. During the passage of the 1998 Bill, which brought the European convention into United Kingdom law--that is driving the necessity to have the Bill on the statute book by 2 October--when it was put to him that the measure was designed to be flexible, the Lord Chancellor told the House of Lords that it would not affect the armed forces. That is why we are here. The Lord Chancellor misled the House of Lords in his statement and in replying to questions about the armed forces.

<P>
There will be extra costs amounting to the salary of an infantry battalion or 35 to 50 doctors and supporting costs in return for 35 lawyers, which the armed forces need like a hole in the head.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am currently deciding whether to make a speech on the subject. Can my hon. Friend recall any other Government Bill that involves expenditure of Government money but does not make specific financial provision for it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> No, I cannot, but that may be because I am much less experienced in the House than my hon. Friend. Some members of the Committee--the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), for example, who sits on the Defence Committee--know the financial position of the armed forces. This is an opportunity for Government members of this Committee to stand up and defend the financial position of the armed forces by supporting the amendment and making the Lord Chancellor bear the costs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I anticipate a lively debate when we consider the Minister's extraordinary amendment to clause 28. This is merely a dress rehearsal for that debate. I warmly support my hon. Friend's amendment No. 110, which is one of the most important amendments to the Bill, and I will speak to my amendments Nos. 112 and 113.

<P>
This discussion should be about joined-up government. In the past fortnight, we have heard much in the media about the Ministry of Defence having slumped down the pecking order of Cabinet priority so that when it comes to the crunch of discussing the Ministry's budget with the Iron Chancellor, it does not have a prayer. We deplore that. With my party, defence was always one of the top three or four posts. We believe that the Government should continue that policy.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Is that why the Conservative Government cut the budgets so savagely?

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's intervention. He taunts me because of the cuts in the defence budget. I think that I should answer that at some length.

<P>
The Conservative Government, with the full support of the Labour Opposition and in almost exactly parallel volume to almost every NATO ally, reacted to the end of the cold war by reducing the size and scale of our armed forces. Not only did the Labour party welcome that, it suggested that we cut the defence budget even further. It has been something of a mystery to me for the past three years that whenever the question of budgets has arisen, the Government have objected to criticism of their cuts on the ground that my party cut the budget. If they objected, why did they go on cutting and taking almost £1 billion a year from the defence budget?

<P>
Last week I was astonished when the Minister said in Committee that, because the Ministry of Defence had such a large budget, it would not really notice the £9 million. I assure the Minister that everyone at the Ministry of Defence sees problems with the squeezing of its budget. I find this everywhere I go. Only last Saturday, I was at a conference of RAF wives at the Royal British Legion training college in Tidworth. The chief executive of the defence housing executive explained how difficult it had been to cope with the mid-year cut in the upgrade programme for married quarters. When asked whether the cut would be restored in the financial year, he was unable to answer: he did not know. What does a little cut in the married quarters upgrade programme matter? It matters becuase the Government's strategic defence review, in supporting essay 9, contained an important section relating to their policy for people. It said that the Government recognised that the effectiveness of the armed forces depended on having policies for people, which included forces families, therefore that housing was an extremely important part of the Ministry of Defence's overall strategy and vision. So, they cut the mid-year upgrade programme. They also cut little things such as curtains and carpets which reduced the budget by £2 million. This had an extraordinary impact on morale among service families. We are talking about £9 million in the first year, which I bet is an underestimate. In every service there are similar examples of an inability to implement the provisions of the strategic defence review and the administrative changes to units and locations because the budget is being cut. What about joined-up government?

<P>
It is clear that the Lord Chancellor's Department has plenty of scope. Pleasant though it is to have with us the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), this is the third day on which she has sat in Committee and not uttered a word. There is clearly some scope for saving money in the Lord Chancellor's Department if there is so much slack in its resources. We look forward to hearing the hon. Lady's contribution later--I hope.

<P>
The amendment provides that judicial officers be appointed by the Lord Chancellor, not by judge advocates, who are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. Logically, it follows that judicial officers should be appointed in a similar way in order to ensure that their appointment is ECHR compliant. The Committee knows that the Bill will increase costs to the MOD vote. Overstretch is another key issue, which causes chronic retention problems, and the Army remains 6,000 men under strength. The director of Army personnel told us that at current rates of recruitment, it will take 31 years to reach its post-SDR strength.

<P>
In paragraph 61 of the explanatory notes, the Ministry of Defence candidly acknowledges that there will be

<P>
additional costs arising from the establishment of the summary appeals courts and other  arrangements. The majority of these costs will arise from the need for additional laywers, investigators and other staff to administer the new procedures  the estimated cost of implementing the changes included in the Bill will be of the order of £6,500,000 per annum
with additional start-up costs in 2000-01 of about £1.75 million, to provide for

<P>
the computer system  accommodation and office equipment and activity associated with the recruitment of additional personnel.
We think that that it is a fudge of a figure, to say the least. In another place, we said that costs arising from the Bill are more likely to total approximately £9 million--and we stand by that reckoning. As my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate said, that amounts to the salary of a battalion of infantry.
 
<P>
The noble Baroness Symons admitted on Second Reading in the other place that the costs would

<P>
absorb an appreciable part of the Armed Forces' legal aid scheme.
She continued by arguing that the costs would be

<P>
absorbed across a wide range of budgetary areas, each of which will manage their costs in terms of their overall priorities.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 698.]
That clearly implies that costs associated with additional personnel will lead to other defence expenditure being proportionately cut back or axed. Front-line forces may suffer as a result of the Government's determination to implement their politically correct agenda.

<P>
In Committee in the other place, when the noble Baroness was questioned about further costs she said:

<P>
Ministers in the Ministry of Defence are always grateful for any assistance, from whatever quarter it arises, in identifying others who might be willing to bear the costs of our activities. Any thought on that point will, of course, be studied with great verve on our part.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 347.]
I bet it will, and we are delighted to assist the Government, especially when the beneficiary will be Her Majesty's armed forces. That was an unusual appeal for help; and we are happy to oblige. It provides us with a useful and timely opportunity to highlight MOD Ministers' political weakness and lack of clout in the Cabinet in the face of the combined onslaught of the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary. Yet again we hear the usual round of stories about the Secretary of State for Defence going cap in hand to the Treasury. Last week we saw the fiasco over Mozambique and the spat between different Government Departments about how to deal with it.

<P>
We are not alone in wishing the Lord Chancellor's Department to put its hand in its pocket. Paragraph 26 of the Defence Select Committee report states:

<P>
However, it is undoubtedly the case that in a time of overstretch and over-commitment it is a burden the Armed Forces could do without.
Every pound counts; every million counts. I hope that the Minister, along with the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that those substantial costs should be turned over to a Department that is much better able to absorb them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> My hon. Friend mentions paragraph 26 of a report that was unanimously agreed by the Defence Committee. Would it not be rather odd, therefore, for members of this Committee who signed that report to reject the amendments? That would fly in the face of their decision that the matter is a burden that the armed forces could do without and which should be handled by the Lord Chancellor's Department.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. I look forward to hearing the hon. Members for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) and for Crawley speak on the matter. We shall press the amendment to a Division and I shall examine carefully how they vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> My hon. Friend has left out the hon. Member for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn).

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I had not got to the hon. Member for Jarrow, who is in his usual place, working assiduously on the Bill. I look forward to his contribution, whether he defends the Government or the Defence Committee. Like the other hon. Members I mentioned, he cannot have it both ways.

<P>
The matter is a test. Someone who signs up to a Select Committee report saying one thing cannot, within a couple of weeks, vote for the opposite thing in Standing Committee. Someone who does so will have some explaining to do to the House, the armed forces and his or her constituents.

<P>
The amendment is a touchstone. It is not acceptable that the defence budget should be subjected to more cheese paring and salami slicing to pay for an unnecessary measure that is being forced on the military. We are living in a time of joined up government. However, if the Government believe that it is expedient to change the law, it should pay for that and not penalise Her Majesty's forces.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I had not decided whether to speak on the amendments before coming to Committee. However, I am prompted to do so by my hon. Friends' arguments, which contain an important kernel.

<P>
The 1951 convention was not designed as a measure allowing Governments to cut departmental budgets. Compliance with the convention will be impossible unless the Government ring fence specific funds and my hon. Friend said that that might cost the Ministry of Defence up to £9 million. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that? Unless the Government find extra funding, the Bill will be a cost-cutting measure affecting the defence budget.

<P>
It is extraordinary that the Government should cut a departmental budget to comply with the convention. I have sat on numerous Committees considering criminal justice Bills and crime and disorder Bills, but I never witnessed the Home Office budget or the Lord Chancellor's Department budget being cut. Extra funds are always allocated for the Bill to be implemented.

<P>
That is true of the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill, which is being debated on the Floor of the House today. I do not know whether that measure will reduce or increase the budgets of the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Home Office. However, if their budgets are increased, I bet that the Parliamentary Secretary, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) will ask her Treasury colleagues for an increase in her budget and that that will be granted.

<P>
It is intolerable that the defence budget is being cut to meet the provisions of the European convention on human rights. I hope that the Minister will say more about that today and give us accurate information on precisely how many personnel will need to be employed, based on the latest estimate of the number of cases likely to occur under the Bill. My guess is that, as a result the Bill, the number of summary cases will reduce, but the number of court martial cases will increase because everyone will use the Bill to advance his or her case to the maximum. I bet that many more of those who opt for summary justice will use the appeal procedure. All in all, the costs of the Bill will be greater than the Government have estimated in the explantory notes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> My hon. Friend is referring to the summary appeal courts procedure, with which we have yet to deal. What is of particular concern is that the cost of judicial officers taking custodial decisions will be much less predictable than if summary appeal courts took them because all their overheads will be established. I do not know whether the Government's prediction of the number of appeals is right, but the clause will require people to turn up from all over the place to act as judicial officers and they must somehow be put in contact with those who take custodial decisions. The money that will be spent on lawyers is wholly unpredictable. Therefore, the Lord Chancellor's Department should bear such costs, rather than the Ministry of Defence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wholly agree with my hon. Friend. The principal is totally wrong. I have been involved with the Public Accounts Committee and know about the appropriation of public money. It is totally wrong that one departmental budget should, in effect, subsidise another. Perhaps the Minister will provide examples, but I know of no other justice system that has to be paid for from such a departmental budget. It is like telling the police that a new police and criminal evidence Act will involve extra expenditure, but the Government will provide them with no additional money and individual police forces will have to provide it from their existing budgets. I could tell the Minister what the ratepayers of Gloucestershire and other areas would say if that were the case. The parallel in the clause is exactly the same. If the Government do not make public money available under the excellent amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate to appoint the judge advocate and pay all his expenses and those of the appeals procedure, they will, in effect, cut the departmental budget.

<P>
The Minister should provide some answers. Perhaps he will tell us whether parallel provisions apply elsewhere. Perhaps he will tell us precisely how much he thinks that the Bill will cost; how many judge advocates will be needed; and how many appeal, summary and court martial cases will be brought? If we had that information, we should be able to tell more accurately whether to accept the clause. I do not know what my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury thinks, but we will certainly vote for the amendments, or against the clause if it is not amended. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reponse.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moonie:</B> I had thought that these amendments had a profound intellectual basis, in that the hon. Member for Reigate had serious reason to think that the Lord Chancellor, rather than the judge advocate general, would be the appropriate person to take charge of such proceedings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Knowing the Minister's intellectual acuity, if he is able to adduce such an argument, I shall be delighted to entertain it and welcome his support for the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Alas, the hon. Gentleman disappointed me because he did not advance such an argument. The preparation of my response has been predicated on the fact that I thought that that would be the case. However, all he wants is for the Lord Chancellor to pick up the bill. I am sorry, but in the armed forces, we pick up our own bills, and this is our bill. It is confusing to use the term ``bill'' to refer not only to the Bill, but to the costs of the study. I will try to remember to use different terms.

<P>
I do not know what planet the Opposition have been living on for the past 20 years. When Conservative Members were in government, they frequently insisted on the implementation of local government legislation that changed statutory duties, and they did not provide a single penny extra to cover that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> When I was the Minister responsible for local government finance, we changed the local taxation system and introduced the council tax to replace the community charge. For several years, the Treasury provided a series of special grants--from outside what was then the Department of the Environment's budget.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman admits his responsibility for so many of the iniquities that I have described. If I were him, I do not think that I would bring up the poll tax, although his views on it were probably similar to my own.

<P>
We have already discussed the costs in detail. I do not propose to do that again, but I will summarise by saying that the annual figure for costs is £6.5 million, not £9 million--[
Interruption.]. It is a lot of money.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I hope that the Minister accepts that that figure must be an estimate, because he does not know how much the judicial officers will be paid, and lawyers always end up being more expensive than anticipated. Inevitably, the figure must be an estimate. The Minister cannot say that the figure will be £6.5 million or £9 million--it is wet finger in the air time.

<P>
The Minister rightly chided me for not introducing the intellectual case for the Lord Chancellor. It would be better to refer to the Lord Chancellor instead of the judge advocate general. The judge advocate general belongs to the Ministry of Defence, and is therefore part of the chain of command. If the judicial officers were appointed by the Lord Chancellor, that would be another step towards independence and would make the Bill a little more fireproof against judgments by the European Court of Human Rights, even though the Lord Chancellor owes his duties to the sovereign, who is part of the chain of command, even if the Minister recognises that only in a technical sense.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Only for the purposes of what we discussed.

<P>
I am prepared to accept that it was a mere oversight that the hon. Gentleman did not mention that point in the flush of his rhetoric. Now that he has, I can reply to it. The annual figure is £6.5 million, but we do not want to pay anything extra out of the budget, let alone £6.5 million. We know that we have problems in meeting all our commitments, which is why we must work so hard in that regard. However, that does not mean that we will not meet our commitments. All it means is that we must scratch around more to find the £6.5 million. There are ample examples of situations in which we have managed to save money. Admittedly, some money has been raised thorugh the sale of surplus real estate and property, but that is a solid tradition that we see no reason not to continue. We require less property and land than in the past, and I am quite happy that we should make as much money as we can from sales. That is my responsibility and I am happy to devote a fair amount of time to it, to contribute to the Ministry's coffers.

<P>
The sale of married accommodation that was carried out under the previous Government raised £2 billion, but only the princely sum of £100 million was left to the Ministry. That will not even cover the proposed increase in rents, because the previous Government forgot that rents could go up in the quinquennial review. It is difficult enough to cope with the pressures of day-to-day changes in requirements for our armed forces without also having to cope with the legacy of a most unfortunate deal that was carried out five years ago, but whose true cost we are only now realising.

<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The Minister says that the money can be raised by selling property. He knows that he has to find £700 million of property sales under the terms of the SDR before he can find any extra money to start contributing to the £6.5 million a year that he says this will cost, plus the £250 million that they will not get for the sale of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. He properly chides the last Government about the sale of the married quarters. He might just remember that it was not the MOD's idea to sell the married quarters; it was driven by the Treasury, not least by the First Lord of the Treasury, after he ceased to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. This is an opportunity for the Minister and the Committee to put a small part of the burden imposed on the MOD by central Government back where it belongs--on the centre and not on the departmental budget.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I cannot accept that. We have accepted responsibility for our own budget. The money resolution authorises us to make expenditure. It does not, unfortunately, provide the extra money but we can manage it within our own resources and we shall do so.

<P>
The point about the Lord Chancellor is fair. I do not happen to agree but it would on the surface appear to make the process even more independent of the chain of command than it is at present. I hope that I will be able to satisfy the hon. Gentleman that we have taken account of his concerns and that such a change is unnecessary. The amendments concern the responsibility for the appointment of the judicial officer who will determine the need for custody prior to trial. They would transfer the responsibility for these appointments from the judge advocate general and the chief naval judge advocate to the Lord Chancellor. Those officers are responsible for appointing judge advocates to courts martial and, under the proposals in the Bill, to the summary appeal court. There seems little logical reason for them not also to appoint judicial officers to deal with rather less formal custody hearings.

<P>
As an aside, I might mention that the judge advocate general is independent of the MOD. It has been consistent legal advice that, having the responsibility for making these appointments where it is, does not pose problems in terms of independence in relation to the European convention on human rights or in any other sense. As I have said, the judge advocate general is not constituted as part of the Ministry of Defence. Although the chief naval judge advocate is a naval officer, as are the naval barristers whom he may appoint to preside at courts martial or act as judicial officers, arrangements are in place to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest.

<P>
There are extensive safeguards to ensure the independence of naval judge advocates that are designed to ensure that there are no prejudicial connections between the judge advocate appointed to preside at a trial and the other naval authorities involved in that trial. The costs arising from the appointment of judicial officers will fall to the Ministry of Defence like the other costs in the Bill. There will not be a corps of full-time judicial officers dealing with custody hearings because we do not expect there to be much more than 250 or so custody hearings each year. It is important to keep this in proportion. The overall costs in the Bill, as the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, arise from the need for additional staff at the MOD.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I was astonished to hear the Minister's figure of 250 custody hearings a year. We are talking about custody hearings every eight days for someone remanded on a serious charge. My regiment would have accounted for a significant percentage of those hearings and that was just one soldier. If someone is remanded, a judicial officer must be produced every eight days to make the decision. I urge the Minister to go back to his officials to check that the figure of 250 is right. On each occasion one must pay an hourly rate for a judicial officer. Lawyers are not cheap, as we know, and so it will be a substantial sum. He may have to be contacted via the video system that we will debate on the following clause. We shall discover that a video link would be expensive and that, if someone was detained overseas, getting a judicial officer to a theatre would incur huge expense, as would renting a lawyer in the United Kingdom to make his case. From my experience of all those things I must say that the figure of 250 sounds astonishingly low.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The Army is not such a lawless bunch as the hon. Gentleman thinks. These are estimates that the Army has given us; we have not imposed them. I am happy to accept them. All forecast expenditure is an estimate. We discuss the defence estimates every year. Of course there may be differences in future between the outturn spending and what we anticipate it will be. We can only make the best possible guess. The Army gave us these estimates, which are probably just about accurate.

<P>
There is little else that I can say. We have discussed this issue at length on other occasions. The costs are such that we can absorb them. We do not enjoy doing that, but we shall do it. In addition to property sales and so on there have been considerable efficiency savings so far through the introduction of smart procurement which, in turn, will bring great dividends in driving down costs in future years and increasing the speed at which new equipment is brought into service. Although most equipment comes in on time, and works well, the obvious examples of where it does not are a great disappointment to us. We hope that they will not happen in future. We are driving down costs across a wide area of services as well as improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the forces. This enables us to meet the commitments under the SDR that we have decided are necessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> We have had a good debate. Although the most astonishing figure has been kept until last. It could impose a considerable cost burden on the Ministry of Defence. I urge the Minister and other hon. Members to consider that, particularly the three members of the Defence Select Committee, who have agreed that this is a burden that the armed forces could well do without. The hon. Member for Ilford, South took part in the Select Committee's evidence-taking session and in its proceedings on 15 February when we read the proposed Chairman's draft. Unusually, the hon. Member for Crawley, who has a very good attendance record for the Defence Select Committee, was not at those two sittings. The hon. Member for Jarrow was present at the sitting at which we deliberated on the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Given his service experience, does my hon. Friend think that if the Ministry of Defence has to bear these costs it may decide, purely on budgetary grounds, not to take a case to court-martial, choosing instead to deal with it at a later date when considering an officer for promotion and decide not to promote him?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I would hope that the scenario that my hon. Friend paints would be extremely unlikely. It would, of course, imply a collapse of the proper operation of the military discipline system. It is conceivable that it could happen, but I hope that it would not, on account of the costs that the proposed financial sytem will impose.

<P>
My former colleagues on the Defence Select Committee, with expertise borne of having seen these events at first hand and having had the opportunity to scrutinise them for Parliament, know the difficulties that the Ministry of Defence faces. I will demonstrate why the Government's case is flawed. My understanding was that there are 250 custody cases a year. Was that the figure?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I suspect that the figures that Brigadier Ritchie presented to the Select Committee referred to 250 cases, not hearings. Two hundred and fifty cases might involve more than 250 hearings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> It is terribly important that we know what the estimate is; the Minister referred to 250 hearings.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I have made a correction. I think that it is slightly improper to refer to the previous figure, when I have openly made a correction.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Of course I accept that. However, I am slightly suspicious that the advice received by the Minister does not reflect the actual number of hearings, because one case implies several hearings. We need to know the number of custody hearings, which is likely to be substantial, because that will drive the cost. One case could generate more than 40 custody hearings a year if somebody was remanded for that long. If the offence was very serious, such as murder or rape, it is likely that it would take up to a year for both the prosecution and the defence to prepare to come to trial. I have had experience of a case in which it took two years for someone on a rape charge to be brought to trial.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Disgraceful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Well, I think that my hon. Friend should know the circumstances of the trial, otherwise I might think that he was impugning by contribution as well. There are circumstances in which it can take that long to reach trial; perhaps to let the defence prepare a proper case. The fact that trials are delayed can be related to problems with the administration of legla aid, which has been mentioned, because there is a trigger for the availability of legal aid.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Of course I am not impugning by hon. Friend. He highlighted the problem, which I mentioned, of the process under military law whereby the prosecution can have up to nearly two years to prepare its case. If a charge is not brought until about 18 months after the initiation of the process, the process becomes hugely unfair.

<P>
My hon. Friend also underlined the problem with the Ministry of Defence. In answer to my parliamentary question, the Ministry had to admit that it did not keep statistics on a wide range of court martials and their circumstances. Staff simply said that they had never needed to do so in the past, but they would tighten up now. Therefore the estimate about which my hon. Friend is concerned does not actually carry a great deal of credibility. It is a fairly good guesstimate, but that is about as far as one could go.

<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. We have been told that 250 cases might require the exercise of a judicial officer's functions. I am worried that 250 cases might be an underestimate, but even if it is not, those 250 cases of people remanded back in custody would each lead to 40 hearings a year. Every eight days, each case would require a hearing in order to remand the person in custody, and we are concerned that that implies 10,000 hearings for custody in the armed forces.

<P>
We used to have a system whereby the person under investigation was marched out of the guardroom and into the commanding officer's room on orders and remanded in custody again, if the commanding officer took that decision. However, we are now imposing a system of judicial officers. Offenders are likely to be held under arrest in their own guardroom, so there will usually be the cost of sending the judicial officer there. If 250 people are remanded in custody a year, that would mean 10,000 hearings--I think that those figures are likely to be reasonably valid. That is a substantial number of hearings. Each town might require a lawyer to come for a day for each case. I do not know exactly what lawyers' rates are, but one might be getting away lightly if one paid £100 an hour. It could cost £500 a day to hire a lawyer to investigate the cases. The Department estimates having to pay £5 million for judicial officers for custody hearings alone.

<P>
The amendment would allow us to remove that element of risk from the Defence budget: it should not have to bear all the costs, which may well have been seriously underestimated by the Department. The cost overrun on the estimates would then be borne by the appropriate Department--the Lord Chancellor's Department. If the administration of justice under the convention requires judicial officers, we should pass the amendment and protect the armed forces.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> My hon. Friend started by saying that we had had a good debate, but we have not, because we have not yet heard from the hon. Members for Ilford, South, for Jarrow or for Crawley. Having voted in the Defence Select Committee on the report, how can those hon. Members fail to speak in the debate and vote as they will? Or am I being cruel and prejudging the issue?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> My hon. Friend is right. When I said that we had had a good debate, I was thinking about the members of the Committee who take an interest in the Bill--in other words, Opposition Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury will recall that, on Second Reading, only one Government Back Bencher--the Chairman of the Select Committee--could be brought to support the Government's case. That is an absolute disgrace.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> My hon. Friend has mentioned Opposition Members, but he should also note the absence of the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch), the Liberal Democrat spokesman, for the second consecutive sitting. He cannot be bothered to turn up for two sittings running--and we have only had three.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The level of interest of Government Members in the Bill's principles and details is a disgrace. The level of interest expressed in Committee by the Liberal Democrats is also woeful. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury was right to correct me when I said that we had had a good debate. I meant the debate that we have come to expect from those who are interested in discussing the Bill--Conservative Members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend not think that we should hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree? It is, after all, her Department that denies responsibility for paying the costs of the amendment. Should we not hear the case from her?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Yes, I thought that the case for the defence would come from the Lord Chancellor's Department. I saw the hon. Lady sitting on the Government Front Bench and thought that it would be appropriate for her to open her innings and make her case, but she relied on her hon. Friend the Minister to argue for her.

<P>
The three Labour members of the Select Committee know their duty to the armed forces, which they oversee on behalf of the House of Commons. The amendments would provide an opportunity to give judicial officers of Parliament more proof against further judgments about their independence in relation to the European convention.

<P>
In his reply, the Minister said that the safeguards were sufficient, particularly regarding the naval judge advocate general. However, we thought that we had safeguards in place regarding the powers of air officers, admirals and officers of flag rank before the Findlay case. We thought then that the system would be proof against the European convention, but that turned out to be wrong. The amendment would provide further proof of the independence of action of judge advocates general in the appointment of judicial officers. The most important aspect involves relieving the Ministry of the cost burden of judicial officers, which it has underestimated badly. If the amendments are rejected, the Ministry will be in for a serious financial fall which will affect the armed forces' fighting ability. I shall therefore press the amendments to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I shall vote against the amendments. I shall explain why because allegations have been made and I wish to clarify my views.

<P>
I do not regard my opinion as being incompatible with that expressed in the Defence Committee report on which my name appears. The Minister and others have admitted that additional burdens and costs will be involved. Nevertheless, the provisions are necessary because the United Kingdom needs an effective mechanism to comply with the European convention.

<P>
Resources for the Ministry of Defence are a contentious matter. The Budget is imminent and will be followed by a comprehensive spending review and arguments about the allocation and total sum of resources available for the Ministry. With my colleagues on the Defence Committee, I am happy to argue that adequate funding is required for all forms of defence provision.

<P>
That is what we should be considering instead of how many angels there are on the head of a pin. The real issue is not whether we are against the provisions because they prevent the Ministry from doing its work, but how to get adequate resources for every aspect of the Ministry's important work.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> No, I intend to give a brief clarification of my position.

<P>
The amendments, like others that the Opposition have tabled, have a hidden agenda. Their approach to international law and organisations is based on a unilateralist view of the world, suggesting that, if only we opted out of international obligations, we could go for derogations and opt-outs. We would be right and everyone else in the world--including the international legal system, international institutions and European Union--would be wrong. That is another example of the Eurosceptic Conservative party fulminating against all things European.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman has had plenty of time already and I shall finish my point.

<P>
The measures have nothing to do with the European Union. However, one would think that they did if one listened to the Tories, who have generally expounded the anti-European philosophy dominating their party.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Let me clarify the matter. The custody hearings are army estimates, based on the current number of cases. It is not predicted that the number of crimes for which custody is appropriate will change as a result of the Bill. The provision is merely an additional safeguard, based on the army's long-established custom and practice. The estimates are pretty accurate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Will the Minister give us a figure for custody hearings, which is more important than the number of cases?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That is obviously an estimate. Not everyone is kept in custody for a year and not everyone is required to have a hearing every eight days. There is provision for hearings to be held approximately once every four weeks with the agreement of the accused. Administratively, that would be much more convenient and we expect matters to proceed accordingly. Any estimate is a forecast, whether right or wrong. However, in this case, the forecast has a sound basis.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The Minister is unable to tell us the number of custody hearings.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Of course I am. I am sorry that I sat down now. There have not yet been any custody hearings so how can I possibly say how many there will be? The hon. Gentleman is being a wee bit unreasonable. If I could forecast as well as that I would have won the national lottery by now and would not be sitting here.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The Minister is being slightly unreasonable. Assuming that there will be 250 cases, then, on the experience of cases that have gone through the system, the Ministry of Defence will know the required length of a custody hearing. Currently, a hearing takes place before a commanding officer. Given that we know the length of time, and assuming that the judicial officer comes to the same judgments as the commanding officer--at present, he is guided by the Army prosecuting authority, or by his legal advisers, when making determinations about custody--the performance of judicial officers will not differ greatly from that of commanding officers now. The Ministry knows the figure for custody hearings--it can work it out. The Minister referred to relieving the burden by having the accused say that he is content to be put into custody for 28 days. During our previous discussion I attempted to relieve the burden by saying that the accused would not need to have a lawyer with him. If there is a 28-day period, it will be necessary to have two lawyers. They will submit claims, so the saving from the 28-day period will not be large. The accused will have to have his own lawyer and a judicial officer so the saving will not be as great as the Minister suggested. We do not know the figure for custody hearings nor do we know the cost. The cost of using judicial officers who are paid at an hourly rate is also not clear. We do not know how difficult it will be to get them to wherever the hearings take place, or the time for which they will charge. Given the open-ended nature of the Bill, I am concerned about the provision being bound from the centre.

<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 29, line 21, leave out ``or any colony'' and insert--

<P>
, colony or the United States of America.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment:

<P>
No. 115, in page 29, line 24, leave out ``or any colony'' and insert--

<P>
, colony or the United States of America.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> It is important, as we consider the Bill, to imagine the position in which the armed forces will find themselves when they put the Bill into action. The amendments are a sort of reality check on the way in which the armed forces usually conduct themselves and on who is usually beside them on operations. My amendment would widen the category people who may be appointed as judicial officers by the judge advocate general, or by the chief naval judge advocate, had my earlier amendment sadly not been rejected by the Committee. It would allow people who have been appointed for at least five years in any Commonwealth country or

<P>
colony or the United States of America ... and duties similar to those of a barrister or solicitor in England and Wales, and is subject to punishment or disability for breach of professional rules.
That meets the reality test that our armed forces must face.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary is leaving the Committee, as her expertise may be needed. I hope that my remarks will convince her that the judicial systems of the United States, the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth are sufficiently similar to allow her to accept the amendments.

<P>
At present, even though their country may have different legal structures, barristers or solicitors from any Commonwealth country may be appointed, as long as they are subject to punishment or disability for breach of professional rules, and to sanctions if they do not properly exercise their functions as a judicial officer according to the rules of the profession in their own country. The legal system of the United States, which once belonged to the Crown, is based on the English system, and it is similar to ours in many respects; indeed, English case law is frequently used in the United States in determining precedents. There is thus no reason why the clause should not include lawyers from the United States of America.

<P>
If the clause is to include lawyers from any Commonwealth country, there is no reason to object in principle to those from the United States. For example, the legal system of Mozambique, which is a member of the Commonwealth, derives from its Portuguese inheritance. If barristers and solicitors from Mozambique can be appointed to be judicial officers for United Kingdom armed forces, surely it should be possible to appoint lawyers from the United States, who speak English, which is not always the case with those from Mozambique.

<P>
A reality check is necessary; we must consider where, and with whom, our forces will be deployed. It may be necessary to appoint judicial officers from other countries when our armed forces are deployed around the world, and in such circumstnaces it is more likely than not that they will be operating alongside troops from the United States, as they did in the Gulf, in Bosnia and in Kosovo and, in Beirut in the 1980s. The Beirut example is a good one, as it may have been useful to use lawyers attached to the American forces to take custody decisions when our forces were on detachment in that hostile city. Those circumstances must, quite properly, have been in the minds of those who drafted the Bill.

<P>
The clause enables judicial officers to be appointed in peculiar circumstances when armed forces are on detachment in remote parts of the world, in order to widen the net of those who could be appointed to that role. As our troops are invariably deployed alongside those from the United States, which usually makes a greater contribution to the operation than the United Kingdom, it would be sensible to take advantage of the fact that they are more likely than we are to have lawyers in their train who could be available for use at judicial hearings. Adding

<P>
or the United States of America
reflects the reality of the situations that our armed forces are likely to meet around the world. It meets the legal test of having a legal system that is similar enough to ours and United States lawyers are seen to be reasonable people who speak English and have the same background of common law to enable them to take decisions about custody.

<P>
The hon. Member for Ilford, South will no doubt ask why the amendment does not include European Union countries and, ideally, I would want it to do so. However, I assumed that those who drafted the Bill wanted to choose countries whose legal systems had a similar genesis to ours, which is why the proposal is limited to the Commonwealth. As the United Kingdom forces are usually deployed with those of the United States rather than with those of our European allies, adding the United States would increase the measure's flexibility without having the complications of legal systems with a different base.

<P>
I do not want the hon. Member for Ilford, South suddenly to leap up and say that we have a wider Atlanticist agenda, and that we foaming mouthed, wild-eyed sceptics will do anything to do down the European Union. The presentation of the previous clause was a travesty; I fear that the hon. Gentleman is revealing more about his own prejudices than those of Conservative Members.

<P>
This sensible amendment is designed to increase the flexibility of our armed forces deployed in the difficult circumstances in which the Bill will have to operate. It is likely that our troops will operate alongside a larger force from the United States, which is more likely to include lawyers. That will reduce the burden on the Ministry of Defence which would otherwise have to fly our own lawyers miles to an operation when someone has to be remanded rather quickly. I hope that the Committee will accept this limited and sensible amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> This is an interesting one. The hon. Gentleman made much of the great costs of the measure to the armed forces, but he also told us that we should employ American lawyers. From what I know of them, that strikes me as being slightly inconsistent.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South would not dream of referring to the present complement as foaming mouthed; they are the respectable face of Conservatism as far as their views on Europe are concerned. That was not intended to be patronising, however it may have sounded.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman made an interesting point; the reason for widening the proposal was to be flexible while recognising that familiarity with the British system of law is important. Mozambiquean lawyers would be considered only if they had been trained in a system that paralleled our own closely enough. It is intended to be flexible, but not prescriptive. I suspect that we have not included any provision for European lawyers because their legal systems are so different. This case, quite apart from the cost, hinges on whether a United States--

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I hope that the issue of cost will not be an argument against this. Clearly if a British lawyer could be appointed judicial officer more cheaply, he would be used.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Absolutely. It was a mildly facetious point that I introduced at the start. It was not intended to be a serious point of debate. Lawyers are expensive enough, as we are all aware to our cost.

<P>
The amendment would enable lawyers qualified in the United States to serve as judicial officers? Would that be helpful? We have looked at this and we do not belive that the similarities between our system and the American system are great enough to enable us to welcome the amendment. In some ways the differences are much greater than is generally realised. For example, US constitutional principles relating to the investigation of offences make their approach to the admissibility of evidence very different from that with which Commonwealth lawyers would be familiar.

<P>
While I share the hon. Gentlemen's boundless internationalism, in this case it must be tempered with some regard to the job that we are asking these people to do. The principles of the Bill balance the imperatives of flexibility and using people who can come to terms quickly with the job we are asking them to do. Although the amendment is superficially attractive, it would not achieve our objectives.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am very disappointed by that response. I hope that the Minister has properly satisfied himself that we cannot use Americans because of their legal system. Our systems are pretty similar. If we are trying to include the whole of the Commonwealth, clearly we accept that people with slightly different legal systems are capable, if they owe the same duty and are subject to the same punishment for breach of professional rules.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> That is precisely the point. The Bill makes it clear that it must be a barrister or solicitor of at least five years' standing. Surely an American with that experience of the law would be well capable of reading this Bill and the other service discipline Acts and coming to a reasonable decision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> That is what I would have thought. I agree with my hon. Friend. We are talking about the Commonwealth, which includes countries that were not ruled by the United Kingdom, and so have a different system of law. It includes Mozambique. I believe that the objection to US lawyers can be met even if there is a problem with their slight difference on admissibility of evidence. We might, for example, provide a brigade or even a battalion to an American division that has been deployed on detached operations and has other NATO or UN troops under its command. The Americans would come with the divisional troops and the support for those troops in the field. A British battalion or brigade is unlikely to be deployed with lawyers in tow.

<P>

<B>Mr. Key:</B> My hon. Friend used the term ``British'' which includes England and Scotland. A Scottish Writer to the Signet cannot practise at the bar in London and an English barrister cannot practise at the Scottish bar. Subsection 2(a) of new section 75L makes it clear that appointment depends on being qualified under section 84B(2) of each of the 1955 Acts. Section 84B(2) of the Army Acts refers to

<P>
an advocate in Scotland of at least five years' standing or a solicitor who has a right of audience in the Court of Sessions or the High Court of Justiciary for at least five years; or a member of the bar of Northern Ireland.
If we can do it for Scottish and Northern Ireland barristers, why not for American?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend: we can do it for an American. An American division may deploy British troops under command in an operation and a discipline problem may arise, whereby someone needs to be remanded in custody by a judicial officer within 48 hours, as required by earlier clauses. An American formation is the most likely context for British troops to be under command in an operation. In those circumstances, divisional troops will have access, under the Bill, to qualified lawyers.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
Our troops are highly unlikely to be under the command of Australians, New Zealanders or Canadians in the same way. In those circumstances, we are likely to make a larger contribution than they would. If our armed forces need non-British lawyers, they are likely to be under the command of the United States of America. If the Americans provide the divisional command and divisional troops and they are able to deal with British custody hearings, an American lawyer could be appointed by the judge advocate general. It could also happen with detached naval operations on a flotilla of naval ships with one British ship alongside the vast US navy. So it could be much easier to appoint an American officer--on either detached sea operations or land operations.

<P>
To meet the Minister's objections, the officer would have to satisfy himself that he knew enough about the rules of procedure that govern custody hearings--the Bail Act 1976 and other appropriate tests. It would be the responsibility of the officer with British troops under his command to take on the role of judicial officer and exercise a judgement about custody, which involves knowledge of a fairly limited area of British law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> We shall come later to consideration of the interface with visiting forces legislation. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a good example of where it would be convenient and helpful if the Americans could play some role in proceedings and had enough knowledge of the British system to do so?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I think that I agree with my hon. Friend. American military lawyers would need to be familiar with the status of forces agreement and are likely to have relevant expertise because they know how the administration of justice works when American soldiers commit offences in the United Kingdom. That raises the same issues about who is to administer justice as when our forces in Germany commit offences. Similar questions about jurisdiction apply.

<P>
I am sadly familiar with the case of a British soldier who raped two German women. It was decided, in conjunction with the German authorities, for the British military to exercise justice by bringing the soldier to court martial, though it was open to the Germans to insist on the issue being taken before a German court. Our military lawyers in Germany are familiar with the German system of justice. Similarly, American military lawyers serving in the United Kingdom are likely to be familiar with the status of forces agreement here, as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury said. That increases flexibility in difficult circumstances.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will reflect on my remarks and any advice that he has received and accept the amendments as a means of widening the flexibility available to us when the Bill comes into force.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I regret the necessity of disappointing the hon. Gentleman yet again. I used only one example of the differences, but many others exist. Scottish, Irish and Commonwealth lawyers, who are familiar with the British legal system--in other words, those whose system is based on ours--will be considered for use. Many of those people will be appointed on an ad hoc basis and it will not therefore be possible to give them time to train. We want people who are sufficiently qualified to deal with such cases at short notice. That clearly applies to Scottish and irish lawyers because, although differences exist, their systems mirror English law, but that is not the case with the USA. There are so many differences between the US system and ours that it would be improper to use American-trained lawyers, unless they had previously been trained in the British system. However, that would involve administrative costs and each person would have to be investigated, which would not be practicable, so I stand by what I have said and will resist the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> If Pakistanis, Mozambiqueans and Nigerians, with three wholly different legal systems, can be used under the Bill, it is absolutely absurd that lawyers from the United States cannot, so I shall press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Very many years ago, I was in the Army cadet force. I am extremely fortunate to have had that experience. In those far-off days of the late 1950s, alsmost everyone belonged to his school combined cadet force. A contingent of more than 400 boys belonged to my school CCF. That was only a decade after the last war finished. The cadet force instilled in young people a remarkable sense of reliance, self-confidence, discipline and the other virtues of that sort of life. I learned that getting an extra stripe on one's arm was not just a matter of Brownie points--if one may put it like that without denigrating the Brownies--but it also meant extra responsibility. I ended up as a company sergeant-major which was a great privilege. In those days, the cadet forces were an important part of the national scene.

<P>
NCOs have an increasingly important role. Every day, we examine problems of overstretch, recruitment and retention. Retention is the biggest single difficulty and is extremely serious in relation to senior NCOs, who feel undervalued, although they are proud of what they have achieved.

<P>
Earlier, we heard off-stage sounds of jollification outside the Committee. There is an exhibition of hon. Members' photographs, including some remarkable ones taken by Lord Healey, a former Defence Secretary. However, I digress. The exhibition includes a photograph that I took of the university library in Pristina being guarded by a British Warrior and a detachment of British forces--a nice irony. The Warrior was commanded by a senior NCO with great responsibility for his men, his machine and British troops' involvement in Kosovo. The nation and the military--or, more specifically, the Army--believe that that NCO is qualified to administer military discipline and uphold peace in Kosovo.

<P>
Having served on the Committee considering the Bill that became the Armed Forces Act 1996, I realise that senior NCOs are the backbone of the military system in all three services. We made recommendations to which previous Government responded. Therefore, we were not surprised that supporting essay 9 of the strategic defence review, entitled ``A Policy for People'', contains a paragraph entitled ``Membership of Courts Martial'' which states:

<P>
In recognition of the value of Warrant Officers and their experience in contributing to the administration of justice, the Services will amend the eligibility criteria for members of Courts Martial to allow Warrant Officers to sit as members of the panel where sergeants and more junior ranks (or equivalent) have been arraigned. This change requires legislation and it will be included in the next Armed Forces Bill in 2001.
 
<P>
I was keen to give the present Government an opportunity to bring forward that legislative change and include it in the Bill. That seemed appropriate to the clause, which deals with people's qualifications to administer justice. However, in his wisdom it was decided that my amendment No. 38 should be taken with amendment No. 5, which we considered at our first sitting last Tuesday. Regrettably, amendment No. 38 was voted down without explanation and the Minister made no comment. That, however, is water under the bridge.

<P>
We must still address whether the inclusion of warrant officers as officers qualified for the membership of summary appeal courts is a simple measure that would improve the forces' disciplinary system. I hope that the Minister will say that it is and that it will be included in next year's armed forces Bill. However, it would assist the Committee if he would explain why it is not included in the Bill.

<P>
The strategic defence review recognised the value of warrant officers and their experience contributing to the administration of justice. The previous Conservative Government had a hand in that and, in February 1997, announced that they would examine whether warrant officers should sit on courts martial. In 1996, when the last armed forces Bill was being considered, the Defence Committee was aware that a move to that effect could have widespread consequences and that such a proposal would need detailed investigation. So it remained a suggestion from the Committee rather than a firm recommendation.

<P>
However, the Ministry of Defence undertook at that time to review the policy and the associated legal provisions. A detailed internal review was carried out and there was extensive consultation with the three services. The traditional structure of courts martial within the disciplinary hierarchy was examined closely, as were the various additional benefits of including warrant officers as court-martial members. The Ministry of Defence noted that there were a few caveats to the inclusion of warrant officers--it was not intended that they serve on courts martial with persons of equal or higher rank. The Ministry of Defence also intended that officers, in keeping with their overall responsibility for discipline, should continue to constitute the majority of court martial members. They concluded that a decision about whether to include warrant officers as court martial members would be made on a case-by-case basis.

<P>
Conservative Ministers corresponded with the Defence Select Committee and noted that a legislative opportunity was unlikely to be available before the next armed forces Bill came before the House, but then this cropped up, which is why we have raised it. It is not too late for the Government to take this opportunity; we shall be disappointed if they do not. This is an appropriate time to ask the Minister about his intentions. Does he still intend to wait until 2001 to implement this part of the strategic defence review, and is he prepared to consider an amendment of his own, even at this late stage or perhaps even later in the Bill?

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point in asking why we are not including a worthwhile change. At this stage in the quinquennial cycle, there is a huge build-up of worthy amendments for next year's Bill. Including them in this year's Bill would not only take away from the importance of next year's Bill but would circumvent the very different procedures that are usually employed for armed forces Bills, which involve the special Committee and so on.

<P>
The Bill has the narrow purpose of ensuring compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998 and the ECHR and making necessary consequential associated changes. It was a difficult Bill to draft. A great deal of work had to be done on it, within a limited time scale. While I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's aims, I do not think that I can agree to his amendment. It is properly a matter for next year's Bill. I should like to accept it, but it will have to wait until then.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury has spoken to earlier amendments. We are now on the clause stand part debate. No one could claim that we have not done our best to widen and improve the clause to give the armed forces the greatest flexibility in finding judicial officers. We sought earlier to put the burden of the Bill on the Government's legal officers but that was resoundingly refused. We attempted further to proof the Bill in its own terms against more unexpected judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, which we might find extended its jurisdiction further than it ought to in terms of identifying the independence of the chain of command. By definition, judge advocates general are less independent than Lord Chancellors, but we did not succeed in bringing about an improvement.

<P>
The clause is flawed. It will impose on the armed forces the unpredictable costs of judicial officers. Some cases should be predictable: we should know how many times someone has to be remanded in custody, but the Minister has failed to provide the figures. We do not know what changes in the pattern of the armed forces' behaviour will arise when the Bill comes into effect. That is the greatest problem with the Bill: an edifice is being created to protect the armed forces' discipline system, but it will change the way in which the armed forces behave and respond to the justice system. The clause is a mini-classic of the wider problem because judicial officers are appointed under it. The administration of the rules of custody is to be taken outside the chain of command--perhaps right outside the United Kingdom. Appointments in Commonwealth countries or colonies are provided for under clause 7(2), new section 47M(2).

<P>
The clause should not stand part of the Bill because it is the key driver of the custody provisions, which provide an extra burden on the armed forces. If people examine the record of our Committee proceedings, they will see that some of us opposed the clause because of the burden that it will place on the armed forces. These costs should not be borne by the armed forces, which will detract from their prime duty of military capability. The burden will be imposed as a result of a Government policy to subject our armed forces to the European convention on human rights. In the end, that will have to change. As successive judgments come, and we react to each one by proposing another armed forces Bill, it will chip away, bit by bit, at what the armed forces are trying to defend--the authority of the commanding officer and the administration of the justice system.

<P>
In response to the Hood judgment, the Bill takes away the responsibility of the commanding officer to decide--on the legal advice that he receives from lawyers in the existing system--how to put the Bail Act into effect and to make judgments about whether the soldiers, sailors or airmen under his command should be remanded in custody. The Bill is another stage in the process of reducing the authority of the commanding officer. If we do not defend the commanding officer here in Committee, we shall salami-slice away more of his authority. In later clauses, we do so in spades--a fundamental objection to the Bill--but we are reducing his authority in this clause, even though there is no direct case law that forces us to do so.

<P>
As I said, at some stage we shall have to face up to the fact that our armed forces cannot continue to operate at their present high standard, underpinned by their own system of justice, or to defend the rights to which we all--including European countries--aspire. Under the remit of the European convention on human rights, that is impossible. Therefore, the clause should not stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to speak to new section 75L(2)(b) of the Army Act 1955, which states that the barrister or solicitor must be of at least five years standing. I know that the proposal is copied from previous service discipline Acts, but it seems an unnecessary hurdle. It should be examined in order to put down a makrer for a new combined service discipline Bill, perhaps next year.

<P>
In the civilian system, people are remanded in custody by a magistrate--often a lay magistrate--with relatively little experience. To require a judicial officer to be a barrister or a solicitor with five years experience imposes an unnecessary qualification. A barrister or solicitor with five years experience might become a recorder, if not a judge, within that time, and unnecessary expense will be involved if such a qualification is specified.

<P>
I see no reason why the qualifying period should not be reduced to three years. Under the old system of courts martial in the 1955 disciplinary Acts, the officer appointed in the more serious cases had to have only three years experience. If the Army officer had to have only three years commissioned experience, why should not that period be sufficient for a barrister or a solicitor who has had a significant period of training before qualifying as a lawyer? I hope that the Minister will consider my proposal carefully.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to make one further point and then I shall be happy to give way to my hon. Friend.

<P>
New section 75L makes it clear that those who have had at least five years experience are also

<P>
subject to punishment or disability for breach of professional rules.
Their professional bodies will ensure that barristers and solicitors are of a reasonable standard before they qualify. Like other professional bodies, if members consistently hand out faulty judgments, they will impose disciplinary penalties, as would my professional body--I am a chartered surveyor--if I were practising and made faulty reports to clients.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I presume that my hon. Friend is familiar with Lord Renton's amendment in another place. With all his experience, he felt that it would be more appropriate to increase the period to 10 years. The reason why the service discipline Acts specify three years experience in respect of general courts martial is that one does not know the circumstances in which they will be constituted. It may be in the most extreme and urgent operational conditions, when it is difficult to find anyone to serve on field general courts martial in discipline cases. I can vividly remember being taken through the circumstances in which a sentence of death could be imposed in a test case when I passed my military law examinations. I learnt the extreme circumstances which apply and how a field general court martial is put together. Of course, one hopes that such circumstances will never have to be faced, but it is possible to include them in legislation. Flexibility is needed in putting together field general courts martial and general courts martial; they should reflect the experience of young and junior officers. A longer period than five years might be appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I was getting a little worried that my hon. Friend might be challenging my speech with one of his own. Nevertheless, he makes an interesting point about Lord Renton's amendments. I disagree with the noble Lord in that respect; the Bill makes matters far more legalistic in response to the Hood judgment in the European Court of Human Rights. We therefore want the Bill to be as practical as possible and the costs to be kept as low as is consistent with providing a reasonable system of justice and appeals to comply with the European Court--
