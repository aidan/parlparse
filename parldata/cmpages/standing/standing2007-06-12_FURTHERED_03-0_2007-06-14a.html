FHEA 1992,
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#147;56A
Intervention: England</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(1) This
section applies if the Learning and Skills Council for England is
satisfied as to one or more of the matters listed in subsection (2) in
the case of an institution in England within the further education
sector; and it is immaterial whether or not a complaint is made by any
person.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2) The matters
are&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) that the
institution&#146;s affairs have been or are being mismanaged by the
institution&#146;s governing
body;</div>

institution&#146;s governing body have failed to discharge any duty
imposed on them by or for the purposes of any
Act;</div>

is performing significantly less well than it might in all the
circumstances reasonably be expected to perform, or is failing or
likely to fail to give an acceptable standard of education or
training.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(3) If this section
applies the council may do one or more of the things listed in
subsection (5).</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(4) If the
council does one or more of those things, it must at the same time give
the institution&#146;s governing body a notice
stating&#151;</div>

or matters listed in subsection (2) as to which the council is
satisfied;</div>

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(8) The council may not direct a governing body
under subsection (5)(c) to dismiss a member of
staff.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(9) But subsection (8)
does not prevent the council, where it considers that it may be
appropriate to dismiss a member of staff whom the governing body have
power under their institution&#146;s articles of government to
dismiss, from giving the governing body such directions under this
section as are necessary to secure that the procedures applicable to
the consideration of the case for dismissal of that member of staff are
given effect to in relation to that member of
staff.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(10) A governing body
must comply with any directions given to them under this
section.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(11) An appointment of
a member of a governing body under this section shall have effect as if
made in accordance with the instrument of government and articles of
government of the institution
concerned.</div>

to the form and content of the
policy.</div>

					<a name="07061443000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
am pleased to introduce the Government new clauses and Government
amendments. More than &#163;11 billion a year of public investment
throughout England and Wales reflects the importance of the further
education system to individuals in helping fundamentally to change
their lives. It also reflects the importance to employers and the
nation of providing the skills that are vital to secure a successful
and vibrant economy. Such investment must be protected in the interest
of learners and the public
purse.</div>
					<a name="07061443000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the past six
years, we have seen significant improvements. Success rates are up by
20 percentage points&#151;a fantastic rate of progress. In the
current inspection cycle, more than 90 per cent. of colleges inspected
so far have been graded satisfactory or better. That is significant
progress, but we need to go
further.</div>
					<a name="07061443000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
policy intention in Wales is to raise the bar for quality in FE
provision by 2010, with 65 per cent. or more of FE colleges gaining
inspection grade 2 or above. We are introducing proposals that will
enable Welsh Ministers to initiate remedial action in relation to an
institution in the FE sector in certain prescribed circumstances, such
as when there is evidence that the provider is failing to meet the
needs of its learners or is performing significantly less well than
might be expected.</div>
					<a name="07061443000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
England, we have had Sir Andrew Foster&#146;s report and our
&#147;Further Education&#148; White Paper. The Bill will help us to
take the action needed to continue to transform the FE system. Nowhere
is there a clearer demonstration of that transformation than in our
intention to ensure that there is sustainable development and
improvement in provision. During the debates in another place, Baroness
Morris said that</div>
					<a name="07061443000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we are
not against rigour or driving up standards.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 27 February 2007; Vol. 689, c.
1530.]</div>
					<a name="07061443000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to go further
than that. The Government intend to ensure year-on-year improvements in
the available provision through a robust intervention strategy that
will provide the &#147;ultimate deterrent&#148; referred to by my
right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) during
Second Reading.</div>
					<a name="07061443000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
well as supporting colleges and providers to develop and improve, we
will ensure that any pockets of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>underperformance in the FE system are tackled quickly, robustly and
fairly. In saying that, let me be clear that we are talking about a
very small proportion of providers; overall, FE colleges are doing
extremely well. However, those intervention powers are vital if we are
to continue making important improvements in the UK&#146;s skills
base.</div>
					<a name="07061443000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our commitment
to ensure that all provision is good or improving and to eliminate all
inadequate or unsatisfactory provision by 2008 remains firm. Crucially,
however, we have listened carefully to the thoughtful and constructive
debate on our intervention proposals during the Bill&#146;s passage.
Indeed, I have had conversations across the Floor of the House with
Opposition Members. It is in the interests not only of learners but of
colleges and the reputation of the whole FE system that we get this
right, so I have taken full account of the representations that I have
received. The amendments that I have tabled, as they apply to England
and Wales, directly address those
concerns.</div>
					<a name="07061443000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
ensure that both the Learning and Skills Council in England and the
Welsh Ministers, as the bodies responsible for commissioning and
funding FE, have the full range of powers that they need to secure best
quality and best value for money. The recent report on collaboration
between schools with sixth forms and further education colleges shows
that there is a need in Wales to encourage and promote greater
collaborative approaches among post-16 providers. The provision for
Welsh Ministers to be given the power to direct governing bodies of FE
institutions to make specific collaboration arrangements with
maintained schools or other education bodies will directly contribute
to ensuring that that
happens.</div>
					<a name="07061443000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me also
be clear that our White Paper commitment to eliminate inadequate
provision in England is unchanged. The LSC must have the power to
intervene if governing bodies do not take the appropriate action in
those rare instances in which a failure of leadership and management
leads to inadequate provision. The clause will give the LSC the power
to affect a move towards dismissal by enabling it to direct the
governing body to initiate dismissal procedures in respect of a
particular senior post holder. Our intention has always been that the
governing body would follow its usual dismissal procedures if the LSC
directed the dismissal of a post holder. However, in response to
concerns raised we have now made that explicit. I hope that that will
be welcomed by the
Opposition.</div>
					<a name="07061443000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
stressed during debates here and in another place, those powers of
intervention would be utilised only at the end of a long process that
allows time for colleges to improve. The LSC&#146;s draft
intervention policy document was made available to Members, together
with the Government amendment tabled on 6 June. That draft policy sets
out the initial thinking and shows the procedures that the LSC would
follow before invoking any statutory intervention powers. It also sets
out very clearly the important safeguards that would be in place. The
LSC&#146;s draft intervention policy document shows that intervention
would be considered only in serious cases and only where the college
had not tackled the problem that had been identified.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>
					<a name="07061443000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be helpful if I
summarise the four-stage process that we envisage. The first step is
the annual commissioning dialogue. Each year, the LSC discusses with
every college the full range of learning provisions offered and how
that contributes to delivering successful outcomes for learners,
employers and the local community. A review of the quality of provision
and the identification of areas for development is an integral element
of that dialogue and is an opportunity for both the college and the LSC
to highlight any concerns as they arise so that the appropriate
remedial action can be taken before problems
escalate.</div>
					<a name="07061443000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through that
discussion, however, and where supported by evidence, such as
inspection reports, success rate data or evidence of financial
problems, the second step is for the LSC to consider the capacity of
the college to address the underperformance robustly and swiftly, and
to determine whether it is appropriate to issue a notice to improve.
During the third step, the LSC would co-ordinate work with a range of
agencies to support the college in delivering the improvements required
by the notice to improve. Usually, we would expect that phase of
support and improvement to be completed within 12 months.</div>
					<a name="07061443000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The fourth
and final step of the process would be intervention, if necessary.
Escalation to intervention procedures would be considered only where
the LSC was satisfied about one or more of the triggers identified in
proposed new section 56A(2) to the Further and Higher Education Act
1992, which might include the failure of a college to meet the relevant
conditions under the notice to improve. Exceptionally, intervention may
be triggered by circumstances that place immediate and serious risk to
learners and/or public funding, or by a direction by the Secretary of
State. In respect of any direction from the Secretary of State, let me
be clear that we have introduced a requirement for the LSC to supply
the governing body with a copy of the notice that it receives when
complying with a direction from the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="07061443000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress that
throughout each step of the process, if the governing body can
demonstrate that it is, or is capable of addressing the problems, the
LSC would not take action to exercise its statutory powers. I know, for
example, that much of the previous debate focused on specific concerns
about the proposed provisions as they might apply to the dismissal of
senior post holders, but, as I have just outlined, the prior steps of
the process are intended to support the college in managing and
securing its own quality improvement. That is very much the thrust of
our proposals.</div>
					<a name="07061443000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
bringing forward new clause 1, I have sought to make it clear that the
governing body, as the employer, is responsible for all decisions
regarding any dismissal, by giving the LSC the power to direct the
governing body to put into effect its procedures for considering the
dismissal of one of its senior members of staff. We would expect any
governing body that received such a direction to commission a full and
thorough investigation and to consider whether there is a case for
dismissal in the light of its findings. The governing body alone would
be responsible for the outcome of that process.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>
					<a name="07061443000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we make new orders for the
instruments and articles to government to apply to further education
corporations in England, we will make them consistent with the
requirement to conduct an investigation to provide any evidence for the
consideration of dismissal
procedures.</div>
					<a name="07061443000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
as the governing body would be obliged to comply with such a direction,
we believe that these powers still gives us the rigour and reassurances
that we need to ensure that any and all instances of failure in the
system will be challenged robustly and effectively. Of course, we would
expect that in the vast majority of cases, the governing body would act
without the need for external intervention. That is very much the
thrust of our argument. But if governing bodies are not robust enough
to deliver what we need, something should be in place to ensure that
that weakness is remedied. Most reasonable people would support that
conclusion.</div>
					<a name="07061443000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
offer even greater reassurances in respect of some of the concerns that
have been expressed. In those rare and extreme circumstances where
intervention proves to be necessary, I have now also made explicit on
the face of the Bill the requirement for the Learning and Skills
Council to give the governing body notice citing which aspect of
section 56A(2) applies; the reasons why it is satisfied that this
applies; and to set out its reasons for the actions it proposes to
take. The governing body would then have the opportunity to respond
before any action was taken.</div>
					<a name="07061443000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, if the governing body is
able to demonstrate that the problem is being or is capable of being
addressed, the Learning and Skills Council would not exercise its
statutory powers. In Wales, the Welsh Ministers are required to take
intervention action by order. Similar to the requirement for a written
notice from the Learning and Skills Council, this order of the Welsh
Ministers would explain which of the conditions for intervention is
satisfied and will satisfy the requirement for a written record of the
action taken and the reasons for
it.</div>
					<a name="07061443000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, the
Learning and Skills Council has set out its proposed intervention
policy document in draft to aid the discussions during Committee and
beyond. This draft is, of course, subject to the passage of the Bill
and the outcome of the consultation with the sector. This means that
all interested parties will have the opportunity to refine the policy
further before it is finalised and approved by the Secretary of State.
Once the policy is approved the Secretary of State will then lay it
before the House. Similarly, the requirement that Welsh Ministers
consult on their statement of policy will ensure that appropriate
consultation takes place with stakeholders, particularly further
education
representatives.</div>
					<a name="07061443000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
end by summing up the key points I have made in response to what is an
exceedingly important element of this Bill. Our goal of eliminating
underperformance from the further education system is a bold and
justifiable ambition. That is why I make no apology for saying that the
Learning and Skills Council must be able to intervene effectively in
those extreme circumstances where the college has not itself addressed
underperformance in a sufficiently rapid and robust
manner.</div>
					<a name="07061443000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must also
stress that the powers of intervention proposed by this clause are
wholly consistent with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>employment and human rights legislation; they do not undermine the role
of governing bodies; and perhaps most importantly they safeguard the
interest of learners by supporting our ambition to eliminate poor and
inadequate provision from the further education system. We have a duty
to every learner in the FE system to make sure that they benefit from
high quality and ever improving provision. As my right hon. Friend the
Member for Torfaen said on Second
Reading,</div>
					<a name="07061443000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

					<a name="07061443000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The support
for a robust, fair and transparent interventions policy is clear and
there is a consensus on this issue. The Association of Colleges
supports this as do many Members of both Houses. Indeed, I have
received a letter from John Brennan in which he offers the
unconditional support of the AOC to this Government amendment as the
AOC now considers we have achieved a workable basis for LSC
intervention, which is compatible with employment legislation,
consistent with the moves towards self-regulation and will give
emphasis to the drive to embed within the sector a culture of
responsibility for its own standards and performance. Similarly in
Wales, I am pleased to say that Forum welcomes the fact that Ministers
have listened to its views
too.</div>
					<a name="07061443000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
should like to take this opportunity to thank the Association of
Colleges for its contribution to this amendment, and in particular for
its help in the development of the LSC&#146;s draft policy document.
Through consultation, debate and dialogue we have achieved an
acceptable way forward. We have gone a long way to allay the concerns
of hon. Members and I therefore commend the new clauses and the
amendment to the

							<b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): It is
good to be back and considering these matters. John Ruskin, speaking of
19th-century industrial Britain, said
that</div>
					<a name="07061443000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the sky is covered
with gray cloud;&#151;not rain-cloud, but a dry black veil, which no
ray of sunshine can pierce...It looks more to me as if it were
made of dead men&#146;s
souls&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061443000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought that we
ought to have some Ruskin to raise the standard of debate in the
Committee. When these proposals were first introduced, there was a
cloud hanging over FE colleges&#151;perhaps not quite the same kind
as Ruskin&#146;s, but certainly a dark cloud&#151;which was why the
proposals were greeted with such hostility. Indeed, it was why members
of all parties in the House of Lords took the view that the powers
being granted were unnecessary. It would be quite inappropriate for a
dark cloud to hang over our successful further education
sector.</div>
					<a name="07061443000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
listened and, as I said earlier in the Committee, he was
generous in allowing representations to be made to him and, more than
that, in entering dialogue with, as he said, the AOC, other interested
parties and Opposition Members. I pay tribute to the tone and tenor of
the way in which he has handled the whole Bill and particularly this
part of it. However, I remain largely unconvinced, and I shall explain
why.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>
					<a name="07061443000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has set out the
four elements of the process that would ensue should it become
necessary, in the view of those who will have the power, to intervene
in respect of an FE college and to take the very serious step of
dismissing its senior managers, governors or principal. I simply do not
believe, based on the evidence, that those additional powers are
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07061443000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Minister generously started his comments by acknowledging that 90 per
cent. of FE colleges were deemed by Ofsted to be satisfactory or
better. He then, in my judgment with equal sagacity, said that the
Government were determined to drive up standards and eliminate
underperformance. But underperformance in the sector is rare, by
Ofsted&#146;s and his own admission. There is no evidence that it is
growing and no evidence that Ministers have had to use their existing
powers to intervene in respect of college principals to deal with
underperformance.</div>
					<a name="07061443000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister knows, when I asked him how often the Government have had
to intervene using their existing powers to sack college principals
since those powers emerged in statute, he revealed that they have never
been used. Powers that have never been used are to be increased and
transferred to the LSC. Performance is deemed to be satisfactory or
better in the overwhelming majority of colleges and, where it is not,
we have been offered no evidence to suggest that it is due to
inadequate leadership or that the powers that the Government are
seeking to create would be likely to solve the
problem.</div>
					<a name="07061443000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
have reached a point at which a sensible and generous Minister is
dancing on the head of a pin. I say that because in the new clause
reintroduced following the defeat of Lord Adonis in the other
place&#151;the first time that that gentleman had ever been defeated
in the Lords, though one fears he may have further disappointments to
face in coming weeks&#151;the Minister seeks to amend the proposals
in such a way as to satisfy his critics. He has been generous, as I
have said, but the powers are now so qualified, so convoluted and so
byzantine that one wonders whether they are worth introducing at all.
So we have a Minister who has listened and reacted, but he is now
reintroducing a clause that, frankly, is not worthy of this Bill, this
Committee or this House. Ministers have powers at present and if they
choose to use them, they should use them. There is a need for a
long-stop power, where public money is involved and the public interest
is concerned. The Minister is right that standards and rigour of
quality are about learners and learners&#146; interests. Were there
no powers of that kind, and had the Minister brought through this
Committee a proposal to take such powers, he might have attracted the
support of Opposition Members. However, let us be clear; we
are talking about greater powers and their transfer to the
LSC.</div>
					<a name="07061443000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
have one or two further questions, as if my previous words were not
enough to damn the clause. First, the regulatory impact assessment
states that there will be an additional burden on the LSC in terms of
administering the intervention strategy. Will the Minister estimate the
cost of that additional burden and tell us whether new staff will be
involved to implement that strategy? Also, because he has a brilliant
team of civil servants assisting him, he must have a notional view of
how often those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>powers will be used and how many colleges are in such a state that he
expects these powers to be implemented with regard to them.</div>
					<a name="07061443000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, what are the
proposed savings in the Department for Education and Skills of
transferring the intervention strategy to the LSC? There must be a
concomitant saving, and I am sure that the Minister has those figures
at his finger tips. How can we judge the effectiveness of powers that
have never been used? Why do powers that have never been used need to
be extended to college managers? I ask that question specifically
because this issue is not just about principals; it is now about senior
managers, too. Finally, does the Minister envisage these powers being
used more often, once they have gone to the LSC, than they have been
thus far?</div>
					<a name="07061443000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat
that the Minister has been generous. He has approached this matter with
good will. I have absolutely no doubts about his commitment to
improving standards. However, one does not get rid of underperformance
by taking these types of steps. One gets rid of underperformance by
celebrating excellence and examining how it can be exported and
emulated. That is the way to improve those colleges that still have
some way to go.</div>
					<a name="07061443000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis of what we have heard and unless we hear much more, then I am
afraid that, with some hesitation because of the good dialogue that we
have had, that the Opposition may wish to test the will of the
Committee on this matter, subject to the debate that will now
ensue.</div>
					
					<a name="07061443000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07061443000208"></a>
							<b class="B">Sarah
Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): I recognise and welcome the
steps forward that the new clause makes. It is significantly better
than the original draft of the clause in the Bill that first went
through the other place. Nevertheless, I must say that I have some
sympathy with the statements that the hon. Member for South Holland and
The Deepings has made. I am still not clear about the purpose of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07061443000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, as the
hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings has said and as the
Minister has acknowledged, the powers in the Further and Higher
Education Act 1992 have never been used, so why does the Minister want
to transfer those powers to the LSC? Is it because he believes that
they should have been used? If so, why did he fail to use them? How
many colleges does he envisage that the powers will be used on? I also
sympathise with the comments that the hon. Gentleman has just made
about the increased burden on the LSC, especially at a time when I know
that the Minister has been pushing hard to try to streamline the
administrative burden on that organisation.</div>
					<a name="07061443000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, as we move forward
with Leitch, it is not immediately clear to me that the LSC is
obviously the body that should take responsibility for this matter. In
many colleges, the LSC contributes only 50 or 60 per cent. of the total
sum to run the college. If we are dealing with public money, and other
money that comes by way of contributions from individuals or private
industry, is it necessarily right, as we progress with Leitch and
expect more of a contribution from individuals and industry, to give
the power in question 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>to the Learning and Skills Council? What are the implications for
colleges whose governors are provided for by a charitable foundation,
such as those dealing specifically with disabilities and special
needs?</div>
					<a name="07061443000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would welcome
clarification on several points. I welcome new subsection (8), but I am
not really clear what new subsection (9) provides for. The Minister
said that it would force colleges to initiate dismissal procedures, but
will the Learning and Skills Council give in its direction the
employment law grounds for dismissal of the individual? It is not clear
to me exactly what is meant. I should also be grateful for more
clarification of new subsection (2)(d), which seems to be extremely
vaguely worded. I am not clear precisely what would constitute an
institution&#146;s</div>
					<a name="07061443000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;performing
significantly less well than it might in all the circumstances
reasonably be expected to
perform&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061443000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister will explain that a little more
clearly.</div>
					<a name="07061443000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
listen to what the Minister has to say, but I remain unconvinced about
the purpose of the clause. If the Conservatives press the matter to a
vote, we are minded to support
them.</div>

						<a name="07061443000209"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Austin Mitchell</b> (Great Grimsby) (Lab): I rise to dispel
the impression that Labour Members are all sitting silently waiting for
the dawn of socialism on 27 June and that they all admire the
Bill. It is right to express a note of dissent on the new clause,
which, frankly, worries me.</div>
					<a name="07061443000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see that a power of the
kind that the new clause provides for is necessary to deal with the
financial abuses that developed in the halcyon days to which the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings has referred&#151;I was
going to call him my hon. Friend, because we used to go on joint
fishing expeditions to find small fish that had escaped the common
fisheries policy. As to whether I agree with him in this case, I must
point out that many of the financial abuses that the new clause would
allow the Learning and Skills Council to deal with were in the past
cleared up only very slowly, and often in face-saving ways. The new
clause would enable them to be dealt with more directly. My worry is
more general, because the Learning and Skills Council has considerable
powers and the colleges, in the main, dance to its tune.</div>
					<a name="07061443000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been very concerned and
have written to the Minister, the Learning and Skills Council and
colleges about the fall of more than 1 million in recruitment to what
might be called leisure or non-vocational courses. An article in <i class="I">The
Guardian&#146;s</i> education supplement on Tuesday, entitled
&#147;Why have adults suddenly decided to stay away from
colleges?&#148; dealt with that. The leisure courses that they are
deserting are those that enrich the lives of older students, and have
traditionally been offered in the colleges or by the Workers
Educational Association, which is in a much weaker state these days.
Such courses might be dismissed as trivial, if they are on, for
example, local history. Some of the other types of courses affected
are</div>
					<a name="07061443000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;distance
learning...courses that aren&#146;t included in the National
Qualifications Framework and thus don&#146;t attract public
subsidy...language and leisure
courses&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061443000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">and even some
professional courses. Those all enrich people&#146;s lives, but there
has been a fall in recruitment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>
					<a name="07061443000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">That aspect of the matter is in
effect covered by clause 20, which requires colleges to consult
affected groups, and the groups that I am concerned about have been
badly affected. However, this is an instance of the way in which
colleges all dance&#151;indeed, have been forced to dance&#151;to
the tune of the Learning and Skills Council, since it decided to
concentrate spending on vocational qualifications for those in the
16-to-19 and 19 and older age groups. That ties colleges down in a way
in which they have not been tied down before. The LSC, which controls
the purse strings, has adequate power to ensure that colleges comply
with Government priorities, and they are no more than
priorities&#151;there is no mention of dropping courses, although
many have been dropped. To maintain courses, however, colleges will
need a degree of freedom, and we must ensure that they have more power
and responsibility than they would have if they were faced with the
threat of draconian intervention by the LSC.</div>
					<a name="07061443000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I refer
particularly to new subsection (9), which the Liberals, surprisingly,
glossed over. They are not making a courageous stand for academic
freedom or college independence by saying that they will listen eagerly
to what the Minister has to say. Let us be clear about this: will their
party stand up for what it believes? Liberal Members cannot give us
their usual equivocation, saying, &#147;On the one hand,
there&#146;s A, on the other hand, there&#146;s B, so let&#146;s
wait to see what Minister says,&#148; because he has already said it.
New subsection (9) is a threat to academic freedom. In effect, it says
that any lecturer who makes trouble and who is a bloody nuisance, and I
have known several examples at Grimsby college, which is now Grimsby
institute of further and higher education&#151;</div>

					<a name="07061443000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						One
lecturer who taught my daughter was, frankly, a nuisance in the
college, but he was right to raise questions about expenditure,
although he was eventually kicked out. If the LSC decides that a
college must push out a lecturer who attracts public attention, that is
another threat to colleges&#146; academic independence and freedom.
It is over-egging the threat to academic freedom to supplement the
powers that colleges already have&#151;they were overused in the long
dispute over the silver book contract, when those who stuck to the old
terms of service were precluded from getting pay increases, which was a
restriction on them&#151;with a power to allow outside intervention
against anybody who breaks surface and becomes publicly concerned, and
about whom there is some kind of agitation.</div>
					<a name="07061443000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see the case for the
proposed powers in respect of financial abuses, which it is difficult
for governing bodies to control and which have certainly arisen.
Although I am glad that colleges now work in a much freer atmosphere,
financial fiddles are always possible and must be controlled, so the
LSC needs a power to intervene to deal with them. However, I cannot see
why we need such powers in respect of the courses that colleges provide
or the people they employ. That is a threat too far.</div>

the torrential rain in Harlow last night and the fact that my house had

fancy that was not justified by the substance of our proposals. He
talked about hostility in the further education sector in respect of
our original proposals; given what actually took place, that was
unjustified. We rightly stated our desire to retain a power of
intervention, and there was then a reasoned debate with colleges and
representative bodies that expressed concerns on the issue. We reached
a conclusion with which the Association of Colleges, the body that
represents FE colleges, is extremely satisfied, so I am struggling to
understand why it does not satisfy the official Opposition.</div>
					<a name="07061443000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We are right
to maintain that, in extreme circumstances and when all else has
failed, we need powers of intervention. Let me be clear, however, and
reiterate what I said at the beginning of the process: our strong

Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): Among the measures that will
be implemented before extreme action is taken, does the Minister
include sharing best practice with successful further and higher
education colleges? A successful one in my constituency, Havering
college, has a strong head and a stable governing body. It is
over-subscribed and has innovative courses; I am sure that it would be
only too pleased to share that good practice with an underperforming

four-stage process, there will usually be a period of about 12 months
for the college to improve following a notice to improve. It will be
down to the Learning and Skills Council, with the Quality Improvement
Agency and perhaps neighbouring colleges, to provide the support to
help the college and the governing body to tackle underperformance. The
proposals are not directed at trying to ensure that colleges fail; they
are crafted to ensure that the college takes responsibility for
tackling the problem itself. In addition, as the hon. Lady eloquently
set out, we will do everything in our power to ensure that others can
come in and support that
process.</div>

improvement, there are any number of bodies, ranging from the LSC to

I respond to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Great
Grimsby. The contention of the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings, who is leading for the Opposition, is that the powers are not
necessary in any circumstances and that, in every eventuality, we
should trust the college and the college governing body to tackle such
problems. I think back to the experience in the late 1980s and early
1990s, immediately after incorporation. If the Government had had these
powers for intervention in extremis, there would not have been the kind
of problems and abuses that existed at that stage. For the record, the
Conservative party was in power then and responsible for such
issues.</div>
					<a name="07061443000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Gentleman said that the existing powers have not been used. I have
no problem with that. In fact, I hope that the new powers will not be
used. They are powers to deter and to ensure that the governing body
and the college take responsibility for their
actions.</div>
					<a name="07061443000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat that
we have had an important and reasoned debate. The Government have
responded to concerns that have been expressed, and we have managed to
satisfy the Association of Colleges, which has written to me explicitly
supporting our proposals. In those circumstances, I do not understand
why the Opposition cannot support our position, unless they are in the
business of opposition for opposition&#146;s
sake.</div>
					<a name="07061443000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Brent, East asked whether it was right that the Learning and Skills
Council should have responsibility for such matters given that there is
a policy thrust towards self-regulation. It is certainly the case that
the proposals that Sir George Sweeney made for
self-regulation&#151;proposals that I asked him to put
forward&#151;envisage circumstances in which colleges take greater
collective responsibility for self-policing, for want of a better
phrase. That would be good and healthy. Just as I want individual
governing bodies to take responsibility for dealing with poor
performance, I would regard it as a healthy development if colleges
collectively could take on that responsibility.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>
					<a name="07061443000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, we
would still want to have the longstop power, in extremis, if a college
governing body, the Association of Colleges collectively or whoever
else has not dealt with an issue. Because of our responsibilities for
the public purse and the public interest and, most importantly, to the
learners who are affected, we would want longstop powers in
extremis.</div>

not all the funding is channelled through the Learning and Skills

moving towards&#151;we envisage most of the funding going through the
demand-led process&#151;there would still be a relationship with the
Learning and Skills Council. Funding would still come from the council.
If it will not have the ultimate power of intervention, and if we want
to protect the public purse and the public interest, who will take on
the
responsibility?</div>

Rammell:
						</b> From a sedentary position comes the cry,
&#147;The Secretary of State.&#148; It is clear that through these
processes the Secretary of State has the power to direct the Learning
and Skills Council to tackle a problem of poor performance through
intervention. The Secretary of State also has the power to disagree and
stop the council from intervening. I believe that that provides the
public accountability reassurance requested by the colleges and by
Opposition
Members.</div>
					<a name="07061443000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
referred to subsection (9) and spoke about employment law and the
responsibilities of the Learning and Skills Council. The proposals that
we have put forward make it explicitly clear that, under employment
law, the governing body is responsible for the situation. The
council&#146;s responsibility is to identify poor performance, and,
if it has concerns about the conduct of a senior post-holder, to direct
the governing body to consider a dismissal procedure. However, under
contracts and employment law, the responsibility would reside with the
governing body.</div>
					<a name="07061443000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby made several points. I shall
deal directly with his concerns because I know that he has a
long-standing interest in further education and adult education
funding. This Government have not cut funding for the further education
sector. We have increased funding in real terms by 50 per cent. during
the past 10 years. What we are rightly doing is shifting priorities.
Skills for life provision for people who have literacy and numeracy
problems has to be a priority. In addition, the roll-out of the train
to gain programme makes the incredibly radical commitment that, for the
first time in this country, if an adult in the workplace does not have
their first full level 2 qualification&#151;the equivalent of five
GCSEs&#151;the state has a responsibility and duty to step in and
ensure the relevant provision is provided. That is what we are doing
and where we are prioritising funding. I acknowledge that because we
are doing that much more, even with the increased funding in those
priorities areas, there is relatively less money available than there
has been for non-vocational education.</div>

					<a name="07061443000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not saying that those types of courses are not valuable; they are
incredibly valuable. However, in those circumstances and given that
there has to be a limit to how much money the Government can give, we
must ask the individual to contribute more. We need to shift the
culture of learning in this country so that individuals make that
commitment voluntarily. My hon. Friend referred to older learners. Even
with the changes that we have made, on the last available figures we
have double the number of over-60s studying at further education
colleges compared with 10 years ago. I hope that gives him some
reassurance.</div>
					<a name="07061443000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
in response to my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns about the threat to
academic freedom, I genuinely do not support the view that this
proposal is a threat to academic freedom. The powers will prevail in
tightly constrained circumstances and most certainly will not apply
when a lecturer complains about expenditure by a college governing body
or a principal.</div>

							<b class="B">Ms
Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): As the
student of the lecturer to which my hon. Friend the Member for Great
Grimsby referred, the situation that he mentioned was one that I
referred to on Second Reading. Having the Learning and Skills Council
in place would have been helpful then&#151;it was pre-incorporation
at that time&#151;because the governing body of the college
completely and utterly failed to deal with the situation. In fact, it
removed the lecturer and supported college management. If a body over
and above the governing body had existed to which that situation could
have been referred and to which the inquiry that was recommended by the
governing body could have been referred, the necessary action could
perhaps have been
taken.</div>

levels. The framework for excellence that is in development will, over
time, provide a more coherent and simpler framework by which the
performance of a further education college can be
judged.</div>

However, I am still not clear about exactly what will constitute
&#147;significantly less well&#148; than would be expected in the

to consult on that. Within that framework what constitutes poor
performance is clear. We will undoubtedly listen to concerns about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>
						degree to which we have got that right and will
ensure that the draft intervention strategy addresses those issues. As
I said earlier, that will ultimately be placed before the House. It
will be crystal clear in what circumstances poor performance will be
tackled.</div>
					<a name="07061443000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
an important debate. This issue and the matter of foundation degree
awarding powers have been the two most contentious elements of the
Bill. Any reasonable person would conclude that the Government have
listened and responded, and that they have given reassurance as to the
manner in which the powers will be used. We have to retain the right to
intervene in extremis&#151;in exceptional circumstances in which a
governing body has not dealt with a major, fundamental concern. The
Association of Colleges says clearly and explicitly that we have
listened and got it right, and have found an acceptable way forward. If
the measure is acceptable to the AOC, I hope that it will be acceptable
to Opposition parties.</div>

						</b> The Minister has been dancing, albeit elegantly, on
the head of his pin. Section 57 of Further and Higher Education Act
1992 gives explicit powers in extreme circumstances to the Government,
through the Secretary of State, to intervene in a college in the way
that he has described. We have heard from the Minister that that is a
power that he never expects to use; that it is a deterrent, not a
threat. We have also heard that the LSC could be told by the Secretary
of State that it is not allowed to use the power in particular
circumstances. The power is not only unnecessary; it is not worthy to
be a part of the Bill. I think that we should test the mood of the

today about bodies that have relationships with FE colleges in all
kinds of ways&#151;inspecting, funding, monitoring, planning, setting
standards and helping them to improve. They were highlighted by Sir
Andrew Foster, whose report into these matters revealed that there were
no fewer than 17 such bodies. Since his report, one has gone
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>
						another has been added, so there are still 17. He
described that as &#147;a galaxy&#148; of oversight, inspection and
accreditation, and argued that they needed to be rationalised,
co-ordinated and focused. He went on to say that the inspection regime
of FE colleges could be lightened by rationalising the process and
moving to a system under which colleges regulated themselves to a much
greater extent. He argued for deregulation&#151;self-regulation, I

lighter-touch regulation&#151;self-regulation&#151;that Andrew
Foster recommended and which we support.</div>
					<a name="07061443000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that colleges can do
more. We think that there is untapped capacity in FE. We celebrate the

inhibited from exercising their skills; they feel restricted by
bureaucracy and burdened by over-regulation.</div>

the standards unit of the DFES, sector skills councils, regional

between them. Not only is there duplication, but the feeling among FE
colleges&#151;the hon. Lady, with her immense experience in these
matters must have encountered it as much as I have&#151;is that they
are forced endlessly to jump through hoops, sometimes the same hoops by
different people, and sometimes for an uncertain purpose.</div>
					<a name="07061443000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">How often have members of the
Committee met FE college principals and senior managers who say that
they spend a great deal of their time collecting or collating data, but
are not sure why? I suspect that any commercial organisation&#151;and
I have no dogmatic reverence for the commercial sector&#151;looking
at the matter would want to rationalise the process in the way that
Andrew Foster recommended. That is not my analysis; it is his. It is
not my report; it is the report that resulted from the Government
asking an independent person to consider those matters. The hon. Lady
is a perfectly reasonable member of the Committee and of this House,
but we might, through this new clause, ask for a report back to
Parliament on what the impact of all of this is on the daily life of
colleges.</div>

								Dr.
Blackman-Woods:
						</b> The general point about making an
efficient regulation system is a good one. What I was not clear about
was what specifically the hon. Gentleman would suggest should be taken
out of the current system of regulation, and which of those bodies that
he identified should be taken out of the FE
sector.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061443000247"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Government took the view that the adult
learning inspectorate should go. That was just after the adult learning
inspectorate was damning about the Government. In its final report, the
inspectorate was critical of the Government&#146;s record on skills.
I do not want to be too prescriptive about that. Far be it for me to
describe in detail precisely which of the requirements on colleges is
most burdensome. However, if we move to self-regulation, that means by
definition reducing some of the burden of regulation on others. If we
are going to let FE grow up, we must be adult about that
process.</div>

							<a name="07061443000248"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> I shall make this point, which will save me from
making a speech, and help to speed up the Committee. I have great
sympathy with the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. In response
to the point made by the hon. Member for City of Durham, given that the
report was commissioned by the Government, is it not for the Government
to respond to the recommendations of Sir Andrew Foster&#146;s report?
I do not see any need to put the matter on the face of the Bill, but
the hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I would like to see the Minister
make regular statements to the House about progress on the
rationalisation of those
bodies.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061443000249"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I fear that the relationship between the official
Opposition and the Liberals is becoming too close. I am becoming
worried that every time the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>Lady rises, I agree with her. There is a moving together of the
Opposition parties, at least on the subject of further education.
However, that might not feature during the course of the Bill, so I
will not offer a hostage to fortune. She is right, of course; it is not
up to me to list which bodies would go and what form the new regime
would take after regulation, as the hon. Member for City of Durham
knows.</div>
					<a name="07061443000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, what
is absolutely clear is that since Foster, the burden of regulation has
not altered significantly. We still have a large number of bodies, and
regular reports of duplication and repetition from colleges. We do not
have a blueprint for self-regulation of the kind that I want to see. I
am disappointed that the Bill does not do more in that regard. That is
one of the reasons that I was initially so hostile to the part of the
Bill that we have just debated. I accept that the Minister has
mitigated, to a considerable degree, that part of the Bill, but it is a
bit rich, in a world that gives FE colleges more responsibility, to
have a Bill which at least in one important respect gives more power to
those who have oversight of
them.</div>

come at the end of the report rather than at the

consider what I described as independent and empirical evidence. We are
asking in the new clause for a proper analysis of this. We do not claim
that we have all the answers but we know the direction in which we wish
to travel. My hon. Friend is quite right. Once we have that report
there should be a debate about how we move forward on its results. I am
more confident about the capacity of FE than some others may be. I have
more belief in the leaders and teachers in
FE.</div>

							<a name="07061443000252"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Phil
Hope):
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has made some sweeping
statements about how he wants to remove bureaucracy, but rather
dishonestly from my point of view, he has refused to say exactly what
that would entail. I have just received, regrettably, a copy of the
submission to the shadow Cabinet from the Conservative economic
competitiveness policy group, &#147;Skills Training for a More
Competitive Economy&#148;. It makes no mention of any of the changes
that he suggests need to be made, but
states:</div>
					<a name="07061443000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the flow of
funds should be from the DfES to the trainee&#146;s local authority,
and from the local authority, on behalf of an individual trainee, to a
training
provider&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061443000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
hon. Gentleman would like to explain how the system he suggests would
work in a way that reduces bureaucracy on further education
colleges.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061443000253"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> It would be quite wrong for me to speak on behalf
of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr.
Redwood) about the report that he published. Indeed, its relevance to
the clause is pretty thin, given that it is not about FE college
management or FE college regulation. What I can say with confidence
about that report is that it is absolutely right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>
						in wanting to slim down the funding and management
process in FE. It is absolutely right in its analysis of the paucity of
the Government&#146;s policy in respect of driving up
skills.</div>
					<a name="07061443000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary, who is a diligent Minister and a good Member of this
House, must regard the figures for apprenticeship enrolments&#151;his
own Government&#146;s figures&#151;with a certain degree of shame.
Now that he has read that first report, perhaps he will take the
trouble to read the report that I published today on that subject. It
shows not only that the number of people who are not in education,
employment or training has grown by 15 per cent. since the Government
came to
office&#151;</div>

							<a name="07061443000254"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. We are having a battle of reports, and it
is going rather wide of the new clause. After that little political
knockabout, I should be grateful if we could get back to the
subject.</div>
					
					<a name="07061443000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061443000255"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Under-Secretary was tempting me down the road
of exchanging claims about the Government&#146;s record on skills.
You are right, Mr. Atkinson. If we are to deal with the
problem of NEETs, those young people whose lives have been blighted and
whose dreams have been shattered, we need an FE system that is fit for
purpose. That means an FE system that is confident, forward looking and
highly focused. That would be best served in an atmosphere of
self-regulation where the bureaucracy that surrounds FE was reduced.
That is not my consideration. That is the consideration of most of the
college principals I speak to and certainly it is the thrust of Sir
Andrew Foster&#146;s
report.</div>
					<a name="07061443000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">To that end,
our new clause 7 suggests that we look at those matters closely and
that that examination be reported back to this House so that Members
can make a judgment on how we move forward in that endeavour. I think
that that is uncontentious and in line with Sir Andrew
Foster&#146;s considerations and, indeed, with the stated opinions of
Ministers, who have said that they want greater self-regulation in
colleges. I find it hard to believe that the Minister does not want
that kind of empirical analysis, and impossible to conceive that he
does not want that information reported back to the House. I look
forward eagerly to him embracing the new clause as a helpful and
positive addition tothe
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061443000256"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I might have to disappoint the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings. He started by making an incorrect
assertion; he said that Sir Andrew Foster&#146;s very good report
talked about 17 inspection and oversight bodies, and that one
has been added and one taken away. That simply is not true. Two have
been taken away. To claim that there has been no substantive change is
completely at odds with the reality given that we have merged two
inspection bodies, which have a major impact on FE colleges, to reduce
their number from two to one.</div>
					<a name="07061443000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought that there was a very
interesting interchange, involving my hon. Friend, the Under-Secretary,
about the report produced by the right hon. Member for Wokingham. I
will take your counsel, Mr. Atkinson&#151;all I would say
is that, in the last two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>years, I have not met one FE college principal who has urged me to give
funding responsibilities back to local authorities. If the hon.
Gentleman believes that there is support for such a proposition,
perhaps he can bring it
forward.</div>
					<a name="07061443000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the matters before us, I agree very much that the operational
efficiency and effectiveness of all organisations involved in FE and
training is vital. As we said, in our further education White Paper, we
are committed to looking at the scope for further simplification, and
all elements of the learning and skills landscape are kept under
review. We are committed to continuing to seek further
efficiencies.</div>
					<a name="07061443000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman referred to Sir Andrew Foster&#146;s report, which drew
attention to the number of bodies. As I said earlier, we have since
merged Ofsted and ALI so that now only one body inspects FE
institutions, rather than two. We have also removed the Learning and
Skills Development Agency. Also, as Foster suggested, roles have been
clarified, as we described in last year&#146;s &#147;Further
Education&#148; White Paper, which was the right response to Sir
Andrew Foster&#146;s report. The remaining bodies have clear and
distinct roles and responsibilities, and although we expect partners to
work together, I do not believe that their activities
overlap.</div>
					<a name="07061443000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Gentleman has failed to recognise how the landscape continues to
change as part of our ongoing reform agenda. The 17 bodies that Foster
discussed are organisations with monitoring, inspection, improvement
and standard-setting roles, which clearly are very important. Foster
set them out as three groups: inspectorates, of which there were three,
monitoring bodies, of which there were six, and those that help the
sector improve and thus bring greater success to learners, of which
there were eight. We have streamlined the first group already so that
there is Ofsted for FE and the QAA for HE. We have spoken about
foundation degrees already and about maintaining the role for the QAA,
which is of paramount importance. In that debate, I did not hear calls
from the Opposition to do away with the QAA or to merge its role;
indeed, there was an insistence on the importance of that role.
However, on this part of the Bill, the Opposition, looking for some
cheap shots, argue
differently.</div>
					<a name="07061443000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second group includes local authorities, regional development agencies
and sector skills councils. Again, on Tuesday, the hon. Gentleman
pointed out the importance to the learning and skills system of those
bodies, and there was explicit and strong support from the Opposition
for the sector skills councils. However, again, in this part of the
debate, a different tune is played. It is also important that we are
clear that those bodies are far more partners, bringing influence to
bear, than bodies set up to regulate individual providers. We have
already debated their importance and their role in delivering
appropriate choice for young people and demand-led provision to meet
the skills challenge. I know that the hon. Gentleman agrees with
that.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07061443000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
third group reflects our commitment to drive up standards and the
importance of providing both expertise and support to the sector as a
whole, as part of the wider reform agenda. But that group, too, has
been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>streamlined; the DFES standards unit no longer exists in a separate form
and the QIA has been established to simplify and support quality
improvement across the sector.</div>
					<a name="07061443000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we consider the matter in
the abstract, it is possible to call simplistically for further
rationalisation. On one level that is attractive but, when we begin
seriously to examine the detail, we often reach different conclusions.
I shall give an example of that. I considered, and asked officials to
consider, the possibility of merging the Learning and Skills Council
and HEFCE, and I concluded that, were we to go down that route, we
would create the largest funding and commissioning body outside the
former Soviet Union. Given that, I do not think that it would be a
sensible move to make. With respect, some of the calls for
simplification are driven from a simplistic
basis.</div>
					<a name="07061443000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are making
changes and bringing about further rationalisation&#151;that is not
rhetoric. We are also working with the further education system as the
proposals for self-regulation are developed. We as a Government, I as
the responsible Minister, and the Secretary of State asked the further
education body to come up with those proposals. Sir George Sweeney, as
the chair of the self-regulation steering group, is working and
consulting on self-regulation plans&#151;work rightly being done by
the sector, for the sector. We are also putting forward new freedoms
for highly performing colleges, including action to develop collective
sector ownership of quality improvement, including identifying and
managing poor performance. I am confident that, if and when Sir George
makes other proposals for any of the relevant bodies, they will be
actioned where
appropriate.</div>
					
					<a name="07061443000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061443000257"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Will the Minister let the Committee know whether
that analysis includes a measurement of the impact of bureaucracy on
colleges, whether he has had an interim report on that and when he
expects George Sweeney&#146;s work to be reported back to Parliament
so that Members of the House can play a role in debating and
considering the
issues?</div>

							<a name="07061443000258"></a>
								Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I hope that it will report back within a
relatively short period, to Ministers and then to the House. There is
also a bureaucracy reduction group, which is making significant
progress. As an example of that, the number of documents sent out by
the Learning and Skills Council to colleges between January and March
this year was 60 per cent. lower than in the same three months last
year. It is a simply unsustainable contention that progress is not
being made.</div>
					<a name="07061443000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about annual reports. I genuinely do
not believe that the new clause is necessary, as robust mechanisms
already exist to hold both Ofsted and the LSC to account for how they
discharge their responsibilities. Both have a statutory duty to publish
annual reports and for the reports to be laid before Parliament. The
LSC must ensure that is makes the best use of its resources when
carrying out its duties, and the chief inspector of Ofsted must perform
all his functions efficiently and effectively.</div>
					<a name="07061443000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament also recently
established new governance arrangements in the form of a statutory
board for Ofsted to hold the chief inspector to account for its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>work. The bureaucracy reduction group, to which I referred a moment ago,
produces an annual report on the progress of our large non-departmental
bodies. Important progress is being made and accountability structures
and reporting mechanisms are in place. That should provide the
reassurance that the hon. Gentleman is looking
for.</div>
					<a name="07061443000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as that,
we said on Tuesday that we would return to the matter of efficiency
savings. I want to set the record straight: the creation of the
Learning and Skills Council was a significant step forward for the
further education sector. We would not have had such a degree of
progress in improving performance were it not for the work that the LSC
has undertaken. It brought much-needed coherence to post-16 learning,
with year-on-year improvements in performance, and it makes more than
&#163;50 million of year-on-year savings compared with its
predecessor bodies, which existed when the Conservative party was last
in government, when more money was spent on bureaucracy and
administration than today. We therefore know that we have saved the
equivalent of &#163;50 million a year by merging the TECs and the
Further Education Funding Council. Since 2001-02, the percentage of
total LSC expenditure spent on administration has gone down from 4.6 to
1.9 per cent. That clearly represents the ongoing commitment of both
the Government and the council to ensure that as much funding as
possible gets to the front line of
FE.</div>
					<a name="07061443000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
theme 7 restructuring will save a further &#163;40 million a
year&#151;savings that are already being redirected to the front
line. We have always made it clear that that is the same &#163;40
million that has been mentioned frequently during the Bill&#146;s
passage through this House and the other place. The &#163;40 million
is a combination of the statutory and non-statutory changes dealt with
in &#147;Agenda for Change&#148; theme 7 and the measures in this
Bill. I am talking about the abolition of 47 local learning and skills
councils, the creation of a regional structure, non-statutory local
partnership teams and a slimmer national office, facilitating
reductions of 1,100 staff and 600
non-executives.</div>
					
					<a name="07061443000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061443000259"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> It is important that the Minister has clarified
that, because there was doubt on Second Reading and during earlier
discussions in Committee. I want it to be crystal clear. The
Minister has now said that the &#163;40 million is the
&#163;40 million is the&#163;40 million&#151;there is no
additional &#163;40 million. Is that the &#163;40 million reported
in the 2006 annual
report?</div>
					
					<a name="07061443000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061443000260"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I have made this point on numerous occasions. The
&#163;40 million refers to both the theme 7 restructuring and the
changes included and anticipated within this Bill. If the hon.
Gentleman is in any doubt about that, I urge him to talk to the
Learning and Skills Council staff, who have gone through a very
difficult restructuring process, in which 1,100 posts have been removed
from the system. That, plus associated reductions in administration and
rationalisation of premises, results in the &#163;40 million savings,
so the cumulative administrative savings since 2001 come to &#163;500
million, which rightly has been realigned to support learners and
students. We will also continue to expect efficiency gains
each year in order to put more money back into front-line provision.
The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>Government are asking all non-departmental public bodies to reduce their
administrative costs by 5 per cent. each
year.</div>
					<a name="07061443000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						All
that is in stark contrast to the erroneous picture that the Opposition
painted on Second Reading. All of it falls dramatically short of the
&#163;1.8 billion that the Conservative party erroneously claimed was
the figure for LSC administration and bureaucracy. There was clearly an
organised operation on Second Reading. Three or four Conservative MPs
cited that figure in, in my view, a deliberate attempt to misrepresent
the situation. The actual amount that is being spent on administration
and bureaucracy, having been reduced significantly, is &#163;220
million. To exaggerate the sum for administration and bureaucracy
ninefold is a bit rich, even by the Opposition&#146;s standards of
dodgy
accounting.</div>
					<a name="07061443000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
understand&#151;I have done some work on this&#151;that the figure
that the Conservatives reached was established by including the sums
spent in 2005-06 on learner participation, learner support, local
intervention and development, capital and other programmes. If the
Conservative party is really saying that, for example, education
maintenance allowances, which have brought 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>about an unprecedented step change in participation at the age of 16,
amount to bureaucracy and administration, it needs to talk to the young
people who, at the age of 16, are receiving such significant
support.</div>
