<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> We come now to the part of the Bill that deals with Scotland. Many of the points of principle relating to clauses 19 and 20 are the same as those which we discussed during our debates on clauses 2 and 3. I shall not try the patience of hon. Members by rehearsing the arguments that were advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) In our earlier debates [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."	] I see that I have assent from Labour Members for that.
<P>
However, there are some points that relate only to Scotland; some provisions have a slightly different application in Scotland from their application in England and Wales. As a point of principle, it is important to consider Scottish criminal law separately, as we are doing in the Committee. It is a separate body of law that matter is often not appreciated throughout the United Kingdom. It is not merely that there is different terminology: it is not always possible to draw a parallel between the meaning of a particular word in English law and a similar word in Scots law. There is a different legal system. That is why these clauses should be considered separately.
<P>
The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office, the hon. Member for Central Fife(Mr. McLeish) has now joined us in Committee. Hewill be aware that my colleagues and I have argued many times during recent months that this Parliament is the proper place to consider criminal law 
<P>
<B>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish):</B> It used to be.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> The Minister says that it used to be, but this Parliament is still the fit and proper place to pass laws for the whole United Kingdom. If it were not, we would not be here this afternoon. My argument is valid, however, only if Scottish law is given the place that it deserves given its unique nature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): I shall listen with great interest to the debates on Scotland. However, does my hon. Friend know whether the House of Commons will make criminal law for Scotland in the years to come or will such law be made by a Scottish Assembly? I do not know the answer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that that has anything to do with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I did not know what we were talking about.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should read the Scotland Bill, which has just passed through the House.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. It is not clear which matters are reserved for this Parliament. I shall not go into that subject now, however. I am sure that I would be ruled out of order and that the Minister has answered such questions so many times on the Floor of the House that he could hardly bear to do so once again.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): Given the hon. Lady's belief that the House is the proper place to discuss Scottish law, does she not think that it would be more appropriate for Scotland to have a separate Bill so that more than just one or two hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies could discuss it in detail?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We really need to speak to the amendments. Otherwise, we will not get anywhere very fast.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) has made the point to which I was coming. I agree with the Government's strategy of putting the clauses relating to Scotland in the same Bill as the clauses relating to England and Wales. That is the correct approach. It is sensible, however, for the Committee to discuss all the Scottish clauses together. That will give coherence to the debate.
<P>
The Committee has been joined by the Scottish Office Minister for the debate on these clauses. However, I agree with the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine that it is a great pity that not one Labour Member representing a Scottish constituency is on the Benches behind him. [Interruption.] Before the Minister makes the perfectly reasonable point that no Conservative Members represent a Scottish seat, I must tell him that I am a member of the Law Society of Scotland.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> The hon. Lady is not an expert, but an export.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I do not claim to be an expert; I claim merely to have a degree in Scots law. I have not practised for many years.
<P>
Although Labour Members will not agree, hon. Members from throughout the United Kingdom are competent to make laws for any part of it. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine will join me in forgiving the Government for not having any Labour Members representing Scottish constituencies on their Back Benches. However, I am glad that the hon. Gentleman noted that fact.
<P>
There are differences between the criminal law in Scotland and the criminal law in England and Wales, so it is right that we should consider the clauses separately. I am pleased that the clauses relating to Scotland have been drafted differently and in a way that is in keeping with Scottish criminal law.
<P>
In Scotland, the anti-social behaviour covered by clause 19 is normally dealt with under the common law crime of breach of the peace. Matters are handled very differently in England and Wales. That underlies the amendments that we have tabled. How will the order operate alongside existing law? How will the common law breach of the peace remedy fit in with the anti-social behaviour orders?
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 146, which must be considered in relation to amendment No. 116. Amendment No. 146 would change the age at which an anti-social order can be imposed from 16 to 12. Amendment No. 116 would give sheriffs the power to make orders against parents whose children are subject to anti-social orders.
<P>
We discussed the age limit of 10 some weeks ago when we debated the general rule of doli incapax in relation to clauses 2 and 3. We suggest that 12 is the correct age because children of 10 are very young. Children of 12, however, are adolescents. Anti-social orders should not apply only to people who are over 16.
<P>
In Scotland, children are dealt with by children's panels. That is the significant difference between the application of clause 19 and of clause 2. Children's panels are not a creature of the English and Welsh legal systems. They are peculiar to Scotland where, I understand, they operate rather well.
<P>
I do not wish to suggest that the system of children's panels should be altered. However, many of the serious anti-social problems dealt with by the authorities concern the activities of teenagers mostly boys, but girls as well, unfortunately between the ages of 12 and 16.
<P>
It is nonsense that children under 14 should be protected by, for example, not having their names disclosed in the press when society has no protection against them. There is no justification for children between 12 and 16 being the subject of children's panel hearings, and yet not coming within the scope of the fairly revolutionary proposal in the Bill.
<P>
The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office has experience of such matters in his capacity as a Member of Parliament. In 1994, a well-known case was considered in Kirkcaldy sheriff court involving the Graham family, which went through a long court procedure more than three weeks because of the terrorising behaviour it had inflicted on its neighbours.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I understand that the Minister, as the local Member of Parliament, gave evidence about that family's behaviour to the court, so I trust that when he replies he can enlighten us more effectively than anyone else has been able to during the passage of the Bill so far about the practical effects that the imposition of an anti-social behaviour order would have as an alternative to going through the traditional, long, drawn-out, expensive and bureaucratic court procedure.
<P>
Since our consideration of the Bill began, I have felt that the advantage of the anti-social behaviour order is that it is neater, simpler, more easily imposed and can give quicker, more effective protection to the local community against a family causing harm and distress in the neighbourhood. There can be no justification for limiting anti-social behaviour orders to people over 16. That does not make sense because it would involve our protecting young adults between 12 and 16 while failing to provide due protection to the rest of the community against such people.
<P>
As I said in debates on other clauses, when courts deal with culprits just over 10 or those who have just reached their 12th birthday, I accept that they and the authorities and society are dealing with children. However, courts dealing with those over the age of 15 or nearing their 16th birthday are effectively dealing with adults. Where we should draw the line has already been debated at length. It is difficult, but drawing the line at 16 is too high; drawing it at 10 is probably too low; at 12 is just about right and would secure the right balance between protecting children and protecting society from young adults. That is the main argument underlying amendment No. 146.
<P>
Amendment No. 116 would give the sheriff the power to make an order
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"against the parents, guardian or other adult with whom the person habitually resides"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when an order has been directed against a person under 16. The purpose of the amendment is simple and practical: it is to involve the parents or other responsible family members. When someone under the age of 16 has taken part in actions or behaviour that the police, local authority, social services department or, indeed, neighbours or others in the community regard as serious, there is almost certainly a background to the trouble.
<P>
We are considering remedies to put matters right, not just punishment. We want children or young adults who have gone slightly off the rails to be put back on the rails by the warning provisions of an anti-social behaviour order. It is only right that the adults who play such a large part in the young person's life should also be involved. If those adults were to be involved only vaguely or casually in the imposition of the anti-social behaviour order it would not work. They should bear some legal responsibility as they would, if the sheriff saw fit, under amendment No. 116 for the behaviour of the child or young person living with them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): My understanding of the children's panel system in Scotland is that it already does much as the hon. Lady describes. Does she agree that, if anti-social behaviour orders are not extended below the age of 16, the adults connected with youngsters who engage in the relevant behaviour will anyway be involved when they go before the children's panel?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I see the logic of what the hon. Gentleman says. As I said earlier, I appreciate the way in which the children's panel works in Scotland rather differently from the rest of the United Kingdom, and successfully, because of the unusual arrangements, in which other family members are involved. However, I still argue that all that the children's hearings can do is impose supervision requirements, whether in the home or elsewhere, whereas the anti-social behaviour order is a hybrid creature between civil and criminal proceedings. It constitutes a warning more serious than the children's panel can give, but does not lead to a criminal record. While going further than the children's panel can, it falls short of the ordinary criminal procedure in the sheriff court.
<P>
The clever thing about anti-social behaviour orders is the serious, properly imposed warning that they give. That could bring a young person, and the family involved, back on the rails of good behaviour before the behaviour deteriorated to the point of criminality.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> As the hon. Lady said, the orders are a halfway house between civil and criminal measures. However, the consequences of a breach are very much criminal. Does the hon. lady forsee any consequences of the coming into force of clause 22 if the relevant age were reduced from 16?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point if he means that breach of an anti-social behaviour order would lead to criminal prosecution. I assume that the authorities which brought the prosecution would either, on judging the breach not to be too serious, refer it to the children's panel in the normal way for dealing with a person under the age of 16 under the criminal law in Scotland; or, on judging it and the pattern of behaviour of which it was part to be serious, apply to the Lord Advocate to bring a normal criminal prosecution in the sheriff court.
<P>
Amendment No. 116 would not detract in any way from existing powers, but would add powers to make it simpler to take action against people aged between 12 and 16, to protect the rest of the community. It is sad that we must do that, but everyone who has paid attention to such matters recognises that a great many petty crimes and disturbances now are caused by young adults between the ages of 12 and 16. It is for precisely that reason that we have tabled amendments Nos. 146 and 116 and I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Before I start I should like to welcome the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office, to our proceedings and to congratulate him on his recent marriage.
<P>
One of the benefits of being in Committee is that we can make cross-references to debates on similar clauses. The tenor of our earlier debate on this subject was the desire to avoid sucking juveniles into the system. The Committee sought assurances from the Minister that there would be minimal intervention in that regard. The age limit in the clause provides a more cast-iron assurance.I am therefore slightly confused about what is happening.
<P>
My major concern is how we handle youth justice overall. It should be part of a major review of the whole criminal system. That would be something for the Scottish Parliament to deal with. It worries me that as a consequence of the amendment, a 12-year-old could face six months' imprisonment on conviction. I wait to hear what the Minister has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am glad to be able to say a word or two about the amendment. I recall our earlier debates about anti-social behaviour orders in relation to England and Wales. The current debate is most intriguing because of the differences as well as the similarities between the two clauses. The amendment deals with the age of the person concerned. The clause relating to England and Wales dealt with persons aged 10 or over, which caused a degree of discussion and almost disagreement in the Committee. Some of us felt that having someone of 10 who breaches an order face severe consequences was not entirely satisfactory and was not the way to deal with 10 or 11-year-olds.
<P>
Now we are faced with a similar clause for Scotland that applies to children over 16. I assume that the reason for the age difference is because children of 10 to 14 are dealt with by a different method in Scotland. That is perhaps all to the good, but it is worth recalling that some of the thinking around the earlier clause originated from the fact that on housing estates and elsewhere children as young as that were the principal troublemakers or potentially big troublemakers.
<P>
The Government seemed to want to target that age group. Whether that is right or wrong is another question. We had quite a long debate about diversion; nevertheless, it was thought important to look at that age group. We agreed that many of the problems were caused by the youngsters who were around at night. Much of the purpose of an anti-social behaviour order for England and Wales was to go for the younger age group, but those youngsters have to be over 16 in Scotland. There is a case for greater consistency. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain what happens in Scotland to youngsters who behave in an anti-social way. There should be even-handedness in the treatment as between England and Scotland.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Would current Scots law make the amendment's proposal to reduce the age from 16 to 12 impossible to implement? It would be useful to explore the position in Scotland. Is there any point in the clause, given that clause 2, which covers England, applies to an age group that cannot be covered in Scotland by the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I am delighted to be here. My throat is weary after 11 days of discussing the Scotland Bill on the Floor of the House. The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) will understand that.
<P>
I thank you, Mrs. Michie, and members of the Committee, for agreeing to consider the provisions for Scotland at the end of our proceedings, and for giving us an opportunity to complete our consideration of the Scotland Bill. I was immensely encouraged to see the hon. Member for Epping Forest wearing Scotland blue and Mackintosh jewellery. I hope that her outfit is not only for today, but for the big game next Wednesday. I did a stint with Brazilian television this morning, and I did not mention England, but I praised the qualities of Brazil. Perhaps we will cause an upset next Wednesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough) rose 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I shall move on quickly to the substance of the vital amendments that we are considering.
<P>
Members of the Committee have asked why the anti-social behaviour orders cannot be applied to 12-year-olds in Scotland. There is little difference of substance between the two sides of the Committee. We are considering a matter of jurisdiction and existing law. As the hon. Member for Epping Forest said, I have had personal experience of a family from hell. I shall not describe it again, because time is short. All the family, including 10, 11 and 12-year-olds, were involved in anti-social activities. That is no different from what can happen in England and Wales. However, we are keen to preserve the integrity of the children's hearing system in Scotland.
<P>
I do not underestimate the destruction and distress that children under 16 can cause in communities. That view unites the Committee. I have personal experience of such destruction. We are considering not only children but parents. The Bill applies a family concept to the problem.
<P>
Scotland has a distinctive system of children's hearings. They are not a soft option. A wide variety of disposals is available to them. They range from secure accommodation to the proverbial warning the use of the discipline of the children's hearing as a punishment. I do not want to cut across the sheriffs to make anti-social behaviour orders against under-16s.
<P>
My colleagues stressed that they did not want juveniles to be the only target of anti-social behaviour orders in England and Wales. A child and his or her parents are required to attend a children's hearing. The hearings are conscious of the needs of the child. It is in the child's best interests to confront his anti-social behaviour and its impact on communities.
<P>
Hearings can require compulsory supervision of the child and attach a range of conditions to that. For example, a child may be prevented from having contact with specific individuals, or groups of individuals. That might be useful in helping the child to break associations with undesirable elements, especially members of a peer group who damage the interests of the youngster. If there was a breach of a supervision requirement, the hearing would review its original decision and would consider the case for additional conditions and stronger measures.
<P>
However, even if the Scottish orders applied to under-16-year-olds, it would not be appropriate for them to be extended to the parents of the relevant children. It is a fundamental principle of Scots law that the parent should not be held responsible for the actions of the child. That principle was considered in depth by the Kilbrandon Committee in its 1964 report on "Children and young persons in Scotland"	, which led to the children's hearing system and reaffirmed the principle. To serve an order on a parent because of the actions of a child, or to require the parent to ensure that a child complies with an anti-social behaviour order, would cut across that central principle.
<P>
I fully agree, however, that parents should be involved in decisions about their child and encouraged to support the child's future behaviour. The children's hearing system does that by addressing the child's problems in the family context. It also cements the family bond. I am sure that all hon. Members would support that in terms of family law and family policy. On far too many occasions, parents are not accountable for the activities of their children and the children are not responsible to their parents. That situation exists in our society, but the amendments would not help to remedy it in the Scottish context.
<P>
Under the children's hearing system, parents are encouraged to take part in the process of deciding what action should be taken in relation to their child, and are expected to support the child as he or she carries out the requirements of the hearing.
<P>
A point was made about the breach of the peace in Scotland. The anti-social behaviour order will allow us to deal with future behaviour. The breach of the peace deals with a criminal act. That is significant and I am sure that all members of the Committee will agree that in any community a breach of the peace is a serious matter. The breach of the peace remedy is inappropriate for swift action, specifically in allowing the police, councillors, councils and other agencies to act promptly. As the hon. Member for Epping Forest pointed out, that is why the anti-social behaviour order will be of such benefit in the situations that we are discussing.
<P>
The Government offer the firm reassurance that the children's hearing system will address issues that affect under 16-year-olds. The anti-social behaviour order is a new and valuable tool in the fight against disruptive and totally unacceptable behaviour. There is a separate jurisdiction in Scotland with separate laws. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine made the valid point that if we are to address the anti-social behaviour of under 16-year-olds, it should be in relation to the whole youth justice system. As he might be aware, that system is currently being reviewed.
<P>
I hope, that after hearing my comments, the hon. Member will withdraw the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I add the congratulations of Conservative Members to the Minister on his recent marriage. I thank the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine for reminding me to do so.
<P>
Amazingly, I find myself in agreement with the Minister's first few comments. I hope for the same result as he does when Scotland meet Brazil next week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will my hon. Friend refute the wicked suggestion made in some parts of England not Scotland that, in anticipation of the big match, it is not merely some elements of the Scottish population who need anti-social orders, but the whole Scottish population?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> That is an interesting observation, but I assure my hon. Friend that if the meeting between Scotland and Brazil produces the result that we all hope for, the whole population of Scotland will engage in extremely social behaviour. Let us hope so. At any rate, they will imagine that they are engaging in social behaviour. Furthermore, I am pleased that that match will not take place when the Committee is sitting.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister's statement that the children's hearings will continue to deal with young people between the ages of 12 and 16 who engage in offensive behaviour. I accept that the unique system of children's hearings already works differently in Scotland from the way in which the criminal law operates in England and Wales.
<P>
I also accept the Minister's assurance about parental responsibility for the criminal behaviour of children. Even if children's hearings do not impose responsibilities on parents, they involve parents in monitoring the behaviour of children under the age of 16. Given his assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 147, 148, 108, 424 and 118. They are practical and are designed to enhance the Bill. They would make it more reasonable and easier to apply.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 147 and 148 would add the word "intimidation"	 to the words "alarm or distress"	 in subsection (1)(a)(i) and (ii). Subparagraphs (i) and (ii) refer to behaviour.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that caused or was likely to cause alarm or distress"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be more appropriate to refer to alarm, distress or intimidation. If the provision is limited to only alarm or distress, that will narrow down the behaviour that will be covered.
<P>
Anti-social behaviour orders relate to behaviour that has an effect on the rest of the community. If people in the community feel intimidated, but not particularly alarmed or distressed, a local authority should have the right to apply for, and a sheriff should have the right to grant, an anti-social behaviour order. Intimidation is different form alarm or distress and it should be covered by the Bill. That would enhance the Bill by broadening the grounds under which an anti-social order could be granted.
<P>
Amendment No. 108 would change the definition of "persons"	 in subsection (1) (a). It refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"persons not of the same household as himself in the authority's area"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would also cover persons "of reasonable firmness"	. My hon, Friend the Minister for Hertsmere argued that point well when we discussed clause 2.I repeat that the Bill will be enhanced if it specifies that the person who has been upset by the order must be "of reasonable firmness"	.
<P>
It is unfair that orders should be served to protect people who are not reasonably firm. That implies that they are alarmed, distressed or intimidated as a consequence of their own nature, rather than as a consequence of the unreasonable behaviour of people against whom orders are brought. The addition of the words "of reasonable firmness"	 would merely tighten the clause.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 424 proposes to insert the words "distress or intimidation"	 after "alarm or distress"	 in clause 19(2). I have already dealt with that.
<P>
Amendment No. 118 is a practical amendment which would make subsection (4) simpler for sheriffs to interpret. The amendment would insert into the subsection the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"part of his quiet enjoyment of his home"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A person may behave in a way that is acceptable to neighbours who get upset only about truly unreasonable behaviour and should therefore be able to come to the court and explain that such behaviour is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"part of his quiet enjoyment of his home"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is intended to enhance the Bill's meaning.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 484 and I shall address some of the points raised in relation to other amendments.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that he has taken on board the assurances that were given on an earlier clause on anti-social behaviour by one of his ministerial colleagues with responsibility for England and Wales? That would be a shorthand way of bringing together Government assurances about how the orders will work, relating them to the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts. It would also prevent the Minister being dragged through previous ministerial pledges.
<P>
Will the Minister give assurances on the scope of the orders and the nature of their impact? That would help to address amendment No. 108 which, like an earlier amendment, aims to come to terms with the creation of a hybrid order. An anti-social order will not technically speaking contribute to a criminal record, but it will impinge on personal liberty, so it should not be taken lightly. It affects the individual against whom it is brought. We appreciate the wider community's anxieties about how such matters are to be tackled. A later amendment will deal with those worries.
<P>
I do not understand why the Minister would want to reject amendment No. 484, because it fits in with the Bill's strategy of sorting out offending behaviour, nipping it in the bud addressing its causes and ensuring that it does not happen again. Amendment No. 484 would ensure that before those trying to deal with anti-social behaviour take further action they must first have exhausted available remedies to sort out problems, conflicts and the trigger points of anti-social behaviour and have sought out mediation wherever possible. "Wherever possible"	 is an important proviso because we do not want the clause to prevent further action against anti-social behaviour if mediation is impossible.
<P>
However, mediation could often be a more effective way of nipping anti-social behaviour in the bud than imposing orders. It would allow people to address their bad behaviour, to confront the factors in the community that might be triggering it and to get to the bottom of it. Through mediation, people involved in anti-social behaviour might voluntarily from their own volition adjust their behaviour before the next step needed to be taken and the problem will have been confronted early on.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the aims of amendment No. 484 and, if at all possible, see his way to accepting it it seems so much in the spirit of what the Bill is trying to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I should earlier have added my own welcome to the Minister who represents Fife, Central.I spent my honeymoon in Fife in Largo where I played golf every day. In the evenings, also, my wife encouraged me to practise my golf.
<P>
I should like to speak about amendment No. 147. The choice of language regarding anti-social behaviour orders is important. The Minister will have read our debates on clause 2 and noted our concern about the sort of conduct necessary to give rise to an application for an anti-social behaviour order. Some of us were worried that it could be the sort of conduct that might be described as eccentric or offbeat. The Minister of State, Home Office then assured us that the sort of conduct required to trigger such an application would be criminal or "sub-criminal"	 a little phrase that none of us understood. What would the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office say about that in respect of Scotland?
<P>
In debating that earlier clause we spoke of harassment, alarm or distress language partly taken from the Public Order Act 1986. Several of us said that the sort of conduct that we are talking about in the English context would inevitably amount to a criminal offence under that Act. Why, therefore, the need for anti-social behaviour orders? Such was the thrust of our arguments. I notice that the wording is different in the Scottish context because subsection (1)(a)(i) talks of behaviour.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"likely to cause alarm or distress"	,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and mention of harassment is omitted. I am unsure why and I hope that the Minister will be able to explain it.
<P>
The amendment would insert the word "intimidation"	, which beefs up the provision. It is a word not often found in English law. Will the Minister explain why the language is slightly different in this clause and whether he shares the view of the Minister of State, Home Office about the need for conduct resulting in an application for an order to be very serious? Is there an equivalent to the Public Order Act 1986 in Scotland, which deals with the same sort of conduct dealt with in the clause?

<P>

<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> Assurances have been sought on a wide range of issues that have been discussed previously. Assurances given by my colleague will be fully taken on board where applicable to Scottish measures.
<P>
The draft guidance is what the Committee is really considering. I do not want to accept as part of the Bill much of what is proposed, because I do not think it is necessary. The shaping of the guidance on anti-social behaviour orders, which is in its fourth draft, is still to be completed. The subject is sensitive and relates to important issues of civil liberties, as Liberal Democrat Members pointed out. However, a distinction should be made between the functions of primary legislation and those of the draft guidance, which is a more appropriate vehicle for ensuring that the measure will be implemented sensitively. Generally, I give the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine the overall assurance he wanted.
<P>
As the Committee has already discussed, in relation to the equivalent amendment tabled to the English provisions, there is no need for the addition of "intimidation"	 to the definition of anti-social manner or anti-social behaviour. The term "alarm or distress"	 would already cover feelings of intimidation. If everyone considers their personal experiences of anti-social behaviour, I think that that will be borne out. To single out intimidation and add it specifically to the clause might call into question whether other elements, which are also implicitly covered by the definition, have in fact been excluded.
<P>
It is clearly right that a person should be able to argue that his actions were part of his quiet enjoyment of his home, and should not therefore be considered anti-social. However, there is no need for an amendment to achieve that result. Actions which were part of the quiet enjoyment of a person's home would be covered by the existing defence that they were reasonable in the circumstances.
<P>
We should not want to start constructing a list of possible additions to this general defence. Such a list could never be comprehensive, and its existence might call into question whether a type of behaviour that had not been included could be argued as being reasonable in the circumstances. We do not believe that the courts would have difficulty in interpreting the reasonableness defence as flexibly as hon. Members would wish.
<P>
Amendment No. 108 would introduce a test of whether anti-social acts or conduct caused, or were likely to cause, alarm or distress to a person of "of reasonable firmness"	. I understand the motivation behind the amendment. It is of course right that an anti-social behaviour order should not be granted simply because a particularly sensitive individual has been upset by behaviour that most people would find acceptable or innocuous.
<P>
It is, however, for the sheriff to determine whether an act or conduct caused alarm or distress, and was therefore anti-social. It would seem appropriate to leave it to the sheriff to decide that on the particular facts, rather than having to consider the view of the hypothetical person of reasonable firmness.
<P>
I entirely agree with the principle behind amendment No. 484 that anti-social behaviour orders should be a last rather than a first resort. Clearly, common sense and conciliation should be used before there is any thought of recourse to legal remedies. However, it is important to stress that we are discussing not the generality of anti-social behaviour, but, despite difficulties of definition, extreme behaviour. Often, that reaches a point at which mediation would not be appropriate. However, I agree with the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine that, if possible, a resolution of issues outside the courts and the limelight should be the first option.
<P>
I am not sure about England and Wales, but in Scotland more resources are required for mediation of various kinds. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the issue features in the civil legal aid consultation paper issued a few weeks ago. We are keen to shift resources from certain parts of civil legal aid into this whole area of mediation, involving solicitors and a whole range other non-legal groups, but with the same objective of ensuring that if a problem can be resolved at the lowest level possible it should be. Neither the Government nr the Opposition have any interest in taking an issue higher than is necessary to resolve it.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I know, for example, that the Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, which is a voluntary organisation working in Scotland to reduce offending, make communities safer and inform change in justice policy, manages two community mediation projects which act to resolve disputes between neighbours in conflict. Indeed, I opened SACRO's annual conference, which was on the theme of making society safer, as recently as March. The SACRO projects, and others like them, are showing some success in dealing with anti-social behaviour at the lower end of the scale.
<P>
The scale of the anti-social behaviour is the crucial issue. If mediation were taking place and working properly, there would be no need for the anti-social behaviour orders. There is a genuine need in communities throughout the United Kingdom for that to happen.
<P>
In cases where the anti-social behaviour is directed against a small group of individuals, mediation or some similar technique should certainly be attempted before court action is considered. Although there are circumstances where that might not be appropriate for example, where the anti-social behaviour is directed against a whole community, or where the victims are unwilling to be identified or to negotiate the possibility should always be considered.
<P>
In the instance that I quoted, the family terrorised a whole community. Mediation would have been extremely difficult. They were beyond that and the circumstances did not lend themselves to it, but that does not invalidate the central thrust of the comments made by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine.
<P>
The steps to be gone through before a local authority can make an application are, however, administrative matters which should properly be dealt with in the guidance rather than in the primary legislation itself. Important though mediation is, there is no reason to single it out above a range of other administrative matters connected with anti-social behaviour orders.
<P>
The importance of using mediation wherever possible will be covered in the guidance to be issued to local authorities in due course on implementing these provisions. A first draft of the guidance has been made available to the committee. Paragraph 18 of the draft indicates that the local authority should establish what steps the complainant has taken to resolve matters, and consider whether further steps would be appropriate. It goes on to say that these might include mediation in some circumstances. The draft is at present being discussed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and SACRO. Its wording is by no means fixed, and I am sure that they will have improvements to suggest.
<P>
I would also welcome any further comments from hon. Members on that. Later in the summer, it will be issued to a wide range of bodies, including the local authorities, for full consultation. Mediation will be appropriately dealt with in the guidance.
<P>
I hope that what I have said reassures hon. Members that the sentiment and substance of the points that have been raised have been taken on board. We see no need to write them into the Bill but, clearly, they must go into the guidance, and the whole spirit of implementation should reflect the concerns that have been expressed.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I welcome some of what the Minister had to say, especially the talk of the need for more resources for mediation. Clearly, if the guidelines are to be implemented, it must be by action on the ground. Action involves people and people have wages. The Minister touched on the reality by talking about paragraph 18. According to paragraph 19, anti-social behaviour orders will be seen as a last resort and relatively few are expected across Scotland per annum.
<P>
The Minister seeks to reassure us that mediation does not need to be mentioned in the Bill because it is in the guidelines, but I continue to be worried. The Bill is fresh now and the guidelines are being debated simultaneously, but what happens to the guidelines a few years after the Bill has been enacted? What constraints are there on the guidelines? What would happen if a local authority chose to be inefficient in its use of the guidelines and decided because it had the anti-social behaviour orders to throw its weight about and start using them?
<P>
There will be pressure from the community as the clause has had a build-up as bringing an end to the problem. It is important to dampen expectation while welcoming a step towards tackling a serious and complex problem. I am worried that local authorities will be under pressure locally to get their act together and issue anti-social behaviour orders. If local authorities decided not to follow the guidelines, or to do so only superficially, what constraint would prevent a flood of anti-social behaviour orders? I fear that the system would not be able to cope, or to deal with cases that genuinely required anti-social behaviour orders. I hope that the Minister can reassure me.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I am pleased to do so. Local authorities in Scotland currently try to deal with anti-social behaviour. Such behaviour often ends in eviction, which may solve the immediate housing problem, but is not a solution to anti-social behaviour. I believe that local authorities will use anti-social behaviour orders with sensitivity and common sense.
<P>
I hope that local authorities would resist any demand for a flood of anti-social behaviour orders, and would not use them more often than necessary. We estimate that 600 anti-social behaviour orders a year will be issued in Scotland. That is a large number, but it is the high-tariff end of the scale and I hope that caution will be used. Communities will realise that there are other methods of tackling the problem before resorting to anti-social behaviour orders. Those methods include breach of the peace, mediation, and landlord agreements.
<P>
Before issuing an anti-social behaviour order, there has to be due process. When the case reaches the sheriff, it has to be proved. Therefore, local authorities will not attempt to use anti-social behaviour orders as a convenient tool. The court process will act as a constraint on frivolous use of the orders.

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> So the guidelines could be useful to someone who faced the prospect of an anti-social behaviour order Could such a person argue in his defence that the guidelines had not been followed properly?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> Yes. The local authority that applies for the order and the person against whom the order is made can appeal. A local authority will not simply be able to take an anti-social behaviour order off the top shelf and use it as an easy way out. It is a tough process, and I hope that local authorities would try other means before applying for an anti-social behaviour order.
<P>
However, there are cases for which current law is simply inappropriate. The famous case in which I was involved cost 100,000 of legal aid money and took two years. Twenty to 30 people sold their houses and moved. The financial and social consequences are appalling. Nevertheless, I assure the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine that any legal solution must be treated sensibly and seriously.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Again, I have listened to the Minister's explanation for rejecting the amendments. We believe that they would enhance the Bill a little. However, I agree with the Minister's comments about the burden on the legal aid bill of long cases such as the one in which he was involved. All hon. Members want to limit legal aid spending, which has escalated to a ridiculous extent. If the procedures that we have been considering lead to swifter, but genuine justice, we are happy to accept them. In the light of the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 16, line 2, after `satisfied', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`on the basis of the evidence from two or more witnesses or by reason of the admission on the part of the person against whom the order is sought.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 111, in page 16, line 2, leave out `fulfilled' and insert `proved beyond reasonable doubt'.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> The amendments are fairly simple. They relate to the balance of proof to be applied when the sheriff considers an anti-social behaviour order. Amendment No. 110 would add to subsection (3) that the sheriff may be satisfied that the conditions for the application of an order have been fulfilled on the evidence of two witnesses, or an admission by the person against whom the order is sought. That is important because if the burden of proof is so light that it becomes too easy for an anti-social behaviour order to be obtained, the whole system will lose its credibility.
<P>
Amendment No. 111 serves the same purpose as amendment No. 110. The conditions for an order should not only be fulfilled in the way specified in the Bill, but they should be proved beyond reasonable doubt. That principle was discussed at some length during our consideration of clause 2. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is the criminal standard of proof, whereas a lower standard of proof would be required in a civil action. I appreciate that the anti-social behaviour order is a civil action and that it is only the breach of an order through criminal behaviour that leads to a criminal prosecution. Nevertheless, as the Opposition argued when we considered clause 2, the principle relating to the burden of proof is exactly the same. There should be no difference between the law of Scotland and of England and Wales regarding the burden of proof. That matter relates to the way in which justice is interpreted.
<P>
A person can be brought before the sheriff regarding an anti-social behaviour order, which is a civil rather than a criminal proceeding. However, as there is every chance that the case will lead to a criminal prosecution if a breach of the order occurs, then the standard of proof should be the criminal standard of proof: that is, it should be beyond reasonable doubt. For that reason, the amendment purposes that the evidence of two witnesses should be taken into consideration.
<P>
The Opposition's reasons for the amendments are practical rather than principled. If the sheriff has to grant an anti-social behaviour order on the evidence of only one witness probably the person who made the complaint in the first place and who has been harassed or feels intimidated by the behaviour of the person against whom the order is sought the balance of proof might not be weighty enough. The anti-social behaviour orders would be more meaningful if the standard of proof was higher.
<P>
The Opposition do not want to make it more difficult for a local authority to obtain an anti-social behaviour order when young people or others have behaved in ways that have caused obvious harm and distress in a neighbourhood. The amendments are designed to protect civil liberties in situations in which neighbours might complain about behaviour that a court might consider was perfectly reasonable. We want to redress the balance so that the civil liberties of the individual, as well as the liberties of the neighbourhood, are protected.
<P>
The amendments would redress the balance so that it does not become too easy for an anti-social behaviour order to be obtained. Our arguments throughout the Bill have been mindful of the need to protect the freedom of the individual.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I hope that the Minister will make cross-reference to earlier debates and, therefore, cut a corner by associating himself with the reassurances on the workings of the orders that were given in them.
<P>
It must not be forgotten that the orders are a major step. However they are operated, they will affect a person's life. To operate on the basis of probability rather than on the basis of beyond reasonable doubt will have important consequences. It has been suggested that the orders are not a punishment, but they will restrict a person's liberty. Therefore, great caution must be applied before they are granted against a free citizen.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> Again, I start by repeating points that were made by my hon. Friends. Whether the standard of proof required is civil or criminal, the orders will be a serious matter for the person involved. They are civil orders, but a breach of them will be a criminal act. I assure the Committee that the process will be approached with the care that has been outlined today.
<P>
The amendments would increase the standard of proof for anti-social behaviour orders from the civil one of the balance of probabilities to the criminal one of beyond reasonable doubt. They would require corroborated evidence in the absence of an admission.
<P>
Anti-social behaviour orders are designed to prohibit such behaviour, and they are neither convictions nor punishments. In those circumstances, it is right that the laws of civil evidence should apply. An order should be able to be granted if the need for it is proved on the balance of probabilities and the court is satisfied that the facts have been established by evidence, notwithstanding the absence of corroboration of those facts.
<P>
The court will decide, in response to the circumstances of each case, whether to exercise its discretion having regard to the Bill's provisions. Even if the anti-social behaviour is established, the court must be satisfied that the order is necessary and that the person has not been able to show that the behaviour was reasonable.
<P>
The civil rules of evidence apply to interdicts and to applications to the civil court for non-harassment orders. Anti-social behaviour orders will be very similar in effect, and there is no reason to treat them differently. Breach of the order, however, will be a criminal offence and the criminal rules of evidence standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt and corroboration of crucial facts will of course apply.
<P>
Before I ask for the amendments to be withdrawn, I should mention the scope and status of the guidance that we shall issue. Page 3 of the draft guidance refers to the role of a local authority. An arduous process is involved, and local authorities will not enter into it lightly and ignore any sensitivities that exist. Page 5 of the draft deals with an application for an ASBO. Stringent conditions, including mediation before the process begins, have to be met to satisfy the court that all possible action has been taken.
<P>
I am content that the Bill is right and that the guidance will ensure a rigorous process. It satisfies the rules of civil law, so it is entirely consistent with the relevant aspects of criminal justice in Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I thank the Minister for his assurances. Accordingly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> The amendments are all designed to protect the freedom of the individual. When I spoke to amendment Nos. 110 and 111, I expressed the anxiety that Conservative Members have felt throughout the duration of the Committee that individual liberty should not be adversely affected by steps taken to protect neighbourhoods and society.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 112 and 114 would prohibit sheriffs from granting anti-social behaviour orders if that were to cause individuals against whom they are granted exceptional hardship or stop those people living in their own homes.
<P>
Amendment No. 119 would prohibit the granting of anti-social behaviour orders if that were to affect individuals' religious activity. That is very important and we will consider the religious aspects of anti-social behaviour later this evening.
<P>
A situation may arise in which a serious misunderstanding arises between two social groups because of their religious activity. It would be wrong if such intolerance were to be encouraged. Anti-social behaviour orders are meant to promote a tolerant society in which people demonstrate reasonable behaviour that will not upset their neighbours and in which neighbours are not upset without reason. However, religious custom often leads to a total lack of understanding between different social groups. That is why we have tabled the amendment.
<P>
It would be wrong for orders to be sought against people who attend school. That would go against the thrust of the Bill. Anti-social behaviour orders should not stop young people involved in anti-social behaviour attending school, either voluntarily or involuntarily. I am sure that the Minister will agree with that on principle, and I hope that he can give an explanation for rejecting amendment No. 115 that is consistent with such an agreement.
<P>
Amendment No. 119 would prevent anti-social behaviour orders being imposed if, as a result, they were to discriminate against people
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on grounds of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or disability."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, I am sure that the Minister will agree with that on principle. Should he reject the amendment, I hope that he will assure us that the Government accept the spirit behind it.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Very briefly, we associate ourselves with the anxieties and questions of the Opposition. I hope that the Minister can again reassure us.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I may be blamed for repeating myself, but I am happy to give blanket reassurances.
<P>
Anti-social behaviour orders will mean that people do not have to lose their homes. Often, the only solution to anti-social behaviour is eviction. I hope that ASBOs and proper guidance will lead to families remaining in theirhomes and amending their behaviour, rather than being pushed out of their homes and perhaps not changing their behaviour.
<P>
On religion, the draft guidance to local authorities states that orders should be specific,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"so that it will be readily apparent to the person and to the local community what constitutes a breach. Unless the circumstances are exceptional, the terms should not be such as to prevent the person from practising his religion or attending work or school or further education."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear that the orders should be implemented sensibly. Guidance will facilitate that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Will the Minister clarify the status of the guidance? If a sheriff grants an order that does not follow the guidance, will the person against whom it is made have recourse to the guidance in an appeal?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I made that clear when I replied to the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. The guidance will not have a legal basis, but I hope that the elaborate process that it outlines will be followed for each application for an ASBO. Indeed, the process will have to be adhered to because an ASBO could be challenged in several courts in Scotland if an established procedure had not been followed. The document has no legal significance, but it is significant in terms of due process.
<P>
I share the worries of the hon. Member for Epping Forest, but the amendments are unnecessary. The court may impose only prohibitions that are necessary to protect the community from further anti-social acts or behaviour. It is difficult to envisage circumstances in which it would be necessary to ban a person from his own home as opposed to banning particular types of behaviour outside it or inside it in order to do so. It is better for people to be confronted with their behaviour than to be evicted. The ASBOs will provide a genuine test of that.
<P>
Clause 19 already provides that a court can impose a prohibition only if it is satisfied that that is necessary for the protection of the community. That is essentially what amendment No. 112 seeks to achieve. The amendments could cause difficulties by implying that other as yet unimagined undesirable sorts of prohibition were acceptable. As my honourable friend the Minister of State, Home Office explained when we discussed the equivalent amendments to the English provisions, no list of what should or should not be included could ever be complete.
<P>
I have no difficulty with the principle of amendments No. 115 and 119. However, it would not be appropriate to include such provisions in the Bill. As I said earlier, they are matters for the guidance, which we will issue on implementation.
<P>
The guidance makes it clear that the orders must not be used in a discriminatory way. That is a central principle. We would not want to use civil law relating to anti-social behaviour to undermine other legislation covering most important areas of discrimination.
<P>
There is no need, in our view, for further legislation to make discrimination against the law. To include specific provisions in the Bill could call into question whether discrimination was permitted in contexts where no specific provision had been made. I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I accept that the Minister agrees in principle with the spirit of the amendment. He has explained the way in which matters will work in practice, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 113, in page 16, line 6, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) On an application under subsection (1) above the sheriff may, pending the determination of the application, make any such interim order as he considers appropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a practical amendment, giving the sheriff rather more flexibility than the Bill would otherwise allow. The amendment would allow the sheriff, pending determination of the application, to make any such interim order as he considered appropriate. The intention is to speed up the effect on the relevant neighbourhood of the application for an order.
<P>
Hon. Members will all appreciate that if the local authority, police force or social services department consider behaviour in an area to have deteriorated enough to justify seeking an order, action should be taken as quickly as possible. The sheriff might want further information, such as reports on the educational or family background or the state of health of the person concerned. if he decided that he needed such information to set the precise, final terms of the order, he should surely have the power to make an interim order, so that immediate action could be taken to try to curb the relevant behaviour.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will agree in principle that we want the provision to be swiftly applicable when necessary. If he does not accept the amendment, I hope that he will be able to assure me that the principle behind it can be dealt with in another way.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I support amendment No. 113. It is similar to amendment No. 448, which was I think tabled at the behest of Glasgow city council. That authority has problems in its area that it wants to tackle quickly and effectively. The sooner action can be taken, the sooner anti-social behaviour can be nipped in the bud, the cycle of such behaviour stopped and the community reassured.
<P>
What does the Minister envisage happening in the period between application for an order and the sheriff's final determination?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I share the reasonable concern expressed by hon. Members about this matter, which has been discussed previously in another place.
<P>
Clause 21 provides that applications for an anti-social behaviour order should be by way of the normal summary application procedure for civil business. The amendment tackles the possibility that the court process would not be sufficiently speedy to meet the expectations of the community. The representations from Glasgow have been mentioned in that context. Cases where there is a need for urgency should be rare, however, given that conduct which is clearly provable as criminal will be addressed by other means. If, exceptionally, there is a particular urgency, the period of notice to the person against whom the order is to be made can be as little as 48 hours and the sheriff can be asked to agree to an early date being fixed for the hearing.
<P>
What I have outlined is consistent with the position for England and Wales and with the provisions for non-harassment orders in the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Indeed, it is only in very exceptional circumstances for example, where there is an immediate threat to someone's safety that statutory provisions for interim orders are considered appropriate. An existing example would be the orders to exclude an adult from a child's home under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.
<P>
Comparisons have been drawn with interdict, roughly the Scottish equivalent of an injunction. Interdict can be used, however, to prevent an event that is otherwise certain to take place. It may in such cases be necessary to obtain an order immediately, and provision for interim orders is then appropriate. That is not the situation which anti-social behaviour orders are intended to address.
<P>
We have considered this matter very carefully, following the deliberations in another place. We are satisfied, however, that the normal civil procedures are sufficient and that there is no need to provide for interim orders.
<P>
The concerns that hon. Members have expressed on the issue have highlighted the frustration in communities about the speed with which local authorities, the police or any other agencies can act. The Bill is intended to strike a balance by establishing a powerful anti-social behaviour order which should be used with common sense and avoiding the possibility of knee-jerk reactions in which insufficiently prepared matters would be brought quickly to court. It that happened, applications could backfire, or there could be the very consequences for civil liberties that hon. Members want to prevent.
<P>
We have struck the right balance and while I embrace the spirit of the suggestions, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> With the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 16, line 22, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8A) It shall be the duty of the local authority to appoint an independent person to monitor applications for anti-social behaviour orders and to publish a report each year in the local authority's area giving such details of the applications as he thinks fit.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Amendment No. 120 is intended simply to suggest that the workings of the anti-social behaviour order system should be monitored; that an independent monitor should be appointed and that a report should be published annually.
<P>
The orders are an experiment in civil and criminal law, so monitoring should be carefully conducted and provided for in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> In clause stand part it is always important to seek an assurance from the Government that the introduction of a Bill is not the end of the relevant matter; that they are not window dressing or headline grabbing, or telling us, "We know about the problem, but we have a new law to solve it."	 It is also important to obtain an assurance that the Government recognise the implications with regard to resources. The measure involves work to be done by local authorities whose budgets are severely stretched. In the long run, if the cycle of anti-social behaviour can be broken, there may be savings for local authorities. However, there could well be a pump-priming point requiring additional expenditure.
<P>
The police will have to be involved in enforcement. An issue raised by Glasgow city council is whether a constable would need a warrant to act on a breach of an order. Alternatively, if the police believed that an order was being broken, could they quickly nip that situation in the bud without a warrant?
<P>
It would be helpful if the Miniser would recognise the need for resources and provide a reassurance to the community that the proposal is an important step in dealing with the crisis without being a panacea. Expectations should not be built up too much, but the measure might contribute something to society's ability to deal with some of its worst problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> The central thrust is that this is a serious and important development in dealing with anti-social behaviour. I certainly concur with that. All parties should approach the problem in the same constructive manner as that of the Committee this afternoon. The financial memorandum makes it clear that we are talking about approximately 600 orders it is hard to be more precise. In resource terms, we may be talking about 1.3 million a substantial amount.
<P>
The attitude of the Government in Scotland is that if we want the measure to work and to be implemented effectively, sufficient resources must be provided. The resource issue is crucial and we intend to deliver on it. In the past local authorities have rightly taken on additional burdens and understandably had to complain about the squeeze on other resources. Local authorities must have adequate resources because we do not want the proposed measures to fail. If we embark on the project, it is vital to make it a real success, as the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine rightly said.
<P>
Responses to consultation have made it clear that people in the communities appreciate the measure. It is popular, but that does not mean that we should be frivolous or cavalier about implementation. I reassure the Committee that that will not happen.
<P>
I move on to monitoring, the importance of which we entirely accept. Public money is to be spent on a new piece of legislation and it is crucial to assess its impact. It is about outputs, not inputs, and we must assess them. The guidance will make it clear that local authorities should be carrying out such assessments.
<P>
It is important for local authorities to consider applications for orders in a way that avoids discrimination and victimisation an aspect that also needs to be monitored. However, that is an operational management matter for local authorities and it would be inappropriate to include it in the Bill.
<P>
I nevertheless accept the constructive suggestions that have been made, and I suspect that we shall want careful monitoring at government level as well as at local authority level to ensure that the provisions work properly and solve problems in the various communities.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The Minister dealt with the issue in a way, but does he view it as a necessary requirement to have a warrant for arrest for a breach of an order?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> There is no need for a specific power of arrest without warrant for a breach either of an anti-social behaviour order or of an interim order. Should the conduct that constitutes the breach be sufficiently serious to justify arrest, it would almost certainly be a criminal act in itself, irrespective of whether it breaches a particular order. In those circumstances, the police could use their normal common law powers of arrest, though any arrest without warrant would have to be justified in the particular circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 122 , in page 16, line 25, leave out `his police force'and insert `the local authority'.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> The amendments deal with the person or body with the power to apply for a sex offender order. They would replace the chief constable's power to do so with that of the local authority. Both amendments relate to the same matter. In introducing them, I am mindful of the response of the Faculty of Advocates a fine body for which I have the utmost respect to initial Scottish Office consultation.
<P>
The Faculty of Advocates said that applications should be made by the local authority in order to avoid undue pressure from self-styled vigilante groups, by which I am sure it did not mean undue pressure on the chief constable. One of its main concerns and it has been touched on in consideration of the Bill is the clash between criminal and civil procedure. The Faculty of Advocates said that if a case is more appropriately viewed as a criminal matter, the application should be made at the instance of the procurator fiscal. Hence giving the power to the chief constable and the police force is inappropriate. If not dealt with as a criminal matter by the procurator fiscal, a case should be dealt with as a civil matter by the local authority on behalf of the local community.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Following on from that, it seems that in crossing the border the drafting has left out the first part of the triangle, so will the Minister explain why the chief constable is deemed the appropriate authority? Chief constables do not normally have experience of assessing evidence for its effectiveness in court. That assessment is normally passed on to the procurator fiscal. Will the Minister explain why he believes that the chief constable is the most appropriate authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I would be pleased to do that. We debated the most appropriate authority for originating sex offender orders because they are much less clear cut than anti-social behaviour orders. We are dealing with people who have had a previous criminal conviction, so there is an important link with the police as an agency. That is one of the most compelling reasons for them to process the order.
<P>
A point was made about the procurator fiscal's involvement in criminal activity when civil matters are often relevant. However, the civil nature of cases in no way undermines the seriousness of sex offending in Scotland. We are perturbed by vigilantes, whom we have seen in Aberdeen, Ayr and Stirling. There is a great deal of understandable emotion about this issue.
<P>
When we considered the most appropriate process for implementing sex offender orders, however, it became clear that local authorities would not be involved. Criminal justice social work an important part of the criminal justice system has a role to play, but it is not wholly appropriate for such social workers to process sex offender orders. We needed detailed discussions with the police because it would have been wrong to impose an inappropriate task on local authorities or other organisations. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland) agreed with us that the police should have the task. Thus the police are more appropriate than other agencies not only because of their skills but because of the previous criminal convictions of people involved.
<P>
Sex offender orders were built on legislation passed by the previous Government, but there were many gaps in it. If an order is served, it will provide for control and for registration under the Sex Offenders Act 1997. It is right for the police to do that, but they will be required by statute to consult the local authority before making an application for an order.
<P>
At present, we are engaged in consultations about the guidance on risk assessment and management of sex offenders. That guidance makes it clear that the Government expect local authorities and the police to work together to assess and manage risk. Although the process is undertaken by the police, it will not be carried out in isolation from the key agencies, especially criminal justice social work. It will be clear to anyone who has studied the coverage of incidents in Scotland that there is enormous sensitivity on these matters. I am sure that the situation is the same for England. In Scotland, there is a close relationship between the police and criminal justice social work, as part of the local authority, and that is good and encouraging.
<P>
I have set out the background to our proposals and the Government believe that they are justified and that they will work, but we shall monitor the situation closely.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I accept the Minister's explanation, and I am pleased to hear that the Government intend to monitor the situation closely. I assume that if the proposals do not work, the Government will take different powers to alter the situation in due course. Accordingly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 16, line 30, leave out `16' and insert `12'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 124, in page 16, line 34, leave out `serious'.
<P>
No. 126, in page 16, line 40, leave out `appropriate' and insert `necessary'.
<P>
No 125, in page 17, line 1, leave out `serious'.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Amendment No. 123 once again proposes that in applications for the imposition of a sex offender order the age of 16 should be reduced to 12. The Opposition have already rehearsed the arguments for that. They are similar to those that we put forward during consideration of amendment No. 146 to clause 19 and I will not repeat them. If I did so, I assume that the minister would give me the same answers as he did in that earlier discussion. I will spare what is left of the committee that excitement.
<P>
Amendment No. 124 would remove "serious"	 from subsection 2(b). The provision would then read that an order would be granted if it was necessary to protect the public merely from harm, rather than from serious harm. The arguments for that were advanced during consideration of clause 3. Although that was some weeks ago, I am sure that the remaining members of the Committee this evening will remember those arguments. The Opposition want to ensure that it would not be too difficult for an order to be granted under clause 20. The deletion of "serious"	 would make that matter easier.
<P>
Amendment No. 125 seeks to clarify and simplify the application process for sex offender orders. The sheriff should not merely consider that the order would be appropriate, but necessary. I suspect that the Minister will argue that the sheriff would not think that an order was appropriate if it was not necessary. I await his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> In our discussion of the anti-social behaviour orders, we established that in Scotland those people under 16 are dealt with by the children's hearing system and that the Government would not want to cut across that system. Hearings can require the supervision of a child and impose conditions on him or her. If the conditions are breached, the hearing can consider additional and stronger measures, as I said earlier.
<P>
If there is concern that a child poses a risk to the community and might commit a sex offence, the children's hearing system already provides a mechanism for monitoring that child and regulating his behaviour. Once the child is 16, existing provisions for sex offender orders allow the police to apply for an order, provided that the child has received a conviction for a sex offence in the past.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 124 and 125 suggest that sex offender orders should be available to protect the public from harm, rather than from serious harm. That requirement would be too wide. In theory, orders might then be considered against a very large number of sex offenders. That could be counterproductive. To be effective, these orders and the police activity associated with them must be concentrated on those who pose the greatest risk.
<P>
It should also be borne in mind that the test of serious harm is familiar to the courts and is readily understood by them in the context of decisions on whether to impose supervised release orders under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 126 would reduce the sheriff's discretion over when he could make an interim order under clause 20. It would negate much of the value of the Bill's provision for interim sex offender orders. The sheriff would be unable to make such an order when he considered it appropriate and would be able to do so only if he considered that one were necessary to protect the public from serious harm. I am sure that we would not wish to restrict the sheriff's discretion over interim orders in this way.
<P>
Satisfying the sheriff that an interim order is necessary in the legal sense would impose too high a test. The point of making provision for interim orders is to allow stopgap action to protect the public in the period before a full hearing of the case is possible. However, if the sheriff were to be satisfied that an interim order were necessary, he would have to have evidence before him of the harm that would otherwise result. He may be unable to satisfy himself without what would amount almost to the full hearing.
<P>
The orders are intended to address potential sex offending. A test of appropriateness at what I must stress is the interim stage will strike the right balance between the need to protect the public, especially children and vulnerable adults and the rights of the person who will be subject to the interim order.
<P>
Sex offender orders must be seen in the context of other measures. The Sex Offenders Act 1997 allowed registration. The Bill's provision for sex offender orders will allow another period of registration. In Scotland, work on DNA identification has been done in relation to sex offenders.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Lady will find those comments helpful and that she will withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I acknowledge the Minister's helpful comments. We agree in spirit about the clause and about what the amendments intend to achieve. Accordingly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 489, in page 19, line 28, leave out subsection (b).
<P>
No. 488, in page 19, line 34 leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or a person visiting the house'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Amendment Nos. 487 and 488 seek to discount the actions of a person visiting the house as reasons for ending the tenancy. Amendment No. 489 would delete subsection (b), which is widely drawn and refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an offence punishable by imprisonment committed in, or in the locality of, the house."<P>
</UL></FONT>	
<P>
Making people homeless is not necessarily the best way of dealing with their criminal behaviour. The Scottish Office has traditionally argued in its guidelines to local authorities that the reverse should be done if at all possible. Local authorities should seek to keep such people in their homes as a means of helping them to remain part of the community.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We understand that there comes a point when a landlord may feel that certain people should not remain part of their community. For example, they may be dealing in drugs and seriously affecting the neighbourhood and their neighbours. However, the Government have drawn the Bill quite widely, and it is an imported clause that copies English legislation. I am not sure that it has been properly thought out and honed down to be specific in achieving the Government's goals.
<P>
My worry about clause 23(2)(b) is that some offences, which are punishable by prison, do not impinge anti-socially on neighbours. For example, someone could get involved in a cycle of mail-order fraud. The crime originates in the home, has an effect on society and is reprehensible. However, the power to evict that person should not necessarily be given to the landlord. the crime does not directly affect the neighbours or the landlord. If the Government give landlords such powers, there is a danger that they will use it in cases that the Government did not originally envisage.
<P>
I have some fears about the provision relating to visitors to the house. The person being visited may have no control over the visitor, but he may lose his tenancy even if he has a family. Will the Minister tell us what the clause is trying to achieve and how it could be honed down to achieve his wishes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I support my hon. Friend's comments. He referred to the activities of those in the vicinity of a house. The Minister earlier said that the concept that parents can be punished for the actions of their children is alien to Scottish law. Similarly, we question the extent to which a householder can be held responsible for those in the vicinity of his house.
<P>
It is one thing for someone dealing drugs from his home to have a customer caught around the corner, but many other cases would not fall into that category. For example, an unwelcome visitor to a house may become drunk and disorderly and the householder would have no direct control over his behaviour. I hope that the Minister will tell us that such cases will be covered in the guidance to the courts. However, we seek reassurance that the guidance will be binding on landlords who from whatever motive be it malicious or otherwise seek to evict those who genuinely have no control over their visitors. The guidance must have sufficient force to prevent such unfortunate and unnecessary evictions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> The clause is not intended to increase the number of evictions in Scotland. Earlier I said that eviction is far too often not the last, but the first, recourse. I reassure the Committee that we wish to attack the problems without people losing their homes. The clause will not be a charter for unscrupulous landlords. That was the central tenet of the concerns expressed. It will close a loophole, but it will not allow landlords to do what they wish when they wish to potentially vulnerable tenants.
<P>
Hon. Members will be aware of the widespread concerns about serious anti-social and criminal conduct in some parts of our communities. The social menace of drug dealing and other criminal and violent acts render some housing estates virtual no-go areas. That cannot be tolerated. There is a consensus that that must be tackled.
<P>
Current Scottish housing legislation already provides discretionary grounds for eviction where a house is used for criminal or immoral purposes. These powers, however, are sometimes insufficient to tackle the full range of anti-social and criminal behaviour perpetrated in our communities. We wish to extend the provisions to cover criminal acts committed in the locality of the house, and the activities of visitors to the house.
<P>
The provisions in clause 23 mirror those introduced for England and Wales by the Housing Act 1996. They have already been shown to be successful in combating drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour there. The aim is to make it possible for landlords to take tough action to deal with those who are carrying out their criminal activities in and around tenanted properties. The person must have been convicted of a serious offence before the local authority can take action to evict the tenant on these grounds. The sheriff will then exercise his discretion in deciding whether in all the circumstances it is reasonable to evict the tenant.
<P>
I understand the concerns that the provisions could, if interpreted too loosely, result in eviction action against tenants who themselves step out of line in ways which might not merit the loss of a tenancy, or whose visitors are found guilty of similar misdemeanours.
<P>
I believe that tenants have a responsibility to ensure that their visitors behave in an acceptable manner, both in and outwith the properties. If a tenant allows visitors to behave badly, he is in breach of his tenancy agreement. Clearly, there may be cases where the tenant is genuinely unable to control visitors. Guidance to landlords will make it clear that it would be inappropriate to take forward cases for eviction in such circumstances, and sheriffs would be able to use their discretion to refuse to make an order to evict. Eviction is a serious matter and is rightly taken as such by the courts.
<P>
The provisions are intended to cover guests of the tenant who are positively invited into and allowed to remain in the property. They are not intended to cover strangers visiting in an official capacity. We are determined to close the existing loophole, which does not allow criminal activity in common areas of tenanted properties, such as stairways, courtyards, or lifts, to be taken into account in eviction actions. It follows, therefore, that we would not wish to drop the proposed extension of the eviction grounds relating to criminal activity in the locality of tenanted properties, for tenants and their visitors.
<P>
Guidance to landlords will stress that offences must relate to the tenancy and must have adversely affected the community.

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> What stage are the guidelines at?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I can be corrected, but I think that they are draft guidelines.
<P>
Sheriffs should not entertain spurious actions and should not grant repossession where the offence is irrelevant. On the basis of those assurances, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. Again, it is critical that we get the guidance correct. Whether it is a landlord or sheriff who is involved, they have to know the context and the parameters within which they are working. I will certainly give the assurance that further consideration will be given to that, and regard will be paid to any further concerns expressed by hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I feel that the Minister wears one hat here but he has another hat as Minister for Women. It was important when he was talking about the ability [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I have responsibility for women's issues.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I keep bringing new information to the Committee which is of great interest to those south of the border. There is a serious point here the Minister is beginning to be aware of it which is that it is important to recognise what happens in the real world. Many women have problems with violent partners and there will be a danger of assuming control in a situation where their ability to control is not so great. It would be extremely remiss, especially from a Government who are committed to trying to avoid social exclusion, to end up with a cycle of an intimidating partner getting involved in crime or a partner who dominates the relationship allowing crime to be committed in the area. There would be a double victim: the victim of an intimidating partner would become a victim of eviction and society.
<P>
The Minister talked of research. I do not know whether there is time for him to go into the research that has been done in England on the effectiveness of the clause that has been used in England. It may be something that he could write to us about. Perhaps if there is a way to tidy up some of the loose ends or to narrow down the effect of the clause, we could return to this matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> The guidance will be in the commencement circular which has not yet been issued and so has not been finalised. The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point about domestic violence. On 19 June we are issuing a major paper about domestic violence in Scotland and about our new strategy. The Bill is certainly no intended to worsen the plight of women in difficult circumstances. I can give the hon. Gentleman an assurance on that point. None of our policies or statutes regarding women in such situations should compromise that. I do not have further details of the research but I would be willing to ensure that the Scottish Office gives the hon. Gentleman the finding. By way of a postscript, it is less onerous to be Minister for Women's Issues than to be the Minister for Women.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Accuracy is important. Could the Minister go a little further and accept that if by Report stage there is a way of drafting things better, or when considering the guidelines or when we see the research, he will think again about some of the detail. That would be somewhat reassuring.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> We will provide the research information which will be helpful. We will also be able to take the guidance further forward. I will also provide that for the hon. Gentleman. At this point, I leave it at that.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> We await those pieces of information, and depending on what we receive, we may return to this on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> There may be details that I should worry about but if the clause can tackle the problem of noise nuisance from neighbours, which I often hear about at my surgeries, particularly at the time of the event,I welcome it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I would be quite happy to write to the hon. Gentleman to confirm that we mean business on this item. It is the immediacy of the problem that cannot be tackled at present. That is why the powers we are providing in the clause will address that.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 425, in page 25, line 9, after `race', insert `religion'.
<P>
I shall be brief. This is an important amendment. We have now moved on from the part of the Bill that dealt with the hybridity between civil and criminal law this is now pure criminal law. It is a serious part of the criminal law dealing with racially aggravated offences. Under the amendment, the word "religion"	 would be included in the definition of a racial group. If it were accepted, a racial group would mean
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a group of persons defined by reference to race, religion, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those drafting the Bill might have assumed that religious differences can usually be identified by racial differences. For example, it would not matter whether one defined members of the Sikh religion according to religious or racial criteria. In their case, religion and race are more or less one and the same.
<P>

<P>
It is a sensitive point, but it must be accepted that in the real world especially in the real world of the west of Scotland a significant religious difference can be found that has nothing to do with racial difference. That is the difference between Catholics and Protestants, and some crimes result from it. I was born and brought up near Glasgow and I know that such matters are treated differently, and rather more seriously, there than in the rest of Scotland and the United Kingdom.
<P>
The clause is good and will strengthen the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995. However, it would be wrong to leave out an important element of difference that is not racial. That difference does not lead to racially aggravated harassment, but to religiously aggravated harassment in some parts of the country. The amendment would make the Bill and the implementation of the 1995 Act more effective and relevant to the real world. I do not deny the sensitivity of the subject I reluctantly deal with it but we should accept that crimes committed because of a person's religion are just as serious as those committed because of a person's race.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will agree with the spirit behind the amendment. I look forward to his reply.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The clause is extremely welcome. Complacency can creep in in those parts of Scotland, which are almost arrogant enough to say that they do not have the same racial problems as other parts of the country. However, experience shows that that is not the case.
<P>
We can try to educate people so that they understand that racially motivated behaviour can lead to a waste of resources, but the clause sends out an important signal. Even if we cannot change people's private views, the clause makes it clear that we will not allow anyone to impose such views on the rest of society and that we will not tolerate any violent behaviour that results from them. We must treat such views seriously and condemn racially motivated acts.
<P>
It is important to get across the point that racial attacks create much harm. Even if a physical attack is minor, the stress it causes to young people and the consequent feeling of exclusion from society results in scars that last far longer than the physical injuries. We must also consider the potential waste of talent. We have enough problems recruiting new talent; it must not be wasted through bigotry and prejudice.
<P>
It is also disastrous to exclude people from society on the basis of their religion. Anything that helps to convey that message is welcome. We cannot change people from the inside overnight, but creating a climate in which bigotry is not tolerated will help to improve society.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> As my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office made clear, the definition of "racial group"	 as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is not new. The same definition is used in both the Race Relations Act 1976, which deals with racial discrimination, and part III of the Public Order Act 1986, which deals with incitement to racial hatred.
<P>
We have considered carefully whether the offences should be extended to cover religious as well as racial groups, but the aim of the clause is to deal with the specific problem of racial crime because of the scale of that particular problem and its impact on society. To include religion would extend the scope of the offences considerably, and risk diluting the emphasis on race and the strength of the message that the Bill sends to the victims of racial violence and harassment.
<P>
There are difficulties in defining "religious aggravation"	 that are not tackled by the amendment. References to "religious belief"	 or "faith groups"	 do not cover the extent of "religion"	.
<P>
An attack motivated by religious hostility, as opposed to racial hostility, would, of course, still be covered by the existing law. It is also open to the courts to consider whether religious motivation for an attack should be considered an aggravating factor in sentencing.
<P>
I appreciate that hon. Members made their points in good faith. It is sometimes difficult to decide whether an offence is motivated by race or religion, which are intertwined in a problematic way. I also appreciate that we are discussing complex and sensitive subjects. However, the Government are not avoiding the issue.
<P>
Legislation can achieve only so much, but, as the hon. member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine said, it can send a message that abhorrent behaviour will not be tolerated in a modern society. The Bill sends a powerful message. I acknowledge that religion is important. However, the Government have taken a principled stand by tackling racial criminal activity in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I take the Minister's point. It is unfortunate that the Government are not willing to send the further message that religious hatred is as intolerable as racial hatred. However, I appreciate the Minister's point about diluting the effect of the clause. Therefore,I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
