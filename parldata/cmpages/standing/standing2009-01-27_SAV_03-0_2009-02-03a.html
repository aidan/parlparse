Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Bercow. I understand that regulations were published
yesterday that relate to the Bill. They have not been circulated to
Committee members; nor are there copies in the room this morning. Will
the regulations be provided to Committee members to enable us to
deliberate the Bill
properly?</div><a name="09020315000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000300"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> Further
to that point of order, Mr. Bercow. I apologise that the
draft regulations are not before the Committee. They were published for
the assistance of the Committee in deliberating the Bill. We appreciate
that much of the detail under discussion will be passed in secondary
legislation. I understand that the regulations were in the Vote Office
by 4 o&#146;clock, and they are certainly on the website. I will
ensure that they are available to the Committee as quickly as possible.
Perhaps if I look at the officials in the Box in the right way, one of
them will go and ensure that the regulations are available during the
morning.</div><a name="09020315000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000301"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the
point of order and to the Economic Secretary for the gracious apology
and clarification that he issued. Attempts will be made to ensure that
copies are available to Committee members speedily. We do not need to
labour the point, but the point of order was fair and reasonable. As a
matter of good order and practice in the future, it is important that
material germane to the Committee&#146;s considerations is available
in an easily accessible form for Committee members when
deliberating.</div><a name="09020315000012"></a>

Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): I beg to move amendment 1,
in
clause 1, page 1, line 4, leave
out from &#145;by&#146; to end of line 5 and insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;an eligible person (within the meaning
given by section
3).&#146;.</div><a name="09020315000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000303"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 2, in
clause 1, page 1, line 15, leave
out subsection (3).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="09020315000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000304"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I welcome you, Mr. Bercow, and everyone
else to the Committee. I am sure that I will be first of many to say
what a pleasure it is to serve under your
chairmanship.</div><a name="09020315000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
way of introduction, may I say that the Liberal Democrats support the
Bill&#146;s broad principles? We see virtue in incentivising people
who are on low incomes to save money. The savings will serve as a
buffer against unexpected emergency expenditure. Such accounts should
inculcate a savings culture and spread a sense of asset-owning stakes
in
society.</div><a name="09020315000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
one might expect, clause 1 defines the savings gateway account. I
confess that amendments 1 and 2 are somewhat finickity. They are
designed to improve the Bill&#146;s drafting, rather than to make a
broader political point. Clause 1 states that the account holder must
first receive a notice of eligibility and secondly
be</div><a name="09020315000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
eligible person at the relevant
date&#148;.</div><a name="09020315000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
they will not receive a notice of eligibility unless they are an
eligible person at the relevant date. The wording is therefore
unnecessarily complicated. Amendment 1 would delete the requirement to
have received a notice of eligibility. There is no reason why a person
who is eligible under clause 3 should have to wait for Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to issue a notice. If they have to
wait, the danger is that they will be subject to any administrative
inadequacies that arise at HMRC. For example, if there was a backlog or
a notice was lost in the post, a person who was deemed to be eligible
would
suffer.</div><a name="09020315000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could speak at greater length, but I have made the point. It is not a
major point, but one about drafting. The Economic Secretary may wish to
consider not putting that additional obstacle in the way of people who
want an account. If they are eligible, the additional criteria are
unnecessary.</div><a name="09020315000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000305"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I assume that the notice is required because an
account provider will know that somebody is eligible if they can
furnish them with the notice. If there is no requirement to produce the
notice, how will a person who qualifies under clause 3 prove to the
account provider that they are
eligible?</div><a name="09020315000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000306"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> My understanding is that such people would be
deemed eligible. The essential point is that, if they have received the
notice, they must by definition have been eligible on that date;
otherwise they would not have received the notice. I am willing to have
further light shed on that by the Economic Secretary before we get on
to the more substantial aspects of the
Bill.</div><a name="09020315000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020315000307"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Stephen Ladyman</b> (South Thanet) (Lab): I welcome you,
Mr. Bercow, to the Committee and look forward to serving
under your chairmanship.</div>
<a name="09020315000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
quick question along the same lines as that asked by the hon. Member
for Taunton, who tabled these amendments. Given our experience of the
occasional inefficiencies of HMRC, I wonder how many of our
constituents will not get their notice of eligibility when required,
and how many will end up in their MP&#146;s office, asking for help
to get them. I would like assurance from my hon. Friend the Economic
Secretary that notices will be issued as soon as someone becomes
eligible, that some mechanism will be put in place to ensure that they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>are routinely issued and that we can count on everyone eligible having a
notice as soon as they are entitled to go to the relevant account
provider and open one of the savings accounts. It seems to me that we
might be adding possible inefficiency to the process by doing things in
this way. I should like to hear his
comments.</div><a name="09020315000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000308"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Bercow. I hope that I can persuade the
Committee that we are not placing burdens or, in the words of the hon.
Member for Taunton, being pernickety and overcomplicated. We are
actually providing opportunities, and I would like to explain why the
legislation should stand as it is.</div>
<a name="09020315000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee is aware, clause 1 sets out the general features of the
saving gateway account, including specifying that it is an
account</div>
<a name="09020315000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;held by a
person who has received a notice of eligibility...and who was an
eligible person at the relevant date.&#148;</div>
<a name="09020315000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will discuss
eligibility in more detail when we come to clause 3, but, broadly, to
be an eligible person someone must be entitled to one of the qualifying
benefits or tax credits and have a specified connection with the UK. In
most cases, the relevant date will simply be the date when a notice of
eligibility is issued to the person by HMRC. I tell my hon. Friend the
Member for South Thanet that we will make sure that that is done in an
orderly and timely way.</div>
<a name="09020315000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our intention
is for data to be transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions
to HMRC, which will issue the eligibility notices frequently, possibly
fortnightly or monthly. Some people might move off a qualifying benefit
before they receive their notice of eligibility. In those
circumstances, because we do not want to stop people who fit our normal
criteria receiving support under the Bill, it is important to have both
elements of the eligibility criteria: receiving a notice of eligibility
and being eligible at the relevant date.</div>
<a name="09020315000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
amendments 1 and 2, anyone whose eligibility status changed would have
to lose their saving gateway account. That would be confusing for
account holders and costly and complicated for account providers.
Amendment 2, in particular, would remove the definition of the relevant
date for the purposes of subsection 1(a), and if amendment 1 was not
agreed, the conditions set out in subsection 1(a) for a saving gateway
account holder to be someone who was an eligible person at the relevant
date could not be satisfied. As a result, no account held could be a
saving gateway account, because there would be no way of identifying
the relevant date. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09020315000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will say something more specifically about subsection
(1)(a), under which people who are eligible on the relevant date will
be able to keep their accounts and receive the match payment,
regardless of whether they remain eligible. Removing an account from
people whose eligibility status changed could, though this is unlikely,
provide a perverse incentive for eligible people not to seek to move
back into work, or into higher paid work, to maintain tax credit or
benefit status. It would also make the accounts more complicated for
providers and the Government to administer, as accounts would have to
be closed frequently. That would be extremely burdensome for providers,
which is another good reason for us to resist amendments 1 and
2.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000309"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I want to clarify something that arose in the
evidence sessions, and I will want to return to it under clause 3. Am I
right to think that my hon. Friend said that, if someone is eligible
for a savings account and opens one but goes back to work the next day
and is therefore not eligible, he or she is allowed to keep the account
until it has run its
course?</div><a name="09020315000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000310"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Yes, that is right, and with that I ask the hon.
Gentleman to consider withdrawing the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000312"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I beg to move amendment 3, in clause 2,
page 2, line 6, leave out paragraph
(a).</div><a name="09020315000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000313"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 23, in
clause 2, page 2, line 12, at
end add</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;The expiry date is either
three months after the issue of a notice of eligibility or cessation of
eligibility as defined in section 3, whichever is
earlier.&#146;.</div><a name="09020315000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000314"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The territory here is similar to that which
concerned the amendments that I tabled to the previous clause. Clause 2
will require HMRC to issue a notice of eligibility to each person who
qualifies under clause 3. The crucial point to draw out with the
amendment is the requirement that the notice of eligibility should
include an expiry date. If one is eligible, one continues to be so
until eligibility ceases. Unless one can see into the future, the
expiry date would not necessarily be an accurate prediction of
eligibility.</div>
<a name="09020315000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
if one were to leap forward to clause 3, one of the eligibilities is
severe disablement allowance. One can imagine that unless an amazing
cure were invented in the meantime, that allowance would continue
beyond the recorded expiry date. However, eligibility for
jobseeker&#146;s allowance may not. The Economic Secretary clarified
that that would continue for the whole period; even if one were only
eligible for a day and then became employed as a premiership footballer
on &#163;70,000 a week, one would still be eligible for the remaining
two years to draw this very generous support from the
taxpayer.</div><a name="09020315000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
of the criteria, however, would be permanent. An expiry date in those
circumstances may create an extra administrative burden on the people
who would have to reapply, or who may allow their eligibility to lapse
unwittingly. They would then have to demonstrate their eligibility
again, even though they were claiming on the same basis as the first
time around.</div>
<a name="09020315000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
one of ease of access for people who may be disinclined to partake in
such initiatives and incentives. It would not be desirable to put extra
barriers in their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>way; we all share the same objectives. If people are eligible to start a
saving gateway account, it does not necessarily need to be made clear
when they may or may not cease to be eligible in the
future.</div><a name="09020315000271"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000315"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I add my welcome for your chairmanship, Mr Bercow,
to the welcomes offered by other hon. Members. I want to speak to my
amendment 23, which looks at the question of when the eligibility
notice expires and is very much probing. Clause 2(2)(a) states that
there will be an expiry date, but that date will be specified in
regulations. Of course, the amendments were tabled before the
regulations even appeared in the Vote Office
yesterday.</div><a name="09020315000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
suggestion here is that the expiry date be either three months after
the date of issuance of the eligibility notice or cessation of
eligibility, as set out in clause 3, which specifies the benefits that
someone is entitled to, which then triggers their
eligibility&#151;whichever is earlier. I am trying to set out a
sensible parameter for the expiry of the notice and I suggest three
months; it may take someone a while, once they become eligible for
benefits, to decide whether to open a saving gateway. They may need to
consider whether their income would enable them to save &#163;25 a
month, or whatever amount happened to be specified. Perhaps there
should be a reasonable period in place before the expiration of the
notice and perhaps people would then have an incentive to think about
it, rather than leaving things until the latest possible
moment.</div><a name="09020315000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,
considering the other qualifications on cessation of eligibility, once
someone stops being eligible for a benefit, surely they should stop
being eligible for a saving gateway. We touched on that
topic when we debated  the previous clause. That is the
thinking behind amendment
23.</div><a name="09020315000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000316"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Again, I have just a few questions for my hon.
Friend the Economic Secretary. Is it envisaged that the expiry date of
one&#146;s eligibility notice will be short term&#151;a month,
perhaps&#151;or will it be longer term? If one&#146;s eligibility
for the saving gateway continues after the expiry date, will another
eligibility notice be issued? For example, if someone has a three-month
expiry date and is eligible for a saving gateway account for 12 months,
will they get four notices in that period? Will there be a process in
place to ensure that people get a notice immediately on the expiry of
their old notice or will there be a gap between the
two?</div>
<a name="09020315000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020315000317"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): It is good to sit under your
chairmanship once again, Mr. Bercow. I want to raise a point
in relation to clause 2(2) on the notice of eligibility. We are talking
about a number of aspects relating to the expiry date. Is this the
right occasion to ask the Economic Secretary whether this is a good
place to ensure, as it is not in the regulations, that there is also a
health warning on the notice of eligibility as to what happens in the
event of withdrawal? There seems to be no other place for that aspect
to be rammed home at the beginning, given the somewhat chaotic lives of
some of the people who would be eligible for the
account.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div><a name="09020315000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000318"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Clause 2 deals with the notices of eligibility
that HMRC will send to eligible people. The amendments tabled by the
hon. Members for Taunton and for Fareham are very different, so let me
deal with them in turn. Amendment 3, which stands in the name of the
hon. Member for Taunton, would remove the need for the notice of
eligibility to contain an expiry date, along with any other information
about the participant that was set out in the regulations. Obviously,
it is essential that notices of eligibility contain information about
the eligible person&#151;for example, their name and address. This
will allow account providers to carry out their account-opening checks
and prevent those who are not eligible for the scheme from opening an
account using a notice issued to another person. However, going by the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments, I strongly suspect that his main
point is about the expiry
date.</div><a name="09020315000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Considering
the amendment in isolation, its impact would be that once the notice of
eligibility had been issued it would be valid indefinitely. That would
mean someone who was at one point eligible for a saving gateway account
could open their account at any point in the future, regardless of any
change in their tax credit entitlement circumstances. That is clearly
undesirable. Including an expiry date on a notice of eligibility is
essential to ensure that eligibility for the saving gateway account is
targeted on working-age people on lower incomes, rather than people who
were in that group in the
past.</div><a name="09020315000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I explained to my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet, it is
certainly our intention that those who are eligible and who take up the
saving gateway within the three-month period, even though their
circumstances might have changed, should still open an account.
However, we do not think it is a sensible approach to say that the
notice of eligibility would last for all time and that in five, 10 or
20 years a person would be allowed and be eligible to open a saving
gateway
account.</div><a name="09020315000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
23, which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Fareham, provides
that notices of eligibility would expire after three months, or when
the holder of the notice ceased to be an eligible person. Again, let me
say that our intention is to provide in regulations that all notices of
eligibility will have an expiry date of three months from their date of
issue. However, we do not believe that that should be put in the
Bill.</div><a name="09020315000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
intention is that the notice of eligibility should contribute to the
simplicity of the scheme for account applicants and account providers.
Where an eligible person receives a properly issued notice, we believe
that they should be certain that that entitles them to open an account
with an approved account provider until the expiry date printed on the
notice&#151;provided that they have the necessary connection with the
UK.</div>
<a name="09020315000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that account providers and eligible people will welcome that approach.
It provides certainty and should minimise the number of accounts that
are opened wrongly, as well as allowing people to plan ahead and
consider when they should open an account. However, if amendment 23 was
agreed to, the change in circumstances could mean that that person was
no longer eligible to open an account. In other words, a person who
wanted to open an account would need to be eligible not only at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>the relevant date, which we have just discussed in relation to clause 1,
but at the date on which they opened their
account.</div><a name="09020315000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
considered that aspect carefully and decided against it. If individuals
were required to be eligible at account opening, that would obviously
need to be confirmed in some way. It would also not be possible for the
account provider to check with HMRC, because the saving gateway
database will not have a real-time record of people&#146;s
entitlement to qualifying benefits and tax credits. As I indicated to
my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet, the information will be
transferred periodically. That will be done regularly&#151;probably
fortnightly or monthly, but not in real time.</div>
<a name="09020315000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, if
we were to accept the proposals tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham,
we would have to introduce a new bureaucratic system to ensure that
people were eligible on the date that they opened the account. It would
not be available then to people who were eligible at a particular
time.</div><a name="09020315000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other approach would the individual needing to self-certify their
entitlement to one of the qualifying benefits or tax credits.
Self-certification could also mean accounts needing to be disclosed if
HMRC later found that someone had opened an account when no longer
eligible to do so. Again, that would place additional burdens on
account providers. We are very keen indeed to minimise the burdens
placed on those who intend to offer saving gateway
accounts.</div><a name="09020315000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000319"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for his
explanation and I understand his point about the administrative
convenience of having, say, a three-month eligibility period before the
notice
expires.</div><a name="09020315000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
assessment has the Economic Secretary made of the proportion of people
opening an account who will no longer be eligible for the benefits set
out in clause 3? I am not sure whether dead-weight cost is the right
phrase, but there is a big cost there for people who are not eligible
for the benefits, but who are, due the three-month period, eligible to
open a saving gateway account and perhaps are not in the low-income
categories that the Bill
targets.</div><a name="09020315000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000320"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> That is a perfectly valid point for the hon.
Gentleman to raise. The work that we have done suggests that there will
clearly be some people who are in that category, having moved off
qualifying benefits in the period before the notice of eligibility is
received by them. We do not think that those numbers are likely to be
very high. We believe that the people that we are talking about, who
might have moved off those qualifying benefits, are those we would
generally want to target anyway. While it is true that some people
might move out of entitlement, we estimate that that will be the case
in about 4 per cent. of the accounts that are opened. It is not a
significant
figure.</div><a name="09020315000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000321"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I would like to follow on from the point made by
the hon. Member for Fareham. Does the Economic Secretary envisage that
people who, for example, do seasonal work&#151;where they are perhaps
quite well paid for nine or 10 months of the year, but then do not work
for the remaining two or three months&#151;may see this as an
enticing way to bulk up their savings by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>qualifying during the period when they are not working, even though
their earnings during the year would make them far too wealthy to
qualify in any other circumstances? Have I misunderstood? As I
understand it, they would be eligible to put their names forward so
long as they were claiming benefits during the short period of the year
when they were not working for seasonal
reasons.</div><a name="09020315000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000322"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> If people are on a qualifying benefit, they are
entitled to open a saving gateway account. We have to remember that we
are trying to encourage people who are working but are on relatively
low incomes to save for the future. It is entirely appropriate that
seasonal workers, who might spend some time on qualifying benefits,
should have the opportunity to have a saving gateway
account.</div><a name="09020315000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020315000323"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Mudie</b> (Leeds, East) (Lab): I am taking the
opportunity to ask a question. I want to follow on from the Economic
Secretary&#146;s first contribution about the inefficiencies of HMRC,
which we have found on many occasions. If a qualifying individual turns
up at their MP&#146;s surgery and says, &#147;I did not receive a
notice, I have just heard about it,&#148; will the Department give
that individual a fresh date, provided that they are suitably
qualified?</div><a name="09020315000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000324"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Specifically on that question and the question
raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet, as we made clear,
the expiry date on the notice will normally be three months after it is
issued. We think that that is the right period for people to be able to
access an account. We do not intend that there will be an automatic
repeat notice when that three-month period expires if somebody has not
opened an account. We do not want to keep bombarding people with pieces
of paper, but people who are still eligible can request new notices if
they want to open an account and there will be publicity about saving
gateway accounts because we want to encourage take-up. We will also
have the flexibility to allow us to issue repeat notices, if at some
point in the future we decide that we want do so. We think that that is
a sensible thing to
do.</div><a name="09020315000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000325"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that answer.
I want to take him back to the issue of people who move off eligible
benefits. Is it his intention for the gap between when somebody goes on
to eligible benefits and when they receive an eligibility notice to be
used for targeting the accounts on those who are not on benefits for
only a short time? In other words, if it was a month before somebody
got their eligibility notice and they were out of work for only a week
or two, they would not receive a notice in time to open an account. Is
it the intention deliberately to use that gap in some way to try to
limit the people who might access
it?</div><a name="09020315000272"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09020315000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000326"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> No, it is not our intention deliberately to use
that gap in the way my hon. Friend suggests. We are planning to adopt
the process of a data transfer of names of eligible people from the DWP
to HMRC, which we expect to happen fortnightly or monthly. Some people
who are eligible according to DWP records will have moved off in the
period before HMRC issues 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>the notices and we estimate that figure to be about 4 per cent. We think
it reasonable for those people to be eligible to open a saving gateway
account. Given the administrative complexity involved, we do not think
it sensible to prevent them from opening an account, which is, in
effect, what the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham would
do. The overall eligibility criteria are well targeted and the
Committee heard in evidence what our intentions are and that the Bill
has widespread support.</div>
<a name="09020315000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000327"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Following on from the point raised by the hon.
Member for South Thanet, may I have clarification of whether everyone
who claims JSA, for example, will receive a notice of eligibility, even
if they move off that benefit in the processing time between when they
register and when the information is passed on to HMRC? Therefore, will
everybody who claims JSA receive a notice of eligibility, even if they
are on the register for only a week or a few
days?</div>
<a name="09020315000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000328"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand that that will depend on the time
between when the DWP transfers information and when HMRC receives it.
Somebody might sign on and claim JSA with the DWP, but get a new job
extremely quickly and therefore remove themselves from the record, so
their information would not be transferred. It is likely that an
estimated 4 per cent. of people whose names are on the transferred DWP
data will have a notice issued by HMRC but will have moved on in that
time. I hope that that clarifies the
situation.</div><a name="09020315000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000329"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> To be absolutely clear, the Economic Secretary is
saying that a snapshot will be taken of the people claiming JSA when
the data are transferred from the DWP to HMRC. If a person has moved on
between one snapshot and the next, and is no longer eligible for JSA,
that will not be picked
up.</div><a name="09020315000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000330"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> That is certainly my understanding of how the
system will work. We have been talking about transferring data
regularly&#151;fortnightly or monthly&#151;and few people will fall
into that category. The bigger category will be those who have been
frictionally unemployed and have moved from qualifying benefits into
the mainstream labour market where they do not qualify. That is a
relatively small number of people, but we still believe it right that
they should be entitled to open saving gateway
accounts.</div><a name="09020315000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000331"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The point made by the hon. Member for Fareham is
important, or will at least be thought of as important by those who
come across other people whom they feel are being treated differently
from them. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that person A has been
eligible for JSA for a fortnight and then finds another job. Person B
has also been eligible for JSA for a fortnight and then finds the same
job&#151;they are working together&#151;but person A happens to
come at the point in the cycle at which HMRC is processing that
information and is therefore able retrospectively to apply for a saving
gateway account because he got the letter, even though he is doing the
same job for the same pay as person B.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="09020315000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Person B will
ask why he cannot retrospectively save for the next 102 weeks, or
whatever it is, at the generous 50p matching rate and we will have to
say, &#147;Sorry, HMRC did not process you in the same way.&#148;
That will cause people to come to our constituency surgeries asking why
person A is being treated differently from person B, will it
not?</div><a name="09020315000079"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000332"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the point that the hon. Member is
making and, on grounds of fairness, we should look to ensure that
people are treated identically if they have had similar periods off
benefits. We are talking about a very small number of people, but let
me reflect on the point about how the administrative systems will work.
Clearly, we want to ensure that we treat all people fairly, even if we
are talking about those who are moving quickly from benefits to being
in work at a level where they are not entitled to benefits. I will come
back to the Committee on
that.</div><a name="09020315000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000333"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> I would be grateful if the Economic Secretary
answered my question, which got caught up in other questions. I know
that it was insignificant, but I would still appreciate an answer. I
see from the puzzlement on his face that he has forgotten it. It was
simply about a person who turns up and says that they have not received
an eligibility
indication.</div><a name="09020315000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am anticipating an answer, but that involves time, so I shall ask two
further questions. First, I would like the Economic Secretary to
reconsider the business of following up those who do not take up
benefits. We are conscious of the lack of take-up of various benefits
and we profess to being interested in persuading people to take up
benefits that are profitable to them&#151;this is certainly one. I do
not regard receiving a reminder as being&#151;to use the Economic
Secretary&#146;s
phrase&#151;bombarded.</div><a name="09020315000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second question is simply about data received: four months down the
road, who does an individual who has not received a form, but who has
heard on the community grapevine that they should have received one,
approach at HMRC? That ties up with my first question: will such people
then receive a fresh eligibility date that runs for two
years?</div><a name="09020315000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000334"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I apologise to my hon. Friend for not replying to
his original question. If anybody has been missed, they are entitled to
apply to HMRC for notice of eligibility. I think that that will
probably take into account the situation that the hon. Member for
Taunton talked about as
well.</div><a name="09020315000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
whether we want to issue repeat notices, I want us to get that policy
and legislation implemented, and to have a three-month notice period to
ensure that we promote saving gateway as a programme and to see what
the take-up is. If at some point after that we think that take-up rates
are lower than desired and that it would be a worthwhile use of
resources to issue repeat notices, we would have the flexibility to
consider it. We do not want to say now that we intend to have a rolling
programme of issuing repeat notices a certain number of times. Let us
promote the scheme and ensure that there are clear rules on
eligibility, which is lost after a three-month period. Let us see what
the take-up is, but reserve the right to do more in future if we want
to encourage the savings habit, which we all think is
important.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div><a name="09020315000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000335"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> Will the Economic Secretary answer my third
question? If an individual turns up and says, &#147;I have not
received it,&#148; or, &#147;I did not take it up,&#148; will
they be given a new eligibility date or will they be given a notice
that relates to their first
date?</div><a name="09020315000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000336"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Such a person could request a notice and it would
have that eligibility date on it. It would be round about the time that
the notice was issued to them. It would not be that they were missed
off and discovered it two and a half months later, leaving them with
only a couple of weeks to apply for a saving gateway account; it would
be from the date of the notice of eligibility that was issued. I would
imagine in normal processing terms that that would be a day or two
before it was received, due to the timing of posting arrangements. I
hope that that clarifies
matters.</div><a name="09020315000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000337"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the points he
has made. Also, it was helpful for the Committee to explore those
issues. I particularly appreciate his open-mindedness about ensuing
that there is consistency in the application of eligibility for people
who touch upon that eligibility only before moving on to, for example,
paid employment. I look forward to hearing his response to the
Committee either later in our deliberations or when the Bill returns to
the Chamber for consideration. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09020315000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000338"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 22, in clause 2,
page 2, line 11, after
&#145;person&#146;, insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;but
the person has not opened a Saving Gateway
account&#146;.</div><a name="09020315000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment. Subsection (3)
states:</div><a name="09020315000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Regulations
may provide that the Commissioners may... issue a further notice
of eligibility to an eligible
person&#148;.</div><a name="09020315000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
touched on this subject a little during the previous debate. The clause
does not explain what happens when someone has already opened a saving
gateway account. Are they entitled to receive a further notice of
eligibility? We touched on a broader issue, which we will debate in a
later group of amendments, but it seems fairly straightforward that if
the intention is for people not to have more than one saving gateway
account, it should not be possible to reissue a notice of eligibility
if they already have an
account.</div><a name="09020315000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000339"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendment relates to further notices of
eligibility being sent to people whose original notices have expired.
The Bill already provides that those can be sent only to people who
remain eligible for the saving gateway. The amendment also specifies
that they could be sent only to people who had not already opened a
saving gateway account. I hope to be able to persuade the hon.
Gentleman that that is our intention; it is set out in the draft
regulations, which we have
published.</div><a name="09020315000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Draft
regulation 5(4) provides that a further notice of eligibility may be
issued to an eligible person at the discretion of the commissioners
where the expiry date of a previous notice has passed and the person
has not opened a saving gateway account. That addresses the issues
raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Leeds, East and for South
Thanet.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="09020315000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe it
sensible to put that provision in secondary legislation rather than the
Bill because if the Bill were to prevent HMRC from issuing a further
notice of eligibility, the flexibility for people to be given the
chance to have a second saving gateway account during their lifetime
would be removed. While at the moment we do not intend to offer a
second account, it is sensible and prudent to establish that if the
Government felt that appropriate, primary legislation would not be
required.</div><a name="09020315000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
clause 6(5), which we shall debate in due course, along with amendment
30, we have ensured flexibility to change our position. I hope that the
hon. Member for Fareham is reassured that we intend further notices of
eligibility to be sent only to people who have not already opened a
saving gateway account. I hope that his probing has given him the
answers he seeks and that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09020315000273"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

Bill.</div><a name="09020315000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000341"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Given the long time we have spent on it, the
Committee might have thought that we had exhausted every possible
question about a clause that has only about 10 lines. However, I have
two questions. One is about ensuring that the notices of eligibility
are issued. Some benefits are administered by HMRC and some by the DWP.
How will HMRC ensure that people receive only one notice and not a
blizzard? The second question is about the information in the notice. I
know that this is covered by regulation, but in last week&#146;s
evidence session, the account providers mentioned the administrative
cost of the accounts, and said that the likely cost would have an
impact on whether they were prepared to offer them. One way to reduce
the administrative cost to account providers is to give sufficient
information in the notice to ensure that providers do not need to go
through the usual account-opening process, which can be laborious and
time-consuming. I wonder whether that information will be sufficient
for providers to take as given a person&#146;s name and address. Will
the Economic Secretary clarify
that?</div><a name="09020315000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000342"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Now that we have reached the end of clause 2, it
is worth putting some thoughts on the record. It seems to me&#151;the
Economic Secretary will confirm whether this is the
intention&#151;that clauses 1 and 2 are about simplifying the
accounts to keep the cost as low as possible. The bankers and the
representatives from whom we took evidence made it clear that some of
them were reluctant to take on the accounts, because of the operational
costs. Given what we now know about the banking industry in this
country, I would have thought that the bankers might be keen to do
something pro bono and show themselves occasionally to be doing
something for the public good, but clearly that is not their intention.
They made it clear that if there is no profit they may not be prepared
to operate the
accounts.</div><a name="09020315000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Economic Secretary and his team have tried to think of ways to keep the
process as simple and foolproof as possible, and I applaud him for
that. The problem is  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>that if things are kept simple, inefficiencies and unfairnesses are
introduced. We need to be absolutely open about those unfairnesses and
inefficiencies so that in five years&#146; time when we read the
article in the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i> pointing out how many people who
perhaps otherwise should not have got one of these accounts have
managed to get one, or we read the stories from Opposition Members
about how many people have been to their surgeries complaining that
they have not been able to get one of the accounts when they should
have been able to do so, we have it on the record that we did this with
our eyes open and we knew that there would be
inefficiencies.</div><a name="09020315000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend has made it clear that he will reflect on the questions
that have been asked about the potential unfairnesses. That is a
generous offer, but I encourage him to reflect thoroughly and to spell
out on Report what the potential unfairnesses are. Some are quite
obvious. Some Opposition Members will lose their seats at the next
general election, and I hope that they will be eligible for
jobseeker&#146;s allowance for only a short period. Nevertheless,
they will be entitled to open a saving gateway account during that
period. Good luck to them&#151;they deserve to get some bounty from
the Labour Government&#151;but we must accept that we have built that
level of poor targeting into the Bill.</div>
<a name="09020315000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Leeds, East pointed out in his questioning, it is
more important that some of our constituents are genuinely the people
we want to target with these accounts, but those who are fortunate
enough to get work quickly may not receive their eligibility notice in
time, so they will come to us as Members of Parliament and say that it
is not right that they could not open such an account. We must be able
to explain to them the rationale behind the
measure.</div><a name="09020315000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the Minister said that repeat eligibility notices will not be issued. I
understand why he takes that view, but I encourage him to say that at
least one repeat notice should be sent to people who are still eligible
for the gateway saving account at the end of the three-month period.
Some people will be new to receiving benefits, because they will be out
of work for the first time. They may be unsure of how to budget and
wonder whether they can afford to put the money away. Three months
later, when they have managed to get their life in order, they may
realise that they could have afforded it. I encourage the Minister to
support at least one more
notice.</div><a name="09020315000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000343"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman share my view that concern
about bombarding our constituents with correspondence does not seem to
weigh as heavily on the minds of Government Ministers when the
constituent concerned is indebted to Government agencies rather than
eligible for financial
support?</div><a name="09020315000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000344"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I would not take that cynical view of Government
for one second. Making these accounts available is good news for our
constituents. If the Government were interested in currying favour with
our constituents, they would say that they are going to bombard them
with these
notices.</div><a name="09020315000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there are not to be repeated eligibility notices, at least one more
notice should be sent out at the end of the three-month period, telling
people that they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>entitled to take up an account at any time until they cease to be
eligible under the system. It should say that we will not send them
more notices but that they should keep it in mind that they can still
set up an account. The purpose of the accounts is to encourage saving.
They are not intended to make a lot of money for anybody or to help to
reduce Government indebtedness by getting massive savings into the
banks. They are intended to encourage a state of mind. Therefore, I
think that it is worth sending one more reminder after three months
telling people that they continue to be eligible for these accounts,
even if that is the final reminder. I would like my hon. Friend to keep
those things in mind and to put some of his thoughts on the record on
Report.</div><a name="09020315000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000345"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Although the clause is just over eight lines
long, it has produced a number of debating points. However, I think
that it is important and that it should stand part of the Bill. I do
not think that there is any dispute about that, but I will respond to
the comments that have been
made.</div><a name="09020315000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham raised a number of operational points on how
the detail of the clause will work. Our intention is that the HMRC
system should be designed to ensure that only one notice of eligibility
is issued at a time. It will eliminate any duplication from the
different qualifying benefits. If somebody is eligible through more
than one route, that will be taken into
account.</div><a name="09020315000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
might have confused the Committee when talking about jobseeker&#146;s
allowance and the transfer of data. Having thought through the matter
more clearly, there might be some data transfer issues. It is clear in
my mind and in the legislation that eligible persons under clause 3
will be entitled to open a saving gateway account. We must ensure that
the administrative arrangements are sufficiently robust so that people
who move on and off the jobseeker&#146;s allowance register quickly
are not inconvenienced and do not have to go to the trouble of making a
separate request to
HMRC.</div><a name="09020315000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked what proof of identity will be needed to open
an account and whether a notice of eligibility will give sufficient
assurance by providing the name and address. What evidence they accept
as proof of identity or address is a matter for the providers. We will
work with them and financial inclusion groups to explore how
providers&#146; ID requirements can best be balanced with the need to
prevent the account opening process becoming an obstacle for savers. We
want it to be as simple as possible, but we must ensure that basic
checks are
made.</div><a name="09020315000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000346"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> It has just occurred to me that we have
introduced legislation intended to combat money laundering that
requires people to produce certain identification when they open bank
accounts. I advise my hon. Friend to ensure that there is no conflict
between the Bill and the requirements of money laundering
legislation.</div><a name="09020315000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000347"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. There is no
intention that there will be any such conflict. We will continue to
hold discussions with the banks to ensure that we get the provisions
right.</div><a name="09020315000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Duplicate
notices may be issued if people lose their first notice. If they find
the initial notice at a later date, they might be tempted to open two
saving gateway accounts. Clearly, that should not be possible. Draft 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>regulation 13(2)(a) makes it clear that people opening accounts will be
required to declare that they have not opened a gateway saving account
previously. The hon. Member for Fareham, too, raised the issue of
duplication, but I think I have given the assurances that he wants.
There is already a process to ensure that individuals cannot open
multiple individual savings accounts, so we are familiar with this
area. I have no reason to believe that we will not be able to deal with
this matter in a satisfactory
manner.</div><a name="09020315000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet made a number of additional
points. We will come on to the reason why non-income related benefits
such as contributory jobseeker&#146;s allowance are included under
amendments 26 and 27, so perhaps he will allow me to leave
the issue until then. I have two things to say on issuing reminders.
First, there is a great opportunity for all MPs to campaign to promote
saving gateway accounts in their communities. I hope that we will
facilitate that as a
Government.</div><a name="09020315000274"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09020315000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not know at the moment what the likely take-up of saving gateway
accounts will be. We obviously want to ensure that it is as high as
possible. We will consider whether to have further notices in future,
but we do not have to include that in this legislation, nor is it an
impediment to making progress on the Bill. If we decide to do so in
future, it will be a policy decision taken in the ordinary way. I take
my hon. Friend&#146;s point that we want to encourage this policy to
be a success: we want people to get into the savings habit, we want to
make it as easy as possible, and we want to remind them of this
opportunity. In that spirit, I hope he will appreciate the flexible way
we are proceeding with the
legislation.</div><a name="09020315000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

clause 3, page 2, line 17, leave out
paragraph
(b).</div><a name="09020315000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a simple, clarifying amendment. Clause 3 (1)(b) says
that</div><a name="09020315000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
person has a connection with the United Kingdom of a kind prescribed by
regulations.&#148;</div><a name="09020315000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless
I have not fully understood the nature of those regulations, I am
slightly uncomfortable with the vagueness of the phrase, &#147;a
connection with the United Kingdom&#148;. I have connection with all
kinds of countries without necessarily expecting to be eligible for
financial support from them. Subsection (2) lists as specific
criteria</div><a name="09020315000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;income
support; employment and support allowance; jobseeker&#146;s
allowance&#148;</div><a name="09020315000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
so on. There are seven different criteria of eligibility. If one were
eligible under one or more of those seven criteria, one would imagine
that one also had a connection with the UK. After all, one does not
qualify for JSA in the UK if one has no connection with this country.
Otherwise, there would be billions of people getting UK JSA. The point
I seek to draw out in this amendment stems from the fact that I do not
understand the need to specify the connection with the UK when it is
implicit in the nature of the list of
entitlements.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="09020315000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000349"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendment would remove the requirement that a
person must have that connection with the UK to be eligible for the
saving gateway account. As a result, any person entitled to a
qualifying benefit or tax credits would be eligible. A person may, in
certain circumstances, continue to be entitled to certain qualifying
benefits and tax credits, even though they no longer live in the UK,
provided they still satisfy all the other conditions for entitlement.
While there are good reasons for them to be able to continue to claim
their benefit or tax credit when they no longer live or work in the UK,
we do not believe that that is the case for the saving gateway account.
The connection with the UK that individuals need to be eligible for the
saving gateway account will be set out in regulations. The relevant
draft regulations have been published and I hope that they will be
available shortly, if that is not already the
case.</div><a name="09020315000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Very
broadly, those who live or work in the UK, as well as being entitled to
a qualifying benefit or tax credit, will be able to open a saving
gateway account. That will also include Crown servants posted abroad
and their partners, and people who are ordinarily resident in the UK
but are temporarily absent. That is one reason why the legislation is
phrased in that way. It will exclude, however, people claiming
incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance or contribution-based
employment and support allowance who move out of the UK permanently,
although they may still be able to claim the underlying benefit. It
will also exclude people who are not ordinarily resident in the UK but
who would otherwise be eligible for the saving gateway through a joint
claim to one of the qualifying benefits or tax credits such as child
tax credit.</div>
<a name="09020315000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that this might be slightly complicated, but the key point is that that
presents no problem for the vast majority of people who are ordinarily
resident in the United Kingdom. We are trying to introduce a system
that is as simple as possible. We think that Crown servants posted
abroad should be entitled if they qualify, as should people who are
ordinarily resident here but who are temporarily absent, perhaps
because they are working or have activities abroad that take them there
for a period of time. We do not think that people who are not
ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom should be able to open a
saving gateway account. That does not seem to us to be a very targeted
use of taxpayers&#146; money. I hope that that clarifies the points
that have emerged. The regulations, which I am sure we will consider in
due course, explain this in more detail, and no doubt we will return to
them later.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000350"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Just in case any Member is not aware and
in the light of the point of order raised by the hon. Member for
Fareham, copies of those draft regulations are now available in the
Room. Connection with the UK is addressed on page
5.</div><a name="09020315000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000351"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful to be made aware of that,
Mr. Bercow. I do not doubt that it is possible to come up
with a whole list of criteria and regulations which satisfy the
drafters in the Minister&#146;s Department. The concern often
expressed is that it is very difficult for members of the public to
understand who is, or is not, eligible for certain entitlements, and
why they are not eligible when someone they know who appears to be in
similar circumstance is eligible. This is typical work for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>an MP, both in their surgeries and in correspondence. It is strange to
have a list of criteria, one or more item of which has to be satisfied,
then come up with a separate category which is defined in regulation by
another list of criteria.</div>
<a name="09020315000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">This may be
for the DWP rather than the Treasury, but quite a few people would find
it strange that there are people claiming benefits who are essentially
receiving money directly from the UK Government despite having no
connection with the United Kingdom of a type laid out in the
regulations. I think that most people would feel that if someone had no
connection with the UK they should not be receiving the benefits listed
in subsection (2). There may be co-ordinating criteria
explaining why it is so much easier to get benefits than it is to open
one of the new saving gateway accounts and why our taxes are being
spent on people who have no connection whatsoever with the UK, but I
sense the Economic Secretary is not keen to add the type of clarity
that I would wish to see. On that basis, having made my point, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09020315000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 26, in clause 3,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000353"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000354"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> These amendments relate to entitlement, which was
alluded to in an earlier debate. They would insert the phrase
&#147;income-based&#148; in subsection (2)(b) and (c). At the
moment, employment and support allowance and jobseeker&#146;s
allowance can be claimed on either an income or on a contributions
basis. We want to make sure&#151;and the Economic Secretary made this
point in his response to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for
Taunton&#151;that the resources are targeted well and carefully on
the demographic that we want to develop a saving habit. The hon. Member
for South Thanet talked about MPs losing their seats in the next
election and being able to claim contributions-based JSA, open a saving
gateway account, then moving out. Perhaps the House authorities might
take that into account and put it in a leaver&#146;s pack for MPs at
the next election. It is an example of people who could claim the
contributions-based JSA, see the opportunity to put &#163;600 into an
account, and get &#163;300 back from the Government. That is a good
rate of return, and probably reflects a dead-weight cost. I think the
second pilot was meant to reduce the income threshold so that people
who were already saving or were in a position to save were not
diverting savings from a different account to benefit from the 50 p in
the pound match. The amendment seeks to narrow down eligibility to
those who are claiming income-based JSA or employment and support
allowance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000357"></a>Mr.

intervene. I will give way to the hon. Member for Taunton first and
then to the hon. Member for South Thanet.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div><a name="09020315000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000358"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way
to me first. I understand his desire to try to reduce dead-weight
costs, and I share that instinct. However, I am always concerned when
the complication of any scheme acts as a disincentive preventing people
from participating in it. In particular&#151;obviously, I am making a
generalisation&#151;I am talking about people who are on low incomes
and may not necessarily have saved in the past or be familiar with the
mechanisms for saving. Is it not a worthwhile consideration, even it
may slightly increase dead-weight costs, to make sure that people are
not disincentivised to save because they find the systems
intimidatingly complicated?</div>
<a name="09020315000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000359"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not sure that I agree that that point applies
to the design of the system, because we have already introduced some
complexity, through the reference to whether someone is ordinarily
resident in the UK.  I do not think that is a huge increase in
complexity, but I do think there is a need&#151;and I would be
grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on this, and it is partly
why I tabled this amendment&#151;to understand the demographics of
the group claiming JSA on the basis of national insurance
contributions. One of the points made in the evidence session last week
by Teresa Perchard of the CAB, and by Brian Pomeroy as well, was that a
high proportion of people who claim contributions-based JSA are on low
incomes. They could, by virtue of the eligibility criteria, help to
develop a savings culture through their entitlement to open a saving
gateway account.</div>
<a name="09020315000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister says, &#147;Yes, there is a high proportion of people in
that demographic group claiming contributions-based JSA who are on low
incomes, and it is right to enable them to acquire a savings gateway
account&#148;, I am quite content with that explanation. I am just
probing the rationale for including contributions-based JSA, which
would potentially allow quite a large number of people to open a saving
gateway account even though they are outside the target demographic for
this initiative.</div>
<a name="09020315000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000360"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I cannot recollect whether the hon. Gentleman was
in the Chamber yesterday for DWP questions, but it was a recurrent
theme among Conservative Members that there is insufficient difference
between the benefits people get, having paid contributions all their
lives, and the benefits they get if they had not paid any contributions
when they became unemployed. It seems ironic that, if that is the view
of the Conservative party, he should suggest that we should narrow
again the difference between the benefits that people receive, whether
they are claiming income-based JSA or contribution-based JSA. Not to
make this benefit available to those who have made contributions would
be very unpopular among Conservative
Members.</div><a name="09020315000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000361"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. It
is certainly a point that has been raised with me by my constituents. I
received a letter last week from someone who had paid national
insurance contributions all their life. When they claimed JSA at
&#163;60 a week, because they were single, they wondered why they had
bothered to pay for that benefit, and wondered what they got in return
for their contributions. The hon. Gentleman makes a very important
point, but we are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>trying to ensure that this initiative is well targeted. We should think
about the potential leakage to people who are already saving, and we
should ensure that our approach provides value for money. I tabled
amendments 26 and 27, not simply to press them to a vote, but to obtain
clarification from the Government about the impact of extending the
measure to people who claim JSA on the basis of their contributions. It
is a big part of the teasing-out process, which is important for
scrutiny in the
House.</div><a name="09020315000275"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09020315000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
may argue that capping the contribution at &#163;25 a month might
reduce the extent to which the measure could be taken advantage of by
people who have savings in other sources and who want to switch from an
ISA or an instant-access savings account to a saving gateway account.
Perhaps the Government&#146;s objective is to try and broaden the
eligibility criteria as far as possible, within reasonable boundaries,
while preventing&#151;I do not like the word
&#147;abuse&#148;&#151;people from taking advantage of it, by
limiting the amount of money that they can pay into the account. That
would be
reasonable.</div><a name="09020315000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
are probing amendments. What will the impact be of enabling people who
qualify for JSA based on their national insurance contributions to take
up the saving gateway account? Are people who claim contributions-based
JSA in the target demographic for the saving gateway account, as
suggested in the evidence session last Tuesday? Those people do not
have a history of saving and this would be a good way for them to
acquire that savings
culture.</div>
<a name="09020315000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000362"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I accept the probing nature of
amendments 26 and 27, and I am happy to put the
Government&#146;s thinking on record. To summarise, we think that
most people on contributory JSA would be moving from one low-income job
to another. We do not have incredibly good data on that, but it is our
strong view that that is the case. Given the advantages of passporting
from qualifying benefits and tax credits in the Bill, it is the
appropriate way to go. I shall provide the hon. Gentleman with a little
more detail because, as he is aware, the amendments would restrict
entitlement to individuals who are on the income-based forms of JSA and
ESA.</div>
<a name="09020315000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the points that the hon. Member for Fareham has made. Some
contribution-based JSA and ESA claimants might have relatively high
levels of savings, but we do not believe that it is the case. In any
system of passporting, there are some rough edges. However, the
advantages of passporting outweigh the disadvantages, particularly the
fact that some people with relatively high savings might qualify. The
fact that people will not be required to fill out a form or complete a
means test to prove that they are eligible for a saving gateway account
is an important part of the programme. As the hon. Gentleman rightly
says, if we are talking about a small number of people who have
relatively high levels of savings, the sort of incentives that the
saving gateway will provide would not have a great attraction to
them.</div>
<a name="09020315000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to give a little more detail, starting with contribution-based JSA.
Sharon Collard, of the personal finance research centre at the
university of Bristol, told the Committee at last week&#146;s
evidence session that</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div><a name="09020315000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;people moving
off...JSA are unlikely to be moving into highly paid employment. We
know that that is the case.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Saving Gateway Accounts Public Bill Committee, </i>27 January
2009; c. 24,
Q48.]</div><a name="09020315000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to have better information on the numbers involved, but it does
not seem to be available. We would be concerned that if
contribution-based JSA were not a qualifying benefit, people who move
in and out of work frequently and do not therefore move on to
income-based JSA&#151;we have good evidence about such
people&#151;would not be eligible for the saving gateway account. In
October last year, the average time spent on JSA was 3.7 months, but
most people will not move from contribution-based JSA to income-based
JSA until they have been on JSA for about six
months.</div><a name="09020315000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inclusion
of contribution-based JSA was supported by Teresa Perchard of Citizens
Advice in last week&#146;s evidence session. On the question of
whether both income-based and contribution-based JSA should be
qualifying benefits, she
said:</div><a name="09020315000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sticking
with broad availability for both groups is
appropriate&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Saving
Gateway Accounts Public Bill Committee, </i>27 January 2009; c. 7,
Q16.]</div><a name="09020315000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
research and evidence points to that being the appropriate thing to do.
Similar arguments apply to contribution-based ESA, so I do not need to
rehearse
them.</div><a name="09020315000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
it is important to remember that many people who are entitled to both
JSA and ESA on the basis of their national insurance contributions will
meet the income and capital requirements for the income-based benefits.
The amendment would penalise those people on the basis of the national
insurance contributions that they had paid. That is another reason why
the hon. Gentleman will want to withdraw the amendment, although he is
right to raise the problem of potential dead-weight costs. I hope that
my explanations have reassured him that while the policy has some rough
edges it is a sensible way to proceed, compared with significant
means-testing for all
applicants.</div><a name="09020315000150"></a>

When looking at a scheme one has to be pragmatic. I am sure that at
some point the Opposition will point out that footballers or former
Cabinet Ministers have set up savings gateway accounts. There will be a
rich seam of cheap headlines, and hon. Members will perhaps want to
participate in their generation. A compromise has to be struck. I
accept the Economic Secretary&#146;s point that the vast majority of
people claiming contribution-based JSA will be in the target
demographic. Some will fall outside it, but compromises need to be made
when looking at implementing the proposals. With the Economic
Secretary&#146;s reassurance in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="09020315000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000366"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Amendment 5 is a probing amendment in support of
campaigns by the RNIB and Carers UK among others to include additional
income replacement benefits in the list of qualifying benefits in
subsection (2). That list contains seven benefits and tax credits that
confer eligibility. These organisations have suggested that the list
should include carer&#146;s allowance, housing benefit and council
tax benefit. The allowances and tax credits in the list are not all of
the same type: some are means-tested and some are not; some apply to
income of less than &#163;16,040 a year and some do not. There are no
uniform criteria for the seven listed in the Bill, so there is no
inherent reason why other forms of benefit or support could not be
considered in addition to those seven.</div>
<a name="09020315000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
briefly make the case as to why the Minister may wish to consider
carer&#146;s benefit in particular. According to a report by Carers
UK, 75 per cent. of carers struggle to pay their bills and 54 per cent.
of those carers were in debt. This is becoming an even more prevalent
issue&#151;ironically, given that society as a whole is becoming
healthier&#151; because people are having to look after relatives who
are ill, for one reason or another. If carer&#146;s allowance were
included in the list, 290,000 more people would be eligible for the
saving gateway. Many of those people&#151;although I admit not
all&#151;would be precisely the types of people that the Minister may
be keenest to help and encourage through this legislation. However, if
this amendment were not accepted, they would not be eligible for that
assistance and encouragement. It is on that basis that I table this
amendment.</div>
<a name="09020315000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000367"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Amendment 39 is in my name, and it is essentially
exactly the same as amendment 5. It is probably appropriate at this
point for me to reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney, who is
the Government Whip on this Bill, that the amendments I have tabled for
today are of a probing nature. I do not intend to damage my impeccable
record of support for the Government any time soon, although I have a
great deal of sympathy for this particular amendment. However, if my
hon. Friend the Economic Secretary does not come up with a good
explanation as to why carer&#146;s allowance is not included, I
suspect that this is something to which the House might want to return
on Report.</div>
<a name="09020315000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">At one point,
I had the honour of being the Minister responsible for carers, so I am
aware of their incredible work. It has been estimated that this work
has a value to the country of more than &#163;70 billion a year,
which is the cost that would be imposed on us if we had to provide this
care professionally. I am also aware that the Prime Minister is
evangelistic about the need to encourage people to care and in his wish
for the Government to support carers, so he would want to see us doing
everything possible to make life better for
them.</div><a name="09020315000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are potentially two arguments that the Economic Secretary might muster
for not including carer&#146;s allowance. The first is that it is a
poor way of targeting resources&#151;some carers might not be part of
our target audience for such savings accounts. However, if the Economic
Secretary musters that argument, he has to return to the amendments 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>that the hon. Member for Fareham has tabled, relating to why we are not
limiting those people on jobseeker&#146;s allowance to income-based
jobseeker&#146;s allowance, rather than making it contribution-based.
You cannot say in one part of the Bill that we have to target a benefit
tightly, and in another part say that we want to simplify a benefit and
not target it tightly. I do not accept the argument that it is about
targeting.</div>
<a name="09020315000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
potential argument that my hon. Friend might muster is that an awful
lot of the people who would be entitled because they are carers will be
entitled to open one of these savings accounts because they are
claiming one of the other eligible benefits. If that is the case and
there would not be many of them in addition, it will not cost much to
include them, so we might as well do the right thing by
carers.</div>
<a name="09020315000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I encourage
my hon. Friend&#151;not just today, when he responds, but in the
weeks to come before Report&#151;to think very carefully about the
benefits of including carer&#146;s allowance in this, including
sending out a signal that we will never treat carers as being in the
second tier of our thoughts. They are people whom we always want to
encourage, whose value we recognise and who we believe are entitled to
a bit of extra help. If this is that bit of extra help that we can
offer on this occasion, why not? Let us include them in it. I ask my
hon. Friend to reflect on that in the weeks
ahead.</div><a name="09020315000276"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000368"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I appreciate the probing manner in which both the
hon. Member for Taunton and my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet
have dealt with the
amendments.</div><a name="09020315000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
Government have done more for carers than any previous Government, much
of which was done by my hon. Friend when he was the Minister with
responsibility for carers. I would continue to stress that carers are
in the first tier of our minds when it comes to taking action to
provide them with support. They were too often forgotten by previous
Governments and I am glad that they have not been by this
one.</div><a name="09020315000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that either amendment would make eligible more people from our
target group, which, let us be clear, is working-age people on lower
incomes. When framing legislation, we have to look at how we can best
target it while accepting that if we are trying to do something simple
and broad then there will be some rough edges. When we are talking
about people on contributory JSA for instance, as we were previously,
we believe that the vast bulk will be moving from one low-income job to
another. It is right, therefore, that contributory JSA is included
rather than
excluded.</div><a name="09020315000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important, however, to recognise that many working-age, lower-income
recipients of one or more of the benefits in amendments 5 and 39, may
already be eligible for the saving gateway through entitlement to
another qualifying benefit or tax credit. Adding any of those benefits
to the list in clause 3(2) would also make eligible people from outside
our target group of working-age people on lower incomes, either because
they are not working-age or because they have relatively high
incomes.</div><a name="09020315000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000369"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> My understanding is that carer&#146;s allowance
is an income replacement benefit. One of the most common complaints
that I receive about it as a Member 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>of Parliament is that it is lost upon reaching retirement age because
one cannot have two income replacement benefits. By definition, people
who are receiving carer&#146;s allowance are of working age and have
given up income. It seems to me that they absolutely fall into the
category that my hon. Friend is trying to
target.</div><a name="09020315000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000370"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Let me go on to explain the situation. First,
carers are not excluded from the saving gateway. Those who are in
low-income households will be able to claim income support, including
the carer&#146;s premium, in addition to carer&#146;s allowance.
There is also a carer&#146;s premium in JSA, another qualifying
benefit. People who are entitled to either income support or JSA will,
as hon. Members will know, be eligible for the saving gateway. Overall,
therefore, we expect around 225,000 recipients of carer&#146;s
allowance to be eligible for the saving
gateway.</div><a name="09020315000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000371"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I cannot help thinking that many of the people on
the list that my hon. Friend has just read out will actually be the
person being cared for and not the carer. Someone who has given up
their job in order to care for somebody&#151;possibly not in the same
household, but still as their primary carer&#151;would be excluded
from the saving gateway on that basis. It is clear from my hon.
Friend&#146;s tone that he does not want to exclude those kinds of
people from it, but they would be on that
basis.</div><a name="09020315000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000372"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I have said, I do not have a detailed
breakdown of the figures, within that total, of those who might be
carers or being cared for. Certainly, we believe that about 225,000
recipients of carer&#146;s allowance will be eligible for the saving
gateway. Making carer&#146;s allowance a qualifying benefit would
bring many people into eligibility who we believe are outside our
target group. Honourable Members will be aware that carer&#146;s
allowance is available to people who care for a severely disabled
person and have earnings lower than &#163;95 per week, who, by any
definition, would qualify as people on low incomes.</div>
<a name="09020315000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
while all recipients of carer&#146;s allowance will have low
individual earnings, it is not limited to those in low-income
households. Extending the scheme to all carers could bring into
eligibility some people with higher household incomes. It would also
bring many people who are not working age into the scheme. Of some
875,000 people entitled to carer&#146;s allowance, about 500,000 are
of working age, leaving 375,000 who are not. We have been very clear
that the saving gateway is for working-age people on low
incomes.</div>
<a name="09020315000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
none of this means that we do not recognise and support the important
role that carers play in our society. I want to be very clear that many
carers will be eligible for the saving gateway, particularly through
income support and jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Our view is that
making carer&#146;s allowance itself a qualifying benefit would not
be well-targeted, but I appreciate the points made by my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="09020315000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000373"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> This is just a thought on what the Economic
Secretary said. Is it beyond the wit of the Department to put something
in the Bill&#151;I do not know if it is elsewhere in the Bill, but it
could be inserted&#151;that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>excludes carers who are not of working age? If that is a specific
objection, it can be easily dealt with via a minor
amendment.</div><a name="09020315000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000374"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will certainly undertake to reflect on that
point. Some 375,000 are on carer&#146;s allowance who are not of
working age, and 225,000 are on carer&#146;s allowance who would
qualify for a saving gateway account because of their receipt of other
benefits, so this is an appropriate way of
targeting.</div>
<a name="09020315000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000375"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> I would not wish my hon. Friend simply to consider
that isolated point, but rather to consider the whole amendment. I do
not think that he can do one without doing the other. I am sad that my
hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet introduced it as a probing
amendment. I think that there will be a widespread feeling in Committee
that this is an important amendment for those who save the Government
enormous amounts of money by caring, and it deserves consideration in
its entirety, not just on the age-related
question.</div><a name="09020315000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000376"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will certainly undertake to go away and reflect
further on the points that have been made. As a Government, we have
been and continue to be very supportive of carers. However, we have to
be clear about what we are trying to achieve through the Bill. It is to
encourage saving among working-age people on low incomes, and a
significant number of carers are not in that category because they are
not of working
age.</div><a name="09020315000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000377"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I would be grateful if my hon. Friend could help
us before Report by writing to Committee members with a breakdown of
the people who he believes claim carer&#146;s allowance, but who are
not of working age. I do not see how anyone can claim an income
replacement benefit if they are not of working age. The only people to
whom that might apply would be young carers or people who have passed
retirement age but are taking carer&#146;s allowance rather than
their pension. I would have thought that we would want to encourage
young carers to save, but I do not think that they are eligible for
carer&#146;s allowance, and I cannot imagine that many people receive
carer&#146;s allowance rather than pension. I do not know where the
figure of 375,000 comes from, and I would be grateful if my hon. Friend
could provide us with details of that before Report. As I said earlier,
I suspect that we will return to this
discussion.</div><a name="09020315000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000378"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will see whether I can do that. It might be
possible to discuss this matter under a later clause. If not, I will
happily write to the Committee to make available any information we
have.</div><a name="09020315000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000379"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> The Minister is opposing amendment 39 on the basis
that some carers may have high incomes, but in the regulations he has
taken care to put a limit of &#163;16,000 on applicants who receive
working tax credit and child tax credit. He has put that limit on
working tax credit, so why is he not prepared to look at the same
mechanism so that it is fair for carers who receive below
&#163;16,000, &#163;10,000 or even
&#163;8,000?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div><a name="09020315000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000380"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is possible to impose such limits without
having a means-testing regime because of the income thresholds. The
current Government view is that some carers will be able to open saving
gateway accounts because they receive another qualifying benefit. We
expect that figure to be about 225,000. However, we are proposing that
two categories of carer&#151;those in high income households and
those who are not of working age&#151;should not be eligible for
saving gateway accounts. I will undertake to provide figures because
further clarification is needed in those
areas.</div><a name="09020315000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar
arguments apply for the insertion of housing benefit and council tax
benefit under amendment 5, which was tabled by the hon. Member for
Taunton. Many people who are eligible for those benefits are outside
our target group. Of the 5 million families in receipt of council tax
benefit, just 50 per cent. are of working age. Of the 4 million who are
eligible for housing benefit, the figure is 63 per
cent.</div><a name="09020315000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
recipients of those benefits may also be on relatively high incomes
depending on the rent and council tax that they pay. If those benefits
were included in the Bill, large numbers of people from outside the
intended target group would be eligible. As with carer&#146;s
allowance, many recipients of housing benefit and council tax benefit
who are in the intended target group will be eligible through another
qualifying benefit. We do not believe that including those benefits
would target people
well.</div><a name="09020315000181"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000381"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the Minister explain at what income somebody
ceases to be eligible for housing benefit or council tax benefit? It is

excluding those
benefits.</div><a name="09020315000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000382"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not have the figures immediately to hand. If
I cannot make them available during the debate, I will happily write to
the Committee about those areas. My key point is that the amendments
are not well targeted. In the case of housing benefit, half of
recipients are not of working age. We are clear about the fact that the
intention of saving gateway is to encourage the saving habit among
people who are of working age and on low incomes. It is not possible
for us to support the
amendments.</div><a name="09020315000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">None
of this means that we do not recognise and support the role that carers
play in our society, or recognise the importance of council tax benefit
and housing benefit for those who require it. Many people are eligible
for those benefits; if they have another qualifying benefit, we will be
able to secure them. However, it remains our view that, with housing
benefit and council tax benefit in particular, the proposal is not well
targeted; it is not what we want to achieve in terms of the
Bill&#146;s objectives. I appreciate the probing nature of the
amendment, but I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000383"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> That was extremely useful, and I appreciate the
contributions made by other Members. However, I still do not quite
understand the point. The Economic Secretary was on the thinnest ice
when he said that most of the people who qualify for carer&#146;s
benefit would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>probably be scooped up by other criteria in the Bill, in which case not
many people would be disadvantaged. That seems to reinforce the
argument for including them on the basis that the cost is presumably
negligible, because most of them already qualify by other means. It
would feel even more iniquitous to those who do not qualify by other
means, when they see that they are in a relatively small minority and
others who appear to be in similar circumstances to them are
qualifying.</div>
<a name="09020315000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
reasonable point about how we treat carers and the impression that is
given to them. I do not know whether the Economic Secretary has made
any assumption; my impression is that many carers would not choose to
open one of these accounts. They might feel that there were other
things that they wished to do with their limited income than put it
into such a savings scheme. Even if they did, they might not put the
full amount of money to which they are entitled into the
scheme.</div><a name="09020315000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
imagine that the cost to the Government of including those carers who
do not qualify by other criteria and who would be inclined to use the
scheme to its maximum is fairly small&#151;I am guessing: if the
Economic Secretary has any estimate, it would be interesting for the
Committee to hear it. The number of people involved is, I think, fairly
small, but they would regard that as a gesture of good will. Although I
do not intend to press the amendment to a vote, I think the interest
that has been expressed in it by the Liberal Democrats and by Labour
members of the Committee is well intentioned and worthy of the Economic
Secretary&#146;s reflection. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

entitled to a benefit or tax credit with another person is eligible to

not.&#146;.</div><a name="09020315000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment which seeks some clarity. It does not need to
detain the Committee for long. The Bill states:</div>
<a name="09020315000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person is
&#145;entitled&#146; to a benefit or tax credit whether the person
is entitled to the benefit or tax credit alone or with another
person.&#148;</div><a name="09020315000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the wording does not make it clear whether two people who together
qualify for a benefit or tax credit would be eligible to do so
independently of each other. I seek the Government&#146;s assurance
that both individuals would be allowed to open their own separate
saving gateway accounts if they both collectively met the criteria for
qualification. At present, there seems a lack of clarity between the
criteria for eligibility and whether two individuals can be assessed
separately and could, therefore, both open an
account.</div><a name="09020315000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000385"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The purpose of the amendment appears to be to
ensure that, with a joint claim to one of the qualifying benefits and
tax credits, both parties are eligible for the saving gateway. That is
already the effect of clause 3(3), which says that, for the purposes of
the
Bill,</div><a name="09020315000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
person is entitled to a benefit or tax credit whether the person is

<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div><a name="09020315000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view is that that is
straightforward and really puts the matter beyond doubt. Therefore, we
do not believe that the amendment is necessary. Indeed, the effect of
the amendment would be different because it would not limit benefit or
tax credit to the qualifying benefits and tax credits listed in clause
3(2). For tax credits, there is no limit in relation to the income
threshold set out in regulations under clause 3(4). There is also no
limit in relation to connection with the UK. So, the amendment is
defective and I urge hon. Members to resist it. If it is probing, I am
happy to confirm that both individuals will be entitled to take out
saving gateway
accounts.</div><a name="09020315000193"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000390"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 25, in
clause 3, page 2, line 36, leave
out sub-paragraph
(a).</div><a name="09020315000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000391"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Amendments 24 and 25 would include in the Bill all
the threshold points at which people cease to become eligible for
saving gateway accounts if they claim either child tax credit or
working tax credit. It relates back in a different way to the debate
about the carer&#146;s allowance, housing benefit and council tax
benefit in that in relation to the saving gateway account there has
been a thought process in Ministers&#146; minds: do we go down a
route that is purely about means testing, whereby people submit an
application form and if they meet the criteria they can open a saving
gateway account? We know that means testing can be expensive,
complicated and prone to error. Alternatively, do we use the existing
architecture of the benefits and tax system to prove eligibility, so
that, in effect, a person is passported through to a saving gateway
account if they qualify for a particular benefit or tax
credit?</div><a name="09020315000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see that that thinking is probably present in some of the
Minister&#146;s responses on carer&#146;s allowance and is probably
part of the thought process used in designing the system. It explains
why some benefits have been excluded and how Ministers slice and dice
the population entitled to receive those
benefits.</div><a name="09020315000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
the regulations referred to in clause 3(4) take that a stage further.
Families with incomes of up to about &#163;60,000 are eligible to
receive tax credits at the top end of the taper. Without the test in
regulations set out in subsection (4), people with relatively high
incomes&#151;who will, we hope, save anyway through ISAs or other
forms of saving&#151;would qualify for the saving gateway account. I
can therefore understand why it is important to set a
threshold&#151;indeed, the threshold that has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>used is the one where people cease to be eligible for full child tax
credit and where a taper applies. If that is such a fundamental part of
the system&#146;s architecture, I do not understand why it is not in
the Bill and why it has been relegated to
regulations.</div><a name="09020315000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will say he wants flexibility. If he does, I will understand
that, but perhaps he might explain why he
wants&#151;</div><a name="09020315000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000392"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman should want it as
well.</div><a name="09020315000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000393"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Economic Secretary says from a sedentary
position that I should want it as well. Perhaps I should, but we will
wait for that day to come. Will he explain why the Government need that
flexibility and what factors would drive them to vary that threshold up
or down? I tabled the amendment to obtain such an explanation. I can
see the thinking that goes on in designing the system, but it would
help if we understood why the Government believe that that threshold of
around &#163;16,000 is correct, why they need flexibility and what
might drive them to change their mind about where the threshold kicks
in. This is a probing
amendment.</div><a name="09020315000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000394"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We set out in the document that we published in
December and in the draft regulations that we published ahead of the
Bill&#146;s Second Reading the fact that we intend to set an income
threshold above which the entitlement to tax credits will not lead to
eligibility to the saving gateway. We intend to set it at the same
level as the income threshold for child tax credit, which is
&#163;15,575 and will rise to &#163;16,040 in the financial year
2009-10. We also intend to ensure that people who have been passported
into a maximum award of child tax credit because of their entitlement
to another benefit will in turn be passported into eligibility for the
saving
gateway.</div><a name="09020315000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
probing amendment moved by the hon. Member for Fareham would put into
the Bill the link between eligibility for the saving gateway and the
income threshold for child tax credit. I hope that I can assure the
Committee that it is our intention to link those two thresholds, as set
out in condition 2 of draft regulation 3(1). That is the appropriate
level at which to set the threshold; it is the same as the threshold
for receiving a higher Government contribution to a child trust fund
and for several other passporting
benefits.</div><a name="09020315000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not intend to depart from that, but there are good reasons for
wanting to make the link in secondary rather than primary legislation.
In particular, a Government may decide to alter the tax credit system,
in which case it might be necessary to set an income threshold purely
for saving gateway purposes. Primary legislation would not be an
efficient use of parliamentary time. I am not convinced that the
Conservative party is particularly keen on child tax credits, so I
cannot see why it would want to make that link explicit in the Bill, as
the Bill would become defective if a change of policy were
desired.</div><a name="09020315000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
future Government might simply decide that the two thresholds, which
are for different purposes, should be set at different levels. As the
Bill stands, that can be done without the need for primary legislation
and the regulations will be subjected to the affirmative procedure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>to provide the appropriate parliamentary scrutiny. That is the
appropriate way to do this. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
therefore withdraw his probing
amendment.</div><a name="09020315000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000395"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am happy to accept the Economic
Secretary&#146;s explanation as to why secondary legislation should
be used and what the checks are, but our concern is not so much the
principle of the child tax credit as the administration of the system.
From the earlier comments about the inefficiencies of the system, I
think that Labour Members share some of our concerns about the problems
that the administration of the system brings to our constituents. It is
difficult to get the level
right.</div><a name="09020315000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to target these measures where possible on people with a certain
income, we need to have that cut-off in place. The Economic
Secretary&#146;s comments about being consistent with contributions
to child trust funds and with other passported benefits suggest that
this is reasonable point at which to draw that line. On the back of
that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09020315000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000396"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> I wish to raise a point on the spouse&#146;s
situation in a household, which we discussed under the previous group
of amendments. How will the Economic Secretary indicate eligibility to
a spouse in a household where the husband is on income support or
jobseeker&#146;s allowance, but the partner or wife is at home not
receiving any of the benefits, which would be the straightforward thing
to do? I am thinking particularly of Bangladeshi women in my
constituency. The mother is often at home for language or cultural
reasons or because of children. On the question of language, the
publicity that the Economic Secretary will bombard them with might pass
them by without much recognition. Is there any intention to write to
spouses in such
households?</div><a name="09020315000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000397"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> My hon. Friend is making a good point. We all
know of households in our constituencies where that would be an issue.
Will he suggest that the Economic Secretary consider some advertising
with the family allowance? We pay that to the parent with care, so
putting the advertisements with that might be a way of getting the
information to that member of the
household.</div><a name="09020315000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000398"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> That is a sensible suggestion that the Economic
Secretary will probably add to his list of sensible points that he will
make to me. Will such people be sent anything with the eligibility
form? For people in a number of households, the first time they will be
aware of this scheme is when the form falls on the mat saying that they
are eligible to participate in it by virtue of their jobseeker&#146;s
allowance or income support. In a low-income household, the lack of
that will often mean that the individual assumes that they are not
eligible. The only people that I know in low-income households do not
make contact with Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs without due
cause. They might leave it at that and not be aware of their
eligibility.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div><a name="09020315000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition to
the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet, if we do
not do anything with the spouse, will there be anything in the
literature sent out with the eligibility form to alert the individual
that they should tell anyone else in the household who might be
eligible for the
scheme?</div><a name="09020315000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000399"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My hon. Friend is right to raise concerns about
his constituents and to probe me on how the clause will work. When the
legislation is on the statute book, we will consider carefully how to
market and promote saving gateway accounts to individuals as part of
the implementation process. As I said earlier, MPs have a role in doing
that directly in their constituencies. There is a broader role for
those who offer saving gateway accounts in deciding how to market them,
and a role for Government in promoting the principle of the saving
gateway.</div><a name="09020315000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the direct question about a spouse who is not working and is at home,
my hon. Friend will be aware from the criteria in clause 3 (1) and (2)
that the system is based on defining an eligible person who is entitled
to one or more of a number of benefits or tax credits and also passes
the test of connection to the UK. If there is a claim for one of the
qualifying benefits with two claimants, then both sets of details will
be on the claim and both will be sent a notice of eligibility. In a lot
of the instances that he is probably thinking about, low-income
households will be making joint claims. In those circumstances both
would automatically be sent a notice of eligibility.</div>
<a name="09020315000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend also raised some broader questions, such as, what if somebody
got a notice and someone else did not? In that case, how would they
know whether they might have qualified, and might have been missed out?
Again, we would want to consider that when looking at how to promote
the scheme in future. Notwithstanding the amendments discussed so far
and the commitments I have made to reflect, particularly on the point
about carers, I believe that we need a scheme that carefully determines
eligible persons, and that is what clause 3
does.</div><a name="09020315000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000400"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 28, in clause 4,
page 3, line 20, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(d) The Maturity
Period shall not be less than 2
years.&#146;.</div><a name="09020315000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
4 contains two key parameters in determining how the account will
operate. One is the maturity period&#151;the period over which the
matching contribution will be calculated&#151;and the other is the
maximum monthly contribution. In keeping with the general spirit of the
way in which this Bill has been put together, these important details
have been relegated to secondary legislation. My amendment
probes&#151;at this stage, rather than waiting for the discussion of
secondary legislation&#151;the rationale the Government have used to
justify a maturity period of, say, two years. In considering the next
amendment, I will talk about why the figure of &#163;25 a month has
been suggested.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div><a name="09020315000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
about the maturity period made in the evidence session last week by
people such as Teresa Perchard and Sharon Collard was that if someone
had not learnt the saving habit in two years, it was very unlikely that
they ever would and that two years was reasonable. I wonder whether the
Economic Secretary gave consideration to a period longer than two years
to enable people to learn the saving culture&#151;say, three
years&#151;to get it embedded. One point discussed last week was the
likelihood that people would continue to save after the two-year period
expired. There was evidence that a significant minority of people did
continue to save, but not the majority.</div>
<a name="09020315000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
reasons why people would want to take money out of their
account&#151;perhaps they had saved with a particular purpose in
mind, perhaps there was an urgent need to meet an unexpected
expense&#151;so there may have been good reasons why the
participation did not continue beyond two years. However, it does raise
the question&#151;given that it was only a significant minority,
rather than majority&#151;whether a longer period would be needed to
encourage more people to save, to ensure that the saving habit is fully
inculcated. That is the thrust behind my amendment as, other than that,
there is not much to say about inserting two years as a maturity
period.</div><a name="09020315000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000401"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> These are obviously matters of judgment. From the
experience of the pilots and the interviews conducted, and discussions
with interested parties, we concluded that two years was the most
appropriate time period. That account duration will best help potential
account holders to open an account and kick-start a saving habit. It
strikes the right balance between giving people sufficient time to
develop a saving habit and build up a reasonable match, and allowing
them access within a sensible time scale.</div>
<a name="09020315000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
participants on the 18-month trial had a range of views about the
appropriate length: some were in favour of extending the period beyond
18 months and some thought that it should be less. Annuality makes
sense because people generally understand the date when they open
something and the date when it is likely to mature. Of course, we want
to evaluate the policy when it is implemented, but at the moment we
think that two years is appropriate and that it strikes the balance we
are trying to
achieve.</div><a name="09020315000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not believe that the amendment, which says that the maturity period
should never be shorter than two years, is appropriate, because we
might find that, for a significant group of people, that saving habit
can be kick-started in a shorter period. It should not be put in the
Bill, but I appreciate that it is a probing amendment to explore our
thought processes. I hope that my comments this morning clearly outline
to the hon. Gentleman and to the Committee why we have chosen a period
of two years.</div>
<a name="09020315000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000402"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Economic Secretary says that the right period
is a matter of judgment. Given the relative generosity of the match
that the Government are offering&#151;50p per pound saved, based on
the maximum account balance over the two years&#151;we need to
encourage people to keep their savings in the account for as long as
possible. We have tabled other amendments that explore that issue in
more detail. I agree with him&#151;it is not something that we
necessarily want to put in the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div><a name="09020315000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not going
to press the amendment, but it is important that we assess the
policy&#146;s long-term effect on savings, and the Economic Secretary
was right to comment on that. Two pilots were evaluated and, in the
sprit of having an evidence-based policy, we want to ensure that there
are longitudinal surveys to see whether two years is sufficient
time&#151;or too much, or too little&#151;in which to encourage
people to develop a saving culture. With that flexibility in mind, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000403"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 29, in
clause 4, page 3, line 21, leave
out subsection (3) and
insert&#151;</div><a name="09020315000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;(

pm</div><a name="09020315000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment has been tabled in a similar probing spirit. There is no
reference in the Bill to the maximum monthly amount that can be saved,
which the amendment would remedy. The explanatory notes suggests that
the amount will be &#163;25, and I suspect that that is in the
regulations that were circulated to us earlier. For many people,
&#163;25 will sound like not very much to save, but it was
interesting that Teresa Perchard from the CAB described it
as</div><a name="09020315000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
huge amount for many to find&#148;.&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, Saving Gateway Accounts Public Bill Committee, 27 January
2009; c. 10,
Q20.]</div><a name="09020315000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a balance to be struck. Clearly, for many people, that would be a huge
amount to find, as it might be a significant part of their family
income, and they will need to make sacrifices to save anyway near that
amount. However, there are others, as we touched on earlier, who might,
through contributions-based JSA, have a reasonable amount of money and
who would be quite happy to pay &#163;25 a month, and perhaps
transfer money from other savings to the saving gateway account to
benefit from the 50p in the pound match. Has the Economic Secretary
given any thought to whether &#163;25 is too generous a limit, given
the potential loss to the Exchequer from people who are more than
capable of saving that amount, who do so already, and who just want to
take advantage of the great returns that the saving gateway account
will offer them?</div>
<a name="09020315000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000404"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I rise briefly to support the spirit of the
amendment. It is important that the amount is stated in the Bill, and
that is crucial for one&#146;s approval of it. There is
understandable concern in some quarters that the 50p that every pound
attracts is a very generous provision&#151;20 times more generous
than a commercial scheme would typically offer. Therefore the maximum
amount that could be put aside each month to attract that amount from
the Government is an important consideration. It is unsatisfactory for
the Bill simply to
say</div><a name="09020315000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Regulations
may, in particular, impose a limit on the
amount&#148;,</div><a name="09020315000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
if it were some casual detail that would have to be dropped at some
point when the Government were considering these matters in the round.
If we were being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>asked to approve a much higher, or even much lower, sum, it would have
an impact on the willingness of Committee members or the House in
general to support the Bill as a
whole.</div><a name="09020315000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000405"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Thanks to this Government&#146;s strong
management of the economy, we have had low and stable inflation for a
considerable period. It is right to have the opportunity to update
limits on potential savings. It would not be normal to prescribe an
amount in a Bill and then to introduce future Bills to update it
regularly. For that reason, I strongly resist what the hon. Member for
Taunton says about
this.</div><a name="09020315000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham tabled the measure as a probing amendment. He
suggested that some people who were on contributions-based JSA could be
on relatively high incomes and so there might be a deadweight effect to
our policies. We discussed that earlier. As I indicated, the number of
people in such circumstances would be extremely
low.</div><a name="09020315000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the target group whom we are trying to encourage to save, &#163;25 a
month is certainly a stretching savings target. Some will be able to
achieve that, while others will not. Both pilots certainly showed that
the participants thought that &#163;25 was about the right sort of
figure. It was potentially an achievable target, but very difficult for
many. Obviously, we would want to keep these matters under review. That
is why it is appropriate not to put a figure in the Bill, but to set it
out in secondary
legislation.</div><a name="09020315000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can confirm that the draft regulations set out savings of &#163;25 a
month. That is our best view on an appropriate figure. In all such
cases, there is a matter of judgment, but I think that our judgment is
widely supported by the range of agencies that look into these matters,
with which we have worked
closely.</div><a name="09020315000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000406"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for his
comments.</div><a name="09020315000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#163;25 limit is a target that will stretch people. It will be good
to encourage people to save as much as they can. One of the advantages
of the scheme is that it will enable people to withdraw, so if they
have stretched themselves too far by trying to achieve that &#163;25,
there will be flexibility to enable them to withdraw some of that money
and to rebalance their expenses and
savings.</div><a name="09020315000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
might need to look at this. If the scheme proves to be a success, it
might be decided in 10 years&#146; time that &#163;25 is not
enough. It would be very tedious to have to introduce primary
legislation to lift the limit from &#163;25 to an inflation-linked
figure. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

when they mature&#151;would have access to the Financial Ombudsman
Service to have their complaint investigated. That is more than an
academic point because industrial and provident societies are not
regulated by the FSA, so people invest in an industrial and provident
society&#151;as some people might wish to do&#151;do not have
access to the ombudsman. I am not suggesting that many IPSs are
knocking down the door of the Government to set up these accounts, but
they might want to in the future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000408"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is not one of the risks that if IPSs accept money
under saving gateway accounts, they will be not only not covered by the
FOS but&#151;as members of the Presbyterian Mutual Society in
Northern Ireland have found out&#151;not covered by the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme
either?</div><a name="09020315000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000409"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point.
Again, that emphasises why I want the Economic Secretary to confirm
that the only approved providers of these accounts will be those that
are regulated in such a way that access to such protections
exists.</div><a name="09020315000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of the amendment, in which I have broken down various
organisations that might provide these accounts, is there to give my
hon. Friend the Economic Secretary the opportunity to say whether he
intends to be permissive in allowing organisations to provide these
accounts, or whether he is intending to use the provision of these
accounts for other purposes.</div>
<a name="09020315000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
things that struck me in the evidence-taking session was the apparent
reluctance of the banks and building societies to provide such
accounts. They seemed to be taking the attitude that the job of
creating new business for them is not theirs, but the
Government&#146;s. I regard encouraging people to save and to become
prudent with their finances as the job of the people who provide
accounts. When the supermarkets wanted to encourage people into their
shops, they ran loss leaders to encourage people to use them. The banks
seem to have no such ambition to encourage people to save. Indeed, they
do the very opposite by providing the best rates of interest to the
people with the most money, while providing no additional services to
encourage people on low incomes to save. They are clearly reluctant to
get into this market. I recall the difficulty that the Government had
in making them provide basic accounts for people on low
incomes&#151;they almost had to dragoon many banks into providing
them.</div>
<a name="09020315000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the banks
are reluctant to provide these accounts, why do not the Government use
this scheme to encourage certain people, perhaps by restricting these
accounts to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>post office counters? Why not provide an extra opportunity for local
post offices to thrive by saying that they are the only place where
people can get these
accounts?</div><a name="09020315000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000410"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I have some sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s arguments, but the concern that I expressed in last
week&#146;s exploratory discussions remains valid. Will people who
have a bank account be more inclined to open one of these accounts if
they can open it with the bank with which they hold that account? If
they have to have two accounts at two separate institutions, it might
be a
deterrent.</div><a name="09020315000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020315000411"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right, and I am not
promoting this idea as a proposition. I am simply asking whether the
Government want the power to restrict accounts to individual
organisations. I would think seriously about restricting the accounts
to post offices and friendly societies to encourage those institutions.
I am asking my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>way of this amendment, whether he will have the power, through
regulation, to restrict the sort of organisation that may provide
accounts to those classes of organisation. If he says in the future,
&#147;I don&#146;t want banks doing this, because I don&#146;t
trust them to do it properly and to provide the right advice; I want to
limit the people who may provide these accounts to the Post Office and
friendly societies,&#148; will he have the power to implement that
under the
Bill?</div><a name="09020315000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered</i>,
That the debate be now adjourned.&#151;<i class="I">(Mr.
Blizzard.)</i></div><a name="09020315000256"></a>
