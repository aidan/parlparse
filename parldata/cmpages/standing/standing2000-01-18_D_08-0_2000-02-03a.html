<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 34, leave out lines 33 to 37 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) prima facie evidence is adduced that the accused was subject to oppression in order to induce him to make the statement, or that the statement was or may have been obtained in consequence of anything said or done which was likely, in the circumstances, existing at the time, to render unreliable any confession which might be made by him, and
<P>
(c) the prosecution did not prove to the court beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was not obtained in the manner referred to in paragraph (b) above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 139, in page 35, line 5, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) In this section ``oppression'' includes torture, inhumane or degrading punishment, and the use or threat of violence (whether or not amounting to torture).
<P>
(8) In any proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give in evidence a statement by an accused person, the court may require the prosecution, as a condition of allowing it to do so, to prove that the confession was not obtained as set out in subsection (3) above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Good morning, Mr. Malins. These amendments concern—
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): The Terrorism Bill. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I can do better than that. The amendments deal with the process of giving evidence in Northern Ireland and relate specifically to the interpretation of the argument that pressure had been put on the witnesses before they gave evidence. The wording proposed in the amendments is nearer to the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the emergency powers arrangements that Lord Lloyd of Berwick suggested should be retained.
<P>
Part VII deals with the period of extension for up to five years with annual renewal. The issue at stake is whether it is more appropriate to follow Lord Lloyd's recommendation, which is also contained in the consultation paper, that the criminal offence standard should be applied generally throughout the United Kingdom and that exceptional, new and prosecution-friendly standards should not be continued in Northern Ireland. The difference in those arrangements is important because the justification for arguments about oppression is more sensitive in the context of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The criminal law depends on the fact that unreliable evidence is excluded and that the argument whether the evidence is unreliable because pressure has been put on the witness can be made, wherever possible. Until jury trials are restored in Northern Ireland, Lord Lloyd has made such recommendations as a way in which to balance the exceptional provisions for Diplock courts. Do the Government expect the Diplock court arrangements to be continued for the period of the part VII continuation or do they plan to phase them out at an earlier date and replace them with the more normal jury trials, depending on the circumstances in Northern Ireland?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): Like the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Simon Hughes), I look forward to the day when the Diplock courts are no longer necessary. However, the law-abiding majority of people in Northern Ireland—the overwhelming majority of people in the Province—continue to live with the presence in their communities of well-organised, well-trained, well-armed professional terrorist gangs. Even on this side of the water, organised criminals are capable of threatening and intimidating jurors into not bringing in guilty verdicts in the face of fairly conclusive evidence. That risk will continue to be greater in the Province of Northern Ireland until a lasting peace and sense of security can be established there.
<P>
It is clear that a great risk continues while juries are, quite properly, drawn from local communities. Organised criminal gangs, who have sectarian support, are able to exercise power over the communities within which they operate. The evidence, and certainly the belief of the police, is that, irrespective of what may be said later today about the future of the political process in Northern Ireland, the Diplock courts are necessary for the time being.
<P>
The amendment offers an alternative wording to that proposed by the Government. On my layman's reading of the two texts, the Bill seems to reproduce almost word for word the language of section 12 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996. I listened to what the hon. Gentleman said and I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments. The amendment does not seem to be necessary, given the language of the EPA. Nor does it strengthen the hand of the security forces in upholding the right of the great majority of people in Northern Ireland, and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, to be free of the threat of organised Northern Irish terrorism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> To help the hon. Gentleman, paragraph (c) in amendment No. 138 seeks to provide that the prosecution would have to prove to the court
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was not obtained in the manner referred to in paragraph (b) above.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is where the crucial difference between the Bill and existing legislation lies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I understand that the amendment offers a different drafting, but I inferred from what he said that the hon. Gentleman was troubled by the difference between the EPA and the Bill. He said that the amendment sought to make the language of the Bill closer to that in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and other emergency provisions legislation. The language and meaning of the latter is already in place in the Bill. My concern is that what is proposed in amendment No. 138 might make life easier for those charged with terrorist offences by setting a higher threshold of proof for the prosecution.
<P>
I acknowledge that in the special circumstances in which a court must sit without a jury, in breach of our usual constitutional arrangements, a case can be made for carefully considering the rules on admissibility of evidence, especially of alleged confessions or other admissions by the accused person of the crime with which he has been charged. However, the amendment states that the prosecution must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prove to the court beyond reasonable doubt''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the amendment is to have any force and not constitute merely a restatement in different language of what the Bill already provides, it must raise the threshold of proof that the prosecution must cross. If that would make it more difficult to secure the conviction of organised terrorists, who are well trained to resist police questioning and cross-examination in court, it would be undesirable for the Committee to accept the amendment. I await the Minister's comments, but I am not inclined to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> There is a long answer and a short answer to the points that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made. I had better give the long answer first in explanation, as he advanced arguments in support of the amendment. He asked about the future of Diplock courts, which I shall deal with in the short answer.
<P>
I understand that this is a probing amendment. The matter is worth examination, because a considerable body of opinion has been expressed on it, both in court and by those who examine how the legislation operates. The amendment would impose a criminal burden of proof, which we consider unnecessary. Long-established case law exists on the word ``satisfy'', which applies in this case. In Crown v. Hetherington, the court found that ``satisfy'' meant that the prosecution was required to prove the matter beyond reasonable doubt. As a result, that emphasis already exists.
<P>
The amendment would replace the wording in subsection (3)(b) with a reference to oppression. As the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) said, that would limit the wide discretion that the subsection provides in a police investigation. The amendment would require the court to rule as inadmissible a confession that might have been obtained by oppression. Prolonged and robust questioning, which is habitual in scheduled offences, might rank as oppression, and it would be difficult for the court to accept evidence obtained in such circumstances. That would be an undesirable end to the process. Someone who commits a terrorist offence may—indeed, has to—be subject to robust questioning. As we have said previously, most terrorists are well trained and know what is expected and how to handle questions. In trying to proceed to a charge and conviction, the police must be robust in their approach. It is different from dealing with an ordinary criminal, who would be subject to usual questioning, and is not trained to deal with it. In such circumstances, needs must, as the hon. Member for Aylesbury said.
<P>
John Rowe, who is responsible for overseeing the legislation's operation, has examined the matter. His review of the proposal to bring this part of the legislation into line with equivalent PACE provisions was presented to Parliament in 1995. It determined whether the court had said that the clause was to be construed along the same lines as those by which PACE applied in Northern Ireland, which would be a good reason to change the clause. The courts have never said that the matter required change, however. The debates would take place in courts, and judgments would flow from them. There is no decided case for saying that clause 73 is similar to PACE in Northern Ireland. It would be wrong to suggest a change that has nothing to support it in law and has various points of law against it.
<P>
We have debated how the regime operates in relation to interviewing suspects and access to solicitors. There are variations between the clause and a normal provision, for good reason—we are dealing with a different type of criminal. These people are trained and have a different purpose from that of normal criminals. That brings us back to our debate on clause 1.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Interviews with suspects in what have previously been called holding centres are recorded on audio and silent video, a policy that was introduced to meet the need to ensure that matters are carried out strictly in accordance with the law. Statutory codes of practice apply to the treatment and questioning of suspects under the legislation. In one sense, that is the longer answer.
<P>
I said in the debate on schedule 8 that the future of the Diplock regime was subject to continuing review. We hope that that review will deliver its findings when the Bill is discussed on Report or in another place. Such issues will be required to be reviewed. The shorter argument against the amendments is that they have been examined and not only is there no case for them in law but they may inhibit the capacity to bring such people to justice. That would not be desirable, so I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's answer, which was helpful on the clause and in general. I shall gently ask him one final question that relates to the last part of his speech, although I know that he may not have a final answer. Do Northern Ireland and Home Office Ministers yet have a view as to whether some of part VII's provisions could be repealed and replaced by the normal process ahead of others? Have they yet decided whether there will be a staged withdrawal of part VII as opposed to a general one? I am conscious that Lord Lloyd's report regularly uses a phrase about when peace or a peaceful situation returns to Northern Ireland. Some of Lord Lloyd's specific recommendations that the Government have not yet followed are clearly contingent on such circumstances. As that logically follows what the Minister has said in the debate, it would be helpful to hear whether the Government have a view as to whether the change might be all in one or phased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not want to prejudge anything, because we cannot predict with certainty or even probability. I am not trained in mathematics, but I am sure that the clause conforms to the correct use of language. However, there is no guarantee of what the future will hold. Even with all the effort that has gone into trying to establish a new environment in Northern Ireland and even if we achieve the full application and implementation of the Good Friday agreement, with all the parties signed up to it and weapons decommissioned by all the main paramilitary terrorist groups, there is still likely to be an important, residual threat from dissident groups.
<P>
The period of five years is therefore reasonable, in terms of the totality of part VII. If necessary, we will have to judge when we come to that stage whether we need to renew the legislation or whether it can lapse. Under clause 108(2)(b), there is a provision to salami-slice it, if it can be put like that. The Government have shown a willingness at all stages to examine the legislation critically—not just on the basis of comments from those who oversee or examine the legislation outwith the parliamentary machine or on behalf of the Government but on our own behalf. We are examining the best way that we can proceed with legislation of this type.
<P>
I cannot say with certainty that elements of the legislation will drop off, but it is important that we build in that possibility because that can help towards the creation of a more peaceful environment, in response to the new society that is evolving. The legislation was correctly designed to deal with the worst effects, as we experience them, of terrorism and paramilitarism over the past 30 years, but if that landscape changes, we are obliged to examine whether the law is necessary, in part or in total. Part VII provides for that eventuality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. It may help the Committee if I point out that there are some clauses on which I have one or two questions to ask the Minister as well as some on which I have tabled amendments. There are others on which I do not. I happen to have some questions on the next clause. I have no idea what the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and for Aylesbury have in mind, but I am open to being helpful later.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is most helpful. I had wondered whether clauses 74 to 81 could be taken together, but I understand what the hon. Gentleman says.
<P>
Clause 73 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 74</center></H4>
<H4><center>Possession: onus of proof</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to raise a predictable question on the clause, which makes another reverse burden of proof provision. Lord Lloyd made the point in paragraph 16.24 of his report that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Although this has not proved to be a particularly controversial provision (I have heard no complaints about its use) it should be possible to rely on the ordinary law to deal with any such cases once a lasting peace is established in Northern Ireland.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The argument has again been put to me that the onus should always be on the prosecution to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt and that if one goes in the other direction, one may risk breaching article 6.2 of the European convention on human rights, which states that everyone charged with a criminal offence should in law be presumed innocent until proved guilty.
<P>
In our previous sitting we discussed the Kebeline case. The House of Lords implied that a reverse burden of proof alone might not be sufficient to create a risk in terms of the law. No one argues that the offences covered by the clause are not serious ones. I do not want to overrate the importance of offences under the Explosive Substances Act 1883 to do with the possession of explosives and petrol bombs and with the manufacturing and handling of weapons. There is no argument about the seriousness of the matters in question, but it would help if the Government were to put on record their case for the reverse burden of proof provisions being continued in part VII.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Clause 74 makes provision about the onus of proof in trials on indictment for offences of possession of firearms and explosives. When an accused is charged with possessing firearms or explosives, proof that he was present in the same premises as those articles, or that they were on his premises, is sufficient evidence of possession, unless the person charged can show that he had no knowledge or control of them. The provision was introduced to facilitate proof of knowledge as well as proof of possession when knowledge is relevant. Defendants have been acquitted by claiming no knowledge of articles found in their possession. Those acquittals were the subject of comment, and the clause was introduced as a result.
<P>
Some people would contend that the clause puts an unfair burden on the accused. The hon. Gentleman's amendment was moved on that basis. The accused— perhaps only the accused—knows whether he had knowledge of the existence of the articles and, if he knew of their existence, whether he had any control over them. The judgment of the late Lord Lowry in the case of Crown v. Killen in 1974 was that the provision allowed a prima facie case of possession or knowledge of possession. However, the judge made it clear that the burden of proof remained at all times on the prosecution, which must prove possession beyond reasonable doubt. The law is applied on the back of that judgment. The clause is subject to scrutiny and examination, to decide whether it is justified, and reviews of the Emergency Provisions Acts have always recommended the retention of that provision.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 74 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>MUNITIONS AND TRANSMITTERS:</center></H4>
SEARCH AND SEIZURE
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 115, leave out lines 26 and 27 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) if the officer reasonably suspects him to have munitions unlawfully with him or wireless apparatus with him, search him for the purposes of ascertaining whether he has those items'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to debate amendment No. 140, in page 115, line 27, after second `him', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided he reasonably suspects that the person has munitions unlawfully with him or wireless apparatus with him.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> The purpose of the amendment is fairly straightforward. I want to know the reason for the difference in wording between paragraph 6(1)(b) and paragraph 6(2). One covers searches in a public place, the other covers searches not in a public place. I wonder whether there is an obvious explanation for that difference. It seems that an officer needs to have a reasonable suspicion in order to carry out a search in a private place, but no obvious need to have reasonable grounds for carrying out a search in public.
<P>
Unless another, more obvious explanation has escaped me, I see no logic in that. If reasonable suspicions are needed to carry out a search in one set of circumstances, it seems reasonable to assume that the officer should have a similar justification for carrying out a search in other circumstances.
<P>
We have tended to dismiss the possibility that the provisions are not compatible with the ECHR, even though we have received various assurances that they are. However, if a search had not been premised on reasonable grounds, that would not be compatible with the convention and would lead to several difficulties. The purpose of the amendment is to find out whether there is a logical explanation for the way in which the provision has been drafted. If there is not, will my hon. Friend the Minister consider accepting the amendment?
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Our amendment seeks the same answer as the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) and if the Minister responds adequately to him, that may be sufficient for me. Similar criteria should apply wherever a person is stopped and searched. The hon. Gentleman argued rightly that there was no reason why the rule should be different under the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I understand why the amendments were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hall Green and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but I cannot accept them. Paragraph 6 of schedule 9 replicates section 20(6)(a) of the EPA. Both amendments seek to impose a reasonable suspicion requirement on the exercise of that power. There is, of course, a reasonable suspicion requirement when the powers are exercised other than in a public place, such as in a dwelling house.
<P>
I shall explain why I believe that reasonable suspicion should not be imposed and I can do no better than to refer to the relevant section of John Rowe's review that was presented to Parliament in 1995. It encapsulates the background to the way in which the provision applies and how it does so successfully.
<P>
John Rowe said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Subsection (6) is about stopping and searching persons, as opposed to searching premises; in a public place no reasonable suspicion is called for, whereas in a non public place or a dwelling house it is required. I give examples. In a public place, police on point duty for a rural funeral stopped a vehicle driven by a person from the Republic; they neither knew or suspected him, but a search of him revealed papers containing details of terrorist activists and personal facts about a senior police officer. A police patrol, carrying out a routine check of civilians in the street, found a diary in the possession of a man, which contained registration numbers of a car owned by a forensic scientist. A military patrol, at a vehicle checkpoint on the border, stopped a vehicle; the driver had no association with terrorism; on a search of the boot, a bomb was discovered; the terrorist organisation had chosen a local taxi driver for the mission, believing he would be waved through any road stop. In darkness, on a road, a police and military foot patrol were checking vehicles, when a car driven by a woman who had never come to the attention of the police, was found to contain an under-car booby trap bomb, a revolver and ammunition.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There was no reasonable suspicion to stop those people. John Rowe's examples neatly and graphically encapsulate why the provision is required. For that reason, I ask that the amendments are not pressed to a Division.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I understand the Minister's point. I do not pretend to have a comprehensive knowledge of the Northern Ireland law, let alone the law in this country on that issue. Before Report, will the Minister's officials let us see other examples of situations in which, under current Northern Ireland legislation, it is not necessary in public places for there to be a reasonable excuse or reasonable suspicion? That is important, and we know that crucial evidence can be found when people are stopped. It would help if we could see where the powers apply. I have repeatedly tried to probe about laws on which people are certain where they stand. If authorities can stop people at random, and those people do not know what the rules are and under which clauses such powers are justified, we risk those powers being used regularly against the same one or two people. That might be perceived as harassment.
<P>
It is therefore important that the law be as clear as possible. People should know what their rights are. For as long as Northern Ireland has a special security position, it is important that there is a list of rights on both sides of the law enforcement divide. Those enforcing the law and those citizens who are subject to law enforcement should have a list of citizens' rights and authorities' powers for circumstances without reasonable suspicion or preliminary procedure. That would be helpful, and it would help to vindicate similar arguments in relation to such clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If I can comply with that request, I will do so, but I remind the Committee of the advice that I have given on this part of the legislation, which will be subject to review as the Bill proceeds. I do not know if any stronger arguments can be made than those that I gave from John Rowe's report. I do not object when I go through checks at airports and there is no reasonable suspicion, and I say that not as a lawyer but as a normal member of the public. If the person behind me had a gun, I would be glad if he or she were apprehended before boarding my plane.
<P>
Such provisions are writ large in terms of Northern Ireland. No decent law-abiding citizens want to have them in their society, but they are commensurate with the level of threat. Implicit in part VII and explicit in the way in which we are dealing with the problem is that we hope to head towards an environment in Northern Ireland to which they do not apply. That is why the provision has a limited life span, perhaps of only five years, subject to the way in which it will be dealt with over that period based on the examination of various aspects. We all want there to be a normal society in Northern Ireland. If we can comply with the request made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, we shall do so and make the information available to members of the Committee. On that basis, I hope that the amendment will not be put to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for clarification. The provision is not a general stop-and-search power, and is not designed to catch someone carrying any illegal item. It is specifically designed for someone who is in unlawful possession of munitions or wireless apparatus. It seems that, in apprehending someone for that purpose, a demonstration of reasonable suspicion of possession of those items might be needed.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister might reconsider the wording in that context, but I am happy to accept his assurances for the time being, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 9 agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am considering taking clauses 82 to 85 together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I should like to say a word about clause 84.
<P>
Clauses 82 and 83 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 84</center></H4>
<H4><center>Examination of documents</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have a question about subsection (6), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person who wilfully obstructs a member of Her Majesty's forces or a constable in the exercise of a power conferred by this section commits an offence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is there any case law or advice that gives guidance on whether someone who, for example, had just got out of the bath and was putting on his clothes would be guilty of an offence if he were surprised by a member of the armed forces or a constable? To use the Minister's phrase, there are practical situations involving ordinary members of the public in which a police officer or a soldier would technically be obstructed simply because at that precise moment it was not convenient, comfortable, dignified or decent to comply with what was requested. Under the wording of the Bill, that could happen. I hope that that matter will be considered. Is there any guidance on it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not have information to hand on case law, but I will write to the hon. Gentleman if it exists. If other hon. Members want to come to that matter on Report, they can do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Would not the inclusion of ``wilfully'' in subsection (6) give some protection to members of the public in the way that the hon. Gentleman wishes? My layman's instinct would be that that would be adequate to cover the sort of situation that he described, while catching people who deliberately and wilfully seek to obstruct the police or the armed forces carrying out of their duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The example of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was of someone who is in the middle of dressing and thereby obstructs an officer for a split second—but in that split second someone could be out the back door and away. Judgments have to be made. Those who undertake such activities on behalf of the RUC or the Army are well trained by professional people. As I said, I will make available to the hon. Gentleman any case law that is available on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful for that helpful response. To deal with the point of the hon. Member for Aylesbury, while not pretending to be a courtroom lawyer here, I point out that someone can wilfully obstruct an officer while having what he or she perceives as a reasonable excuse for doing so at that moment. A husband might say, ``Not now'', for example, when his wife was getting out of the bath. I understand that that could be an excuse for illegal activity, but it is possible that the wording could provide greater protection. That is what I sought to explore.

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> These are probing amendments. The clause provides for a power to stop and question, for as long as necessary and without any time limit being defined. The amendment allows us to debate whether there should be a limit to the time for which an officer can question someone before being required to seek permission. I have proposed a limit of 15 minutes, but it could be 20 minutes, an hour or an hour and a half. I am not suggesting that that would be appropriate. I am merely trying to ascertain whether it might be better to place a qualification on what is completely open-ended under the Bill as drafted.
<P>
The clause raises three issues and I shall discuss the third in a moment. The first relates to inquiries about explosions and incidents, and the second relates to killings and injuries, which are extremely serious matters that may justify a considerably longer period for which someone could be stopped and questioned than would be involved for other matters. The offences committed by people who break the law are specified later in the clause.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 142 is intended simply to probe whether it might be better to replace the requirement to question someone in order to discover ``his identity and movements'' with the more usual phrase ``name and address'', merely because it is more specific. The word ``identity'' has a slight vagueness, which may go beyond merely someone's name. I am not clear why the Bill uses the word ``identity''. It would be better, clearer and more straightforward to use the phrase ``name and address''. That is usually the information that officers ask when they stop people and ask questions. We discussed stopping and searching the other day, and that is usually the starting point. I should be grateful for an explanation of what is a slightly odd, slightly vague word that strikes me as less susceptible to clear legal interpretation in the event of a court hearing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> So far as I can tell, clause 86 replicates almost exactly section 25 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, albeit with a few small drafting amendments. I should be interested to learn what procedures the police in Northern Ireland follow in practice in implementing that provision. We should be extremely cautious about specifying in law a maximum time for the police to stop and question someone.
<P>
The motive of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is to protect the law-abiding citizen and ensure that he or she is not harassed unduly. However, specifying a particular time raises two problems. First, there is always a tendency for a maximum time to become a standard time once it has been specified, so that even the innocent passer-by who happens to be stopped will ultimately be questioned for a quarter of an hour when the police officer could easily ascertain the necessary details in a much shorter time. Indeed, if the Minister has the relevant statistics available, I suspect that we shall discover that the great majority of people who happen to be stopped are stopped for a short period and allowed to proceed with their usual lawful business. It could, therefore, lead to unnecessary bureaucracy in exercising the powers.
<P>
Secondly, specifying a maximum permitted time in the Bill would provide an easy way out for the genuine terrorist or terrorist sympathiser who is stopped. The Minister points to his wristwatch, but the terrorist knows that if he can keep the conversation going, spin out answers for long enough—for the 15 or 20-minute period allotted—the officer has no option, if he lacks the evidence to justify an arrest, but to let that man disappear. We all know how Ministers can spin out answers for long enough to reach the end of the permitted time for questions. Once again, we are talking about a small number of professional, committed terrorists, who will have received a high level of training in how to resist police interrogation and questioning. To write into the Bill a maximum permitted time for stopping people and questioning them will unwittingly play into their hands.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for Aylesbury understands the logic of my argument, I know that the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was probing, but if 15 minutes is not long enough, should it be 25 minutes or half an hour? If questioning goes beyond a reasonable time, detention may be necessary, but a trained police officer would be only too aware of the constraints placed upon him in such circumstances.
<P>
I do not say that it is a trivial argument, but it is moving towards that. Why is it 15 minutes and not 16 minutes or half an hour? A police officer's conduct when stopping a person and questioning him would obviously be conditioned by his training and his knowledge of the law.
<P>
Amendment No. 142 seeks to redefine questioning. It would change subsection (1)(a), to allow an officer to ascertain only the name and address instead of identity. At present, the person must disclose his or her identity. That will enable the police to seek information about the person's name, address and age. The latter is an important differentiation, because someone else living at the same address may have the same name—for instance, father and son, or mother and daughter. That provision, gives clarity of understanding. I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I shall not proceed with the first amendment. I have one last point on the second. I am grateful for the Minister's answer. Is identity defined elsewhere in the Bill or in existing legislation, or does it come from case law? If the definition of identity is limited to name, address and age, which I completely understand, could not that be written into the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It could be written into the Bill, but when the police ask for identity people usually give them all the proof that they have. I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman is trying to make the provision so prescriptive. I do not understand how it protects our human rights, given the reason for the questioning, which is to enable the police to be sure that they are talking to the suspected person. To confine identity in that way would not be helpful. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about whether identity is defined elsewhere, because I do not claim to have detailed knowledge of every clause and subsection of the Bill—or of other legislation
<P>
John Rowe, in his 1995 report, took identity to mean name, address and date of birth. That is a commonsense approach, because another identifier would be required if more than one person with the same name could live at the same address. For that reason, I believe that the clause should remain unamended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Identity could include one's faith, denomination or political view. It is potentially a wide definition. Although John Rowe gave us a definition, I hope that the Minister will understand why I believe that it would be better if it was defined more accurately. I shall not press the amendment, but I should be interested to hear the Minister's view. I am troubled that the definition is too wide, and I may return to the matter on Report. Therefore, it would be helpful to receive information on how the provision can be justified and whether it applies elsewhere in the law. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 145, in page 46, line 25, leave out `may' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> The intention behind the amendments is obvious. I want to place an obligation on the Secretary of State and replace ``may'' with ``shall'' to ensure that codes of practice will govern the operation of the powers under the clause. Such a minimum safeguard would be of benefit to the police and army personnel who are responsible for putting such powers into operation, as well as to the wider public.
<P>
Both Ministers have acknowledged that the Bill contains extensive powers because of the types of activities that it wants to prevent from happening. Inevitably, such powers will conflict to some extent with natural freedoms that are to be expected in a democracy—hence the need for us to ensure that, at the very least, they contain minimum safeguards. I hope that the Minister will be willing to accept them or to reconsider the absence in the clause of such safeguards. To ask people to operate such extensive powers without their being guided by codes of conduct could be a recipe for difficulties in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have two supplementary points to make about the amendments. Understandably, organisations in Northern Ireland, such as the Human Rights Commission, place considerable importance on the requirement that codes of practice should govern such search powers. That would be of considerable reassurance to the community in general and certain parts of it in particular. As the Minister knows, such codes can be revised subject to consultation, without having to go through the parliamentary process. Therefore, such codes are more flexible tools than even legislation that comes up for annual review. I hope that the Minister responds sympathetically to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that I can be of help to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green. In an earlier debate, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said that he would use an amendment as a piggy back to gain support. I can be helpful now, but only because of my hon. Friend's persuasive arguments.
<P>
The amendment relates to how we would implement such a code. It would make such codes obligatory, but we would rather consider whether the codes provided under the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 are sufficient. We are currently examining that with regard to the codes that apply to the police. We must consult the RUC to ensure that the codes are the best in any given circumstances.
<P>
We are therefore looking at that matter in detail. I acknowledge the arguments that have been made. On the basis of my assurances, I hope that the amendments are not pressed to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> Naturally, I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister. In view of his assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> My point follows on from our debate the other day, which was prompted by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), on whether there is a general merit in having video as well as audio recording. Will the Minister tell us more about the plans of the police and the Government for extending video and audio recording throughout Northern Ireland? All parties seem to agree that it is a good system and that it should be offered as a common standard. As I said, there is in general terms a good argument for a common, evidential procedural standard around the United Kingdom. I shall be in Northern Ireland again shortly and expect to talk to the police there about those issues; the Government may have had some thoughts about their plans.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, Governments have thoughts all the time, although, as shown by the previous Government, such thoughts are not always appropriate—which is why they were voted out of office.
<P>
On this serious issue, I related how video and audio recording was introduced following the review of the legislation that we carried out in 1997 and was presaged in the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996. Our experience is that it is working well. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman will have the chance of seeing it in operation during his discussions with the RUC. The Chief Constable recognised the merits of moving in that direction by bringing in video and audio recording before he was legally obliged to do so. The RUC has shown a willingness to implement such systems.
<P>
On the question of extending the system across criminal law, a criminal justice review is place, as part of the Good Friday agreement commitments, which is due to report shortly. I hesitate to say whether it will go into that matter in detail; it is a comprehensive document, but it might not make reference to it. However, if it is not examined in depth in the consultation flowing from the publication of that document, hon. Members may want to raise it as an issue as part of the operation of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. So the debate is open.
<P>
We heard the radical thoughts of the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border on the matter; those of the Government are even more radical. We want to ensure maximum protection for everyone in the criminal justice system, and audio and video recordings are a substantial move in that direction. However, it is not easy to deliver, because every part of the system must agree on the best way to proceed.
<P>
I hope that that helps the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to understand how we shall deal with the matter in Northern Ireland. If he would like to speak to specialists in the field when he next visits Northern Ireland, I should be only too happy to help him in doing so.
<P>

Question, proposed, That this schedule be the Eleventh schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> What compensation payments have been made to date under existing legislation? Paragraph 1(1) provides a power to pay compensation after the destruction of property or the interference with property rights. It is obviously important to include a statutory compensation provision, and it is important that it be seen to be continuing and to constitute a clearly agreed procedure between the Government and the citizen. What is the position to date? Will provision be made for including in the annual report compensation payments made under the schedule for the next five years, irrespective of what happens to the rest of the Bill?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am slightly unclear in my mind about what the hon. Gentleman is asking. If he is asking whether the matter will be subject to annual reporting, as it is covered under part VII, it will. In assessing how payments are made, it will take time to ascertain whether the different, improved and enhanced regime of schedule 11 is working as we envisage. John Rowe reports annually on compensation payments, so they would be subject to that public examination. I do not know whether that is what the hon. Gentleman asked, but if it is, I hope that he will accept what schedule 11 is designed to do. If he would like a more detailed explanation, I suggest that he read the schedule, or I can give a full explanation now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister half answered my question adequately. I want to ensure that the reporting provision will apply to the use of the power and therefore to the number of compensation payments made and the amount of compensation paid. My first question related to the latest annual—or whatever period is convenient—figures for compensation payments made under the existing arrangements. That will take us into the new five-year period. I am grateful that the matter will be reported. Has compensation been paid? If so, how much last year and the previous year? That information may not be available at the moment. On the other hand, it may.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman would like figures on the amount paid since 1990, but in the financial year 1990–91, it was £1,648,529; in 1991–92, it was £1,833,582; in 1992–93, it was £2,809,373; in 1993–94, it was £2,600,591; in 1994–95, it was £1,714,522; in 1995–96, it was £1,353,176; in 1996–98, it was £1,332,098; in 1997–98, it was £1,535,208; in 1998–99, it was £2,076,308; and between April and September 1999, it was £1,543,761.
<P>
I do not know whether that answer helps the hon. Gentleman, or whether he has any further questions—it would not surprise me if he had. I hope that I have given him the information that he sought about John Rowe's annual scrutiny and review of how compensation is paid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have no further questions. I am grateful for the Minister's comprehensive answer. I thank him and his officials for their help. It is important to have the figures on the record. The answer exceeded my expectations.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 11 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 100</center></H4>
<H4><center>Terrorist information</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have one question about subsection (5). It is a variant on an old theme. We could do without the two words ``to prove'' in lines 16 and l 7. Without them, the clause would state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section that he had a reasonable excuse for his action or possession.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is another of those offences that turns the obligation on to the defendant to prove his innocence; the questions that it raises have been debated, and I shall not elaborate on them now, but that provision could be sufficient without the words ``to prove''. It would still require the defendant to establish something, but it would not require him to prove it beyond reasonable doubt or on the balance of probabilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not know whether any new arguments can be advanced on the subject. We must re-examine and rehearse the arguments that we used in previous clauses. I repeat that the Bill is subject to constant review. We have said that it has a five-year lifespan and that it is subject to annual review, and parts of it can be reviewed more often. However, this is not one of the matters where we could make such a change, because of the strong arguments that have been advanced in previous debates.
<P>
This is another clause that provides for a statutory defence. Common sense supports the position that the defendant is the right person to make and establish a reasonable excuse for what, prima facie, is wrongful conduct. My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office and I agreed in previous debates that it is not a reverse burden of proof; it is a statutory defence. It is still for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that an offence has been committed. A statutory defence is not the only defence; it gives a person the opportunity to show that he is not guilty of an offence and other avenues of defence are open to the accused.
<P>
It is the same argument, and I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will accept the merit and strength of our argument, and not constantly refer to it as a reverse burden of proof. That is not how the courts judge it, let alone those who argue in defence of this legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): This may seem slightly tongue in cheek, but I would like to ask the Minister a question of reductio ad absurdum. My Christmas card list contains the names and addresses of many Ulster politicians. Could that list be an offence under clause 100(1)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We may be moving into the debate of the absurd. Does the hon. Gentleman use his Christmas card list to send Christmas cards or for other purposes? He might send cards to spread good will at the Christmas season but if he put abusive and threatening language in them, it would be in breach not only of this law, but of several. I would need to know for what purpose the list was used. I do not think that I get a Christmas card from him.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must tell the Minister that I do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was going to say that I would be a bit apprehensive if I suddenly received a Christmas card from the hon. Gentleman. You may want to review the fact that you receive one, Mr. Malins. I am prepared to carry on this absurd argument for as long as he wants.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Clauses 103 to 107 are the controversial clauses that replicate provisions in the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, which was passed after the Omagh bombing. Instead of duplicating the debate on the clauses, I would like to raise the matter a little more strongly—probing plus—under clause 104. The arguments about the appropriateness of clause 104 relate to the set of clauses that replicate the provisions in the 1998 Act.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 103 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 104</center></H4>
<H4><center>Proscribed organisations: evidence</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The equivalent section in the 1998 Act was controversial. Clause 104 provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where a police officer . . . states in oral evidence that in his opinion the accused . . . belongs to an organisation which is specified, or . . . belonged to an organisation at a time when it was specified . . . the statement shall be admissible as evidence''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and will be the first step on the ladder towards a conviction of being a member of a proscribed organisation, although additional evidence would be required.
<P>
Clause 105 deals with the inferences that can be drawn from people being silent or failing to mention facts. Clause 105(2) allows the court to draw inferences when
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at any time before being charged . . . the accused, on being questioned . . . failed to mention a fact which is material to the offence and which he could reasonably be expected to mention, and . . . before being questioned the accused was permitted to consult a solicitor.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should preface my specific concerns about clauses 103 and 104 by saying that I am not aware that, under part VII or any other law that works with it, there is a guarantee of entitlement to consult our proverbial friends, the lawyers. There is no right of access to a solicitor. If people are dealt with under part VII, will they be informed of their right to consult a solicitor? Will they be allowed to have a solicitor and, if so, from when? Are the Government considering adding such a provision to the Bill?
<P>
On 21 January, the clauses were discussed jointly by the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office, on behalf of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which made representations in December. The proposition is that the clause will probably fall foul of the Human Rights Act 1998. The conflict could be triggered by clause 104 and the right to a fair trial. The Minister will be relieved to hear that I shall only summarise the submissions to the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office.
<P>
Article 6 of the European convention on human rights provides for the right to a fair trial. In practice, opinions offered by police officers rely on intelligence and their personal experience. By definition, if they use intelligence-based information, the normal evidence rules would exclude that from being valid evidence in court because it would be hearsay. It would not be given credibility as real evidence. As a result, there is no cross-examination in the normal way.
<P>
I accept that there is not an absolute right to call witnesses in court as there is no absolute right to cross-examine them, but the courts have established that there must be equality between the prosecutor and the defendant. I refer to the case of Kaubman v. Belgium, which took place about 10 years ago in Strasbourg, in which it was said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Everyone who is a party to such proceedings shall have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case to the court under conditions which do not place him at substantial disadvantage vis-a-vis his opponent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the Human Rights Bill was debated in 1998, the Government received advice that such a provision might be in breach of the European convention on human rights enacted in English law. Lord Lloyd considered the response of the European Court of Human Rights to a conviction that was based in large part on a statement of a police officer and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Would that conviction have the slightest chance of standing up in Strasbourg? . . . It would not have the slightest chance. It certainly would not stand up in our courts once the Human Rights Act comes into force''—[Official Report, House of Lords, 3 September 1998; Vol. 593, c.38.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the 1970s, Lord Diplock considered the provision and rejected it—obviously before the Diplock courts were set up. The Diplock commission concluded that it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``compelled to reject any evidential solution on these lines as inappropriate to be applied in a regular court of criminal law''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My understanding is that that is still the view of John Rowe, whom the Minister cited as the person appointed to carry out a regular review of the law and who produces an annual review to Parliament. John Rowe has argued that section 30A of the existing law, replicated in clause 104, is likely to constitute a breach of the convention.
<P>
The 1998 legislation has not yet been used in Northern Ireland. Perhaps the Minister could confirm that. That legislation may have been introduced in haste and could be regarded as an overreaction. I have not spoken specifically to police officers about it so I shall not assert that they do not wish to use it, but the fact that it has not been used suggests that there is a reluctance to use it. If that is the case, it may be better to own up to that now and ensure that the provision is removed from the legislation so that it is no longer there when the Human Rights Act 1998 comes into force. I ask the Minister to consider whether we should get the legislation right now rather than risk yet another challenge to the convention, with Strasbourg consequently taking on the British Government—which could occur through the courts of Northern Ireland, just as much as anywhere else, as from October this year when the ECHR is made part of domestic law.
<P>
Serious concerns have been raised about the compatibility declaration. Those who have put their concerns to me on human rights issues in regard to Northern Ireland find this part of the Bill the most worrying. I would be grateful if the Minister could respond on that issue, which I have hung on to the debate on the clause, which is the central clause. As I have said, it seems wise to have that debate at this stage. I will not push the matter to a vote; it is better for people outside to read the debate and reflect on the Minister's comments. It may be a matter that we wish to revisit on Report.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I appreciate the points that the hon. Gentleman raises. We are having a serious and genuine debate, as we did in September 1998. When the provision on proscription was introduced, it was said to be draconian. Everyone recognised that it stretched the law to its limits and criticism was made during that debate about emergency provisions being applied in haste and without due consideration, with all the consequences of that. The Government understood that. They also understood the questions that were being asked on whether the provision constituted a breach of human rights legislation as it then stood.
<P>
Given that that consideration had already taken place, and the judgments that have been made since, we have come to a different conclusion than that of those who advise the hon. Gentleman. That does not mean that at some stage the law will not be subject to scrutiny and found not to comply with the human rights convention. However, we have given the full weight of consideration to that aspect and are satisfied that the legislation is compliant. If it were not, we would not have made that declaration, which was not given easily. That declaration was not issued automatically, but had first to be thoroughly examined by those who advise Ministers. Ministers must then cross-question about it before such a statement is made. It is the Minister who makes that declaration who must be satisfied. We are satisfied that the provision is compliant; otherwise, it would not be there.
<P>
It is easy to recall what happened on 15 August 1998. Despite the existing legislation and all the information and intelligence that we had, we could not prevent the bomb in Omagh that killed 29 people. We remember the reaction in the wider community, not only in Great Britain, but in many communities that had hitherto supported terrorism in all its manifestations. Suddenly people realised that we were moving into a new situation and that a dissident group had carried out that act.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Government had done nothing, we would have been accused—rightly—of standing back and watching that group's development taking off apace without any attempt to provide the police with additional powers to bring those responsible to justice. That was the motivation for the decision to recall Parliament in September 1998 and that judgment was correct. By any standards, it was a heavyweight debate; all the issues were examined and the Government responded according to what they considered right for all the citizens of the United Kingdom. It is worth bearing in mind the fact that the Republic of Ireland introduced similar legislation.
<P>
We include the provision in the Bill because we judge that it is still a useful tool in the armoury of the RUC and others who try to bring terrorists to justice. However, as with every other aspect of part VII, it must be subject to constant review. We have said consistently throughout the debates on previous clauses that such measures must continue to be considered. Are they worthy of remaining on the statute book? Are they achieving anything—or do they fall foul of subsequent court judgments in Europe or elsewhere? We must take all those questions into account.
<P>
I understand that the Republic of Ireland has undertaken a review of its equivalent legislation, and a report is due in May or June. We must take cognisance of what that says, because we will be acting in concert, and the threat exists on both sides of the border.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked whether the law had ever been used. The answer is no; no charges have been brought. However, that does not prove that the law is wrong. It simply proves that, as ever when trying to bring terrorists to justice, it is very difficult for the RUC and the police south of the border to bring such people to justice. Even with what we defined as law that went to the very limits, we have still not been able to bring the perpetrators of that terrible act in Omagh—or people who may be planning such acts as we speak.
<P>
The police have the provision and they know that they can apply it. I am sure that they would not hesitate to use it appropriately if it meant that they could stop another Omagh bomber. However, it is not for the police to judge people; that is the role of the courts. If the police have misapplied the legislation and not given proper legal protection to a suspect, that will be a matter for the defence. The police must have powers to bring people to justice and the courts can then decide whether the law has been applied appropriately.
<P>
I have no hesitation in justifying the legislation because I remember only too graphically what happened in Omagh. It is easy to argue otherwise, but we should all cast our minds back to what happened in Omagh and consider what we need to do to stop terrorists. We cannot achieve that simply by argument; we need laws, because these are ruthless people, determined to kill, bomb and maim. They still operate with that mindset; they have not changed their thought processes. Therefore, we need the law to tackle them. That complies with human rights legislation because it protects everyone's right to life
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The good thing about this Committee is that, whatever our differences, we all agree that terrorism, which seeks to maim and kill, is unacceptable, and there has been no cheap political point scoring about that. I should tell the Minister that I am just as sensitive as he is on the matter; my brother served in the barracks in Omagh and on the streets of the town. I am, therefore, motivated by exactly the same concern that the horrible deeds that were committed there should not be perpetrated on any of our fellow citizens.
<P>
The purpose of the debate was to allow us to argue about the provision which was clearly controversial. As the Minister rightly said, it was the subject of a major parliamentary debate. It was controversial both because of the speed with which it was pushed through Parliament and the extent of the powers to be used. I am content that the Committee should leave the debate there; as I said, we may want to come back to it. I am interested to hear that the Government are watching and are in appropriate contact with the Irish Government, in relation to their review.
<P>
Obviously, it must be better for the law in such cases to be similar on both sides of the border, so that the two police forces and the other security forces can work together. The Minister will know better than I do that the ability to detect and deter terrorism will be hugely reduced, unless there are similar powers in the most suspect areas which are liable to terrorist activity—the counties on either side of the border. I understand that point. I am content that we should leave the matter there for now, but I am sure that people will return to this issue.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We are making good progress. We are now at the clause that deals with the duration of part VII. I can be very brief; I want to give the Minister the opportunity to tell us what process and what criteria the Government will use for assessing the duration of part VII.
<P>
The Minister knows that there are those who say that part VII should not be in the Bill at all: I do not take that view. It is better to start with this legislation, and then to phase it out over a period. We know that there will be the usual annual parliamentary order, but it would be helpful if the Minister could give the Committee further information about that process and, most importantly, about the consultation that will take place before the Government take their annual decision.
<P>
We hope that the Northern Ireland Assembly will stay in being, but decisions on whether it will be suspended for a while are obviously matters for resolution elsewhere and another time. Whatever happens, there are now elected political representatives in Northern Ireland—along with other recognised interest groups—and it would be helpful to know that there will be a methodical, regular and certain review period that will allow everyone to feel that they have been included, that there is no suddenness about the timetable or secrecy about the operation, and that people who want to make representations can do so. People must be able to see that the debate is happening in public, and that the annual decision will be based on the published evidence that people have submitted. It would be helpful to know that the Government had such a process in mind; it is the right way to proceed.
<P>
This part of the Bill obviously relates to Northern Ireland. None the less, there are many who are not elected representatives or residents of Northern Ireland but who have an interest in that process and want to be involved in it—the hon. Member for Basingstoke is an obvious example. Will there be a formal request for such people to submit their views, and a timetable to engage the rest of us? We may want to participate in evaluating the situation before the Government's annual decision, and before the House is asked to renew the legislation or to drop part of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. Only the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly has introduced a new aspect to the handling of the issue. The politicians were there before, although they were not working in the present structure set up under the Good Friday agreement. I think that we touched on the issue in an earlier debate about the relationship between the assembly and the Government. Such matters may be outwith the assembly's remit, but it would be difficult for us to be legalistic and say, ``You go off and talk about health and education and whatever else, and we'll deal with the national security and security issues, because you're not entitled to discuss them.'' That is not the way it works.
<P>
We consult extensively on all matters relating to the security landscape. I do not know of any intention to set a formal timetable, but we constantly consult all the political parties in Northern Ireland. If a Minister's door appeared to be shut, it would soon be forced open by the pressure of having to talk. When one party wishes to make a point, other parties demand a similar right. That applies not just to Ministers such as me or the Secretary of State, but to the Prime Minister, who has been willing to engage in consultation at all levels. We have moved forward so successfully in Northern Ireland to date because we consult and apply the best practice of openness.
<P>
The assessor's annual reports on the legislation will remain in place. The debate under the affirmative procedure will allow full examination of the Government's decisions on the continuation of the legislation or removal of parts of it. To remove any element of part VII, we will have to use the affirmative procedure, so someone will object. It would be unusual not to have an objection, whether we progressed or stood still. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the past arrangements will continue to apply, and will be enhanced by the new relationship and protocols between the Government and the assembly. The ways in which the new assembly will operate are not yet defined, so we may have to adapt to what it demands of the United Kingdom Government.
<P>
As I said, we have shown a willingness to be 100 per cent. co-operative. We can succeed in our arguments only if they are transparent and fully justified, and if we take the bulk of the Northern Ireland people with us. The legislation is undoubtedly very sensitive. With every convert that we make to the underlying reasons for it, we approach the point at which the legislation is no longer required. That is what we are all driving to achieve. The assembly has a major role in that aim through articulating the views of people in Northern Ireland. If we can progress to the total primacy of politics over the threat of the gun and the bomb, we will have achieved the objective that everyone in the Committee and in the wider law-abiding community supports.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> If the Minister is as helpful with this inquiry as he was with my previous one, that would be a double bonus. However, I appreciate that the responsibility for replying to the debate has probably passed along the Front Bench to his Home Office colleague, who may give a different response.
<P>
The clause requires that prosecutions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall not be instituted . . . for an offence under . . . this Act without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
either the DPP for Northern Ireland or the DPP for England and Wales. Will the Minister tell us some of the history of consents to prosecutions in Northern Ireland, or rather for Northern Ireland-based offences in the rest of the United Kingdom, which are the only basis we have had for legislation to date? If he has the figures showing how often there has been DPP consent, going back a reasonable number of years, it would be helpful to know them. The provision that the DPP must consent to bringing serious charges under the Act is welcome, and provides a safeguard.
<P>
Will the Minister assure us, given that this is new legislation covering new territory for the United Kingdom, that decisions on whether to consent to prosecutions will always be made by the DPP and not delegated? Will he make it clear that the person who signs will not be a member of the DPP's staff, but the DPP himself? That would give additional reassurance to those who are nervous about the legislation. The clause is one of those that allow the Minister to give such a reassurance.
<P>
Will the Minister also say whether there is intended to be a role for the Law Officers—in addition to the DPPs—in any of the four countries of the United Kingdom, and if so at what stage in the proceedings?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I considered doing my doctorate at university on the history of consents to prosecution in the United Kingdom, unfortunately I did not, and therefore I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the detailed answer that he wants. However, I will write to him with the information that he seeks.
<P>
On the first point of substance that he made, it is my understanding that the DPP himself will take the decisions and will be involved directly in that process. Under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, all offences are subject to the consent of the DPP for Northern Ireland. Proceedings in Scotland can be undertaken only on the instructions of the Lord Advocate or procurator fiscal, who is the Scottish equivalent of the DPP. In practice, the DPP would consult the Attorney-General and the Law Officers on such cases, for obvious reasons. I hope that that offers some reassurance. In practice, as I understand it, the Crown Prosecution Service headquarters has been closely in touch with the Metropolitan police, and can consider cases with a high level of expertise. Therefore, there is no suggestion that non-experts—if I may call them that—will consider cases within the CPS.
<P>
I hope that that offers the reassurances that the hon. Gentleman seeks. I will write to him with the facts that he wants, but I cannot give a detailed history of the legal structure in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I would regard it as a courtesy, Mr. Malins, as I am sure you would, if Conservative Members could also have copies of the letter that the Minister proposes to write to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Of course I would be delighted to help. I hope that, on that basis, we can agree that the clause should stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's reply. I will make a point, but he need not respond to it. There is at present an inquiry into allegations of discrimination in the CPS. I make no point about the truth or otherwise of those allegations, but it is clearly important in relation to Northern Ireland that the CPS is seen to be a non-discriminatory body. I am sure that safeguards are in place, but they will be even more securely in place under the Bill. We should make sure that everyone has confidence in the representative nature of the CPS, and do away with the risk of allegations being made of impartiality or bias. Discrimination is not only a race matter; in Northern Ireland, among other things, it is also a matter of denomination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The hon. Gentleman is clearly on the margins of anxiety about discrimination in the CPS. I have no observation to make on that, but may I ask him whether he shares my view that the prosecuting function is ultimately answerable to the House through the Attorney-General? We, as Members of Parliament, have a handle on the matter, do we not? Does the hon. Gentleman share that view?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. It was a great advance in the legal system that the CPS was set up, despite the difficulties. My experience of its work in my constituency has been positive. I have visited its offices, and know that it is overloaded, overstretched and overworked. Separating the prosecuting function from the investigative function was good constitutional and civil progress. The accountability of the CPS though the Law Officers' Department is an additional safeguard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I should like to place on record my strong conviction that the Director of Public Prosecutions, who leads the Crown Prosecution Service, is absolutely determined to root out any sense of discrimination that might exist in the service. I say that in light of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful. I am sure that the clarity of determination that the service, its officers and its practices should not be discriminatory will be as important in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 113. as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 114</center></H4>
<H4><center>Crown servants, regulators, ÿc.</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have a couple of questions. Subsection (1) provides for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State to make regulations providing for sections 14 to 21 and 37 to apply to persons in the public service of the Crown.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clauses 14 to 21 and 37 cover the offence of financing terrorist organisations and the duty to disclose information to the authorities about terrorist organisations. I can understand why legislative provision needs to be made to protect people in the public services who are engaged in covert operations of one sort or another against terrorism. I can understand also that that might include not only police officers and members of the security or intelligence services but, from time to time, civil servants and members of Customs and Excise who have knowledge of what is going on.
<P>
Thinking about the import of the subsection, however, I can find little reason for the need to make regulations, other than to provide exemption for people engaged in counter-terrorist work. I look for some explanation as to how the Government exercise legislative powers in relation to public servants and how they see the power being used in future.
<P>
I have a similar question on subsection (2), which provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations for clause 18 powers not to apply to various categories of public servant. Clause 18 imposes a duty on all members of the public, save those to whom exceptions are specifically granted, to pass to a constable or other authority any information that comes into their possession about the activities of a terrorist or a terrorist organisation. Once again, I can see why it is necessary to provide in law an exception for people in the public service who are engaged in counter-terrorist work. However, the subsection is widely drawn, referring to regulations possibly applying to people who, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``performing or connected with the performance of regulatory, supervisory, investigative or registration functions of a public nature.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In theory, that definition could cover a large number of people. I expect that the Government's intention is that the power would be exercised in a more closely defined way, and once again I would be grateful to the Minister if he would explain what the Government intend.
<H4><center>[MR. ANDREW HUNTER in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Congratulations on your elevation to the Chair, Mr. Hunter.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury has made his points fairly. Subsections (1) and (2) empower the Secretary to make regulation. Subsection (3) clarifies how those regulations might operate, stating that they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may make different provision for different purposes, . . . provision which is to apply only in specified circumstances'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point about the clause not being too widely drawn, and we listened carefully to what he said about how the regulations are designed to be specific.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made two specific points about subsection (1). Its purpose is to ensure that Crown privilege cannot be used by public servants to avoid prosecution for money-laundering offences. An example would be Crown servants who work for National Savings, who should not be able to evade prosecution for their money-laundering offences by virtue of the fact that they are public servants. That is the intention.
<P>
Subsection (2) is designed for people in roles in which the obligation to disclose suspicion could hamper the proper exercise of their functions. There is a real issue about regulatory and investigative functions. Our concern is to ensure that the obligation to disclose does not hamper the functions more generally.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that, when we consider whether regulation should be drawn up, we shall be careful to examine his concerns and try to avoid them. I hope that clause 114 will stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>[MR. HUMFREY MALINS in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I tried to catch Mr. Hunter's eye before the Minister spoke. However, I shall flag up the subject of whether regulations should cover journalists. They are not public servants in the same way, as I understand. The Minister will be aware of their investigative duties and concerns. I ask only that that be thought about, as it might be welcomed and prove worth while.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We are now dealing more with drafting matters than substance. Clause 117 is a helpful innovation. I do not believe that we have had for many years a clause that contains an index of definitions. I have not served before on a Committee considering a Bill that contains one.
<P>
Just to make life easier for people who have to read the law, might it be a good idea to contemplate putting the index of definitions at the front of the Bill, with the other introductory items such as the explanatory notes, the list of clauses and schedules, and the declaration? I realise that it might be argued that if it were put only at the front of the Bill it might not have full legal power. However, the index of definitions might be hidden somewhere at the back, and there must be merit in people being able to consult an alphabetical list at the beginning of the Bill to discover what is defined in it. My suggestion is merely intended to tidy up how we draft legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I am not a parliamentary draftsman. The Committee has been enlightened by the various dictionary references that the hon. Gentleman has offered during our proceedings. I shall ensure that the draftsmen consider the points that he has made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 55, leave out line 32.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 137, in page 55, line 43, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(j) paragraph 17(3) of Schedule 6'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Under paragraph 17 of schedule 6, the Secretary of State has the authority to make regulations to empower an examining officer to insist that certain information be provided to him by the owners or agents of ships or aircraft. The information may relate to passengers, crew or vehicles belonging to either passengers or crew. Under paragraph 18 of schedule 6, failure to comply with duties imposed by other provisions in the schedule, including the duty to provide such information, is a criminal offence. The amendment would change the system of parliamentary assent that would be required for the regulations that the Secretary of State may make under paragraph 17 of schedule 6. I suggest that it be done by affirmative resolution, rather than by negative resolution as the Government propose.
<P>
Paragraph 17 of schedule 6 implies that the information required would be expressed in fairly general terms. The language of the schedule does not suggest that it will be different from one ship or aircraft to another. We seem to be considering a general specification to be included in the statutory instrument. It does not, therefore, seem unreasonable to give Parliament the right to scrutinise that, ask the Government questions and give formal assent to the Secretary of State's proposal before it comes into force.
<P>
Parliament should be more assertive, in respect of statutory instruments. There are cases—including some in other parts of the Bill that I have not sought to amend—in which the Government need to act quickly or the content of statutory instruments may have to be changed at very short notice. In those circumstances, I can understand why the idea of negative procedure is appropriate.
<P>
In this instance, however, even if precedent suggested the negative procedure, it would not be unreasonable for us to consider the matter further and decide that the affirmative procedure should be introduced in place of the arrangements in the Bill. That would ensure more effective parliamentary scrutiny, and I cannot see why the Government would want to insist on having the power to go ahead, before formal parliamentary debate and assent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The hon. Member for Aylesbury has explained the rationale behind his amendment very clearly, and I agree with everything that he has said; he has described it entirely accurately.
<P>
We have retained such a provision so that, as the police move more and more towards intelligence-led work—which we encourage—they can focus their attention on sailings, flights or routes that may be of particular interest. That will also be less inconvenient to travelling members of the public. We decided on the order-making approach to give more flexibility in the types of information that may be requested. With technology advancing all the time, and operational requirements changing, it is better not to be bound for all time on the detail of information.
<P>
That has been our general approach. Of course, owners of ships and planes, and agents, have a perfectly understandable interest in the information that they will be asked to provide on request. Theirs is a legitimate concern, and they will be anxious to ensure that they are not asked to provide unreasonable amounts or types of information, as that could hold up their passengers.
<P>
The power is not new, but the information that may be requested is not fixed for all time. The Bill offers scope to obtain information prior to arrival. We have not yet decided what information will be contained in the initial order to be made by the Secretary of State under paragraph 17(3) of schedule 6, but we envisage that an order will be made in time for the Bill's coming into force. It is also our intention to consult widely in and around the industry before we introduce the order. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
We do not think that it is necessary to opt for the affirmative procedure in addition. Section 18 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 contains a similar power, and Parliament decided that the negative procedure was appropriate in that case. That is why we have moved forward on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Given their very large majority, the Government should not pray in aid a similar, look-alike provision in another Bill that passed through the House in 1999. That is an understandable attitude of Governments of all stripes, but it is slightly more worrying in the case of a Government with such a large majority who, given the choice, would rather not go to the trouble of affirmative resolution. I will not be so dramatic as to say that behind every such claim one can hear the noise of breaking glass, but the tendency is slightly dangerous.
<P>
In fairness to him, I must admit that the Minister has involved himself in the proceedings of the Committee with great equanimity, wisdom and good nature—and I am going to ask him for another demonstration of that good nature. The moment that the Executive start to treat Parliament casually, we are on a slope. It is not the slope to perdition, but is not quite best practice. Affirmative resolutions should be required; Parliament should have the chance to debate the issues, even if it is only briefly in Committee. The House should have the opportunity to talk about them, before the Executive move on and pull another lever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's kind remarks. I do not know whether I can offer him equanimity on this occasion.
<P>
I need to emphasise the importance of parliamentary debate on the issues before us. That is why, following many representations from across the House, we have made proposals about the way in which the annual report is produced, considered and discussed. The Committee will discuss our proposals later. It is open to hon. Members, in all the ways with which the hon. Gentleman is familiar, to ask questions about the Executive's role and about how they operate. I understand what he says about other legislation, but I was not making a steamroller point or saying that the provision was right simply because it had been agreed. I was saying that some consistency across the application of different types of relatively similar legislation is not an entirely unreasonable principle. That is why I prayed in aid the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
<P>
I understand if the Opposition want to divide on the matter. However, I hope that they are prepared to consider what I said about the importance of proper parliamentary debate on the Bill and the commitments that I made on consulting widely on the regulations and orders before their introduction. I hope that the hon. Member for Aylesbury will consider withdrawing amendment No. 136 as a result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I must acknowledge that, in fairness to the Minister and the Government, it is not only they who have fallen into bad habits by bringing before Parliament Bills that include ever more enabling powers, which give Ministers the right to introduce measures through secondary legislation. We must think afresh about our constitutional arrangements and seek ways to enhance the legislature's powers of scrutiny and challenge as regards Executive authority.
<P>
I acknowledge that the Minister, the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office will follow through a programme of consultation. However, my experience is that the list of consultees often includes the corporate great and good—it is a standard list readily available on the departmental computer. After a statutory instrument has come into effect, we often find that a corner of the business world or the voluntary sector that has been adversely affected was not consulted and was not even aware that the legislation was being considered. For those reasons, we are right to ask the Government to think again and I propose to test the Committee's opinion on the matter.

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Will Ministers give us an estimate of the cost to the Government of this legislation being enacted, at least for the first few years after it comes into force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I have the information to hand; it is set out in paragraph 133 of the explanatory notes under the heading ``Financial Effects of the Bill'':
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``depending on the number of additional cases, the additional annual costs could amount to at least £1.9 million to the Lord Chancellor's Department, £1.2 million to the Crown Prosecution Service and £2.3 million to the Home Office.''<P>

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this it will be convenient to take the following: New clause 6—Declarations (No. 2)—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) Provisions of this Act shall become operative only when Parliament has approved a declaration by the Secretary of State made under this section that a campaign is occurring which is leading to widespread fear within at least a section of the public and that at least a section of the public is in serious danger.
<P>
(2) A declaration made under this section shall specify the period of time and the area of the United Kingdom for which the declaration shall be valid, as well as the provisions of this Act which are to become operative upon the making of the declaration.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Clause 122 is about commencement, so will Ministers tell us when they expect to bring the Bill into force? Will the whole Bill come into force at once, or will it come into force in separate parts? If in separate parts, on what dates is each part likely to come into force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The clause provides for commencement of most of the Bill by order. The exception, as set out in subsection (1), is that schedule 1, which preserves most of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, in some cases with amendment, for a transitional period, and clause 2(2), which gives effect to it, will commence on Royal Assent. The same is true of the general provisions in clauses 122 to 125. There may be different start dates for different provisions in the rest of the Bill. We expect to bring provisions commenced by order into force early in 2001. I cannot yet be more specific, but I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman and the Committee some guidance.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to make a point through the Minister to the parliamentary draftsmen, although it is perhaps also for Home Office consideration. We are in an era of varying degrees of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It would be better practice to make clear on the outside of the Bill and in its drafting how much it relates, for example, to the United Kingdom, or to England, or to England and Wales. I know that one must currently do some cross-referencing to discover that. Clause 57, for example, is the first of three clauses: one on England and Wales, one on Northern Ireland and one on Scotland. Those clauses say nothing about where they apply to, unlike their marginal notes—which are not legally part of the Act. One must look at a clause at the back of the Bill to find the legal explanation. With word processors, a Bill could be better organised so that somebody could quickly look at the face of it and find out which bits apply to the whole country and which apply to parts of it. That would make the correlation with devolved Parliaments and assemblies better.
<P>
It might be better to consider drafting legislation so that the United Kingdom bits were first and the specifically national bits were at the end. I appreciate that that has as much or as little logic as the present arrangements, but I wanted to take my first opportunity since devolution to suggest that we could improve the drafting of Bills to make them easier for non-politicians and non-lawyers to understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> That was a wicked anti-lawyer remark. I will certainly ensure that the hon. Gentleman's comments are observed and studied carefully by the parliamentary draftsmen.
<P>
Clause 124, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 125 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> We should briefly debate the purpose of the clause, which, as I understand it, is to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings. That is a laudable objective, which the Opposition support. There appear to be precedents in our subscription to international conventions against hijacking and piracy that justify taking extraterritorial jurisdiction in the case of offences listed in the convention. I have several brief questions about clause 60 and about the relationship between the powers of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the Bill and the extradition arrangements that might apply to people who are convicted of crimes under the international convention.
<P>
As I understand—
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

Adjourned till Tuesday 8 February at half-past Ten o'clock.
