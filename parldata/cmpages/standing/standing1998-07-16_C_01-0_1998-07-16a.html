<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Truswell </B>(Pudsey): Good morning, Mr. O'Hara. I do not intend to take up too much of the Committee's time. Some Committee members will be aware of the background to my introduction of the Bill, but I think that it is worth repeating it.
<P>
Last November a constituent of mine, Mr. John Knowles, came to my surgery and told me the tragic story of the death of his son, David. I should like to spend a few minutes telling the Committee that story.
<P>
David was 14. One evening in March 1997 he stayed on at school to watch his friends play football. After the game, the group of friends decided to go home via the centre of Pudsey. When they arrived there David's friends, who were still in their football kit, asked David to go and get them some alcopops. David complied and went to a nearby Threshers off-licence, where he was sold the alcopops that he requested. A few minutes after returning to his friends, David decided that he wanted some alcohol of his own. He returned to the same Threshers off-licence and was sold four cans of lager. David returned to his friends and they set off on the journey home.
<P>
In due course, they reached the busy Stanningley bypass, which forms part of the Leeds inner ring road. At that moment David, whom everybody who knew him has described as a very serious boy, suddenly shouted out ``Let's run.'' He charged down the embankment, across the first part of the dual carriageway and onto the second part, where he was struck by a car. He died shortly afterwards from the massive injuries that he sustained.
<P>
The police quickly attended the scene and took statements from witnesses. As a result, they went to the Threshers off-licence in Pudsey, interviewed the staff and seized the security videos, which showed David being sold alcohol on two occasions within about five minutes. On the basis of the police report, the Crown Prosecution Service decided to mount a prosecution against the two members of staff who had sold David the alcohol. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to pursue the licence holder, because it was felt that she had been able to demonstrate due diligence in that she had given adequate training to the two members of staff about the dangers of selling alcohol to minors.
<P>
The case came to the magistrates court on two occasions, on both of which it was deferred. On the third occasion the CPS announced that it was withdrawing the case. It did so because it had come up against a huge loophole, which my Bill seeks to close. Under section 169(1) of the Licensing Act 1964, a person can be prosecuted for selling alcohol to someone under the age of 18 if they are either the licence holder or the servant of the licence holder. The word ``servant'' has a very narrow definition in law. To be a servant, one has to be directly employed by the licence holder. In this case, the two members of staff were employed by a national company, Threshers, and not by the individual licence holder, who was their manager.
<P>
I do not want any Committee member to jump to the conclusion that my Bill is an emotional over-reaction to the tragedy that John Knowles told me about on that day when he visited my surgery. The loophole in the law has been known about for 30 years. It arose first in a case called Brandish v. Poole in 1968. Mr. Poole was a pub landlord who went to a football match, leaving his wife in charge of the bar. His wife sold cider to a 14-year-old and was subsequently charged, prosecuted and convicted. The appeal court at that time overturned the conviction because it held that Mrs. Poole was not her husband's servant in the legal sense: she was not directly and formally employed by him.
<P>
A more recent case, which has a greater bearing on that of David Knowles, was that of Russell v. DPP in December 1996. Russell sold alcohol to minors and was prosecuted and convicted. Again, however, the prosecution was overturned because Russell was held not to be the servant of the licence holder. He was employed by a national company called Unwins and not by the individual whose name appeared on the licence.
<P>
My Bill seeks to overcome the limitations of the word ``servant'' by introducing the word ``agent'', which has a much wider remit. That would have ensured that the prosecutions against the two individuals in the David Knowles case at least took place. No one can prejudge whether they would have been convicted, but the important point of principle is that the prosecution could at least have taken place.
<P>
I do not need to stress for the Committee the huge implications of the loophole. We all know that a tremendous proportion of alcohol that is sold nowadays is sold by off-licence companies and supermarkets.
<P>
Although the Committee cannot send the Bill any further because there is no more time for private Members' business in this Session, it can perform a useful task. It can show that the House acknowledges that there is a loophole, recognises its enormity and is determined that something be done to close it at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing </B>(Epping Forest): The hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) has described very well the tragic circumstances that led him to introduce the Bill. On reading it, I thought that it was perfectly reasonable and would close a fairly obvious loophole in the law. Having heard the hon. Gentleman describe the circumstances that brought him to introduce it, I am even more convinced that he was absolutely right to do so. Speaking for myself and my colleagues, we have no objection whatever to the Bill and, indeed, support it.
<P>
The Bill imposes a duty of care on any adult who sells alcohol to a young person by introducing the word ``agent'' in addition to the word ``servant''. It is perfectly reasonable to require such an adult to exercise caution in case that young person is under the age when he is legally allowed to buy alcohol and considered capable of consuming it responsibly. It will be sad if the Bill does not pass through all its legislative stages in this House and in the other place before the end of this Session. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to impose a duty of care and he has the support of Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell </B>(Colchester): The Liberal Democrats give the Bill total support. As has been mentioned, it will go no further now, but a Minister is present and I sincerely hope that time will be found.
<P>
Everybody assumed that the law took care of the eventuality that the hon. Member for Pudsey described--witness the fact that three court cases were initiated, although they did not proceed futher. We are talking not so much about a loophole but about a gaping chasm in the Licensing Act 1964. The circumstances that brought about the Bill are obviously sorrowful and I hope that, as a result of that sadness, we will, if nothing else, remove the loophole. In that way, people who break what everybody assumed was the law can be dealt with accordingly. I hope that the message will go out to the licensed trade that, although there is a loophole, we are doing everything we can to ensure that it is plugged.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I apologise for missing the first three or four minutes of the sitting. My hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) has spoken for the Liberal Democrats. I should, however, like the hon. Member for Pudsey to give the Committee one assurance on vicarious criminal liability, for want of a better expression. Will he assure the Committee that such liability cannot be imposed unless it is knowingly incurred? I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would deal with that question.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey on the thoughtful and realistic way in which he introduced his Bill. I am well aware of the tragic circumstances that led him to propose it; we have, indeed, discussed them more than once. I share his concern about the problems that have arisen, but I have reservations about the way in which the provisions are framed, which I shall come to in a moment. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) came close to considering the problems.
<P>
It may help the Committee if I spend a few moments describing how existing provisions work. Currently, the law focuses very sharply on licensees, to avoid criminalising family and social gatherings at which alcohol is available. Hon. Members should bear in mind that it is not an offence for a child to drink. Nor is it an offence, generally, to give a child aged five or more an alcoholic drink. Obviously, we would all urge and caution that such freedom should be exercised in the most responsible manner possible. The law provides for the freedom to be exercised reasonably.
<P>
The basic control on the undesirable supply of alcohol is the prohibition of its sale, which should occur only in properly licensed premises. Alcohol cannot, therefore, be lawfully sold unless someone involved holds a licence. A person who has a licence is generally prohibited from selling alcohol to somebody under the age of 18, or allowing any employee to do so. It is also an offence for the licence holder knowingly to allow somebody under the age of 18 to drink alcohol in a bar.
<P>
The law was strengthened in 1988 to make those acts prima facie offences, but it allows people a defence of due diligence, which would be made on the basis that they have done all that they reasonably could to prevent an offence being committed.
<P>
I agree with the central point of my hon. Friend's Bill and with his comments. The existing law is inadequate to deal with every circumstance in which alcohol may be sold to a person under 18 years of age, especially when the people selling the alcohol are not employed by the licensee. Nevertheless, I have serious reservations about the effect that the Bill would have. Some of the consequences would be unintended by my hon. Friend. By seeking to amend section 169(1) of the Licensing Act 1964--

<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> Notwithstanding the perceived problems that the Minister is highlighting, will he assure the Committee that he will take on board the spirit and thrust of the proposals and return in the next Session with a watertight Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If the hon. Gentleman bears with me, I shall outline the problems. I shall also give some indication of how we might proceed in future, although perhaps not in words that he will like.
<P>
Section 169(1) of the 1964 Act creates three offences. The first is for the licensee or his servant to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in licensed premises . . . sell intoxicating liquor to a person under eighteen''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The second is for the licensee or his servant to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``knowingly allow a person under 18 to consume intoxicating liquor in a bar'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and thirdly for the licensee to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``knowingly allow any person to sell intoxicating liquor to a person under 18''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in licensed premises.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My advice is that the wording of the third offence implies that a licensee does not commit the first offence if his servant sells intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 without the licensee's knowledge and permission. That means that in the context of section 169, a person sells drink if he physically hands it over in exchange for money.
<P>
The Bill would not affect the third offence; it would make it an offence for any person or his agent or servant to sell intoxicating liquor to a person under 18. A person can sell drink only if he carries out the physical transaction; it would be impossible to sell by means of an agent or servant. The Bill would therefore cast doubt on the meaning of ``sell'' in such a way as to cause uncertainty as to what the offence is. That is a somewhat convoluted way of describing it, but it is a complicated matter and I hope that the Committee will understand that I am trying to be helpful, not critical.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I fully appreciate the difficulty of the legal technicalities that the hon. Gentleman has described. Will he assure the Committee that the Government accept the spirit of the Bill and that their purpose will be to impose a duty of care on any adult who is in a position to sell intoxicating liquor to a minor? I believe that there is a clear distinction in the Bill between a family party where alcohol may be consumed by a person under 18 and a situation in which money is handed over in a commercial transaction. I may be wrong in my assumption; I am asking the hon. Gentleman's advice on whether there is a clear distinction. If so, do the Government accept the spirit of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I confirm that I believe that the hon. Lady is correct: there is such a distinction.
<P>
In respect of her earlier point, the hon. Member for Colchester--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not assume too much. I am mindful of the point raised earlier by the hon. Member for Colchester. I share the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey and I accept the spirit of the Bill's intentions, but I do not want to give a specific commitment to the means of meeting those intentions in Committee. I understand that there is a problem, and it is necessary to find a way of tackling it, but I do not want to be overly prescriptive in stating how to do so. My hon. Friend has performed an invaluable service by proposing a solution which enables us to consider some of its pitfalls and to look for alternatives. I do not mean to pour cold water on what my hon. Friend wants to achieve--quite the opposite--but we must find a way to achieve the same result.
<P>
The Bill would also amend the second offence, so that any person who himself or by his agent or servant knowingly allows a person under 18 to consume intoxicating liquor in a bar would commit an offence. That offence could be committed by third parties--that is, persons other than those working in the premises and the person under 18--such as parents, relatives and others in a position of authority in respect of the minor.
<P>
That would raise practical difficulties in determining whether a person allowed someone under 18 to consume alcohol. In order to allow something, a person must in the first place be able to prevent it. That is a difficult matter and I shall give examples to illustrate my point.
<P>
First, let us suppose that two brothers, one aged 18 and the other 17, go into a pub. The 17-year-old buys two pints of beer, one for each of them, which they drink. He commits an offence under subsection (2) both by buying the beer and by consuming it, but does his elder brother commit an offence under subsection (1), as amended by the Bill? That is, does he allow his younger brother to consume the beer? The younger brother may normally--or always--do what his elder brother tells him to do, which would suggest that the elder brother had the power to prevent him from drinking the beer and that he had therefore committed the offence of knowingly allowing his brother to drink it. The younger brother may, however, never do what he is told, or he may be bigger and stronger and boss his elder brother about. Presumably it cannot then be said that the elder brother had allowed the younger brother to consume alcohol. Would that mean that no offence had been committed? We must address that concern.
<P>
An offence can also be committed by the acts of a servant or agent. I shall give another example. Let us say that the owner of a small business organises a leaving party in a pub to which all his staff are invited, including a 17-year-old youth. The employer, who does not attend the party, is aware that the youth likes a pint and can be expected to drink beer at the party. The youth indeed drinks beer there, an act that is seen by his fellow and more senior employees, who know that he is under 18. They do not stop him. Have they knowingly allowed the youth to consume the beer? Does the fact that they are senior employees give them the power to prevent him from consuming alcohol?
<P>
What about the employer himself? If his employees--that is, his ``servants''--allowed the youth to drink beer, is he guilty of knowingly allowing the drinking? Remember, he knew that the youth was likely to drink beer. Do the facts that he is the youth's employer and that the party took place during working hours mean that he could have prevented the youth from drinking? Would it be any different if the party took place outside working hours?
<P>
That gives an indication of some of the difficulties that we would face with this approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Minister has adumbrated exactly the point that gave me misgivings and to which I referred earlier. When he winds up, will the Minister confirm that he will bring forward in the next Session a Bill that will deal with these particular difficulties?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall come to that, although I was under the impression that I was winding up.
<P>
The Bill would render third parties liable to prosecution but it would also create serious doubts as to who committed an offence and in what circumstances. Another difficulty is that section 169(4B) currently provides a defence to a licensee--by virtue of the act or default of another person--where he is charged with an offence under subsection (1). The Bill would make people other than the licensee liable to prosecution for offences under subsection (1) without providing that defence. We can see no justification for providing a defence for the licensee but none for other people, who play no part in the running of the licensed premises.
<P>
Our main reservation about the Bill is that extending the chain of culpability beyond the licence holder or the licence holder's employees in the way proposed would fundamentally change matters. The issues should be considered carefully. We would not want to tackle one problem and create others, although I know that that is not my hon. Friend's intention.
<P>
We need to work out who should be criminally responsible when alcohol is sold to someone under 18; in what circumstances any such person should be able to plead a defence; whether a person should commit an offence if he happens to be in a bar when a youth under 18 drinks alcohol, or happens to have a degree of control over that youth; and what degree of knowledge should be required for one person to be liable for the acts or omissions of others.
<P>
I strongly support the principle behind the Bill, but the advice that I have received is that in its current form, it is unworkable and would need to be amended subsequently. In his realistic way, my hon. Friend has conceded that the vagaries of the parliamentary process mean that it is unlikely to proceed beyond today. However, I can confirm that Home Office officials are considering further the matters raised by my hon. Friend.
<P>
It would be unwise for me to be prescriptive today and say that one or other legislative means will be used to take matters further. I am not in a position to do that, but I can say that the anxieties expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey have been registered. I share them, and so does my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. We will try to find a suitable and appropriate way to remedy the loophole that my hon. Friend has identified.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor </B>(North-West Leicestershire): My hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey deserves congratulations for his persistence in trying to remedy a legal defect in the face of what my hon. Friend the Minister has described as the ``vagaries'' of the parliamentary process. I am pleased that the Minister is to do what he can to bridge a gap that has existed in the Licensing Act 1964 since it passed into the statute book 34 years ago. As a magistrate, I know that such loopholes can be immensely frustrating, especially when no Government over the past three decades have attempted a correction.
<P>
The case that gave rise to the Bill was tragic but, thankfully, rare. My area consists of a series of small towns, one or two of which at weekends become entertainment meccas for large catchment areas. Hundreds or even thousands of young people congregate in those towns, many of them well under the legal age for the purchase of alcohol. The liberalisation of the licensing law--if the hon. Member for Colchester will permit the phrase--has led some elements of the licensing trade to relax concentration on the licensee's responsibilities with regard to the sale and consumption of alcohol on licensed premises.
<P>
Although the Bill will now become becalmed in the parliamentary morass, I hope that its message will be heard in the relevant quarters. I know that the Government are listening, and I welcome that, but I hope too that the trade will refocus on the adequacy of existing controls on the sale and consumption of alcohol. The recent liberalisation of the trade has been welcome, but tighter monitoring is needed to ensure that licensees adhere to the legislation.
<P>
It should not be beyond the wit of man or of servants of the House of Commons to devise for my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey--or a successor to him--a form of words that will avoid the problems described by my hon. Friend the Minister. For example, I wonder whether a more suitable wording for clause 1(2) might not be ``the holder of the licence or his servant or agent''. The colleague of the manager of an off-licence is just as much an employee as the manager. Is he an agent of the licensee? I should be grateful if that question could be answered.
<P>
I welcome the measure and regret its derailment. I hope that the Government will find parliamentary time for, or that at least parliamentary support will be given to, a future private Member's Bill that will tighten the existing legislation. We need to send a message to the licensed trade that some members of its fraternity do not take seriously enough their responsibilities in regard to the sale and consumption of alcohol--a dereliction of duty which can cause social disorder, occasionally on a large scale. Thankfully, the kind of tragedy to which my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey referred is extremely rare. Problems caused by a widespread consumption of alcohol by under-age drinkers are far more common--they probably occur throughout the country. The measure will address that.

<B>Mr. John Gunnell </B>(Morley and Rothwell): I have been struck this morning by the strong support given to the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take note of that all-party support and of the consensus that the loophole should be blocked and that he will introduce appropriate wording, to achieve what we all hope, and find mechanisms for putting such legislation on the statute book.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. In response to him and to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Taylor), I can say that I shall consult Home Office officials and other advisers to find an appropriate form of words. It may not always be a licensee's agent who is involved, and it is difficult to determine the circumstances in which a particular action may take place, but I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Mr. Gunnell) that we are looking into that. I register and share the concern that has been expressed throughout the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Truswell:</B> I begin by welcoming all the comments made this morning. My Bill and the Committee stage have achieved all their useful objectives; awareness of the issue has been raised. I was delighted by the comments of hon. Members, which demonstrate the all-party consensus that the loophole needs to be closed. Most encouraging of all, the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister demonstrate that he and his Department take the matter seriously and are considering it carefully.
<P>
Several legal points have been made, but I have no intention, or capacity, to address them; they are far too arcane for a simple hon. Member such as me. The essence of my Bill is simplicity. It deals with an issue that was brought to me, as an ordinary Member, by a constituent who had noticed the anomaly. I gave a commitment to do all that I could to address that, but there is a limit to how far an individual can take legislation; at some stage it has to go into the realms of greater legal minds--which I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will employ in due course.
<P>
I shall examine the Bill in the light of hon. Members' comments, particularly those of the Minister. If no one else presents a Bill on the subject, I shall certainly do so in our next Session.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
