<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn):</B> I beg to move,<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during the proceedings on the Regional Development Agencies Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o’clock and half-past Four o’clock.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
It is a delight to see you in the Chair this morning, Dr. Clark, because we go back a long time. When we were members of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry we spent many happy days, and indeed some long nights, discussing the pit closure programme. I understand that you will be ably assisted by my hon. Friend the Member for Bootle (Mr. Benton) as your co-Chairman. I see a number of fresh faces here—hon. Members for whom this is the first time that they have served on a Standing Committee. I am sure that, under your chairmanship, they will be guided in all the good habits of Committees and that we will be able to make good progress on the Bill. <P>
The sittings motion sets the times and dates for our discussions on the Bill, which I am sure will be civilised and constructive. We propose that we meet, in the first instance, on Tuesday and Thursday morning of this week. The arrangements for 2 February onwards are being discussed through the usual channels. I hope that the Committee can give the Bill full consideration without having to sit excessively.<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): Dr. Clark, I join the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning in welcoming you warmly to the Committee. We look forward to your guidance and judgment about any matters that arise, where it is required. Like the Minister, I have a long-standing relationship with you, which may not go back to long nights on a Select Committee but certainly involved some long afternoons away from this place.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Tell us more.<P>
<b>Mr. Yeo:</b> Later.<P>
I know that you will share my view, Dr. Clark, and I am glad to hear the Minister say it as well, about the importance of the Bill and the need to give it careful consideration in Committee. I look forward to doing that and to working with all the hon. Members who are serving on it.<P>
The Bill raises a number of issues of principle, whose details will require scrutiny. The Second Reading debate provided, as usual, the opportunity for only a cursory examination of the Bill. Many sweeping statements were made in support of it, and time was not available to challenge them, but three are relevant to the sittings motion.<P>
The first is the Minister’s claim when he opened the Second Reading debate that, out of 10 English regions, only two came up to the average of the European Union regions if measured by the criterion of gross domestic product per head. I challenged that statistic during the debate, but my question was not answered. It is fundamental to the concept of regional development agencies and to the reasons why the Government claim that they are needed. It is difficult to see how we can proceed very far unless that question is answered.<P>
My concern is based on the fact that the Government’s claim about the under-performance of the English regions is based on figures relating to 1993. Yet, since 1993, Britain has out-performed other European Union countries each year. No other major European Union economy has come near to matching the United Kingdom in 1994, 1995, 1996 or 1997.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the Committee is interested in these figures and heard them on Second Reading, but I should be pleased if the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) would explain why the Committee needed more time to discuss them. He should not go through the Second Reading debate again.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to you, Dr. Clark. My concern is this. If the Committee had the benefit of up-to-date figures that related to 1997, it might turn out that the performance of the English regions was on average much better than that of most regions in the European Union.<P>
The Minister attaches much importance to that; he mentioned it in the fourth paragraph of his speech on Second Reading. It is clearly the single most important factor in his mind. If we do not have up-to-date figures, it is difficult to see how the Committee can judge whether all English regions should be covered by the Bill’s provisions. Indeed, perhaps we shall debate that later.<P>
Will the Minister produce for the Committee statistics that are more recent than 1993? That is not an unreasonable request. if we were conducting other affairs and making other decisions—for example, about running a business—we would not rely entirely on figures that were four years out of date. We would want to see the most recently available information.<P>
It is inconceivable that, with all the resources available to him, the Minister cannot produce figures even for 1996, and that we must rely on figures that are more than four years out of date. Will you, Dr. Clark, therefore ensure that before the Committee proceeds much further, up-to-date information is available to us? It is necessary if we are to make the right decisions. History would record a damning verdict on all hon. Members who made important decisions to impose on English regions, all the cost and bureaucracy that the creation of regional development agencies will involve when if we had the up-to-date figures the demand for those RDAs might disappear.<P>
My second concern is that the Bill appears to be the precursor of directly elected regional assemblies. The Minister referred to the Government’s plans in his speech in column 375 of Hansard of 14 January. Unfortunately, he did not enlarge on that reference. Will the Minister give us more information?<P>
The concept of directly elected regional assemblies is central to the measure; the regional chambers referred to in the Bill are expected in due course to evolve into directly elected regional assemblies. Important questions therefore arise, to which the Committee needs answers before it can consider those aspects. How will those regional assemblies be elected? Are the Government planning another proportional representation experiment?<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mr. Yeo, you will know that that matter is the subject of amendment No.1. Although a quick synopsis is in order, a full debate is not.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Again, I am most grateful, Dr. Clark, for your ruling on that point and for your confirmation that this is indeed a very important aspect of the Bill.<P>
My third concern is much more profound than the other two, and is not covered by amendments. the Government have placed extensive reliance on the outcome of the consultation process that was conducted last year. In column 373 of Hansard of 14 January, the Minister referred to the 1,500 responses to the consultation paper. That is not a huge number, given the size of the English population.<P>
It is especially strange that some of those responses were quoted in the White Paper, in which the Government seemed to imply that the organisations that replied to the consultation supported the concept of RDAs. Even the Rural Development Commission was quoted on more than one occasion, although it was so horrified by the proposals in the White Paper that its chairman resigned in protest.<P>
I am worried that much of the White Paper is in danger of being seriously misleading. For example, English Nature is quoted on page 40 of the White Paper as saying that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“RDAs provide an unparalleled opportunity to promote the principles of sustainable development at a strategic level”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
However, elsewhere in its response to the consultation paper—not quoted in the White Paper—English nature argues that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“we were disappointed to see the promotion of sustainable development figure so slightly in the consultation paper. If sustainable development is at the heart of all areas of Government thinking, then sustainability principles must underpin the work of any Government body, particularly one responsible for promoting economic development.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
that is a very different message from that quoted in the White Paper. That is significant. Even a careful reader of the White Paper might gain the impression that many organisations supported RDAs. whereas scrutiny of the whole text of the responses from organisations shows that support to be at least heavily qualified.<P>
The problem is that the full text is not available to the Committee. It is not in the Library of the House of Commons. It is available only to people who go to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to search through its library, as my staff spent some time doing earlier this year. Before the Committee proceeds to examine the Bill, can the Minister explain how he intends to make available the full text of those 1,500 responses? Will he place the text in the Library or circulate it to members of the Committee who request it?<P>
There is a convention in the House that an hon. Member—especially, a Minister—who refers to a document makes the full text available. My request is in keeping with the spirit of that convention, but I make it not only with that convention in mind, as all members of the Committee have a responsibility to their constituents.<P>
The Government have stressed that consultation gave rise to powerful support. The Minister said that the responses were “universally” supportive. He made that sweeping statement on Second Reading when he said that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“1,500 responses...universally supported the case for development agencies”.—[Official Report, 14 January 1998; Vol. 304, c. 373.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
However, I can quote some other responses. The Federation of Small Businesses, in a response not available to hon. Members unless they go to the Department, said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Without full public consultation, a White Paper directly elected assemblies and referendums, the FSB would not support RDAs being granted any statutory powers.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
We have no directly elected assemblies or referendums—at least, not yet—but the Bill will bestow statutory powers on regional development agencies. Does the Minister include the Federation of Small Businesses among the consultees who were universally supportive?<P>
Let me quote Friends of the Earth. Again this quotation was not included in the White Paper and is available only to those who leave the Palace of Westminster to do their own research.<P>
FoE said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“This may lead to the creation of quangos far greater than those that already exist, taking the country further down the path of administration without representation or accountability.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Does the Minister believe that that is universally supportive?<P>
The British Chambers of Commerce said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“business does not support the establishment of a regional tier of government, whether through elected assemblies or through Regional Chambers.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Institute of Directors said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Another layer risks more confusion, more bureaucracy and more costs.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Finally, if the Minister is not interested in those views, perhaps he will pay attention to the North Durham Labour party, which, in a response not, of course, quoted in the White Paper, said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We believe that the mechanisms of accountability proposed in the Consultation Document are palpably inadequate”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
If the Minister classifies those responses as universally supportive, heaven help us if there had been critical or hostile responses. Would the Minister like to reconsider his claim that the consultation gave rise to universally supportive responses?<P>
My point is becoming clear. The Committee cannot sensibly proceed without access to the full text of the responses. I hope that we will agree that the Minister must make the text available before our next sitting.<P>
I have many other concerns to explore during the debates on amendments and clauses. I hope that the Minister will be able to put to rest the grave anxieties that I have expressed this morning.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): I wish to raise another issue. The powers of the development agencies will be substantial; I hope that we can tease more precision out of the Minister during the debate. It is also apparent that the Government have embarked on other policy reviews that will have a substantial impact on the way in which the development agencies work. I want to be assured that this Committee will be able to take account of other policy initiatives, so that we do not find on Report that events have overtaken us.<P>
In that respect, I am especially concerned about planning. The Government have gone into damage limitation in a big way. The Deputy Prime Minister wrote eloquently on the matter in The Times this morning [Hon. Members: “Oh.”] At least, his press officer wrote eloquently in The Times this morning, and in The Daily Telegraph yesterday. There is much talk about the regionalisation of planning policy. Clearly, the development agencies will have planning responsibilities, and I want to know where the links lie between regional planning policy and the RDAs’ regional economic and regeneration competencies. The Government are supposed to be making a statement about the future of planning policy at some point.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> indicated dissent.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Deputy Prime Minister said that such a statement would be made. It would be ironic if we were to conclude our consideration of the Bill on the day before the Government announced a wholesale shake-up of its planning policies. Some of the Minister’s multifarious responsibilities are for planning, and it would be helpful if he were to tell us his intentions as regards planning policy. He should clarify how planning policy is related to the competencies of the development agencies. Will we have to revise our view of their competencies as the Government revise planning policy? Our timetable should be able to accommodate a consideration of those changes, so that we can comprehensively analyse the role of development agencies.<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I shall take the last point made by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) first. I am surprised that he has not been following the proceedings of the House. If my memory is correct, we submitted a major consultation document of 14 January, which gave an overview of how we envisage the modernisation of the European, national, regional and local planning systems. The first part of that document was a wide consultation on the introduction of a more strategic overview of planning, which clearly shows the relationship between the RDAs and the planning process.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> With due respect, I am aware that the planning documents are available. It is the decisions that eventually flow from them that are important. Consultation documents can be issued until the cows come home, but it is the conclusions eventually drawn by the Government, and how they affect the responsibilities of the development agencies, that matter.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I have no doubt that we will be able to answer those questions when we consider the appropriate clauses. I am just trying to guide the right hon. Gentleman as to how we are approaching questions of land use planning, the planned let system, and the democratic process within which such decisions are made. I have no doubt that the right hon. Gentleman is up to date on those matters, and that he will give us his pearls of wisdom when we debate the relevant amendments.<P>
With regard to the request from the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) for more up-to-date figures, the figures we have submitted—which cover a period up to July 1997—are from the Government statistical service, and are the most up-to-date figures available. If the hon. Gentleman has any more up-to-date figures, which conform with the agreed formula as to how Government figures are presented, we shall be pleased to accept them.<P>
As to the question of assemblies, the hon. Gentleman should be reminded that we won an election on 1 May 1997—it may have missed his attention, but the numbers of Labour and Conservative members of the Committee reflect that—and our manifesto, which was overwhelmingly endorsed by the British people, contained our policies with regard to RDAs and devolution. We therefore received overwhelming support from the British people, and we have subsequently consulted on aspects on those policies. The previous Administration had a different culture of consultation. They went out with preconceived ideas, they claimed that they had consulted and they included their ideas in the relevant Bill. That is a good reason why they are now in opposition.<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk rightly referred to English Nature and he raised the question of sustainability. Yes, we consulted. Clause 4 (1) (e) states that a regional development agency will<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom where it is relevant to its area to do so.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That shows that we take seriously the results of our consultations. When serious matters are raised we consider them, and if it is at all possible we include appropriate proposals in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman raised a pertinent point about English Nature. We included the results of our consultation in the Bill.<P>
As for access, I do not know how you interpret the word “research”. Your definition is very different from that of many other people because you seem to think that it means walking from the House of Commons down to Eland house and reading all of the papers relating to our consultations. We have adopted the previous Government’s practice—we deposited all of the papers in the relevant Departments, and we sent a list to the Library. Those papers are available for public scrutiny. You quoted about three results, but that did not involve arduous research—there were over 1,500 papers in all—and you were wrong to say that the views that you quoted were universal.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should be grateful if the Minister would address his remarks to the Chair. The word “you” refers to me.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Dr. Clark, I should not seek in any way to attribute such opinions to you. Please accept my humble apologies. If the hon. Member for South Suffolk wants access to the papers, they are available. The relevant conventions have been in place for some time.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister referred to the results of the general election, which was, of course, a great tragedy for the British people. Nevertheless, he appears to be having more difficulty coming to terms with the result than I do. He asked me whether I had more up-to-date statistics about the performance of the economies of the English regions. He has access in his Department to I do not know how many thousands of civil servants, many of whom are of great ability, yet he asks me for more up-to-date statistics. What an extraordinary situation. He does not understand that he is now responsible for such matters.<P>
The most important argument that supports the Bill is based on statistics that are so out of date—they are from 1993—that no business man who hoped to remain in business for more than a few weeks could possible rely on them. Is he really saying that with all the resources that are at his command he cannot provide more up-to-date figures? Judging by his comments, it appears that he has not even tried to do so since July last year. I must repeat my request to him. Will he give us the most up-to-date figures either at our next sitting on Thursday morning, or in writing. with all the technology that is available, why is the Bill’s central plank supported by economic data that are more than four years out of date?<P>
The Minister discussed sustainable development. I should be delighted to hear English Nature’s views on the severe qualification that accompanies the reference to sustainable development in clause 4. I have already tabled an amendment to remove that qualification. He implied that the Bill satisfactorily met English Nature’s response during the consultation process. I should be interested to hear its response to my amendment to remove the qualification relating to sustainable development. If he is as willing to listen to the views of English Nature in the consultation process as he claims, will he confirm that he is willing to listen to its views on amendment no. 20?<P>
Finally, my concern about the availability of the full text of the responses to the consultation process did not relate just to the difficulty that confronts any hon. Member who tries to obtain those full texts, although that itself is a serious matter, given the Government’s heavy reliance in their White Paper on quotations from that consultation process. My concern was about the misleading mature of those quotations, the highly selective basis on which they have been chosen and the fact that a study of the White Paper could give a completely false impression of the views of many of the organisations quoted by the Government.<P>
The Minister seemed to be criticising me for quoting only six responses. If I have your indulgence, Dr. Clark, I shall quote many more than six. I can occupy quite a little time establishing even more clearly than I already have that the Minister’s selection of quotations is a gross distortion of the consultation process, but I dare say that you would rather take that matter as read. Unless pressed to do so, I shall not go through the other quotations, although there are plenty more and we may need to return to them in the debates. However, I am concerned at the Minister’s refusal even to consider the need for more up-to-date statistics and at his dismissal of my other concerns in such a cavalier manner.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Gentleman’s words about the last general election show the arrogance of some Opposition Members towards the British people. That is not good for democracy and I think the hon. Gentleman should reflect carefully on what he said.<P>
I am assured by my civil servants, who the hon. Gentleman said are very professional people, that the statistics they have given me are up-to-date. If we have any further information, we shall give it to the Committee, because this is a Government of openness who are trying to make sure that all the facts are available, so that a decision can be made on the best available evidence.<P>
Again, it is unbecoming of the hon. Gentleman to say that the central plank and predication—of the regional development agency is one table in one White Paper. If he believes that to be the case, he sorely misjudges the Government’s approach to the devolution of economic and political power in our nation. But, again, one can understand his standpoint.<P>
The consultation papers are available to the public. If the public want access to them, they are at Eland house and the full list is in the Library. They are available not just to Members of Parliament but to the public as well, so we are as open as we can be in that consultation. It is unfortunate that the hon. Gentleman cannot accept that, in the consultation process, we took on board many of the ideas and thoughts of English Nature. If it wants to submit further ideas to develop the concept that we are putting forward, we shall always listen. That may be foreign to the Opposition, but we listen to people, consultation is genuine and we believe that we make sound decisions that are accepted by the majority of the British people. That is why we shall be here for much longer.<P>
Question put and agreed to.<P>
Resolved. That during the proceedings on the Regional Development Agencies Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o’clock and half-past Four o’clock.<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, and copies are available in this Room. I also wish to remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments which may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.<P>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 8, after ‘(1)’, insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘As a first step towards elected regional assemblies, where there is demand in the region for such assemblies.’<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Minister has referred to fresh faces on the Committee, and I and my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) are very fresh faces indeed who will no doubt require your constant wise guidance, Dr. Clark, as we make our maiden mistakes in Standing Committee.<P>
When the Minister refers to the Opposition during our debates, I hope that he will not bracket the Liberal Democrats with the other members of the Opposition. We take a fundamentally different attitude to theirs. As on so many other matters, we will play a role of constructive opposition.<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon (Mr. Harvey) said on Second Reading, we support the Bill and the creation of regional development agencies. The amendments that we have tabled are not wrecking amendments, but address our key concerns over accountability, democracy and openness. We do intend to bog the Committee down.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should point out that wrecking amendments are never selected.<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark, for my first lesson of the day. I come from a local government background where such things are heard of.<P>
The Liberal Democrats have, in common with Labour, opposed quangos for many years. We criticised the previous Government for setting up bodies of non-elected members in charge of spending a great deal of public money. The Minister and Labour Members will still oppose quangos and will not want to be seen to create quangos of their own.<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister said that the Bill was evolutionary and the beginning of a process that would lead to regional government. The Labour party is committed to regional government. We too support RDAs in principle but believe that they must work in partnership not only with local business but local government. They must derive democratic legitimacy not just from the Secretary of State but from the people of the regions. The amendment was tabled to make it clear in the Bill that the Government are committed to creating an elected regional assembly where there is a demand for one.<P>
Some regions have got their acts together quickly and may almost be ready to create assemblies. Others have been slower to work together across the region and will be encouraged by a clear expression of the Government’s intentions. The amendment would make sure that there was no misunderstanding of the Government’s approach to devolution of economic and political power.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I could not help reflecting that the hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) let the cat out of the bag by saying that she did not wish to be associated with Her Majesty’s Opposition. Indeed not. We have had the message more and more clearly over the past nine months that the Liberal Democrats exist to prop up the Government when any difficulty or embarrassment arises.<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I am sure that Dr. Clark would rule me out of order, but I could list several items on which we have voted against the Government while the Conservatives voted with them, such as single parent benefits. We have carried out a role of Opposition.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I hope that the hon. Lady will make sure that the reports of our Committee reach her party leader so that he can see that she is doing her bit in trying to get him into the Cabinet, which appears to be the main thrust of Liberal Democrat policy.<P>
Elected regional assemblies would be an enormous step further. The Government are contemplating it. The Minister has explained that RDAs are part of the process towards that. However, I do not want the Committee to gain any impression that the enactment of the Bill, and clause 1 in particular, will remove the need for the most minute scrutiny of and intense opposition to proposals for directly elected assemblies should they ever come forward.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Taunton for her helpful remarks, which are in stark contrast to those of the hon. Member for South Suffolk. I have no doubt that all sorts of divisions will arise with Conservative Members. The amendment is important and I want to make the Government’s position clear.<P>
We want to move quickly to implement our manifesto commitment on a regional agenda for England. The interests of the English regions have been neglected in recent years and we aim to reverse that.<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): Why do the Government believe that there is such a thing as a regional identity? In the north-west, people in Manchester are proud of being different from people in Liverpool. People in Lancashire feel different from people in Cheshire. My constituency is in Greater Manchester, but people protect their Cheshire identity with a vengeance. Where is this regional identity? If the Minister comes with me to Cheadle, he will not find it there.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman watches regional television. A few weeks ago, I took part in an hour-long programme and was cross-examined by 150 leading decision makers in the north-west. A commercial company and the local television company conducted a poll, under the control of MORI, and a phone-in, and found overwhelming support for regional development agencies and a move to devolution.<P>
One of the most interesting parts of my consultation was when I met local authority representatives in Manchester, including Liberals and Conservatives. I said to one Conservative that he must be overwhelmed by our support and that he was clearly out of line. “No, Mr. Caborn,” he said. “I am a new Conservative and that is the old Conservatives down at Westminster.”<P>
<B>Mr. Ben Chapman </B>(Wirral, South): The north-west, through the North-West Regional Association and the North-West Partnership, submitted a single document during consultation. The north-west above all other regions was unified in its approach. The north-west, indeed, has a regional identity. Perhaps Cheadle is an exception, perhaps Cheadle is a selective choice, but the rest of the region is unified.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> My hon. Friend has enormous experience in that part of the country. His words dismiss the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day).<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If there is such tremendous enthusiasm for the idea, why did the Deputy Prime Minister say that the Government would not implement the proposal during the lifetime of this Parliament? If there is such enthusiasm for it, should he not consider introducing it during the lifetime of this Parliament?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> If the hon. Gentleman listens to my response to the amendment, my view on that important matter will become clear.<P>
The Deputy Prime Minister made an important pronouncement. Our first step is to establish regional development agencies, which will provide effective co-ordination of economic development and social regeneration.<P>
I have much sympathy with the sentiment that lies behind amendment. The RDAs are, the first step in the evolutionary process that will give the English regions the freedom to choose further decentralisation, but the amendment would add nothing to the clause. I propose to start as I mean to go on—I shall amend the Bill only when doing so would improve it. I urge the hon. Member for Taunton to withdraw the amendment.<P>
We have made a commitment about regional centres, and the Deputy Prime Minister made it perfectly clear that we shall take appropriate action after the next general election. More important, we said that all changes must be accompanied by the will of the people. We have embarked on our programme of devolution—we have taken action in Scotland, where the Scottish people wanted devolution, and in Wales, where the Welsh people wanted devolution. There will be further developments in the first week of May, when the people of London will be consulted. I know that some Opposition Members do not agree, and earlier we heard some arrogant comments about the democratic process. We shall give the people of Scotland, Wales and the city of London the right to decide whether to accept further devolution. The choice, and the final say, will be given to the people of the region.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister referred to the elections that will take place in London on 7 May—<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The referendum—get it right.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Yes, the referendum—I am sorry. The Minister also stressed the Government’s willingness to accept the views of the people. Will he therefore explain why the people of London are being denied the choice to answer a separate question about the directly elected London assembly? If he really believes that it is important to abide by the will of the people, will he explain why the people of London are being denied the opportunity to express their views?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The answer is no. The matter has been debated fully in the House, and we shall return to it when the Greater London Authority (Referendum) Bill returns from the House of Lords. The hon. Gentleman’s argument is germane not to our debate in Committee but to our debate on the London Bill. The Opposition will have ample opportunities to amend that Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): We do not accept that the amendment would add nothing to the Bill. In fact, it would clarify the Government’s intention about proceeding “where there is demand”. It also demonstrates our desire to ensure that there is a real demand for reform. We agree with the Minister that where there is demand in regions there should be more decentralised regional government. The first step should not be a 2in step—it should be a stride in the right direction.<P>
The amendment firms up our intention to support such developments and to be open with the people. It would also ensure that the process is democratic because elected assemblies would be set up only if there was a demand for them. As my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton said, there must be more openness. The system should be held fully accountable by ensuring that the demand for decentralisation exists and that regional assemblies are elected.<P>
The amendment is therefore an important addition to the Bill. It demonstrates the Government’s intention to move—we hope at a faster speed—towards the decentralisation of regional government, which we believe is fundamental to the way in which the regional development agencies operate. We hope that there will be an opportunity to revisit the amendment, as we do not accept that it adds nothing. We shall not press this fundamental point further, but reserve the opportunity to come back to it at a later stage.<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I experience a warm feeling of nostalgia when I listen to the Minister reading his notes—they have such a familiar ring to them. No doubt we shall hear the same phraseology over and over again about the amendment not being necessary because it does not add to the Bill and is subsumed in the Bill, but it gives one this marvellously warm feeling of recollection. No doubt the Minister will grow more used to it as time goes on.<P>
I do not understand why the Celts and London seem to rank so much higher in the Minister’s priority than the English regions. After all, he represents an important regional city—he represents the same region as I do—and he would argue that there is a very strong demand for the amendment. He said so with regard to the north-west, and his colleagues would argue that in the north-east there is also a strong demand for a democratic regional identity. The Scots get it when they want it and the Welsh get it when they want it, and Londoners apparently will get it, though I do not understand why anybody should want to be the mayor of London rather than being chairman of the regional development agency for London, which would be much more important, or even more so, of the Food Standards Agency. For someone who really wants power, the chairman of the Foods Standards Agency will offer far more than any of the jobs that we are discussing. <P>
<P>
Why does the Minister want to go back to Yorkshire and tell the people there—if local authority leaders in Yorkshire love the idea, although I am not sure how many others do—that they are second-class citizens? the Scots get devolution in this Parliament. The Government fell over themselves to secure devolution in Scotland and Wales, and London will have its refererendum on the mayor, but the English regions are the third division north.<P>
Why does the Minister not answer the question? If it is so important, if it is such a large part of the constitutional agenda, which I accept is one of the Government’s major items, why are the English regions the tail-end Charlies? The Celts get devolution, but those in Yorkshire, Lancashire or the south-west must await the possibility of devolution in a future Labour Government, when no doubt the issue will have gone even further on to the back burner. How does the Minister explain to his constituents that they are second-class citizens in the Government’s ordering of priorities?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I share the nostalgia on reading the notes, so I have not put the notes down and I shall now answer the right hon. Gentleman’s question. He clearly does not understand what we are discussing. It is called regional development agencies. That is what the Bill is about.<P>
I remind the right hon. Gentleman that in 1975 two Bills went through the House. One was called the Scottish Development Agency Bill and the other was the Welsh Development Agency Bill, and both have stood the test of time. Both Scotland and Wales had development agencies. There has been an interlude of 18 or 19 years when we had a Conservative Government. They did not scrap the SDA or the WDA; they kept those important institutions for those two countries. The Bill aims to deal with the economic deficit that we believe exists in the English regions. That is what it addresses, just as the Scottish Development Agency Bill and the Welsh Development Agency Bill addressed those countries’ issues in 1975. I have no doubt that if the British people had elected a Labour Government, these development agencies would have been up and running much sooner.<P>
I also remind the right hon. Gentleman that the Government that he supported started moving towards consolidation in the regions by establishing Government regional offices. That was a very progressive step to take, for which I think that the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) was responsible. We are therefore building on much of what the Conservatives did, who could not go quite so far as to say that they would give powers to the regions.<P>
The Bill is focused on tackling the economic deficit in the English regions by creating similar institutions to those that Scotland and Wales have enjoyed for more than 20 years, and which have been accepted by all Administrations.<P>
I understand what the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall says, but we gave a commitment to the British people in the manifesto that we would move stage by stage on the path of devolution for Scotland, Wales and London. We said in that manifesto that we would introduce regional development agencies, that we would establish voluntary chambers and that we would move, in the fullness of time and with the consent of the people in the regions, to fully directly elected regional assemblies if they so desired. That is what we have committed ourselves to in the manifesto, and that is what we will do.<P>
Although I appreciate the eagerness of the south-west to move towards a regional assembly, we must take the people with us. The regional chambers that are now being established in all English regions will be a step in that direction. It is not a dash: we are doing it in an evolutionary way. We will take the people with us. We believe that they must have confidence in the institutions, just as the Scottish and Welsh people have had great confidence in the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, which the Labour Government introduced in 1975. I have no doubt that with a steady hand, we will achieve the same results. It will be far better if we take it at an evolutionary pace, rather than in a made dash.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am grateful for the Minister’s response. The amendment supports his position. It says “as a first step”; it recognises that it is a first step. It imposes no timetable constraints. It does not suggest that anything must be done within a certain time scale. It is merely what the Minister has been describing—a first step towards elected regional assemblies in the fullness of time, in due course, where there is demand. Clearly, if there is not demonstrable demand, it will not happen. Therefore, there will necessarily be different timetables in different places.<P>
The words of the amendment are carefully chosen; they are not intended to place pressure on the Government to introduce regional assemblies within a tight timetable. They are intended merely to highlight the fact that the regional development agencies are indeed, as it says, a first step towards elected regional assemblies.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> In his first contribution to the debate on the amendment, the Minister suggested that no elected regional assemblies would be established during the lifetime of this Parliament. I am grateful for that confirmation, which Opposition Members welcome as a step in the right direction. Unlike remarks made by his right hon. and hon. Friends on the subject in the past, it clearly signals a cooling-off of the Government’s enthusiasm for directly elected regional assemblies, which does not surprise me.<P>
The Minister went on to emphasises that the people in the individual regions would decide whether they wanted an assembly. Could we therefore have a situation in which some parts of the country had a directly elected regional assembly, and other parts did not? If the people in some regions vote no, will they be released from the burden? If so, what will be the role of existing local authorities? How will the position of a county council in the eastern region, where there may be no directly elected regional assembly, compare with that of a county council in the south-west, where there may be a directly elected regional assembly?<P>
Are not the Government in a muddle about the matter? Would not the whole structure of local government in this country be thrown into total confusion if a complete hotch-potch of responsibilities were created? Bodies that previously exercised exactly the same statutory functions would suddenly find that those functions had to be completely revised because the people had voted for or against a directly elected regional assembly in one part of the country. Would not the House be overwhelmed by the need to make changes to legislation in order to make sense of the muddle that the Government had created?<P>
In view of the Minister’s cavalier approach to interpreting the responses to consultations that are submitted in writing—he claimed that the results that I quoted earlier were universally supportive—I am glad that the people will at least be allowed a vote. When a referendum is conducted in the regions, will it include a question that deals solely and exclusively with the establishment of a directly elected regional assembly? In other words, will the disgraceful precedent that will apply in London—the people of London will be denied the opportunity to vote yes or no to a directly elected regional assembly—be followed in the regions?<P>
What majority will be needed for the people to have spoken decisively? Would the wafer-thin support that was expressed for the Welsh Assembly—which appears to have been achieved with the use of electoral practices that have caused controversy in the media—be sufficient? Would it constitute decisive support for a directly elected regional assembly? Is a minimum turnout required? In some regions, it does not seem likely that the question on everyone’s lips in the Dog and Duck will be, “Can we have a directly elected regional assembly?” I have been the Member of Parliament for South Suffolk for 15 years, and in that time I have not met one person who believes that his problems would in any way be solved by the creation of a directly elected regional assembly for the eastern region.<P>

<P>

<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> During the 15 years that the hon. Gentleman has been a Member of Parliament, has he met anyone who wanted central Government to give away some of their substantial powers? His constituents may not have asked for directly elected regional assemblies because they did not know what they wanted. However, if they are anything like my constituents, they certainly will have asked for central Government to stop centralising powers and to start sharing some of them around.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My constituents were absolutely delighted in 1993 when the previous Government gave huge new powers and substantial new budgets to the county councils. Social services departments were responsible for implementing the new arrangements for looking after elderly people in the community and for placing them in residential accommodation. That devolution of power from the centre to the county councils was widely supported.<P>
The hon. member for Taunton raises an important consideration, to which we must return. The Bill is full of measures that will increase the Secretary of State’s powers rather than decentralise them, as the Minister and other Labour Members claimed. Almost every clause leaves various matters to the discretion of the Secretary of State. The clause that we are considering is one of the few in which such a provision does not appear. [Laughter.] Labour Members may laugh, but I hope that when we consider clauses in which extra powers will be given to the Secretary of State—clause 2 is one such clause—they will take account of the point that was made by the hon. Member for Taunton. She was right: some of my constituents suggest that it would be helpful if powers were devolved from the centre, although none of my constituents has ever requested a directly elected regional assembly as a solution to his difficulties. I look forward to the Minister’s response to my questions about directly elected regional assemblies.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The answer to that is no. Quite simply, the matter will be dealt with in a separate Bill, as was the case with Scottish devolution, Welsh devolution and the creation of the London assembly. We do not make such decisions in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggested. We won an election on a manifesto in which our broad principles were set out. That manifesto was endorsed by the British people, and will introduce the respective Bills. To lecture us about democracy when one is a member of the party that took power away from Londoners without consulting the GLC, and introduced the poll tax without consultation or even an election manifesto commitment, shows some cheek. We will treat such remarks with the contempt that they deserve.<P>
As to the comments made by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, the legislation will set up chambers in addition to the RDAs. The hon. Gentleman knows that I have visited the south-west on a number of occasions, and have spoken to colleagues of his in the Liberal Democrat party who have been fairly enthusiastic about our policies. They clearly understand that setting up the regional chamber is the first move in addressing the democratic deficit, just as the setting up of the RDAs tackles the economic deficit. I hope that the hon. Member for South East Cornwall will support the setting up of a chamber, as his support for such an institution—regardless of its initial voluntary status—will give it credibility among the people of the south-west. That will enable it to become a directly elected regional assembly at the appropriate time, according to the will of the people.<P>
When moving towards constitutional changes, it is sound principle to test such changes against the will of the people. It is not arrogance—we have seen arrogance, and the consequences of arrogance, in the Committee today—but an attempt to take people with us, step by step. That is why the Bill is clearly drafted. In accordance with our election manifesto commitment, we will move towards devolution to tackle the democratic deficit.<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I assume, Mrs. Ballard, that you wish to withdraw the amendment. Please do so formally.<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I apologies, Dr. Clark. It shows my ignorance of procedure that I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall had already done so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No.7, in page  1, line 8, leave out from ‘Act,’ to ‘there’ in line 9.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 8, in<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>page 1, line 10, after ‘agency’, insert ‘for each of the regions mentioned in Schedule 1’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
No.10, in schedule 1, page 22, leave out lines 12 to 17.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> In considering the amendment, I am severely handicapped by the Minister’s earlier inability, or refusal, to supply the up-to-date information that I requested about the economic performance of the regions. It is deplorable that the Committee must rely on data that are more than four years old. If this factor is as insignificant as the Minister claimed when he answered my point, why did he choose to include it in the fourth paragraph of his speech on Second Reading? At that time, he clearly considered it the first argument to be advanced in support of the Bill.<P>
The White Paper shows that in 1993, the eastern region enjoyed a per capita GDP that was 94 per cent. of the EU average. I am confident that that figure would be substantially higher today. I suspect that when new figures for the eastern region become available—which may not be until after the next general election at the current rate of progress in the Government’s alleged commitment to open government—they will show that the eastern region has achieved a per capita GDP above the EU average. We can be certain that if up-to-date figures were available, they would show that the figure for the eastern region was considerably better than the 94 per cent. shown in the White Paper.<P>
I suspect that the reason for the Government’s reluctance to make vigorous efforts to obtain more recent statistics is that they are fully aware that doing so would undermine their case for the establishment of regional development agencies across the English regions, and I regret that. It sits ill with the claim that they are committed to more openness and accountability. If more data were available, it would strengthen the case for the amendment, but even in the absence of that data, the case for excluding the eastern region from the Bill is very powerful.<P>
First, the boundaries of the proposed eastern region are a nonsense—as they are for some other regions but we shall deal with the others in due course. What does the non-metropolitan district of Thurrock have in common with remote rural parishes in northern Norfolk? I hope that the minister will explain, because I believe that they have nothing in common. Are the needs of the outer-London fringe, which constitutes a significant part of south-west Essex, comparable in any way with the needs of villages in the rural parts of my constituency of South Suffolk? Again the answer, quite clearly, is no. <P>
The boundaries of the eastern region like the others in schedule 1 to the Bill, have been drawn entirely to suit the convenience of bureaucrats. they are administrative boundaries. They do not even pretend to be designed to suit the needs of those whom the Bill is supposed to serve. Parts of Essex quite logically and understandably believe that they have more joint interests with parts of northern Kent than with much of the eastern region. Therefore, this region as defined in the Bill is geographically and culturally nonsense. It is not an entity, it does not feel any sense of common purpose and its boundaries have been drawn solely with administrative convenience in mind.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in English terms sense of identity is purely down to county or city?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My hon. Friend is right. In the county of Suffolk people are proud of the fact that they live in Suffolk or that they were born in Suffolk. They would take great offence if, close to the boundaries, people made the mistake of suggesting that they were Essex people, Norfolk people or Cambridgeshire people. These are traditions in which people have great pride. As my hon. Friend says, the same is true of cities. The people of Bury St. Edmunds and Ipswich are proud of their connections with those towns and cities, and they are right to be proud. As my hon. Friend implies, it is artificial to try to impose a new identity on the people of the eastern region, when it covers places as geographically and culturally diverse as those to which I have referred.<P>
My second concern is that the eastern region does not need a regional development agency to attract more investment. The rural areas, such as my constituency of South Suffolk, have shown impressive flexibility in adapting to the fact that huge numbers of people are no longer required on the land in today’s agriculture. During this period of transformation there has been no whingeing from the East Anglia labour force. There have been no requests for huge Government hand-outs to bail them out. Quietly, efficiently the people of East Anglia have got on with the job of retraining and finding new employment.<P>
Unemployment in the eastern region is often below the national average. That reflects well on the work force, it reflects well on the management of the companies in the region and, above all, it reflects well on the ability of the towns, cities and counties of the region to attract new investment and new businesses.<P>
I do not believe, and the majority of those with whom I have discussed the matter do not believe, that the creation of a regional development agency in the eastern region will bring a single pound of new investment to the region.<P>
Thirdly, there is no demand from people in the region for such an agency. I mentioned in the debate on the previous amendment that in all my time as a Member of Parliament representing South Suffolk, I could not recall a single person arguing that the region’s economy would benefit from the creation of a regional development agency. Interestingly, and perhaps most tellingly, even in the past nine months,  when the policy has been slightly more visible than hitherto, and when the possibility of a development agency in the eastern region has been mooted, I cannot recall a single person saying that such an agency is needed, or if established would be helpful. That does not surprise me: the local economy is performing well. Throughout almost every part of the eastern region as defined in the schedule, the economy is in good shape. In the light of that, why should that region have a regional development agency rammed down its throat?<P>
A fourth concern about the creation of a regional development agency for the eastern region is that the local authorities in the eastern region already co-operate effectively on those matters in which co-operation is helpful. What used to be called the standing committee of the East Anglian local authority operates perfectly satisfactorily, and has done for a number of years. The co-ordination of transport and planning policies, where appropriate, has been achieved through a commonsense approach, sometimes involving bilateral relationships, sometimes involving wider discussions when those are appropriate or helpful. On that ground, we see no need for a regional development agency.<P>
Fifthly, I urge the Government to exclude the eastern region from the Bill’s provisions because it is primarily a rural region. Most of its areas are very rural. Of course, we have some thriving towns and cities, which are important. I have mentioned Ipswich and Bury St. Edmunds. There is also Cambridge, Norwich, Colchester and many others. However, the character of the region is essentially rural.<P>
I am sure that other hon. Members will want to return later to anxieties that regional development agencies will not serve rural interests, but they are also relevant to this amendment. I do not see what the regional development agency will offer to a small business established in a village in my constituency of South Suffolk. How will the regional development agency help East Anglia?<P>
I am worried that, once established, the agency will remove some of the planning powers exercised by local authorities, a matter to which the Committee will return later. In East Anglia, the planning powers of the district councils and the county councils are for the most part satisfactorily exercised by those directly elected to them. It is a matter of considerable anxiety that powers can be taken away under the provisions of the Bill and given to unelected and largely unaccountable bodies.<P>
The amendment would not destroy the Bill. The Government need not be embarrassed to recognise the strength of the arguments that I have presented. Indeed, it might be suggested that the amendment would improve the Bill. It would show, above all, that the Government understood that the establishment of regional development agencies must be justified. RDAs cannot be imposed regardless of local needs and of the wishes of the people who must live under them.<P>
The amendment is an opportunity for the Government to show their flexibility. If the Under-Secretary is not minded to accept it, I hope that she will be able to set out the way in which the regional development agencies will benefit English regions, not just in general terms but in the specific circumstances of the eastern region.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I wish to raise a related but different point. All the regions are heterogenous; they all cover enormous territories. The region with which the Minister and I are most familiar runs from the mouth of the Humber in East Yorkshire into the Pennines and right up to the Ribblehead viaduct, which is virtually in Cumbria. Therefore, the heterogeneity of East Anglia is no different from the heterogeneity of any other region.<P>
If we are to have RDAs, what is the best way of defining them so that they can do their work most effectively? The Government have chosen the most convenient, ready-to-hand, off-the-shelf way, which is the definition of the regions as covered by the government offices for the region and I can see convenience in that. However, I wish to draw attention to a particular circumstance in east London and the Thames gateway.<P>
Thurrock is now a unitary authority. Indeed, I was responsible for making it so. At the time, Thurrock was seriously tempted to try to become a London borough. It saw itself as linked to London rather than to Essex. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk said, the links across the Thames are in many ways more persuasive than the links that either side has with its rural hinterland. Therefore, when we put together the concept of the Thames gateway, it consisted of the eastern part of London, the northern bank of the Thames out to Thurrock—with close co-operation in the boroughs beyond it—and the south Thames area down to Chatham, Maidstone and the coast down to the estuary.<P>
We went to great pains to put together a voluntary organisation, because there was no statutory framework for it, in which local authorities would work together with a strategic concept of planning—I know that “strategic” is one of the Government’s favourite words—to attract investment into a region which had been on the wrong side of London. It is on the east and most great cities have expanded west, because that is where the prevailing wind comes from. People dumped all the muck on the forequarters to the east and, if they were relatively well off, settled in the west. That has happened to east London; it has the great legacy of old chemicals, munitions and a lot of mucky industry. The job losses caused by the decline of chemicals and munitions have been the equivalent of that caused by a pit closing every year.<P>
We wanted to put together a means of revitalising the east of London. We started by trying to give it an identify, by trying to create a structure in which people could work together voluntarily, and it took off. There were some difficult decisions. The decision on Stratford station on the channel tunnel rail link was taken deliberately, because we wanted to make sure that the area got some of the benefit and not just the blight from the line, and I hope that that will eventually take shape. Equally, the intermediate stops on the rail link were seen clearly in that context. The development of Greenwich university was seen as the educational instrument of the regeneration of that area.<P>
Under the Bill, three development agencies will be responsible for the Thames gateway. There will be the greater London area, the eastern region—the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk is relevant, because it includes Thurrock—and, about the most difficult region of the lot, the south-east, which will run from Oxford right down through Kent to the Kent coast and over to Southampton. That is a very heterogenous region which will take in all of Kent.<P>
How will the particular needs of the greater London area be accommodated in a divided structure? I suggest that the logical way forward from the Thames Gateway concept, especially as the London Development Corporation has effectively ceased to exist, would be to consider an estuarial development agency, to revitalise one of the most difficult and deprived areas of the United Kingdom. I do not expect the Under-Secretary to agree to that immediately, but I hope that she will reflect that, without disturbing the balance of the Bill, she can provide for areas with particular needs to receive a more hands-on, focused treatment because there is a precedent of people working together there. She might reflect on that with regard to the Thames gateway, and consider whether special arrangements should be in place to ensure that achievements resulting from the enormous good will of local authorities and businesses across the political divide are not dissipated or cut three ways by new development agencies. Will she consider what structures might preserve such important achievements?<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Angela Eagle):</B> I should like to express my delight, Dr. Clark, at being in my first Committee under your chairmanship as a member of the Government. I must confess to a tiny feeling of nostalgia when the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon made his first intervention about familiar phrases, but I am much happier to be in government than to recall with nostalgia the many hours that I spent in opposition. I hope that the hon. Gentleman enjoys similar experiences to those that I enjoyed when I was in opposition. I am very glad to see him here. He brings wide experience, which is derived from his time in government, of the issues that concern us. We may chide him for that occasionally, but I hope that we show some respect for his experience.<P>
Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 would remove from the Bill the reference to England being divided into regions for the purposes of the Bill, which would create the difficulty of leaving us with no regions with which to form the regional development agencies. I suspect, by the way, that that was the idea behind the amendments. Amendment No. 10 would remove the provision for the eastern region to have a regional development agency, and the hon. Member for South Suffolk has addressed most of his remarks to that point. I intend to respond to the amendments separately as, although they are rightly in the same debate, they raise slightly different issues.<P>
I detected some differences—I would not want to make a habit of this, as it may embarrass the hon. Members concerned—between the reactions of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon to the boundaries defined in the Bill and those of the hon. Member for South Suffolk. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon referred, with a certain degree of accuracy I suppose, to the off-the-shelf, convenience aspects of the boundaries, whereas the hon. Member for South Suffolk dismissed them as nonsense. That nonsense derives from the time when the previous Government set up the GOR boundaries and, presumably, came to some kind of pragmatic view as to where those boundaries should lie. As the GOR boundaries have been up and running for a number of years—with some success, we believe—we decided to stick with those boundaries for the regional development agencies. If they are nonsense, the responsibility for that lies with the hon. Gentleman’s party when it was in office.<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk said that he would make a powerful case for not having a regional development agency in the eastern region, which includes his own constituency. He went on to express his opinions on that matter. His so-called powerful case did not, however, take into account the opinions of those in the eastern region who replied to the consultation on regional development agencies. The eastern region’s response was that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The most significant result of the consultation . . . has been the overwhelming support for the principle of an RDA for the Region.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
There were 223 responses from organisations and institutions in that region, and the consultation exercise was organised by the government office. The proposal was supported by 99 per cent. of the responses that were received. The consultation accepted<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“that there is a role for an RDA to play in co-ordinating regional economic development in the Eastern Region.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Despite the widely held view that the eastern region does not have as obvious a regional identity as for example, the north-east, all of the economic players in that region—local authorities, TECs and the people who responded to the consultation—overwhelmingly supported the principle of a regional development agency. I do not know their view of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South Suffolk, which would remove their ability to develop in that way.<P>
The consultation also found <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“that there is strong support for an RDA with an extensive list of functions and responsibilities . . . The consultation exercise has led to high expectations... the consultation exercise has brought partners in the Region together and encouraged them to work to reach a consensus on a major regional issue. Partners in the region have responded very positively to the opportunity presented by the RDA consultation”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Bill has created a momentum, even in regions that did not especially regard themselves as having a regional identity. Judging by the various regions that I visited in the past few months, my hon. Friend the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning, have seen at regional level the galvanising of economic institutions, even in regions that do not have an especially strong sense of regional identity. That interesting momentum was created by the election of the Labour Government. The hon. Member for South Suffolk may not have grasped the fact that such a momentum exists in the regions, but he may do so as our debate progresses.<P>
The comments of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon about the Thames gateway initiative require a response. That initiative has so far been looked after by three government offices—and it would have been looked after by three RDAs if they had been established—but it has suffered no discernible harm to date. The RDA boundaries are not intended to be so absolute that no co-operation can take place across them. The Bill will create a momentum for change and for economic development and it will increase economic efficiency at regional level through the creation of new institutions. The idea that the Thames gateway initiative will be damaged if it is divided by RDA boundaries is not accurate. The system should be flexible and RDAs should be able to co-operate at sub-regional level within the regions and, sometimes, across them. The right hon. Gentleman accurately described some of those links when he referred to the creation of the Thames gateway and its potential for regeneration and development. The Bill will in no way prejudice those links. The RDAs do not involve a contradiction and will not cause any difficulties.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary is right, but she will know that the new arrangement will be different. At the moment, the government offices are very powerful, and much of the initiative has come from Governments. For example, regeneration awards are determined by Ministers on the advice of the government offices. They will be handled by the development agencies. The idea is that regeneration will be handled by the agencies.<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
There will also be new divisions of function; the Government will retain some of the functions that they have now. The DTI, for example, will retain responsibility for regional development grants, but other regeneration programmes will go to the agencies. At present there is a strong concentration of responsibility in the hands of the government offices. If they co-operated, one could say that they were delivering. However, the responsibility will be more diffuse under the new geography. Some powers will be retained by the Government; others will be devolved to development agencies. In that sense there will be fragmentation. I am anxious to ensure that in the Thames gateway area all the agencies, in the more complex task, can deliver a strategic concept.<P>
I persuaded the government offices that, when they were bidding for regeneration funds, for example, they should make sure that they got their act together and that it was part of a broader strategic concept that they were not simply putting in their own bits and pieces. We must ensure that under the new arrangements, where the DTI will still have major fund-giving powers but where more powers will be devolved to the agencies, areas will still have the ability to deliver strategically, particularly where they are at the tail-end of a development area, like Thurrock is.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that he is making an intervention, not a speech. Has he finished?<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. Yes, I have indeed finished. The Under-Secretary was being so courteous in wishing to explore fully my point of view that I got carried away.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am so sorry that my courtesy did not match the Under-Secretary’s.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman’s enthusiasm bubbles over and combines with his experience of government to tempt him down paths, that cause you to have to remind him that he is making not a speech but an intervention.<P>
The Government believe in devolution, and part of the principle behind the Bill is to devolve power. While the right hon. Gentleman may believe that a more strategic delivery is possible with a centralised function, we do not agree with that. If we did, we would not be devolving power to regional level in the Bill and in other parts of our programme.<P>
The Government believe that more efficient decisions can be taken at regional level where those involved in making them have an intimate knowledge of what the region requires and can translate that, in co-operation with other regional institutions, more effectively than perhaps a Whitehall Department can. Perhaps there is a difference of opinion there between us.<P>
The right hon. Gentleman describes what we are suggesting in the Thames gateway area as fragmentation, but in other parts of the Bill there is not fragmentation but consolidation. For example, the Rural Development Commission’s regeneration powers and English Partnership’s regional powers represent consolidation at regional level rather than a fragmentation. These developments can only strengthen the chances of initiatives like the Thames gateway working, and we want to encourage sub-regional planning as well as planning at regional level. Therefore, we do not believe that the Bill will compromise the chances of success of Thames gateway or similar initiatives that RDAs may wish to take across other boundaries.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> English Partnerships is a case in point. At the moment it is a unified, nationwide body which decides whether to support land reclamation and development schemes. The bulk of the powers will then go to the agencies. Whereas one agency can now deal with the gateway as such, there will be three agencies, because English Partnerships will retain powers in that part of the world only for the famous millennium dome, which is no doubt being prepared for the second coming.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman has more information than I do about plans for the millennium dome. English Partnerships has a regional aspect to it: it is that aspect that will be incorporated into the regional development agencies, not the national part—as he will be aware. I am sure that he has read the White Paper in great detail.<P>
The right hon. Gentleman and I have a difference of opinion, perhaps. As I explained, the Government do not believe that the new arrangements will make it harder for areas such as the Thames gateway that have a strategic but cross-RDA boundary potential to develop in the way that they need. However, they do mean that meetings, planning and initiatives will all have to take place at a different level—the regional level—because we believe that we should devolve power to the regions.<P>
The right hon. Gentleman probably knows more than most about the time and effort in which making changes to boundaries can involve Governments, having overseen the previous major reorganisation. The Government decided at the beginning of the process that we could either move forward with regional devolution or have endless arguments about boundaries. <P>
We decided that the boundaries of the government offices, which are based on local authoritiy boundaries and reflect historic identities, are as good as any others for setting out on the road that the Bill proposes. They are well established for economic purposes. We believe that it makes sense to base regional development agencies on them, but we do not exclude intra-RDA sub-regions or sub-regions that go across different RDAs. At the moment, that is the most workable option, given the wide range of functions and responsibilities with which we are providing RDAs.<P>
Across Europe, the average size of regions is about 5 million people. That seems to be about the right critical mass to achieve proper strategic overview for regional purposes, to attract investment successfully and to promote healthy competition.<P>
A region needs to be big enough to be effective and to allow the right economies of scale so that the benefits that we are looking for in establishing RDAs will be forthcoming. Each of England’s regions should be able to reap the benefit of having an RDA. The eastern region is no exception.<P>
I acknowledge that, traditionally, the eastern region has not had a strong regional identity; it is perhaps not as cohesive as other regions. However, it is coming together quite quickly, and seems enthusiastic to proceed and to make a success of the initiative. Therefore it would not be right to deny the eastern region the opportunity that an RDA will offer the region to increase its competitive position. <P>
The Bill is intended not only to compensate for failure or lost opportunities but to shore up success. It is not adequate to argue that a region is pretty affluent so it does not need an RDA. It needs to ensure that it can do even better.<P>
I am surprised that Opposition Members, especially the hon. Member for South Suffolk, are so complacent about the potential for economic development. They believe that absolutely nothing can be done to improve chances and to do even better in the future. We are trying to shore up success as well as plug gaps and eliminate failures.<P>
We do not want to be diverted from the agenda of establishing regional development agencies and giving the English regions the chance to forge ahead with economic development and to improve their competitiveness. Therefore I do not want to accede to any review of RDA boundaries at this stage. It can only serve to fuel disagreement and rivalries within regions. Our objective is to get people to work together, to build bridges and to make our regions and our country more competitive. I therefore ask the hon. Member for South Suffolk not to press the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Under-Secretary does not seem to understand the difference between the role of the government offices and that of regional development agencies. They are two very different things indeed. If she takes the trouble to read the Bill, she may find that the Government’s proposals for RDAs include a range of powers and characteristics quite different from those established for government offices during the past few years. It simply is not good enough to say that the GDR boundaries are bureaucratically or administratively convenient. We cannot say that the boundaries of regional development agencies must coincide precisely with those of the GDRs.<P>
I have already demonstrated the danger of relying on quotations selectively chosen by Ministers from the consultation responses. In little more than an hour and a half, we have moved from claims that the responses were universally supportive of the Government to a claim that, at least in the eastern region, only 99 per cent. of responses were supportive. That is progress of a sort; and admission of a kind. I strongly suspect that it reveals that a more objective, thorough and independent analysis of the consultation responses might give us a very different picture from that frequently painted by Ministers<P>
The signs that the Under-Secretary claims to detect of an emerging regional identity are not evident in East Anglia. Residents of Lavenham in Suffolk are not walking up the high street saying, “Gosh, suddenly we feel something in common with Luton.” That is a figment of her imagination. Frankly, it insults the people of what I prefer to call the East Anglian region rather than the eastern region, although I appreciate that the latter may cover some areas not traditionally thought of as being in East Anglia.<P>
The Under-Secretary claims that consolidation of the functions of certain agencies, including the Rural Development Commission, is a benefit. Has she considered what the commission thinks of that so-called consolidation? It looks more like dismemberment from the commission’s standpoint. The Government were unable to wring a penny from any Department to support their ambition to establish RDAs and have had to plunder more than half the RDC’s budget. Morale at the RDC may well be at a low ebb. It is astonishing that the Minister has the gall to cite consolidation—as she calls it—of the functions of the RDC as an argument in favour of creating a regional development agency in the eastern region. She has again revealed her appalling ignorance of issues that really matter in the countryside.<P>
Another interesting insight into the Government’s thinking is their argument that the fact that the average European Union region has a certain population is a reason for imposing uniformity on the English regions.<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a concept of critical mass and a strategic size at which things work better? Or does he think that that is a figment of various economist’s imaginations?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The character and structure of the agencies that the Government want to establish depend on consent—indeed, enthusiasm—in the regions to which they will apply. The agencies depend on those regions having a coherent identity. Those tests have been failed.<P>
I was interested by the Minister’s reference to the average size of European Union regions as a justification for covering the whole of England with regions. We know that we will in due course have directly elected regional assemblies. Are they and the RDAs part of a long-term agenda not only to break up the United Kingdom—as the Government are doing by establishing a Scottish Parliament and Welsh assembly—but to divide England into regions that are just parts of the European Union?<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Somehow we have strayed into Euro-paranoia again.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Lady started it.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am not Euro-paranoid. The Bill does not bear directly on our relations with the European Union, and I will not be tempted to speak as if it is. If I did, Dr. Clark, you would pick me up immediately.<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk should think about economies of scale and coherence, and about regional economic effectiveness and efficiency, instead of thinking about Euro-paranoia. Economies of scale have an important part to play in delivering greater competitiveness; that is what lies behind our intention to develop regions of the size that the Bill defines. The hon. Gentleman’s amendments would disrupt that, which is just one of the reasons why we oppose them.<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 22, line 19, after ‘of’, insert ‘Cumbria,’.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment:<P>
No. 12, in page 22, line 29, leave out ‘Cumbria’.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> This is a probing amendment. On Second Reading, the right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Foster) referred to the inclusion of Cumbria in what he called the northern region. He said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“For the entire 25 years that I have been involved in regional politics, Cumbria has been included in the northern region. I know that this is a sensitive issue—I shall not dwell on it—but we believe that Cumbria should remain in the northern region. We know that it will not happen immediately, but we shall return to the matter because most of the people in Cumbria want to belong to the northern region” —[Official Report, 14 January 1998; Vol. 304, c. 390.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I appreciate that time was limited for the replies to the debate on Second Reading. There was no response at that time, however, to the powerful point that the right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland made. I hope that the Under-Secretary will this morning give the Committee the response that, perhaps, could have been given on Second Reading.<P>
The right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland knows Cumbria well. He would not have spoken lightly. He is a former Opposition Chief Whip. Why has Cumbria been plucked from what the right hon. Gentleman called the northern region? Does it have more in common with Merseyside or with the Wirral than with the counties and districts of what are defined in the Bill as the north-eastern region? I hope that the Minister will explain the Government’s thinking and say why they believe that the right hon. Gentleman is mistaken.<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The amendment would place Cumbria in the north-east region instead of the north-west region. I suppose that I must congratulate the hon. Member for South Suffolk on his mischief-making. He knows that there has been a lengthy debate in Cumbria about whether it should be in the north-west or the north-west region.<P>
To be consistent with the views that I expressed earlier, a decision had to be taken on boundaries. Sensitivities are often involved—for instance, about the boundary between Devon and Cornwall. People on both sides feel strongly, but in order to make progress rather than to have huge rows about boundaries, we decided—at least initially—that we should base the RDAs on the existing government office boundaries. That means that Cumbria is, for these purposes, in the north-West region.<P>
There are valid opinions on both sides. I have discussed our proposals on RDAs on many occasions in the north-west region. Other problems are involved, including the decision to create one RDA in the north-west where there are presently two. Those decisions were taken at the outset.<P>
Boundary disputes will always occur. We decided early on that we could either have boundary disputes almost endlessly or we could take a decision at the outset, communicate it to the stakeholders in the regions and ask them to put it aside—at least initially—and to get on with making the RDAs a success. I know that there are strongly held views in the north-west and in the north-east about where Cumbria’s natural home should be. Even in Cumbria there is no consensus—there are passionate advocates on both sides. However, as the hon. Member for Cheadle knows, boundaries have to be drawn somewhere. In order to make progress we have to draw boundaries somewhere, but one will never obtain 100 per cent. agreement on all boundaries. One has to take a decision and move forward.<P>
There is no consensus in Cumbria, although the hon. Member for Cheadle read a quotation from my right hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland which suggested that there was a consensus that Cumbria should be in the north-east rather than in the north-west. That is not the case: there is no consensus. The signs are that people are prepared to put their differences aside and to work in partnership for the success of the north-west RDA. I welcome that development—it is the best way forward.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I said that this was a probing amendment, and I shall not press it to a Division. However, I notice that the Under-Secretary thinks that my point involved mischief-making—I am sure that the right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland will be interested to learn her view. I do not suggest that he represents the majority opinion, but he reflects real concern based on 25 years experience of the region. It was a fair point and it is regrettable that it has been dismissed in such a cavalier way. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 23, line 3, leave out ‘Cornwall, Devon,’.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it is convenient to take the following amendments: No. 14, in page 23, line 9, leave out ‘Plymouth’.<P>
No. 15, in page 23, line 10, leave out from ‘Gloucestershire’ to end of line 11 and insert—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘or Swindon West. The counties of Cornwall and Devon. the non-metropolitan districts of Plymouth and Torbay.’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> This is not a probing amendment but one that deals with a substantive concern. The three amendments in the group would separate Devon and Cornwall to create a new western region consisting of those two great counties and the non-metropolitan districts of Plymouth and Torbay. What schedule 1 describes as the South West region would remain.<P>
I am astonished that anyone sensitive to the views of people who live in the area defined by schedule 1 as the South West should try and lump all that together. My family originates from Devonshire and I retain an interest in the health and identity of that county. Any hon. Member with knowledge of the area will understand the anger felt by many in Cornwall and Devon at being lumped in with places like Swindon. I have nothing against Swindon, a fine and prosperous town, but I question how much it has in common with Plymouth.<P>
How does the Minister respond to the criticism from people in Cornwall that a government office with headquarters in Bristol will be the focus of the regional development agency? Bristol is closer to London than to many parts of the region it will claim to represent. Do not local circumstances and logic point powerfully to a change in the boundaries proposed by the schedule? I have incorporated that change in my amendments.<P>
I regret that the Government felt unable to show any flexibility in dealing with earlier amendments when I sought to exclude the eastern region altogether. This time, I am offering them the opportunity to be flexible in their attitude to the details of the Bill. If regions that do not want a regional development agency—regardless of whether local circumstances justify creating one—must have one because the Minister thinks that he knows best, cannot the Government apply some common sense and flexibility in drawing the boundaries?<P>
I am becoming a little discouraged about the willingness of Ministers to consider any argument about the detail of the Bill. Changing the boundaries will not damage the cherished principles at the basis of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will not simply read out his civil service brief on this amendment.<P>
Consulting the people of Devon and Cornwall might give credence to my amendment. Responding to my previous amendment, the Minister said that there was danger of endless debate about boundaries. Indeed so. That is why I have tabled amendment No. 13. To accept that amendment would not begin endless debate, but would prevent it. My amendment suggests a more logical and acceptable structure for that part of the country.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> My hon. Friend has raised a crucial issue. I had some responsibility for the south-west, and it was apparent that there is tremendous incoherence in that region. The region ranges from some extremely prosperous parts of the M4 corridor to Cornwall, which is one of the most deprived areas in the United Kingdom. My only quarrel with my hon. Friend is about putting Cornwall and Devon together, because they are very separate areas. Devon is significantly more prosperous than Cornwall. Indeed, I believe that there is a strong case that, when the European fund revision takes place, they should no longer be linked and Cornwall should stand on its own as one of the regions eligible for European assistance. Cornwall is characterised by a low-wage economy and high unemployment, because it is an industrial county. If one looks at the history of Cornwall, one sees that it has a strong industrial tradition, which one occasionally overlooks when one thinks of it in terms of its recreational and sporting facilities.<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister’s plans, we will have a development agency that will cover an economically heterogeneous area ranging from very prosperous areas with low unemployment to some of the worst blackspots in the United Kingdom, and in many ways rural unemployment is more insidious and more difficult to remedy than some urban unemployment. All that will be tackled by an agency that has no more than 15 people on it, according to the Bill. How will the Minister ensure that the interests of an area such as Cornwall, which thinks of itself as being very distinct—I sometimes think that the only area in Europe where passport controls will remain will be on the Tamar bridge—are represented and that an area that is wholly different from any other part of the region receives the focus and the attention that it requires? I do not think that the development agency, as conceived at present, is likely to guarantee that. Of all the development agencies proposed across England, this is the one that presents the most glaring difficulty in finding effective remedies for well-rooted problems.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I support what the right hon. Gentleman has just said. I want to pay my own small tribute to him in his previous role as Minister with responsibility for the south-west for raising the issues of the south-west effectively. He certainly gave many of us who were fighting a battle down there a slightly stronger voice.<P>
In some respects there is some sense in having a Devon, Cornwall and Plymouth region, but the experience of recent cross-border organisations has not been particularly good or successful. Much has to do with the fact that, while geographically they are adjacent to each other and Cornwall is in many ways dependent on what happens in Devon—clearly in transport and infrastructure, in order to get to every part of Cornwall one has to go through Devon—that is as far as it goes. As the Minister will be aware, Cornwall has waged a heavy campaign in seeking a separate Cornwall development agency. That is because Cornwall’s problems are clearly much more adverse than Devon’s and indeed than those of the rest of the proposed region.<P>
I do not believe that having a Devon and Cornwall agency would stop the debate. In many respects it might only enliven it. Therefore, I cannot support a Devon and Cornwall agency. However, as the Minister will also be aware, we later suggest that, while the regions are as set out under the Government offices, there is a definite case for a boundary commission to provide a forum in which people can become involved, once again, in putting their views on what a region would mean for them.<P>
Cornwall clearly feels that, if it had its own separate development agency, it could focus on its own problems and blackspots. Putting Devon and Cornwall with Plymouth may be geographically and administratively convenient, but it would not necessarily provide the framework for a lasting and successful regional development agency.<P>
The south-west region that is proposed is, like many of the regions, extremely large and takes in huge differences. As the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said, Cornwall has a genuine case for a separate identity, and we hope that any future proposal that includes a boundary commission report will establish that. A Devon and Cornwall development agency would consign Cornwall to being linked to Devon for the foreseeable future, which we do not believe is the way forward.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> I hope that, by discussing the amendment, we will not be accused of making mischief on this point, because the amendment deals with a relevant issue that is central to the concept of the Bill. It raises questions in my mind about whether the Government have truly thought through what they are proposing and whether their motives are clear to the Committee. Are they simply seeking to bring economic regeneration to various parts of the country, or do they have a constitutional motive in altering the way in which government is conducted in the English part of the United Kingdom? I am not clear in my mind from what Ministers have said, and I do not believe the Committee is clear yet, which of those two motives is to the fore in the Government’s thinking.<P>
The amendment allows us to bring to the Committee’s attention the fact that, as Opposition Members have tried to explain, there is no such thing as a purely regional identity. The south-west, which is often automatically accepted as having more of a regional identity than other parts of England, is a classic example of not having a regional identity to speak of. Anybody who has been to Cornwall knows that a Cornishman if asked who he is, will say that he is a Cornishman, as opposed to an Englishman, and feels that sense of identity, in cultural and economic terms. It is true that Cornwall has not benefited in the same way as many other parts of the United Kingdom, as prosperity has grown in this country. It is essential that such differences in so-called administrative areas, which the Government like to call “regions”, as if they had an identity, should be recognised.<P>
The amendment allows us to discuss these differences and the realities of people’s sense of identity I hope that the Government will be willing to accept that and thereby recognise the differences between, particularly, Devon and Cornwall.<P>
The Government’s concept of the regional agencies implies that they see them as somehow unifying people and bringing them together to work for the benefit of the region. However, there could be splits and divisions, as two parts of the region that have a genuine sense of identity compete with each other for available finance or development, which may happen in Devon and Cornwall. Therefore, the Bill will engender competition, not unity, in a region.<P>
Will the Minister explain—this lay at the heart of what I said earlier—whether the Government’s main motive in the Bill is to bring about economic regeneration in Devon, Cornwall and everywhere else? Or is the Bill in fact the first step to creating regional assemblies? That has not been explained. The Committee should know what is the Government’s highest priority.<P>
I have another direct question about Devon and Cornwall. The reply should help us to understand difficulties that may arise over senses of identity in other regions of England. Will the Minister tell us whether consultation in the south-west—particularly Cornwall—reflected what we are told was 99 per cent. support from councillors and TECs and so on in other parts of the country? Given that the Government were elected with a large majority, having made clear their intentions to move down this road—although the directly elected assemblies were left to a later date—was it any great surprise to the Minister that councillors and TECs who knew the Government’s intentions decided that it would be in their interests to get involved? That does not necessarily imply a particular wish to go in the Government’s direction.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Let me spell out exactly what the regional development agencies are about. The hon. Member for Cheadle obviously has either not read the White Paper or understood the Bill. Let me spell it out in words of one syllable.<P>
Regional development agencies will address an economic deficit that the Government believe to exist in the English regions. We are modelling the RDAs on what has gone before—the Scottish Development Agency and the Welsh Development Agency. We are addressing the specific issue of an economic deficit.<P>
Let me give the Committee chapter and verse. When Dr. Clark and I considered UK manufacturing performance on the Select Committee on Trade and Industry during the previous Parliament, the then President of the Board of Trade responded to our report with the first White Paper on Competitiveness. We considered the weakness in the UK’s competitive base. We considered short-termism in financial markets, the lack of medium-sized companies, the lack of technology transfer and more. All that is well rehearsed.<P>
We also considered how to deliver and what economies of scale there were. Our objective report—unanimously agreed in the days when the Conservative party had a majority on the Select Committee—considered the north-west and south-east regions and said that one thing was clear to those who try to produce wealth in the nation. There was no strategic overview at regional level and a matrix of organisations was trying to deliver economic regeneration. More than 70 were fully funded from the public purse in the north-west, the area of the hon. Member for Cheadle. More than 120 existed in the south-east. The major complaint to the Select Committee was that there was no coherence or strategy and people did not know what they were doing. <P>
That view came not from Labour, but from an objective report by the Trade and Industry Select Committee. That is why I am clear that the RDAs address that issue and do so through economy of scale. No one argues that we want Cornwall to continue to be down 69 per cent. in GPD per capita terms relative to the European Union. In my experience, having visited Cornwall and the South-west, and having read more than 200 submissions to our consultation document, people accept that such economy of scale is necessary. We are discussing not only devolution from the centre to the regions but devolution within the regions.<P>
When I visited Exeter a few weeks ago on another round of consultations, I met Sir Geoffrey Holland, the vice-chancellor of Exeter university, who is desperately fighting for a higher education institute in Cornwall. Cornwall experiences a brain drain every September because it has no institute of higher education. Students are therefore forced to leave the area after their A-levels. Sir Geoffrey Holland and his colleagues are attempting to deal with that problem—as indeed are the Government, with European funding. Devolution within the regions will create more even economic growth. No economic model can show under-utilisation to the extent that Cornwall is experiencing along with an overheated economy. It is a bad economic model by any standards.<P>
The most interesting discussion that I have had took place last week, when someone knocked on my door and asked to see me. It was Lord Young, who told me that he had entered consultations in the south-east with scepticism. He came out arguing that the proposal was a good idea. He is now fully involved in the concept—a former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and for Employment is now arguing that RDAs have merit and wants to be involved.<P>

<B>Mr. Curry rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I shall give way in a moment. I should like to make it absolutely clear to the hon. Member for Cheadle where the Government are coming from.<P>
With the concept of RDAs, we are addressing an economic deficit. We can play around with statistics, but there is real deprivation. We are modelling the bodies on the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies and Scottish Enterprise.<P>
We will then address a democratic deficit. That democratic deficit will be resolved by devolution to ensure good government of the nation. As we said in our manifesto, in the first instance we will set up regional chambers, which will be mainly in the public sector; RDAs will be mainly in the private sector. We will develop them with partners, so that we get cross-fertilisation of ideas and cultures. All stakeholders, all partners in the regions will be party to it, although it will be in the main in the public sector. In the fullness of time, and with the people’s consent in those regions, they may develop into directly elected regional assemblies. That is the agenda; no one is dealing from the bottom of the pack. There is no hidden agenda; it was clearly outlined in our manifesto. I have enunciated that on many occasions in the House.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I should like to take the Minister back to the university of Cornwall. He will know from his conversations that a physical campus, rather than an electronic entity, is envisaged. That is an extremely expensive project. Those involved have considered submitting bids to the Millennium Commission. It would have pretty well cleaned out the kitty of European money as far as objective 5b is concerned. It is therefore an expensive business. They were, I think, examining how Lincoln university had been financed. Would a regional development agency finance such a project? If so, how much would be left for all the rest of the region that it is supposed to cover? What criteria of cost-effectiveness will it apply? The Millennium Commission had some scepticism about the scale of the development proposed for the university.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I do not want to enter the discussion about that matter; it is censored at the moment. Discussions are taking place in Europe. The right hon. Gentleman must understand that the proposed body is an enabling body. It is designed to bring partnerships together. It is not merely about public money. It is about engaging the public and private sectors in an imaginative way, from the bottom up, to deal with the structural weaknesses that have been identified. Structural weaknesses in the competitive base of the south-west are not necessarily the same as those in the north-east. Economies of scale are needed to develop science parks, transport infrastructure and universities. All our discussions with government offices have highlighted the fact that the strategic approach has, sadly, been missing. That is why there is enthusiasm for our proposals.<P>
We must break away from the narrow-mindedness that portrays the Opposition’s centralised thinking. We must engage creatively with our partners and ensure that they begin to deal with their problems themselves. I hear the comments of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, but in the south-west there will be one RDA for each of the English regions. However, that does not involve dictating to them the  sub-structures that they can use to deal with some of the problems that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We have faith in people and in their ability to deliver. We must get away from the arrogance of central Government, who must not dictate what people should do. The response to our dialogue has been positive because we trust people to get on with the job.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> The Minister has still not adequately explained how he will create regional development agencies that will deal with the problems that are experienced by individual counties, including, for example, Cornwall. If there will be sub-structures—as the Minister eloquently called them—what will they be? They are a vital element in the Government’s proposals. The RDAs will create competition in the south-west between Devon and Cornwall, which have entirely conflicting interests and desires.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Let me explain the situation to the hon. Gentleman one more time. In the English dictionary, there is a word called devolution. We are devolving powers without prescribing what should be done. If sub-structures are needed to deal with the economic weaknesses in a competitive base, local regions have got the right to set them up.<P>
Opposition Members find it hard to understand that we will consult and listen to people—and do what they want if there is a consensus—and that we are devolving powers without prescribing what should be done with them. We say to people, “If you want to set up sub-structures, only for Cornwall or for Devon and Cornwall jointly, it is up to those regions to decide.” We believe that they know more about dealing with those weaknesses than do those of us who sit in the ivory towers of Westminster and Whitehall. We are empowering people to take such decisions. That is why there has been universal support—or perhaps I should say 99.9 per cent. support—for our proposals. If one wants to do the relevant research by walking, walk down to Eland house and studying the submissions, one can do so—they are available. We rest our case on that.<P>
The amendment undermines the whole concept behind the RDAs. I refer Opposition Members to the Scottish Development Agency and the Welsh Development Agency. Why have they been so successful? Why has the Scottish Development Agency been able to secure economic growth in that nation of 5 million people? The Opposition should answer that question, and apply their answer to the situation in the south-west.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I listened to the Minister with great interest. He invites me to quote more responses that criticise or heavily qualify their alleged support for the RDAs. I am also interested by his statement that the Bill will empower agencies and local people. Our discussions of later clauses will show that the Secretary of State reserves the power to dictate staffing and the appointment of members, that he controls the budget and decides whether agencies can borrow, and that he even decides who the agencies should consult to retain the power to dictate strategy. The Bill is not about empowering anyone other than the Secretary of State.<P>
I very much regret that the Minister did not see fit to suggest that the Government would at any stage contemplate changing the boundaries. For that reason, we shall press the amendment to a Division.<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I welcome the Minister’s comments, especially those about the RDA’s ability to create sub-structures—provided that that system is not too bureaucratic. It will require appropriate representation and the provision of dedicated and focused resources to ensure that regions such as Cornwall are dealt with appropriately.<P>
I am prepared to support the Government in the hope that later on they will agree to those measures that are necessary to establish adequate sub-structures.<P>
