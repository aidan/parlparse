<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000342"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Good morning, Mr. Key. It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship in the scrutinising and the amending
part of our Public Bill Committee deliberations. As far as the
Opposition are concerned, amendment 59 and new clause 3 are
significant, and I hope that you will permit me to speak for a little
time on them. They go to the heart of the Bill, dealing with the issue
that was discussed extensively in our evidence sessions about getting
the balance right between dealing with the causes of poverty&#151;the
pathways that lead families and children into lives of
poverty&#151;and alleviating its symptoms and effects.</div>
<a name="09102777000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to
Government Members that amendment 59 and new clause 3 do not detract in
any way from the existing income and material deprivation targets in
clauses 2 to 5. The amendment and the new clause will leave those
clauses, which we support, absolutely intact. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>I say emphatically that the proposals are not wrecking amendments. They
would put in the Bill an additional target that would help us to
achieve the 2020 target and do the serious work of reducing the various
pathways that lead families and children into poverty, not just up to
2020, but well beyond that
date.</div><a name="09102777000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102777000343"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): This is an interesting proposal,
and I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman develop the detail of
his argument. I want to ask some overarching questions about his
approach. I suspect that he&#151;indeed, like my
colleagues&#151;has in the past condemned the culture of central
Government setting a target for this, a target for that and so on. The
Bill already has four targets, and his new clause would add perhaps
another eight. Is there some inconsistency there? How does the hon.
Gentleman reconcile the
two?</div><a name="09102777000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000344"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an absolutely fair and
proper point, as he often does. I am not someone who seeks extra
targets for the sake of it, and I accept his general point. In
particular, when we come on to part 2 of the Bill, which deals with
local government, my colleagues and I may want to include fewer targets
and give local authorities in particular slightly more freedom in their
approach. Hopefully, the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member
for Edinburgh, West will support us in
that.</div><a name="09102777000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
worry, as the Committee heard extensively during the witness sessions,
centres on the danger of keeping the current targets alone. They may
drive policy in the wrong direction, keeping it in the area of income
transfer&#151;important as that is&#151;without dealing with some
of the serious issues that cause families to be in poverty in the first
place. We do not propose imposing extra targets in the Bill
lightly&#151;we do so for a serious reason. We think that it will get
to the heart of what we are all about in this Committee, which is
turning lives around in a serious and substantial way. We fear that the
four targets in the Bill alone might not do that, because the
temptation, as has been said in Committee, could be just to whack out
tax credits in 2018-19. Even the hon. Member for Northavon himself said
that that might be the case.</div>
<a name="09102777000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102777000345"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): May I help my hon. Friend out? It
seems to me, as someone who has devoted his life to eradicating
targets, that the targets that would be included in the Bill by virtue
of new clause 3 and amendment 59 merely recognise that that is the way
in which local government is already working to tackle poverty. It is
therefore an appropriate way to overcome the mismatch in the Bill
between the income targets, which are macro-economic and central
Government-related, and the activities that are taking place on the
ground.</div><a name="09102777000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000346"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has
particular expertise in local government, in which he served with
distinction for a number of years. In subsection (2)(a) to (h) of new
clause 3, he and his local government colleagues will recognise a
number of targets on which local authorities up and down the country
are already seriously engaged to try to deal effectively with child
poverty in their area.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div><a name="09102777000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was struck
during the witness sessions by how much support there was&#151;not
just from the people who gave evidence&#151;for the general approach
that I am putting to the Committee.</div>
<a name="09102777000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102777000347"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman refers
to the witness statements, but I quizzed the witnesses about the
difficulty already referred to. We say that we should not have too many
targets, yet the Opposition now suggest that we have a lot more
targets. I could add another 20 to the list. Does he not accept that
the Bill places two duties on the Secretary of State? The first relates
to the minimum income targets, but the second relates to the strategy,
which will be informed by the child poverty commission. Rather than us
putting suggestions in the Bill, surely the commission should be doing
that
job.</div><a name="09102777000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000348"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The hon. Lady makes a perfectly fair point, but
the danger is that if we stick with the targets that are in the Bill,
from clauses 2 to 5, they and they alone will drive the strategy in
clause 8, and it will be wholly directed to
fulfilling&#151;</div><a name="09102777000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000349"></a>Judy
Mallaber</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="09102777000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000350"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Perhaps the hon. Lady will let me develop my
argument a little further. The strategy will be wholly directed to
fulfilling those targets; they will be statutory obligations on the
Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="09102777000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We mentioned
the witness sessions, so let me go through some of the points made in
support of this general approach. The hon. Lady&#146;s colleague, the
hon. Member for Copeland, said at column 21 of <i class="I">Hansard</i> on 20
October that he was concerned about not addressing the real cultural
issues involved in leading families into poverty. The first thing that
Councillor Paul Carter, the leader of Kent county council, spoke about,
at column 51, was the tremendous importance of doing serious long-term
work to get families out of poverty, which is what new clause 3 is
about. In column 55, Kevan Collins, the chief executive of Tower
Hamlets council, said that the Bill needed to be about breaking the
cycles of inter-generational
poverty.</div><a name="09102777000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
column 82 on 22 October, Charlotte Pickles from the Centre for Social
Justice made the point that were we to increase benefit take-up alone,
that would not break the cycle of inter-generational poverty. Indeed,
the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North&#151;perhaps
she will speak for herself during the debate&#151;said that targets
were only part of the whole story, and I agree with her on that
point.</div>
<a name="09102777000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102777000351"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab): I
am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, as he mentioned my
name. My point is&#151;there is cross-party consensus on
this&#151;that poverty is multi-dimensional, and it is addressed in
the &#147;Opportunity for all&#148; strategy. There are many
families and children whose poverty can be ascribed to many complex
social and cultural factors. Among Labour Members, however, what
underpins the Bill is the fact that the 2.9 million children living in
poverty do so because they do not have enough money, and if we do not
have a financially driven programme around benefits and wages and so
forth in this Bill, of all Bills, we are in danger of missing nine out
of 10 of the children currently below the poverty
line.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div><a name="09102777000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000352"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I have no argument with the hon. Lady on that
point. As I have already said, we are leaving clauses 2 to 5 intact. We
are committed to those targets, but this is an important argument
because our contention is that we will not really succeed in meeting
the targets in clauses 2 to 5 unless the strategy in clause 8 is
focused on the additional set of targets that we want to put into new
clause 3, which would become clause 6 of the Bill, were it agreed
to.</div>
<a name="09102777000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me pray in aid some of the other witnesses who came before us. At
column 109, on 22 October, Mike Brewer of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies and Donald Hirsch from Loughborough university were asked
whether to achieve the aims of the Bill one needs to address the
longer-term causes of poverty in the early years, to which they both
said yes. Mike Brewer
said:</div><a name="09102777000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
share the reservations...that all the targets are about family
income.&#148;</div>
<a name="09102777000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">He went on to
say:</div><a name="09102777000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
wish that there were a broader range of
indicators&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Child

concern is that we could achieve the targets, but not turn
people&#146;s lives around in the way that would be necessary to
break inter-generational cycles of poverty. Edna Speed told the
Committee how her organisation, Save the Family, managed to do that,
and said
that</div><a name="09102777000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;86
per cent. of our families are turned round for

a pretty impressive statistic. Neil O&#146;Brien, from Policy
Exchange, spoke about the current set of targets driving public policy
to</div><a name="09102777000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relentlessly...downstream

Q199]</div><a name="09102777000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the central point. Clause 8 will focus solely on meeting the targets in
clauses 2 to 5.</div>
<a name="09102777000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102777000353"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): I have two
questions for my hon. Friend&#151;or perhaps a comment and a
question. One of the criticisms made of the target culture is the fact
that the targets chosen, however worthy, distort the broader range of
policies. That is particularly important in an area in which, as the
hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North said, there is such
complexity involved, so would the addition of a greater number of
targets perhaps lead to a more rounded policy approach? Does my hon.
Friend have reservations&#151;perhaps I am in a minority of
one&#151;about the fact that the setting of targets in statutory form
as an essential aspect of ongoing policy is fundamentally incorrect and
self-distorting?</div><a name="09102777000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000354"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> In relation to my hon. Friend&#146;s first
point, my argument is that we will ultimately not be successful by
2020, or by any other date, in achieving the targets in clauses 2 to 5
without doing serious work on what leads families, often over many
generations&#151;five generations were mentioned by some of the
witnesses&#151;into
poverty.</div><a name="09102777000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point about putting that on a legal basis, I understand the concern
expressed by hon. Members. The Government have failed to meet their
2005 target, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>and they are likely to fail to reach their 2010 target by about a third.
As my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire said on
Second Reading, they are now reaching for legislation, having failed
without legislation. There is a question as to what difference a Bill
will make&#151;that is a legitimate view. However, a Bill is being
considered in Committee. We are all committed, across the House, to
really dealing with, and eradicating, child poverty if we possibly can,
and to driving it down as much as possible. To do that, we need to make
sure that the strategy in the Bill does the job by focusing on what
drives people into poverty in the first
place.</div><a name="09102777000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and her Department used
to publish that sort of data in the Government report
&#147;Opportunity for all&#148;, until 2007. I am not aware that
she has explained why the Department suddenly stopped publishing that
information, as a number of witnesses, including, I think, Neil
O&#146;Brien from Policy Exchange, pointed out. The data that the
Department used to publish focused on children in workless households,
and looked at teenage pregnancy, the proportion of children in
disadvantaged areas with a good level of development, the number of
NEETs&#151;people not in education, employment or training&#151;the
number of 16 to 18-year-olds in learning, obesity in children, and a
number of other factors. Bizarrely, that publication was stopped. Some
Members will perhaps be familiar with the statistics produced by the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which cover more than child
poverty&#151;they go across the age range. The JRF report,
&#147;Monitoring poverty and social exclusion 2008&#148;, contains
56 indicators, and notes whether there have been improvements and
whether the situation is steady or has got worse across a range of
those indicators. It is an incredibly valuable document in terms of
driving policy. Indeed, Save the Children applies a similar
rubric.</div><a name="09102777000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09102777000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the New Economics Foundation and Action for Children report,
&#147;Backing the Future: why investing in children is good for us
all&#148;, came out a month or two ago and I am struck by a couple of
sentences in its summary. The document, which I would commend to all
Members if they have not read it, talks
about</div><a name="09102777000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;why
it is essential to address the impact of the structural factors

how</div><a name="09102777000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

an incredibly striking point is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000356"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> If the hon. Lady will let me finish, I will give
way to her. The report states that</div>
<a name="09102777000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the UK has some
of the lowest levels of child well-being when compared with countries
of similar economic
wealth,&#148;</div><a name="09102777000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
says:</div><a name="09102777000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
16-24-year-olds, for example, record the lowest levels of trust and
belonging in
Europe.&#148;</div><a name="09102777000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is therefore not only the Opposition making the points that I have
outlined. The Action for Children and New Economics Foundation report
is very
serious.</div><a name="09102777000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000357"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that part of the
strength of the report&#146;s analysis, with which I agree, has its
roots in decades of under-investment in child care and effective
welfare-to-work strategies, and in policies that led to a trebling of
child poverty during the 1980s? It is not possible to take the report
as a snapshot and argue that all those factors and decades of
under-investment did not play an important
part.</div><a name="09102777000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000358"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I am not here to play a blame-allocation game. My
purpose is to try to get the policy right for the future. Edna Speed,
who travelled from the north-west to attend an evidence sitting, said
that she hoped that she had not made a wasted journey and that the
Committee would do the serious work to get the policy right for the
future. There has been a tendency across Governments of both parties
for far too long to use sticking-plasters as solutions and to send out
ambulances without doing some of the long-term, tough&#151;it is not
easy&#151;deep, preventive work that is necessary to deal with
families in the constituency of the hon. Member for Regent&#146;s
Park and Kensington, North, as well as with families in my constituency
and, in some cases, whole communities that have suffered severe
inter-generational poverty. We are talking about long-term, deep,
serious work, not quick headlines, and it is needed alongside the
targets in clauses 2 to
5.</div><a name="09102777000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000359"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Good morning, Mr. Key. The amendment and
new clause are well-meaning, because they address things that we want
to do something about. The question is whether they should have
statutory force and be included in the Bill. I do not doubt for a
moment the sincerity of the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire,
but I do not think that he addressed my earlier intervention. I suspect
that every Government Minister throughout history has said that, in
general, micro-management and target-setting are a bad thing, but that
their targets are good targets. The hon. Gentleman gave a slight sense
of that by suggesting that he would strip away bad targets and have
lots of new, good ones.</div>
<a name="09102777000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3
itself indicates that its list of eight targets is not exhaustive. For
example, the list includes children growing up</div>
<a name="09102777000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in homes with
drug and alcohol addiction&#148;,</div>
<a name="09102777000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">but not those in homes
where an adult or child has a mental health problem. One might subset
and say, &#147;Okay, we will put that one in.&#148; Then one might
ask about the children whose parents experience racial discrimination
in employment and as a result are less likely to get jobs and more
likely to live in poverty, and say, &#147;We will put that on the
list.&#148; Suddenly there is a much less focused debate. Does one
say, &#147;Well, 100 targets would be ridiculous, so we will have the
big 10&#148;? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>Then there is distortion, as the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness
suggested, because some things are on the target list and some are
not.</div>
<a name="09102777000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
about the Bill is that it focuses on a narrow range of goals&#151;on
different measures of material deprivation, such as income poverty,
persistent poverty and so on. The risk is of losing focus. My view, as
I will explain later, is that four targets are too many. One of my
worries about having four targets plus the eight in the new clause, or
whatever the number, is that there would then be 12 targets, and the
Government of the day could say, &#147;We haven&#146;t done too
badly; we got seven out of 12.&#148; We want to focus on one specific
goal for which the Government are held to account. One worry about the
absolute poverty target is that it is a sitter. It is a penalty with
the goalkeeper having gone off. The Government will hit that one, so
that is one out of four already. A future Government might say,
&#147;Well, two out of four ain&#146;t bad.&#148; As soon as we
do that, there is a danger that we dilute what we are trying to
achieve. We want to do something about all the things on the list for
their own sake, and possibly as a means to the end of tackling child
poverty, but the Bill is about tackling child poverty in a particular
way and we risk losing focus. I hope that we will get the chance to
have a short stand part debate on clause 1, so I will not go any
broader than the subject of the amendment and the new
clause.</div>
<a name="09102777000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only other danger that I would highlight is that various other parts of
Government will rightly try to tackle the issues. I am concerned that
we would let the Government off the hook if we diluted the targets. We
risk having a massive debate about what is in the Bill, and what is
not. Presumably, the list in new clause 3 is not fixed in time, either.
In other words, whereas we have a 10-year target of tackling child
poverty on an income measure, things would come on to the list and go
off it as society changes. We will still be bothered about income
poverty in 10 years&#146; time, but some of the issues in the list
might become less prevalent, and others more prevalent, as time goes
by. Do we want to be constantly updating and changing? Or do we end up
with a list of out-of-date targets, because although there is a whole
set of bigger issues that should be on it, it is too late to change
primary legislation?</div>
<a name="09102777000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102777000360"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): New clause 3
is drafted to allow the capability to amend and update. The list is not
exclusive. Indeed, the eight targets listed are not compulsory; they
are targets that may be included. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point
about the need to focus on different issues at different times, because
some matters may be addressed and others may emerge, but the amendment
allows that flexibility.</div>
<a name="09102777000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000361"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> It does, but the question is: where would we start?
Would we start with a list that is broadly the length of that in the
new clause? I do not know what is in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s mind.
That would worry me. Four plus eight makes 12 targets. Do we let the
Government off the hook if they hit seven, eight or nine? Do we count
ourselves as quibbling if they miss only two, but they are the two big
ones? Or do we have endless debates about what should be on or off the
list, or what is now more important than it used to be? I am worried
about the loss of focus. The Bill has one specific purpose. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>All of the matters listed are both a means to achieving that end and
worth while in their own right. I am not sure what value is added by
picking a subset of them&#151;or others&#151;and statutorily
targeting them in a child poverty Bill, rather than focusing on one
specific goal for which we want to hold the Government to
account.</div><a name="09102777000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000362"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The hon. Gentleman said that the Bill is extremely
focused. It is focused on the incomes of families in which children
live. The question is whether that policy could lead to bad outcomes.
Will it lead to the allocation of resources to fulfil precisely that
aim? Perhaps, as I think he said, the Government of the day would say
they had tackled child poverty effectively by maintaining people
instead of helping them into work, altering their housing circumstances
and ensuring that they got better schooling. If they just stick the
benefits level up high enough to ensure a statistical, theoretical
removal from poverty, that will leave people stuck there. That concern
is at the heart of the amendment.</div>
<a name="09102777000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000363"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> With respect, that point is at the heart of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concerns, but it is the opposite to what is at the
heart of the amendment and the new clause. The amendment and new clause
would do a lot more of the kind of stuff that he mentions, because they
would add more targets. I take his point that the focus in the Bill is
too narrow. My view is that there is a risk of downplaying income
poverty. In her evidence Edna Speed described it not as absolute
poverty but as abject poverty. What is good about the measures in the
Bill is that they are not just about a line on a graph showing
equivalent household income: we have measures on persistent poverty and
material deprivation.</div>
<a name="09102777000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
list in the &#147;households below average income&#148; statistics
of what counts as material deprivation is not just about lines on a
graph. It covers whether a child can go on holiday, have a new pair of
shoes, and have a hobby. It is already a broader concept than the hon.
Gentleman perhaps suggests. I risk repeating myself, but my key concern
is about whether this focused Bill could be even more focused. The
amendment risks diluting it, albeit in a well-meaning way. The matters
listed should be ends in themselves, and will form part of any child
poverty strategy anyway. I am not sure that we gain focus by adding
them to the
Bill.</div><a name="09102777000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000364"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> I agree that the amendment and the new clause
would create a much less focused Bill. Some of the items in the new
clause are slightly curious. For example, it asks for</div>
<a name="09102777000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regulations
setting out the causes of poverty
targets&#148;,</div><a name="09102777000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
one of those causes is &#147;serious personal debt&#148;. Surely it
is the fact that a person is poor that causes them to have serious
personal debt, rather than the other way
round.</div>
<a name="09102777000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000365"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b><b class="B"> </b>Obviously, I recognise that there is some
truth in what the hon. Lady says, but I have spent quite a lot of time
recently with various debt counselling organisations across the country
that help families who are in poverty and have very serious debt, and
there is a particular characteristic of serious personal debt that
aggravates poverty and can keep people in poverty in a particularly
unattractive way. There is a separate facet of the debate relating to
debt.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div><a name="09102777000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000366"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments show the
complexity and the difficulty of adding extra targets in the way that
the new clause does. I could give another 40 targets, but if I did, I
would be accused of being target-mad. We all know that we have moved
between having too many targets and having too few. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North, pointed out,
the danger is that by focusing solely on those at the bottom of the
pile with multiple deprivation, we ignore 2 million&#151;perhaps even
more&#151;of the 2.9 million people in poverty. The Bill
attempts to focus us on the broader sweep of those in
poverty.</div><a name="09102777000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000367"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a danger of
us almost psychologically profiling the poor? That is something that I
have heard Opposition Members almost do, and that issue is coming
through very strongly again this morning. Is it not true that people
who are on low incomes have as wide a range of characteristics as
people who are on medium and high incomes? Is it not true that they are
no more than just as likely to have the flaws of drinking too much
alcohol, taking drugs or being in debt, but do not have the income to
give them resilience? That is a separate but equally serious problem in
the approach taken on poverty by Opposition
Members.</div><a name="09102777000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000368"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> I agree. In the questioning session I
specifically referred to many of my constituents who, if given
additional income, do not have those other problems and are perfectly
able to cope with their lives. Their sole problem is a lack of income.
That in no way denigrates the really serious problem faced by a certain
proportion of our population, and nobody downplays the importance of
any of the items in the new clause.</div>
<a name="09102777000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I
quizzed the witnesses, there were contradictions in their answers. When
I asked about targets, Neil O&#146;Brien
said:</div><a name="09102777000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think that you want a broader range of targets and you do not want to
privilege a few of them over others. So you want, in a sense, to be
neutral between the different types of approaches to challenging child
poverty&#148;.</div><a name="09102777000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
had asked for targets, but he also said that he did not want to
privilege a few of them. If we list some of them in regulations in the
detailed way that is proposed, that is precisely what we will do.
Donald Hirsch
said:</div><a name="09102777000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
key thing is to...create a commission with some clout and some
teeth, and one that provides a sort of discipline...The risk of
having lots and lots of targets is that they duplicate targets
elsewhere and also that each one of those targets itself becomes a
potentially distorting measure.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,

am</div><a name="09102777000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment does not take account of the Bill&#146;s structure, which
is a good structure, and we need to take equal account of the
provisions in clauses 1 and 8. Clause 8 specifically asks for a
strategy that is not just about the four income targets but about
ensuring that children do not experience socio-economic disadvantage.
That clause sets out the broad headings, such as education, financial
support, social services and employment, under which a number of those
targets would be set. We cannot have a Bill that encourages a Secretary
of State to set out a whole load of targets that might conflict with
what Ministers are doing in relation to their own departmental
interests. That would be confusing. While 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>nobody denies that the items in subsection (2)(a) to (h) of proposed new
clause 3 are important, they would end up creating a muddle. I am
surprised that a party that has gone on at the Labour Government for
having too many targets now seeks to introduce a whole load of new
ones. That is a slightly surprising contradiction in its position. The
amendment does not add to the Bill, and we should oppose
it.</div><a name="09102777000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000369"></a>John
Howell:</b> One of the difficulties that I have with the
Bill&#151;I will, no doubt, wish to return to the subject later in
our deliberations&#151;is the disjuncture that there seems to be
between the theory and the high-level aspects of the Bill on the one
hand, and its implementation on the other, particularly with regard to
how it hands over implementation to local government. I make no apology
for bringing the issue back to local government, because that is a way
of delivering the Bill. I would like there to be much more
acknowledgment of the fact that delivery of what the Bill and all of us
seek to achieve will happen only if there is a true partnership between
central and local government, and that starts at the top, with the
targets. I have listened carefully to the comments that have been made,
some of which have been surprising. The hon. Member for Northavon
questioned the desirability of updating the targets, and also
questioned how we would deal with a whole range of them. I have to tell
him that that is how the Government have imposed the mechanism of
governance on local government activities across the board. They are
always updating targets&#151;until recently a huge number&#151;and
are extremely adept at putting them into baskets of targets that they
can manage, monitor and change
dynamically.</div><a name="09102777000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000370"></a>Steve

precedent?</div><a name="09102777000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000371"></a>John
Howell:</b> To be fair, there are pros and cons. The cons are
that if the process gets too onerous, it creates more of a bureaucratic
structure for the management of the operation, but on the other hand it
provides flexibility to react to situations and, particularly on a
basket basis, the ability to keep the majority of the targets that one
wants and alter those on the periphery. My experience is that there are
pros and cons, and I want to return to that issue in a
second.</div><a name="09102777000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is already a bit of schizophrenia&#151;if I may use that
expression&#151;on the Government&#146;s part as to whether the
targets should go broader than the four income targets. I thought that
during the evidence sessions there was some recognition, however
grudging, by Ministers that the targets needed to be broader. To a
certain extent, the reference to material deprivation in the second of
those targets is an indication that Government thinking has needed to
acknowledge the broader base. The problem with the material deprivation
aspect is that it maintains the issue of addressing symptom rather than
cause, and we heard in the evidence sessions that the material
deprivation target itself did not achieve the wider range of
measurements that was needed to take into account the causes of
poverty. I refer to the question to which Neil O&#146;Brien
replied:</div><a name="09102777000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
bad thing in the Bill...is the narrowness of the legally binding
targets...That...drives you relentlessly towards downstream
intervention to give people income, rather than upstream intervention

me return to the local government point from two additional aspects.
First, as I said in my intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Bedfordshire, local government ought to tackle child poverty
with regard to the sort of issues that are outlined in the new clause.
If we are to have that partnership, there needs to be a recognition, up
front, that that is how they are tackling it, rather than on an income
basis alone. In many ways that argument has been played out in many of
our councils across the country in the run-up to setting their own
targets. The issue comes back to the fact that some councils have
chosen to adopt the overarching indicator 116 and some have chosen to
adopt other
indicators.</div><a name="09102777000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument, philosophically, is exactly the same. For those that chose
not to opt for the overarching indicators, the argument was that they
needed a broader set of indicators, which were more based on the
outcomes that they wanted to achieve in that particular locale. There
is strong evidence for trying, right at the beginning, to set the tone
for a much broader partnership in order to achieve what we want to
achieve in the
Bill.</div><a name="09102777000080"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000372"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I bid you a warm welcome to the Chair of our
Committee, Mr. Key; I look forward to the debates ahead. The
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire helpfully prompted an
interesting debate, which has taken us to the heart of the question,
&#147;What is the Bill for?&#148; I entirely accept that the
amendments are well meaning, as the hon. Member for Northavon said, but
if agreed to they would detract from the Bill&#146;s clarity of
purpose, as others
said.</div><a name="09102777000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
opening debate is a good opportunity for that clarity to be achieved.
We can be straightforward: the Bill is about tackling
poverty&#151;income poverty and material deprivation. Our aim is that
children in the UK should not live in poverty, so the Bill deliberately
has a tight focus on income and material deprivation. The reason for
that is the evidence of poverty&#146;s impact on children&#146;s
lives&#151;on their experiences now and on their chances for the
future. The evidence is clear and is set out in some of the documents
to which the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire drew attention.
Poverty blights children&#146;s lives: it impacts on their education,
health, social lives, relationships with their parents&#151;sometimes
on the relationship between parents&#151;and future life
chances.</div><a name="09102777000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000373"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> In the light of what the Minister has just said
about income poverty, can he explain why over the past three years the
Government have not increased the level of tax credits necessary to
meet their 2010 child poverty
target?</div><a name="09102777000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000374"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Of course, we have increased tax credits
consistently over the past three years. The 2010 target is going to be
difficult to hit, as we discussed in Committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>last week. However, we have made a great deal of progress in reducing
child poverty: we have reduced the figure by 500,000 according to the
most recent data, and we have agreed and legislated for measures that
we anticipate will lift another 500,000 children above the poverty
line. That is very substantial progress, particularly when compared
with what happened between 1979 and 1997, when the level of child
poverty in the UK more than doubled to become the highest in Europe.
That was a disgrace. We have not only arrested that trend but reversed
it&#151;I hope decisively. I welcome the fact that on Second Reading
there was unanimous support for the Bill across the House, which
reflects the recognition&#151;in contrast with the view taken in the
past&#151;that poverty is a blight on the lives of children and on
the country that needs to be
addressed.</div><a name="09102777000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000375"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div>
<a name="09102777000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000376"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Let me make a couple more points and then I shall
gladly give way to the hon. Gentleman. I want to comment on
what he said. I sensed from his remarks that he was arguing that income
poverty may not be that important, and there are other things that may
be important. Of course there are other important things, but the key
to the Bill is the conviction that income poverty&#151;living below
the poverty line&#151;for children should end. That strong conviction
drives the Bill, and I hope the hon. Gentleman accepts
that.</div>
<a name="09102777000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000377"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The Minister is right to say that income poverty
is a blight. Those outside the House will find it extraordinary that
the Government oppose an amendment that would ensure that such a Bill
puts the causes of child poverty&#151;the broad basket of issues that
successive Governments have signally failed to tackle&#151;at its
heart. Instead the Government fixate on income only, and thus do not
ensure that the broader range of issues is tackled. The amendment would
at least ensure that the causes of poverty are at the heart of the
Bill&#151;not just the quick fix that the Government are not even

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000378"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> People listening to and reading the debate will be
much more likely to agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Amber
Valley and for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North: poverty is
an overriding concern. As others have said, it is right for the Bill to
focus tightly on that concern, rather than on lots of things. The
amendment suggests that instead, the Bill should cover a wider range of
policy areas and set targets through regulations on a wide range of
outcomes relating to child poverty. It is true that they relate to
child poverty; they are not irrelevant or unrelated and it is important
to tackle them. Indeed, there are Government proposals and measures in
place to tackle them, and there are targets, but we should not have
targets in the Bill. That would water down the bright spotlight on
poverty, which is the Bill&#146;s great
strength.</div><a name="09102777000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000379"></a>John
Howell:</b> I am slightly confused by that argument. The
Minister has already admitted that the Bill contains not just income
targets but targets relating to material deprivation, so surely that
already widens the Bill. The problem is the evidence given by Neil
O&#146;Brien that the material deprivation data are not solid. Why
have an imperfect definition outside the income ranges for those
targets when we could have a better one?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div><a name="09102777000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000380"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> As others have said, there is not a single number
that tells us about poverty. That is why we have taken the view, which
has been widely supported by those who have looked at this issue, that
there should be four measures, all four of which I would defend. The
hon. Member for Northavon indicated that he will take a contrary view
on at least one of them. All four measures are about poverty, how much
income people have, how much they are able to buy and whether they
suffer from material deprivation. That focus is clear. I
will resist suggestions that we ought to water that down by looking at
a load of other things as well.</div>
<a name="09102777000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000381"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div>
<a name="09102777000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000382"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Let me make one more point on this issue. I am not
sure that the amendments would result in a broad strategy to tackle
child poverty, as has been argued. The target should cover our ultimate
goal&#151;the outcome that we seek to achieve&#151;not the range of
policies and other topics likely to be addressed as part of an
effective
strategy.</div>
<a name="09102777000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09102777000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
strategy needs to be multifaceted if we are to end child poverty, but
specifying targets, and specifying measures for a range of policy
areas, would reduce its effectiveness and result potentially in a focus
on those eight areas, rather than other things which equally need to be
addressed. It is a pretty selective list. A much better approach would
be to ask, what are we trying to achieve? We are attempting to achieve
the eradication of child poverty. That will be our
target.</div>
<a name="09102777000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000383"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Will the Minister give way on that
point?</div><a name="09102777000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000384"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I will give way first to the hon. Member for
South-West
Hertfordshire.</div><a name="09102777000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000385"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Minister is generous, as ever. I seek clarity
on his approach to tackling child poverty. It seems that there was a
stage when the Government argued that the way to reduce child poverty
was simply through better benefits and tax credits and such transfers
of resources. In recent years the Government&#146;s emphasis has been
more on tackling what we consider the long-term causes of poverty. It
is not clear from what the Minister has said today quite where he
stands. Does he believe essentially that the child poverty target set
out in the Bill will be met by transfers of resources, such as tax
credits and child benefit? Or does he believe it is about addressing
what we would consider the causes of poverty? What is his
position?</div><a name="09102777000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000386"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> It will need to be both. Given the substantial
investment in education, child care, Sure Start centres and other
public services over the past 10 years, we will benefit in
the coming decade more than in the past, simply because that investment
and those services are now in place. Some of the children who benefited
from that investment will have their own children by
2020.</div>
<a name="09102777000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000387"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> On exactly that point, we have not seen the
reduction in the number of NEETs for which we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>would have hoped from measures such as Sure Start centres. Let us assume
hypothetically that over the coming years we see a big reduction in the
number of children leaving primary school unable to read or count
properly, from the current scandalous level of one in five to a much
lower level. Let us assume that over the coming years, we see a massive
reduction in teenage pregnancies and other causes that help to put
people into poverty. Let us say that we are making enormous progress in
a way that we have not over the past 10 years. Would the
Minister really want to see us take funding from those successful
programmes in order to increase benefits, when we were making progress
on the root causes of poverty that have made Britain the most miserable
place in which a child can be brought
up?</div><a name="09102777000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000388"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We have, of course, seen significant improvements
in education standards in primary schools. Many more young people
leaving primary and secondary school are
achieving&#151;</div><a name="09102777000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000389"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> That is hotly
disputed.</div><a name="09102777000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000390"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not think it is hotly disputed. The evidence
is actually very clear. We have seen substantial gains, including
progress in reducing the incidence of teenage pregnancy.</div>
<a name="09102777000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The child
poverty strategy will set out the specific actions that need to be
taken. The development of the strategy will identify those groups of
children most at risk of being in poverty, including particularly
vulnerable groups, and the underlying causes of poverty: the kind of
things set out in the amendments. Annual reports will enable us to
monitor progress, tracking a wide range of indicators. I imagine those
indicators are likely to change, as circumstances change over the
coming decade. The ultimate goal&#151; the end of child
poverty&#151;will be unchanged. It is right that that should be at
the heart of the
Bill.</div><a name="09102777000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire mentioned the publication of
&#147;Opportunity for all&#148;. The Under-Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland
wrote to Members of the Committee late yesterday about that, to set out
that the Department for Work and Pensions is considering what form in
which to continue publishing that information. The data are included in
other documents, such as annual departmental reports, reports on public
service agreements and so on. My hon. Friend is considering the issue
at the moment, recognising the interest that there is and has been in
&#147;Opportunity for
all&#148;.</div><a name="09102777000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill requires all four of the targets to be met. The hon. Member for
Northavon said that perhaps in 10 years&#146; time someone
would say, &#147;We&#146;ve done two of them, that&#146;s not too
bad&#148;, but the terms of the Bill are clear&#151;all four
targets need to be
hit.</div><a name="09102777000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Committee will accept that it is right for the Bill to
have the tight focus on poverty&#151;no ifs and no buts&#151;and
that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09102777000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000391"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I am grateful to all hon. Members who have spoken.
We have had a wide-ranging and important debate on the amendment and
new clause. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>Let me scotch the idea straight away that the amendment constitutes some
sort of Conservative get-out, to water down the Bill, as the Minister
said, or to let the Government off the hook, as the hon. Member for
Northavon said. It is nothing of the kind. Clauses 2 to 5 remain in the
Bill&#151;they have not been amended and Conservative Members have
not proposed to take them out. Our attempt is purely to get appropriate
targets&#151;the right targets&#151;in the Bill, so that we drive
policy in the right direction and get the correct balance between
symptoms and
causes.</div><a name="09102777000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principle definition that we use is shifting people from below 60 per
cent. of median income to just above. An analogy that I often use is
that if one of us were to knock on the door of a home in our
constituency and find a family in which income had moved from 58 per
cent. of median to 61 per cent., Ministers would claim that that was a
family taken out of poverty. They would be correct in a purely
statistical sense&#151;that is what would have been achieved
according to the Government terms. However, if we sat down and spent
some time with that family, we would probably be told that, yes, they
did have a bit more money, which was important and for which they were
grateful, but that the deep-seated problems that led to ongoing
difficulties in their lives were still there. New clause 3 and
amendment 59 try to deal with the
issue.</div><a name="09102777000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
make a further point to the Minister, in 1987 the rate of child poverty
was 23 per cent., as it was in 2007, the last year for which we have
figures. Over a 20-year period the rate has not shifted much, so it is
time for a new approach. I shall seek to divide the Committee on
amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000408"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I beg to move amendment 21, in
clause 1, page 1, line 11, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3) The
Secretary of State shall also ensure that interim targets for child
poverty are met in relation to the United Kingdom in the financial year
beginning with 1 April 2015, where such interim targets are specified
by the Child Poverty
Commission.&#146;.</div><a name="09102777000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to put into the Bill an interim target, which is
halfway between now and the target date or, alternatively,
three-quarters of the way from when the promise was first made about 10
years ago. Given the length of our previous debate, I shall endeavour
both to be brief and to encompass any remarks that I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>might otherwise have made on a clause stand part debate, which may be a
position shared across the Committee.</div>
<a name="09102777000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the 2015
targets and why we might want them, one of the worries about where we
are in 2009-10 is the economic situation. We will be going through a
difficult five-year period, when the public finances will be in a mess
and we may even have legislation to put them on an even keel, so it
will be hard to make much progress in the next five years, frankly.
When there was, on the face of it, plenty of spare Government
cash&#151;we can debate whether there was&#151;it was relatively
straightforward, when the economy was growing rapidly and things looked
good, to find money to boost tax credits. Even in those halcyon days,
as they now seem, we could not meet the targets.</div>
<a name="09102777000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">We missed the
five-year target and we missed the 10-year target by more, so it is not
hard to see that the next five years will be more difficult than the
preceding 10 and, therefore, pro rata we will miss the 15-year
benchmark by even more. One option says, &#147;Well, that
doesn&#146;t matter because the only number that matters is 2020.
We&#146;re going to have rolling reports and the child poverty
commission will tell us how we are getting on and there will be
pressure to keep on track, so we don&#146;t need to worry.&#148; It
is true, obviously, that we have not had a child poverty commission for
the past 10 years, so we have not had that external discipline. The
worry is that the momentum, such as we have had bearing in mind that
child poverty has risen for the past two years, will be lost
irreparably in the next five
years.</div><a name="09102777000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
may get to 2015 even further behind schedule and it will have become
impossible to hit the 2020 target. At that point, the legitimate
concern about the Bill as a whole becomes relevant: if we do not have
the interim target to keep us on track, we run the risk of running
round pulling the only lever available to us, which is income transfer.
In a sense, that is a comment for a stand part debate. One reason for a
2015 target is to say, &#147;We need to act now to deliver in
2015&#148;, so we do not get to 2015, miss the target, have no
enforcement mechanism and realise that the only thing that we can do is
rely on cash transfers, which, although a very important part of the
mix, are clearly not the whole story. We have just had that
debate.</div><a name="09102777000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2015 target is a valuable interim target. The Minister may say that the
Secretary of State will give us three-year strategies reflecting on
progress to date, and the child poverty commission will tell us, advise
us and do all the rest. That would have some force if we felt that the
child poverty commission had real clout. Obviously, we will debate in
greater detail the clout of the child poverty commission, but it is
relevant here because I am concerned that it is a weak institution
compared with other analogous bodies, such as the Low Pay
Commission&#151;the minimum wage recommendations of which Governments
have great difficulty ignoring&#151;and the Committee on Climate
Change, which has had a huge influence already and even before it
existed had a huge influence in shadow form. The child poverty
commission will be 14 people meeting four times a year, plus two
members of staff and a hired meeting room. That is it. The idea that it
will hold a Government to account for what the regulatory impact
assessment says is &#163;400 billion of spending over 10 years is
implausible. We need a body with more teeth.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div><a name="09102777000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
gives us a binding interim target. What that should be is clearly a
separate question. There is an argument that it should not be half the
distance between here and there, because some investments are longer
term and will yield fruits later in the decade, but we need to be
explicit and transparent. That argument could become a great get-out
clause for the next Government, who could say, &#147;We&#146;ve
sown all the seeds but you will not see the fruit till 2018 or 2019, so
don&#146;t worry about the fact that we are miles away from our
target in 2015, it&#146;ll be okay.&#148; If we can do all those
things by 2020 but they will not flower by 2015, let us be explicit,
transparent and
accountable.</div><a name="09102777000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
sum up, we have not had a statutory target hitherto. The Bill gives us
one at the end of the period, but we will not know if that has been
achieved until 2022 or some time, so the worry is that we have no real
toothy accountability.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000409"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> For those who support this approach to tackling
child poverty, I can see the logic of having an interim target.
However, the hon. Gentleman keeps talking about teeth and enforcement
mechanisms. As far as I can see, as a sceptic and cynic on the matter,
it will simply show that the child poverty commission can do nothing
and that the Government will fail. If they do fail on an interim
target, what teeth does he
propose?</div>
<a name="09102777000314"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09102777000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000410"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The Bill itself is the teeth. It would be a breach
of a statutory duty if the 2015 target is not met, and the legal remedy
that will apply in 2020&#151;judicial review&#151;would apply in
2015.</div><a name="09102777000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000411"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a very strong case. He
raises the concern that without an interim target we will get to 2018
and will have to pull the only lever available, which is income
transfers. What is to prevent us, if his amendment is accepted, from
finding ourselves in that position in 2014? Given the problems we are
likely to face over the next five years with the state of the public
finances, will we not find in 2014 that we are in exactly the position
that he is trying to avoid in
2018-19?</div><a name="09102777000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000412"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The straight answer to that is that I have a feeling
this is a lever that will need pulling long and hard and consistently.
It is difficult to see how we can deliver on 2015 without significant
action on tax credits and benefit levels. We will not achieve these
goals in 2020 if we lose momentum on that very specific point. Clearly
the strategy has to be a mixture of transfers and tackling the causes
in the longer term, but my worry is that without this interim target,
the whole defence will be that everything is long term and investment.
The argument will be that although there are no such signs and child
poverty may even have risen, we should not worry because all this stuff
has been done for the long term.</div>
<a name="09102777000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">My argument essentially is that
we are not going to deliver on 2020 without significant action on
income transfers, which is one of the shorter-term things we
need to do. If we allow the real value, relative to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>60 per cent. of median income, of tax credits and benefits to
fall back, which is a real danger, we may as well kiss goodbye to 2020.
In a sense, part of 2015 is keeping the momentum and pressure up and
not taking our foot off the gas. That is essentially where we are
coming from. The amendment is straightforward and transparent. It tries
to make sure that we hit 2020. It reinforces what the Government are
trying to do by making sure we do not take our foot off the gas, and by
being transparent. If we think the profile is going to be other than
even to 2020, it requires Governments to say why and to do something
about
it.</div><a name="09102777000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000413"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> As the hon. Member for Northavon said, we can be
briefer in this debate. I understand the logic of what he proposes. We
have had five-yearly targets and milestones, as the Minister described
them last week, since the original 1999 pledge. We have 2005 and 2010.
It would therefore seem logical to have another five-year sequence.
However, I draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to clause 13,
under which annual reports will be made to Parliament by the Secretary
of State concerning all the relevant progress that has been made in
meeting the targets in clauses 2 to 5. I expect those to be fairly
robust occasions on which the Government will be challenged. The child
poverty lobby groups will not miss those opportunities to be vociferous
about what they would like to see done to meet the ultimate 2020
target. I am reassured by what is in the Bill, because in this new
environment we will have the annual report from the Secretary of State,
which will put us in a different situation from the present
one.</div><a name="09102777000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000414"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Member for Northavon made an important
point about the need to scrutinise progress rigorously and to make sure
we are on track to meet our 2020 targets, but much of what I will say
has been anticipated in his remarks and those of the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire.</div>
<a name="09102777000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8
requires the Secretary of State to publish a strategy every three
years, to set out the progress intended over that three-year period in
each of the policy areas specified in subsection (5), and to describe
the progress needed over that period to meet the 2020 targets. In that
way, the strategy will set milestones to 2020. Clause 8(1) sets out
that the first child poverty strategy needs to be published within a
year of Royal Assent of the
Bill.</div><a name="09102777000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire rightly pointed out that clause
13 requires the Secretary of State to publish annual progress reports.
They will show progress towards the milestones set out in the strategy,
and towards the strategy&#146;s aims. Clause 13(5) requires that when
a strategy is not fully implemented, the annual report must describe
the respects in which it has not been implemented and give the reasons
why. There will, therefore, be a high degree of accountability for
progress towards
2020.</div><a name="09102777000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
process of setting milestones needs to be linked to the strategy. If we
set interim milestones in isolation from the strategy, that would be
inconsistent with our approach. For example, the strategy ought to
focus, first, on the longest acting policy levers, and the hon. Member
for Northavon accepted that that would not give a linear trajectory on
income to 2020. Alternatively, the strategy could focus on those with
the greatest need, which would not give a linear trajectory either. It
is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>important, as was reflected on Second Reading, that accountability for
setting targets and monitoring progress remain with Ministers
answerable to Parliament. The commission, through its advice on the
development of the strategy, will inform the interim milestones set out
in the strategy. We are keen to ensure that the Bill requires proper
scrutiny and proper accountability for progress, which is already
provided through what is set out on the strategy and annual reports. On
that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Northavon does not press
his
amendment.</div><a name="09102777000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000415"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Both the Minister and the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire have a touching faith in the power of annual reports to
Parliament. I suspect that there are hundreds if not thousands of such
reports by all manner of Government bodies, all of which we scrutinise
thoroughly, all of which regularly occupy the front pages of our
newspapers and all of which we are regularly asked about on the
doorstep and held to account for&#151;not. I suspect that this would
be just another annual report from just another
body.</div><a name="09102777000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all know how difficult it is to get the media interested in poverty.
When poverty is debated in the House a set of us are there, but we are
not a majority. Poverty is not a subject that gets the pulses of the
majority racing, and I fear that if we do not put some real teeth into
this, it will just be yet another report that Parliament nods at:
perhaps there will be a bit of a flurry for three hours in a desultory
session in Westminster Hall, and then the world moves on. British
children deserve rather better than that. To be fair to the hon. Member
for South-West Bedfordshire, I can understand why a party that aspires
to be in government between 2010 and 2015 does not want tough targets
for 2015; if I were in his position, I am sure I would say exactly the
same.</div><a name="09102777000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000416"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I take it from that that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party does not aspire to be in government in that
period.</div><a name="09102777000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000417"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> On the contrary, we aspire not only to be in
government but to be held to account for those
targets.</div><a name="09102777000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister says that the trajectory is non-linear. I am sure he is
right&#151;reverse, in fact, is the current gear. He is probably
right that if the targets were to be deliverable they would not be
deliverable in a straight line. It would be good if the Government
were&#151;not even forced by my amendment&#151;to be explicit about
how much progress they think is likely by halfway through, and about
the balance between short and long-term measures. The amendment would
have forced that, but I will not pursue it. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09102777000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
2</h4><a name="09102777000007"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">The
relative low income
target</div><a name="09102777000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000418"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I beg to move amendment 22, in
clause 2, page 1, line 13, leave
out &#145;10&#146; and insert &#145;5&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div><a name="09102777000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now move to
targets and start with the relative low income target, which for a long
time has been an internationally standard definition of poverty. There
are always arguments concerning the principle that, as the economy
grows so the poverty line rises, but in my view the poverty line should
rise when economies grow. If the living standards of the majority are
going up, then what it means to be poor goes up. If everyone in the
class but us can go on a trip, or everyone in the class but us can
afford the latest trainers for their children, that is a moving target
and it should be a moving target. The fact is that the relative income
target under clause 2 is entirely welcome and allows for international
comparisons.</div><a name="09102777000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then
comes the question of how many children should be below the target.
Ideally it would be nil, but in reality children will be living in
households below 60 per cent. of the median. The day after a
person loses his job, the chances are that he will be below the poverty
line. That might be transient, and we will come to other measures that
try to pick that up, but at any point there will be a frictional level
of poverty in unemployment terms. How low is frictional? The purpose of
our amendment is to point out that 10 per cent. is unduly unambitious,
especially for a Bill whose long title states:</div>
<a name="09102777000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Set
targets relating to the eradication of child
poverty&#148;.</div><a name="09102777000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time a week or two back, the Prime
Minister referred to eradication of child poverty. It was an entirely
unqualified phrase and anyone hearing him would have assumed that child
poverty would be eradicated. They might be rather surprised to discover
from the Bill that a million children in child poverty would count as
eradication. My mental arithmetic is not great, but I reckon that about
1,500 children in each constituency living in poverty would be
described as eradication. I accept that 5 per cent. is not eradication
either, but we must recognise that there will always be some transient
child poverty, so if we are to use such language&#151;as the
Government clearly are&#151;we need to be as close as possible to
what the public will understand us to
mean.</div><a name="09102777000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000419"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> In support of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
the &#147;Oxford English Dictionary&#148; says that
&#147;eradicate&#148; means to eliminate completely. Therefore, it
is absolutely inappropriate for the Prime Minister or other Ministers
to say that the Bill will eradicate child poverty when clearly, as it
is now constituted, it will
not.</div><a name="09102777000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000420"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I was wondering
whether to amend the long title to &#147;Set targets relating to the
substantial reduction of&#148;, but I might split an infinitive and I
do not want to do
that.</div><a name="09102777000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the figure is not to be 10 per cent., what should it be? We have often
asked ourselves what was in Tony Blair&#146;s mind when he suggested
that he wanted to abolish child poverty. As was famously said when
somebody died, what did he mean by that? At the time when he made his
pledge, countries in Europe had much lower rates of child poverty. I
pray in aid Finland&#151;as the Minister might expect me to
do&#151;because for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998, it had a child
poverty rate of 5 per cent. It is indeed true that no country in the
European Union now has a 5 per cent. child poverty rate. The rate in
Finland has doubled to 10 per cent. and the United Kingdom figure for
2007 was a shameful 23 per cent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div><a name="09102777000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
getting the figure down to 10 per cent. would be huge progress and
entirely laudable, but it would certainly not be eradication and nor is
it as bold as we should wish to be. The Government said that they chose
the figure of 10 per cent. because that was about as good as they could
get, and it is the lowest sustainable level that modern European
countries could achieve. However, the Finnish figures of 5 per cent., 5
per cent., 5 per cent., 7 per cent., and 6 per cent. for a five-year
period were much lower. Surely, if we are to set a target for 2020,
which in a political context is a long-term target, we should be bold.
We should not plan for failure, but I would rather narrowly miss a 5
per cent. child poverty target than comfortably hit a 10 per cent.
target.</div><a name="09102777000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000421"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I agree in general with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, but, given our discussion and understanding
of the perverse outcomes of the Bill, as constituted, I am surprised
that he has not tabled an amendment that would set 5 per cent. for
2030. The focus would be on aiming to reduce over time, but,
absolutely, staying on the deep-rooted causes as well as the immediate
financial issue, whoever was in
Government.</div><a name="09102777000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09102777000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000422"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> If the Minister&#146;s response was, &#147;All
right, we&#146;ll take 5 per cent., but we&#146;ll do it in
2030&#148;, I would probably accept and be happy with that. However,
the question then is how quickly we can tackle
that.</div><a name="09102777000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth reflecting on how quickly the numbers went up. We have had a
staggering rewriting of history by the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire, who conveniently chooses 1987 as a base year. On another
measure, child poverty rose from 1.7 million in 1979 to 3.4 million in
1997&#151;to pick a year at random&#151;so 1.7 million
children were added to child poverty in 18 years. The
Government target is just over 1 million, so we would be trying to take
slightly more than that number out in the following 13 or so
years&#151;essentially bringing the rate down about as fast as it
rose, which is a
challenge.</div><a name="09102777000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Five
per cent. may be a better target for further on, although one of the
problems with child poverty targets is that we have whole generations
going through. If we do not hit 5 per cent. by 2020, the children of
2020 will&#151;strangely&#151;be 10 years older by 2030 and their
whole childhood will have been affected. As I said, we do not want to
legislate for failure, but the political imperative of a 5 per cent.
target is very different from a 10 per cent. target. A 10 per cent.
target would require some serious effort, but a 5 per cent. target
would make for a real hands-on, headline-grabbing target for
Government&#151;every Minister would be called in and asked,
&#147;What are you doing about it?&#148; That target would seize
Government as an objective far more, because it is so
demanding.</div><a name="09102777000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
level of child poverty is shocking&#151;that is why we have the Bill
that we have. It is true that no one else is doing much&#151;I see
that the Danes were on 9 per cent in 2007, so it is possible even in
the present circumstances to reach such figures. However, with a
10-year run at it, it ought to be possible to be much more ambitious.
I commend the amendment to the
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div><a name="09102777000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000423"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming
from with his amendment. I am completely with him on what he and my
hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness properly pointed
out: eradication does not equal 10 per cent. A more honest long title
for the Bill would refer to a substantial reduction or to moving UK
child poverty levels to the best currently achievable in Europe, which
is clearly what the Government seek to do. The Government are stuck
with &#147;eradication&#148;&#151;they have kept the word, which
has entered the public consciousness, and moved the target. I have the
brief from the End Child Poverty campaign, which talks about 1.3
million children who could be left in relative income poverty in
2010&#151;the hon. Member for Northavon mentioned 1
million.</div><a name="09102777000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
said, I do not support the amendment for a number of reasons. I
remember a debate in Westminster Hall on such issues some years ago,
when my parliamentary neighbour, a Labour MP, the hon. Member for
Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), said that it was a nonsense to talk
about eradication and that if the United Kingdom had a target to
achieve the best levels of child poverty, or the lowest levels that
were achievable in Europe, that would be more honest and something that
we could genuinely aim
for.</div><a name="09102777000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon quoted some statistics. I shall quote a few,
briefly, from the Government document, &#147;Ending child poverty:
making it happen&#148;. At the moment the best level of child poverty
in Europe is in Denmark, at 10 per cent., the next best being Finland
on 11 per cent.&#151;a large rise from the figures that the hon.
Gentleman was talking about. Those figures were from 2007. If we go
back two years to 2005, the best rate achieved anywhere in Europe was
in Sweden, at a rate of 9 per cent. If we go back to 2001, we have two
countries, Denmark and Sweden, achieving 7 per cent., which is a little
nearer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s 5 per cent. The plain facts of the
matter are that in both 2005 and 2007, the best figure in Europe was
around 9, 10 or 11 per cent.</div>
<a name="09102777000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have my own
personal philosophy in politics&#151;one can be attacked both ways.
One can be attacked for not being sufficiently ambitious and for being
apparently satisfied with leaving 1.3 million children in poverty,
which I do not believe a single member of the Committee would be.
Alternatively, one can adopt another philosophy, which is my own as far
as politics is concerned, to try to under-promise and over-deliver. I
say to the hon. Member for Northavon that there are a number of reasons
why politicians are held in low regard by members of the public,
including the fact that sometimes our promises and aspirations are very
big&#151;perhaps a bit too big&#151;and we fail in their delivery.
I would rather take a more cautious approach. We would cut the current
rate of 23 per cent. by more than half if we got to 10 per
cent. That would not be good enough&#151;of course I would like to go
further. However, if we are putting something in law, there is merit in
the Government&#146;s approach of saying, &#147;Let&#146;s try to
achieve the best levels that are currently achievable in
Europe&#148;, notwithstanding that every single member of the
Committee would like to go further and make sure that no children are
left in relative income poverty.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000424"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> What we want in the Bill are targets for child
poverty that are ambitious but realistic, and clause 2 defines the
target that less than 10 per cent. of children will be living in
relative low-income poverty. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>Under the Bill, that target must be met by 2020, but it must be
maintained beyond that date, rather than being a momentary effect in
2020. We want it to be sustained permanently, and schedule 2 sets out
that aim. That is a very stretching target, but it is one that
international evidence suggests can be achieved. The hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire is right that 10 per cent. would be a dramatic
improvement on what we have seen in the UK for a long time. It would be
the lowest achieved in the UK since records began in
1961.</div><a name="09102777000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
comparison with other European countries is very telling. The hon.
Member for Northavon was right about Finland achieving 5 per cent. in
1996, 1997 and 1998, but, as the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire pointed out, at the moment, the level of child poverty in
Finland is above 10 per cent., so the evidence suggests that, while one
can sometimes achieve 5 per cent., that figure has not been sustained
over time and we need a target that can be
sustained.</div>
<a name="09102777000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000425"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I hope that I can make an intervention that helps
the Minister&#146;s argument. We heard from the Institute for Fiscal
Studies in the evidence sessions that its estimate on the basis of
current policies was that by 2020, if nothing changed, the relative
child poverty level would again be above 3 million. Does the Minister
accept that projection?</div>
<a name="09102777000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000426"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I have seen something along those lines from the
IFS. It is certainly right that with the way the world economy has been
in recent years, and probably will be for a while yet, the natural
tendency if one does nothing is for the numbers to go up. Holding it
steady requires action. Reducing it on the scale at which we are aiming
requires substantial action, hence the importance of the Bill. Echoing
what the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire said, and according to
the most recent data that I have seen, Denmark is the only European
country where child poverty is as low as 10 per cent. In other
Scandinavian countries and elsewhere in Europe, it is
higher.</div><a name="09102777000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside
the relative low-income target that we are discussing, there are
targets for absolute low income, combined low income, material
deprivation and persistent poverty. By setting four targets, we are
recognising the need for a comprehensive and challenging definition of
success and the need to measure progress and drive action against
different facets of poverty. The duty to meet the targets is absolute,
and the only way to change them would be to repeal the
legislation.</div><a name="09102777000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with the amendment is that it fails the credibility test, as
the hon. Member for Northavon probably recognises. In questioning me in
the evidence session a week ago, he expressed scepticism about the
achievability of a target of 10 per cent. I do not know whether it was
for rhetorical effect, but it was the view that he expressed. Given
that scepticism, it is difficult to see how he supports making the
target twice as demanding, as he does in his
amendment.</div><a name="09102777000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want a tough target&#151;that is absolutely right&#151;but not an
impossible one, as that is useless. If we go into this with everyone
saying that the target is impossible and that no country in Europe has
ever managed to reach it, it will be a much less effective target than
one we can argue is achievable. All of us want the legislation to work,
and on that basis, I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw his
amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div><a name="09102777000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000427"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I like to think that politics is the art of the
possible. What people are despondent about regarding their politicians
is the opposite of what the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
said: the paucity of vision; the fact that we do not dream dreams that
are exciting and motivating; the fact that we are all a shade of
vanilla; the suggestion that we should have cautious targets and not go
too far, but rather over-deliver, under-promise and go to the
electorate with a slightly cagey approach because they have been let
down so often in the
past.</div><a name="09102777000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
this sort of amendment would achieve is a bold vision. The Minister
said that it has not been done before, which obviously people said when
man had not been on the Moon. What about a bit of vision? What about a
bit of boldness? Many people will find puzzling the idea that it is not
possible to sustain &#147;only&#148; 650,000 children in poverty in
this country, that it is an unattainable and unrealistic dream and that
we cannot legislate on that basis. Just to accept that there must
always be two thirds of a million children in poverty seems a bit
disappointing, to say the least.</div>
<a name="09102777000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I do
not sense a groundswell of support in the Committee, so I beg to ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000430"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> It is a great pleasure to be here under your

Ministers in charge of the Bill, because it is the first time that
there have been specific requirements for housing for children. I
recognise that, and pay a great tribute to
them.</div><a name="09102777000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of my purposes in tabling the amendments is to beef up the provision:
to take it from what I call the undergrowth that lies behind the Bill
and put it on the face of the Bill. I would also like some reassurance
from Ministers about what the intentions are and how the provisions on
material deprivation should be treated if, in future years, there are
efforts to use such provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>to improve housing for children. Of course, comments made in Committee
and recorded in <i class="I">Hansard</i> can be used in legal interpretations in
court regarding what should happen to children in bad housing. I am
looking for some specific assurances, and I have raised some of these
issues with Ministers

reasons why the amendments are necessary is the lack of clarity about
exactly what is intended with some of the housing provisions in that
undergrowth behind the Bill. Although the list of 21 items
that are regarded as contributing to material deprivation contains a
number that relate to housing and children, they do not sit very high
in the legislative hierarchy. I thought that material deprivation
indicators would be in the regulations. However, looking at some of the
support papers, there is a policy statement for them. The list of 21
goods and services, which has apparently been used for some time and is
cited in the documents, are</div>
<a name="09102777000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;currently being
updated...to ensure that the list of items used reflect
contemporary standards of living. That is why a statement of policy
intent has been provided rather than draft regulations.&#148;
</div><a name="09102777000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
very helpful to have some assurances on that.</div>
<a name="09102777000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, in the needs
assessment regulations that are due to come in next year, assuming the
legislation is passed, the reference to what local authorities should
be doing on housing also seems to be slack, as it mentions an
assessment of the role of housing, transport and other services
provided by the local authority or partner authorities and the impact
that that has on child poverty. That seems to be a very slight
reference to implementing something that is very important for child
poverty and for children living in poverty. There is no dispute at all
about the importance of housing to children and to poor households.
There is no dispute at all about the fact that it is absolutely right
that housing should be one of the factors listed under material
deprivation.</div>
<a name="09102777000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
&#147;Every Child Matters&#148;&#151;the basic document that
started a lot of the Government&#146;s reforms on children&#146;s
policy&#151;homelessness was listed above unemployment as the prime
risk factor for children. It could just as well have been housing
conditions, because homeless families live in bed-and-breakfast
accommodation and so on. There was a real failure, in the early stages
of Every Child Matters, to operationalise the risk factor that
homelessness and poor housing created for children. The efforts to do
so, by having joint protocols for the local authorities that cater for
children&#151;the county councils and the district
councils&#151;have not worked and I have tabled amendments so that
that can be considered later.</div>
<a name="09102777000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we look at
the concerns about poor housing and its impact on poor children, there
is a knock-on effect&#151;for example, children have to have
somewhere to do their homework. In the list of priorities, I was
surprised that under the items of material deprivation from the
child&#146;s point of view, there is nothing about having somewhere
to do homework. There is a wonderful provision stating that the child
should be able to have</div>
<a name="09102777000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;friends round
for tea or a snack once a fortnight.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div><a name="09102777000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">For disorganised mothers
who work, that is quite a challenge. Obviously, if someone is going to
visit like that, the child has to have a home to bring them to. For a
lot of poor children today, the material deprivation is compounded by
the fact that they simply do not have a home to which they can take a
friend back for tea. Housing has to take priority over a number of
other factors of material deprivation, which is why I have tabled an
amendment stating that that should be in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09102777000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other bits of legislation that deal with issues relating to housing;
for example, homelessness legislation and the decent homes standard.
The commitment in the list of items of material deprivation that I
would like to include in the Bill, concerns overcrowding from the
child&#146;s point of view. There should be</div>
<a name="09102777000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;enough bedrooms
for every child of 10 or over to share their bedroom only with siblings
of the same sex.&#148;</div>
<a name="09102777000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a wonderful
commitment. It would be nice to have that in the Bill, instead of
tucked away in a list, the status of which is unclear and which is
being revised. That is a whole new standard of overcrowding, which my
hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North
and I have never seen in any of the discussions that we have had over
the years. It is far adrift from the standard picture in other
legislation, which is based on the 1935 standards of overcrowding.
Civil servants never realise that the definition of overcrowding that
they say that local authorities have is an allocation policy; it is not
a transfer policy. That affects many families up and down the country.
A couple with a baby will be given a one-bedroom flat, but when the
baby grows up and the couple have two or three children, they cannot
get moved, because there is nothing to say that that family is
overcrowded.</div>
<a name="09102777000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000431"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> My hon. Friend has been a champion of this cause for
many years. As the representative of a constituency where it is common
for families of six to share one bedroom, I accept everything she says.
She is right to talk about the complicated standards that apply and the
failure to get them on to a proper, consistent footing. Does she agree
that the weakness now is that it is impossible to enforce action
against landlords, including social landlords, who do not take action
to deal with overcrowding, because there are potentially three
different standards: the bedroom standard, the 1935 standard and the
housing health and safety rating system? All of those apply, which
leaves people in a state of chaos as to how to measure and tackle
overcrowding.</div><a name="09102777000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000432"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> That is correct, which is why one of the
assurances that I seek is on the precedence that the new standard takes
over all the other standards, so that people can be clear about what
they are entitled to and what children can expect. Another part of the
muddle about standards is that, although we have been successful in
campaigning for recognition that regulations should be introduced to
improve the 1935 standard, those regulations have never happened, so we
are in limbo. I hope that the Minister will clarify the
situation.</div><a name="09102777000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000433"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Like the hon. Member for Regent&#146;s Park and
Kensington, North, I pay tribute to the hon. Lady for her focus on this
important subject. What response has she had from Ministers over the
years? In the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>13th year of this Labour Government, we still have the 1935
standard. I agree with her that that is disgraceful. What response has
she had&#151;not necessarily from Treasury Ministers&#151;to her
representations asking for a new standard to guarantee decent
housing?</div>
<a name="09102777000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000434"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I was once a Housing Minister and I could not get
it changed either. The problem represents a Faustian pact between local
authorities and central Government, because overcrowding is probably
the most explosive housing issue, as it is the most expensive to
resolve. Problems are also increasing: there are about 70,000 more
overcrowded families now. After all the pressure, it has been possible
to get a commitment to introduce regulations. There have also been some
pilot programmes and a survey that showed that the biggest overcrowding
problems in any constituency are in the East Ham constituency of my
right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. It is an
extraordinarily difficult
problem.</div><a name="09102777000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
group of us, including my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s
Park and Kensington, North, have been able to achieve glacial progress,
but the biggest progress of all would be if the bedroom standard,
which, dare one say, is on the material deprivation wish list, was
included in the Bill. That would transform the situation in an
extraordinary
fashion.</div><a name="09102777000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000435"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I hope you will allow me to pursue this point,
Mr. Key. As a former Housing Minister, the hon. Lady is
entirely the appropriate person to ask about the issue. There are two
ways of ensuring decent housing for children: one is, as she said,
through standards; the other is through house building. As a former
Housing Minister, perhaps she can tell us why it is that, during every
year of this Labour Government, fewer affordable housing units have
been built than in any year of the era of either Mrs.
Thatcher or John Major. I am not trying to apportion blame. I am
genuinely confused about why so few houses have been built during the
past 12 or 13
years.</div><a name="09102777000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000436"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am keen that the debate should not get
too wide. However, the hon. Gentleman is in good company because I too
was once a Housing Minister, so I am very interested in
this.</div><a name="09102777000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000437"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I should not have mentioned that I was a Housing
Minister. One of the problems is that the incentives in the grant
system have, until now, encouraged the building of smaller units. That
is a big problem because there is simply not a sufficient number of
substantial family units at a time when people&#146;s expectations
are increasing. Public expectations are exactly in line with what is in
the list: if they have children over 10, people expect that they should
have a separate bedroom. As well as the numbers, the size of housing
units being built is also an issue. That partly relates to the
incentives and grant
system.</div><a name="09102777000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
underline how out of date our standards are, I noted a couple of points
made during the 1935 debate, when a Labour MP, Arthur Greenwood
said:</div><a name="09102777000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s standards as regards overcrowding are not
standards which are tolerable in the twentieth century. He contemplates
as a normal thing that living rooms should be used as bedrooms. I can

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000438"></a>Ms

experienced the problem in her constituency. Registered social

against overcrowding cases on the grounds that they should be allowed
to insist that members of the family sleep in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000439"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I have indeed had plenty of such cases. The only
reason why not so many people are required to sleep in kitchens now is
because many flats and houses do not have kitchens; instead, they have
little kitchenettes and a combined living and dining room. That is the
only saving grace that has stopped a lot of families from having to
sleep in

material deprivation standard in the Bill will transform all that
absolutely, which is why it is so important. The Bill will make it
possible for children over 10 to have bedrooms of their own. One can
understand why that is such a controversial thing to say. My hon.
Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North is absolutely
right to say that the biggest increase in overcrowding is in social
rented housing, where the state sets the standards. That is where the
biggest problem is. We need to change that, so that the poorest
families and children get something better.</div>
<a name="09102777000317"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="09102777000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to go on too long, but I have a few questions. In
particular, I ask my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to give
some commitments, as <i class="I">Hansard</i> is important in interpreting
legislation, and what he says can be used in court. First, what is
included as a bedroom in the bedroom standard envisaged in the Bill?
Until now, a sitting room or a kitchen that was big enough could be a
bedroom, which has made it almost impossible for any family to be
deemed statutorily 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>overcrowded. As I understand it&#151;perhaps my right hon. Friend will
confirm this&#151;the intention behind the proposals is that a
bedroom that is de-designated as a bedroom by the people who live in
the property cannot be counted as a bedroom. That changes what the
family are entitled to.</div>
<a name="09102777000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give
an example. I am not trying to test your patience, Mr. Key.
We need to give some concrete examples; otherwise, it sounds like we
are just having a theoretical debate. I became interested in
overcrowding as a result of my first experience as a councillor in
London. I had been involved in housing in South Africa, where I had
gone around the townships. I had seen plenty of township houses where
the kitchen, although big enough to sleep in, was used as a
kitchen/dining room, and where there was also a living room and two
bedrooms. I ran a housing project that built three bunk beds in one of
the bedrooms. With two children in each bed, and the two parents in the
other bedroom, a family of six children and two adults could sleep
reasonably comfortably in a four-roomed house.</div>
<a name="09102777000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
councillor in this country, I went into a council flat that was
supposed to have three bedrooms. The family comprised six children and
two adults. They had retained the one sitting room; they had a
kitchenette and they had turned one of the bedrooms into a dining room.
When I went into one of the remaining bedrooms, I was astonished to see
that there were three bunk beds up the wall, with two children in each
one. The parents had the other bedroom.</div>
<a name="09102777000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The council
said that the family were not overcrowded, because they could use the
dining room as a bedroom, which is what it was meant to be. The family
said no, because they had turned it from a bedroom into a dining room.
If the family says, perfectly reasonably, that they are de-designating
a bedroom and turning it into a second living room because they need
the space, will that be regarded as permanent or as a wilful misuse of
the space, which is what happened in the case of the family that I
met?</div>
<a name="09102777000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
under the bedroom standard, people are paired off: the married couple
is paired off and has one room; children of the same sex over 10 can be
paired off and have a bedroom; for the younger children, different
arrangements can be made, with those of different genders in one room.
Will the pairings be decided by the family? Will the pairing of the
couple sharing a bedroom be regarded as permanent? I ask that because
if a couple who have a boy and a girl in their early teens and who are
living in a one-bedroomed flat with a sitting room tell their housing
officer that they do not want their children to share a bedroom,
because they are past the age of puberty and that is not
proper&#151;a lot of people think that&#151;the housing officer
will tell them that the father can share a bedroom with the son and the
mother can share a bedroom with the daughter. That will be how they are
supposed to live. The idea that the couple can share a bedroom is not
accepted: the family are not seen as overcrowded and they just have to
make do.</div>
<a name="09102777000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I once tried
to explain that to a family&#151;I only tried it only, and we got
only part way through the discussion. The situation was not helped by
the fact that the family was from a culture with different attitudes
towards sharing bedrooms. They did not appreciate the fact that it is
not accepted in Britain that a married couple 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>should be entitled to share a bedroom. I have never again tried to
explain that to any constituent. I want an assurance from my right hon.
Friend on what is a pair. I also want an assurance, in relation to the
bedroom standard, about what happens to a child under one, because at
present they do not count at all. I also want to know what happens to a
child under 10, because it implies in the Bill that two can share a
room whereas, under our present overcrowding standards four can share a
room, I think. We need to be absolutely clear about what happens,
because it is children under 10 and under one who are important for
child poverty. I want to know what space allocations they are expected
to have.</div>
<a name="09102777000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
the list covers sharing a house with a disabled adult but not with a
disabled child. I want to know what happens and whether there are any
guarantees on having, not just a play area but a stairlift if the child
is disabled.</div>
<a name="09102777000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is the question of precedence. I want to know what precedence the
standards in the undergrowth of the Bill have over other bits of
legislation. Otherwise, we have a wish list that will not be enforced
because it is just that: a wish list. I will try not to test your
patience, Mr. Key, but I have an example of why precedence
is so important.</div>
<a name="09102777000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had a
constituent with three children. She had been in prison for stabbing
her partner. The children were all aged under three and they lived in a
two-bedroomed flat. The pressures were made worse by her having another
baby. Even after meetings with my right hon. Friend&#146;s colleague,
the Minister in the Lords in charge of child protection, it was
impossible to find a piece of legislation that put any pressure on the
Liberal Democrat local authority to re-house that family. There was no
money going in to the family so they were in absolute poverty. The
material deprivation was clearly profound but there was no possibility
of tackling the child poverty and material deprivation suffered by that
family by getting them moved.</div>
<a name="09102777000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless the
standards in the Bill are given priority over other standards, we will
not be able to tackle one of the real drivers of hardship and suffering
among children. Children cannot bring friends home for tea if&#151;as
in one case in my constituency&#151;their 15-year-old brother is
autistic and spends all his time walking up and down the living room.
They cannot get their homework done or bring friends home if they have
to share a bedroom with two siblings. If we are to tackle child poverty
and the material deprivation that poor families suffer, it is important
that the wonderful standards set down in the list are made enforceable
by law. I ask my right hon. Friend to give clear assurances on how the
standards are to be regarded, how they are to be treated and what
priority they are to have over other overcrowding standards, including
the statutory one, which was bad 75 years ago and is completely
unacceptable
today.</div><a name="09102777000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000440"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The Committee owes a debt of gratitude to the hon.
Member for Northampton, North for her remarks. She is clearly very
knowledgeable on the subject and I will listen with great interest to
the Minister. He is a Treasury Minister, so I hope he has a good brief
from the Department for Communities and Local Government in his pack
when he comes to answer the hon. Lady&#146;s specific
points.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div><a name="09102777000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
grateful to the combined ministerial team for sending a helpful note
yesterday evening that gave the Committee further guidance on the
difference between the bedroom standard and the parts of the material
deprivation measure that relate to housing. The note says
that</div>
<a name="09102777000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the standards
within the material deprivation measure are in fact, quite
tight.&#148;</div><a name="09102777000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not entirely clear about the relationship between the two, so I
would be grateful if the Minister could elaborate on that.</div>
<a name="09102777000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness put his finger on it
earlier when he said that, in basic terms, we are talking about supply
and demand. The bottom line is that there are too many people for the
number of houses. We can solve that in two ways. We can increase the
number of houses or we can look at some of the demand factors, which,
in part, relate to the fact that we are living longer, and to family
breakdown and immigration. They are all part of the mix, so it is a big
policy area. The hon. Lady is absolutely right to raise the
issue&#151;it takes me back to 2001 when she was Housing Minister and
touched on such matters. In fact, the first Bill Committee I ever sat
on as a Back Bencher was when she was a Housing
Minister.</div><a name="09102777000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
last point relates to another area of ministerial responsibility for
the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for
Bishop Auckland. When I think about the decreasing supply in the
private rented sector I relate it to aspects of the local housing
allowance regulations that landlords and tenants up and down the
country say are making life more difficult for families, and reducing
the supply. I do not know whether the Minister can comment on that
aspect of LHA when he replies to the quite proper points made by the
hon. Member for Northampton,
North.</div><a name="09102777000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000441"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I will speak only briefly because the hon. Member
for Northampton, North is very knowledgeable. I congratulate her on
bringing forward the key issue of housing standards. When we consider
child poverty, we have to acknowledge that the vast number of children
living in temporary accommodation is a disgrace. It is one of the worst
things that can blight a child&#146;s prospects, and it is absolutely
right that we discuss it in the context of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09102777000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
raised a couple of issues, to which I hope the Minister will respond
specifically. One is the list of things that count as material
deprivation. There are many good things on it&#151;housing-related
issues, such as separate bedrooms, and on the adult definition, issues
such as keeping the house warm&#151;so housing is already included in
one sense. However, how was the list determined? I hope that the
Minister can give us some more information about that. One of the best
things about the Bill is that it covers material deprivation
literally&#151;in a bricks and mortar sense that the public can
understand. It is not just &#147;60% of median equivalent income
before housing costs&#148;, but, &#147;Can you keep your house
warm?&#148; The lists are excellent, but because they are critical to
the success or failure of the child poverty strategy, we need to know
where they come from and that they command broad public support. One
could think of 100 things that one might put on such a list. Therefore,
my first question is where does this list come from?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div><a name="09102777000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
where does the score of 25 come from? Although 60 per cent. of median
is a bit arbitrary so too is a score of 25 on material deprivation.
Where did that come from? If we are to take account of housing and
various other things, we need to know the basis for it.</div>
<a name="09102777000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
slight suspicion that amendment 17 would have the opposite effect to
what the hon. Lady intended. To count as poor under clause 3, a person
has to tick box (a) and box (b). If they also have to tick box (c) as
well, it becomes harder to be counted as poor. As the Bill stands, if a
child is living below 70 per cent. of median and in material
deprivation, they are poor. However, if we add (c), which would insert
&#147;bad housing conditions&#148; and that child is not badly
housed, we have just taken them out of
poverty&#151;perversely&#151;on that definition. I am sure that is
not what the hon. Lady intended, but that is what amendment 17 would
do.</div>
<a name="09102777000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I very much
support the fact that the hon. Lady has brought the issue of housing to
the fore. It is critical to the well-being of children, but I am not
convinced that this is quite the set of amendments to do it. None the
less, I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response on her key
points.</div><a name="09102777000318"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09102777000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000442"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The point made by the hon. Member for Northavon is
a good one, but I am sure that the purpose in tabling the amendment was
to prompt not only the full and frank Government response we shall
doubtless receive but consideration of other ways of strengthening the
housing element.</div>
<a name="09102777000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make no apology for repeating my congratulations to the hon. Member for
Northampton, North on raising the issue. It is a matter of genuine
bewilderment for me to observe that although one would have thought
that the Labour Government would prioritise housing, they have failed
to do so in pure number terms. As my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Bedfordshire says, whatever regulations are set up, it is a
matter of supply and demand. There either are the houses or there are
not. If there are not the houses, it will be the poor and the
vulnerable who are squeezed out and find themselves in inappropriate
conditions.</div>
<a name="09102777000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even with
regulations in place, if the housing is not available the regulations
will be breached and people will live in unsuitable housing. I
congratulate the hon. Lady but I wonder why she is not joined by more
of her colleagues in putting pressure on Ministers to do more. Fewer
affordable housing units have been built and those that have been built
have been smaller because of regulations brought in by the Government
and because of the grant system. We have fewer and smaller units, and
families with more than one or two children can easily find themselves
living in grossly unsuitable housing&#151;housing that would have
been considered grossly unsuitable by Labour and Conservative MPs in
1935. Now in 2009 the same standards apply and the pressure is
increasing.</div>
<a name="09102777000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000443"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09102777000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000444"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Before I give way to the hon. Lady I should like
to pay tribute to Zacchaeus 2000 and Professor Peter Ambrose&#146;s
briefing paper, &#147;Bad, Getting Worse and Very Expensive&#148;,
on children and overcrowding. That is the situation that we ask
Ministers to respond to today.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div><a name="09102777000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000445"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The argument is getting circular. If we ask about
the level of statutory overcrowding we are told that it is very low. It
is very low because the standards are so bad. I do not point out the
circularity of the argument as an excuse, but as part of the reason why
it is hard to get the point across about the real mischief of
overcrowding.</div><a name="09102777000239"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000446"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I thank the hon. Lady. I agree. I certainly do not
dismiss the importance of regulation but I was supporting the point my
hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire made about supply
and demand. It is incumbent on the Government in such a highly planned
country as the UK to ensure that the system of regulations, and the way
they are applied by local authorities and inspectors from Bristol
pronouncing over the heads of local people, works in a way that matches
housing need with housing supply. There has been a complete failure in
that respect by this Government, which is why things are bad, getting
worse and very expensive, and it is those with the lowest incomes who
pay the
price.</div><a name="09102777000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am bewildered and surprised that more MPs from both sides do not spend
more time experiencing the lives of their constituents and talking to
them about what really bothers them. If they did, there would be more
momentum in this place to insist that changes were made and housing was
supplied.</div>
<a name="09102777000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
has made all the other points that I wanted to make. The kitchen as a
place to sleep&#151;in 2009 it is absurd and grotesque to have people
living in such conditions. It is things like that and the failure to
deliver on them that make me particularly sceptical about the Bill and
its supposed eradication of child poverty and its setting of targets in
statutory form. On the ground fundamental things such as housing are
bad and getting worse. If I were convinced that the Bill would change
overall broad policy to ensure that people on low incomes could access
decent housing I would be much more supportive of
it.</div><a name="09102777000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a tribute to the decency and tolerance of the people of this country
that during the long period when so few units have been built, and
those units were grossly small and inadequate, when there has been
uncontrolled immigration, people have been living longer, there have
been big increases in households and the Government have not supplied
the housing that is needed, extremists found a way of getting elected
only in a proportional representation election for the European
Parliament. I do not think that the British people&#151;particularly
those who suffer the most at the bottom of the housing
ladder&#151;will stay so tolerant for long if this Government or the
next do not take housing more
seriously.</div><a name="09102777000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000447"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> I had not intended to contribute to the debate, but
I have been antagonised into so doing. In truth, there are enough
houses to deal with overcrowding, homelessness and housing need. The
issue is with distribution. More than 2 million second or empty homes
are available to us. The question is not simply one of physical
capacity.</div><a name="09102777000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overcrowding,
which was raised so powerfully by my hon. Friend the Member for
Northampton, North, is concentrated almost exclusively in 30 local
authority areas. There is a tail of problems elsewhere. It is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>problem for local authorities in London, Slough, Luton and some inner
cities in other parts of the country. Local government needs more
freedoms, but I am reluctant to tear up targets and controls on local
authorities. It is an indictment of local government in those specific
areas that it has not risen to the
challenge.</div><a name="09102777000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for the overcrowding crisis in this country is that the supply
of social rented accommodation has been in freefall for three decades.
Right-to-buy properties were taken out of the stock of social housing
and not replaced. Above all, they were not replaced in the places where
they were lost, nor using the same style and size of
accommodation.</div><a name="09102777000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000448"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Since I was elected to this place, I have been
trying to discover why fewer affordable housing units are being built
under the Labour Government than at any point during the times of
austerity, recession, economic difficulty and turnaround of the last
Conservative Government. Why have they failed to provide affordable
units for the people one would have thought they would see as a core
constituency that they&#151;like all of us&#151;should
serve?</div><a name="09102777000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000449"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> I was about to respond to that point. I have a germ
of agreement because there is some truth in it. The Government rightly
spent billions of pounds&#151;I do not have the figure at my
fingertips&#151;on the decent homes initiative to get substandard
local authority social housing up to a decent condition. Almost all of
my constituents in such accommodation have had new kitchens and
bathrooms and external work done on their properties. That was long
overdue and was done at huge expense. A great deal of value has been
accrued from it. That money was therefore not spent on social housing
construction.</div><a name="09102777000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have argued since 1997 that we should spend more on housing. I doubt
that would be supported by the Conservative party, which is planning to
take a substantial amount of money out of the social housing budget. On
top of the decent homes initiative, more money should have been spent
on building new
homes.</div><a name="09102777000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities up and down the country&#151;including in areas where
overcrowding is most acute&#151;say that they will not build more
social homes. Those authorities are largely Conservative controlled,
although some are Liberal Democrat controlled and the occasional one is
Labour controlled. Southwark and possibly Newham are among the councils
that say, &#147;We do not want any more social homes because we have
too many people living on low incomes in social homes and we want a
different tenure mix.&#148; There is an argument for that. However, I
do not hear local authorities in Wiltshire, Norfolk, Hammersmith and
Fulham or Barnet saying that they want a different tenure mix with more
social housing to meet the needs of their local people and other people
with housing needs up and down the country. That is a
problem.</div><a name="09102777000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
it happens, there has been a significant increase in the construction
of social housing in London in the past few years, driven by Mayor
Livingstone. We will wait and see whether, given the tearing up of the
targets, that will be carried through by Mayor Johnson. It is true that
across the country as a whole, the social housing construction that we
need has not taken place, but in the areas where we need it most, it
has begun to feed through. However, it is now being blocked. There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>are a number of responses to the crisis rightly mentioned by my hon.
Friend, and the right kind of supply in the right places is what we
need to deal with
it.</div><a name="09102777000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
last point to Ministers is that I am absolutely clear that the
Department for Communities and Local Government has failed dismally for
the past 12 years to recognise how critical overcrowding is to
children&#146;s life chances. It is frankly embarrassing that for
years and years, my hon. Friend and I, and others, have been saying,
&#147;Update the standard, make overcrowding as much a priority as
homelessness&#151;if not more&#151;and help us deal with
this.&#148; If the Bill and the thinking behind the amendments are a
way for us to exercise leverage on DCLG to do so, I support them
wholeheartedly.</div><a name="09102777000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000450"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We have had an interesting debate. My hon. Friend
the Member for Northampton, North made an extremely impressive case.
She is a committed campaigner on these issues, as has been clear to
everybody in the Committee. She was also right to highlight the scale
of the overcrowding problem in my constituency. I urge her
not to press her amendment, partly because, as the hon. Member for
Northavon said, it would have the opposite effect to what she intends,
partly due to the risk of distracting from the tight focus on poverty
that we debated in the amendments to clause 1 and partly because I
think that the amendments are not the right measures for dealing
directly with the issues that she
raised.</div><a name="09102777000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
my hon. Friend certainly raised extremely important issues about which
the Committee will want reassurances. I am struggling a little to
answer the detailed points that she raised, but I can give her some
information in response. The best way to deal with them might be to
come back with further detail when I am in a position to do so. I am
certainly happy, as I know she is, to convey to our colleagues in DCLG
the strength of the views that she and others in the Committee have
expressed as they have reflected on what to do about
overcrowding.</div><a name="09102777000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend is absolutely right to underline the importance of ensuring
that children live in suitable, good-quality housing and the impact of
housing conditions on health and educational development. I was talking
to one of my constituents on Friday about the problem that her child
did not have somewhere to do her homework, exactly as my hon. Friend
said. By the end of next year, we will have invested more than
&#163;40 billion&#151;the figure to which my hon. Friend the Member
for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North alluded&#151;and
completed work to make 3.6 million social homes decent. That is 95 per
cent. of the total. It has been a big programme of investment, which
was necessary because of the previous Government&#146;s neglect and
an absence of investment in housing in the past. However, there is
certainly more to do, and recent announcements on supply and
overcrowding will help to ensure that we maintain
momentum.</div>
<a name="09102777000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000451"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> However new and shiny the kitchen, does the
Minister still think it appropriate, this year, that a family should be
sleeping in
it?</div><a name="09102777000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000452"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I certainly do not. I hope, however, that the hon.
Gentleman will reverse his opposition to the Government&#146;s
bringing forward investment in housing as part of our response to the
recession. That will help us to make some headway on matters.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div><a name="09102777000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will set out
how the Bill addresses housing, and I hope that that will be helpful.
The combined low income and material deprivation target requires us to
ensure that fewer than 5 per cent. of children are living in households
experiencing both material deprivation and an income below 70 per cent.
of the median before housing costs. Of the 21 items currently used to
define material deprivation, two relate explicitly to housing. One
relates to whether families have enough money to keep their home in a
decent state of decoration, while the other relates to the number of
bedrooms in the home, a point particularly welcomed by my hon. Friend
the Member for Northampton, North.</div>
<a name="09102777000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
items were chosen following independent expert analysis of how to
identify families living in poor housing conditions. The question in
the material deprivation survey about the number of bedrooms asks, as
my hon. Friend said, whether the household has enough bedrooms for
every child aged 10 years or more of a different gender to have their
own
bedroom.</div><a name="09102777000319"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09102777000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000453"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I was very surprised by the figures; in about 82
per cent. of the households that responded, the children said that they
did have enough bedrooms. Was that because there were enough bedrooms
in total, or because there were enough bedrooms if the parents slept in
the sitting room? I was not clear about that, as it seems unlikely that
there would be enough bedrooms if only bedrooms were used as
bedrooms.</div><a name="09102777000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000454"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Perhaps I could come back to my hon. Friend on
that, but the survey is quite subjective. It asks whether there are
enough bedrooms, and it records the answer. I do not think that it goes
into great detail about the sleeping arrangements in the home. Its
intention is to establish the self-reporting of material deprivation as
part of the measures under the
Bill.</div><a name="09102777000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000455"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> May I ask for a statement of fact? I might be
stupid and may have missed some documents, but will my right hon.
Friend tell us where the list of factors relating to material
deprivation is set out, explain how we can get hold of it and say
whether we have already been given a
copy?</div><a name="09102777000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000456"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> As the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
said, there was information on that matter in the letter that went
around yesterday, but the &#147;households below average
income&#148; survey is the key source for the
data.</div><a name="09102777000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I explained a little more where we are in the process, it might clarify
the position. Each of the 21 items used to measure material
deprivation has a separate weighting, depending on how common it is for
the general population to be able to afford them. An overall score is
achieved by adding up the weight for each item that has lapsed because
it cannot be afforded, and the score is then adjusted to one on a scale
of zero to
100.</div><a name="09102777000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon asked how is it that a family is materially
deprived if they score 25 or more on the scale. That figure emerged
from the expert assessment. A lot of academic work has been done on the
topic, with the result that 25 is about the right place to set the
threshold. As I said, the measure is subjective, and the work is
exploratory. A lot of it is new. That is the state of the art; that is
where we have got to.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div><a name="09102777000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000457"></a>John
Howell:</b> In answer to question 203, Neil O&#146;Brien
made the important point that the data underlying material deprivation
were very weak. Reading through his helpful policy note, it seems that
there is quite a lot of continuity in the approach taken since the
early years of this decade. Presumably, the weakness applies to that.
Is the Minister satisfied that he has overcome the weakness identified
in the
data?</div><a name="09102777000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000458"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The current list of material deprivation items was
selected in 2003. Work is under way at the moment to update that list,
and the view among the academic experts to whom I have referred is that
it would be sensible to update the list every five years. In that way,
we could allow the measure to keep pace with public perceptions of
disadvantage, but it would not move too fast and thus confuse or
disguise the picture, in relation to whether progress was being made.
We have commissioned research to identify whether and how the current
items should be updated to ensure that the measure remains a robust
measure of contemporary living standards, and we are talking to
academic experts as part of that. I assure my hon. Friend the Member
for Northampton, North, that regulations will set out how material
deprivation, including the housing element, will be measured, and that
will enable us to do the updating in the way that I have described. I
hope that that picks up the issues raised in her amendments 18 and
19.</div><a name="09102777000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000459"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Will those regulations give some priority to some
of the more pressing indicators? It would be perverse if a child could
have a friend over once a fortnight for tea and was able to go on
holiday, but spent their entire childhood living in an appalling
slum.</div><a name="09102777000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000460"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think that my hon. Friend&#146;s question is
about the weightings that are applied to each of the 21
indicators. I am happy to give her some information about that, and she
may want to comment. It is still an evolving science, and there may
well be lessons to be learned from the debate about how that weighting
should be applied.</div>
<a name="09102777000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ought to
draw attention to the fact that, along with the material deprivation
target, housing is listed in clause 8 as one of the key areas to be
considered when preparing a child poverty strategy. As with each of the
building blocks underpinning the strategy, work is under way to analyse
the impact of housing on child poverty, including both the direct
impact on material deprivation and the importance of good quality
housing for other related outcomes, for example parental employment,
family health and children&#146;s education. The duties in part 2
will also lead local authorities and those working with them to address
housing issues that arise in their areas&#151;my hon. Friend touched
on that. For example, needs assessments will need to be undertaken to
identify the quality of housing occupied by families with children
living in poverty in the local area. By using housing items to help to
define material deprivation, requiring the child poverty strategy to
consider housing as one of the building blocks and ensuring that local
partners consider local housing issues, the Bill will be effective in
mitigating for children the effects of bad housing conditions and the
other material effects of living in
poverty.</div><a name="09102777000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have talked a little about the two items relating to housing. As I have
said, the items used are updated over 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>time to capture contemporary living standards&#151;not the bare
basics&#151;and the fact that they will be in regulations means that
they can be updated. The local needs assessment regulations, which my
hon. Friend touched on, are in draft. She may want to comment on the
detail of those, and there is an opportunity to do so. We have to
ensure, of course, that local needs assessment regulations are
deliverable, and that local partners have access to the data that they
need in order to comply. We are working with the Department for
Communities and Local Government on that, and there may well be an
opportunity in that dialogue to pursue my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns
on
overcrowding.</div><a name="09102777000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
items that we use at the moment for material deprivation come from the
2003 consultation on measuring child poverty. I mentioned that the
child poverty unit has commissioned independent academic analysis to
identify whether and which items need updating. If new items were
needed, they would be included in the 2010-11 survey to measure income
and material
deprivation.</div><a name="09102777000272"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000461"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I asked specifically about what constitutes a
bedroom and who decides what is a pair, and I also asked about
precedence. I particularly wanted an answer in Committee because that
will be important for later interpretation of the Bill. Will my right
hon. Friend deal with those specific points? There were also issues
about children under the age of one.</div>
<a name="09102777000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
precedence does the standard&#151;it may be revised, and I take the
point that it appears likely that housing will be included in the new
list&#151;take over other types of measures? That precise point was
raised earlier: in the absence of the new regulations that the
Government committed themselves to bringing forward some time ago,
there is a plethora of different standards, and the basic one is
abysmally low. That is the one that I read out, which was objected to
75 years
ago.</div><a name="09102777000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000462"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000463"></a>Ms

that the answer will be in <i class="I">Hansard</i>. An exchange of letters does
not have the same status. It is important to set out what is meant by
the standard, which will have a profound impact on the standard of
housing provided for our constituents. It will have a real effect on
some of the poorest families and children. We need to know the
sequencing of the standards in the Bill, in relation to measures in
other legislation that affects housing for families and
children.</div><a name="09102777000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102777000464"></a>Mr.

for me to put that detail on the record, and I shall be happy to do
so.</div><a name="09102777000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I want to sound a cautionary note, because of course the statutory
regulations under housing law will take precedence. The Bill may well
effectively apply pressure for change, but it would be misleading if I
were to give the Committee the impression that the inclusion of a
particular formulation in the material deprivation index will override
housing law. However, I shall be
