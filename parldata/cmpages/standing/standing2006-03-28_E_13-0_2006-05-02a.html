Welcome back to theCommittee after the bank holiday weekend.</div><a name="0605023000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before speaking to theamendments, I wish to say a few words about the context of our debatesso far and our forthcoming debate on this part of the Bill, which dealswith school admissions. I hope that that will be helpful to theofficial Opposition, who on more than one occasion have questioned myviews on certainmatters.</div><a name="0605023000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to methat the way in which the official Opposition have approached the Bill,especially questions relating to admissions and the relationship withthe local authority, is not the most useful framework for increasingour understanding of how to build an education system that helps tofulfil the potential of all children. Their view is that there is adichotomy of those who believe that all our schools should be withinthe local education authority and those who believe that they shouldall be free-standing, independent schools with minimal connection withthe LEA. Furthermore, there are those who believe that there should beno LEAs at all. It is not helpful to consider the Bill in such terms.The issue is far more complex than that.</div><a name="0605023000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, traditionally theofficial Opposition have regarded the debate on admissions as a debatebetween those who believe in selection and those who are opposed to it.They have simplified that into debate on grammar schools andcomprehensive schools, or grammar school systems. It is interesting howselective <div class="Column"><a name="Column550" />Column number: 551</div>systems are always described as grammar school systems, not secondarymodern school systems, but we will leave that to one side for themoment.</div><a name="0605023000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000310"></a><b class="B">Mr.John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): That isa caricature of the mission of the official Opposition. We voted forthe Bill in the full understanding that it retains a role for LEAs: agood example of such a function that I value greatly is statementingspecial needs children. We would have voted against the Bill had weheld the opinion that the hon. Gentleman ascribes tous.</div><a name="0605023000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000311"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment,although he is, of course, in the vanguard of thinking in his party onsuch matters and I suspect that his views are not shared by the generalmass of hiscolleagues.</div><a name="0605023000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000312"></a><b class="B">Mrs.Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): Could the reasonwe refer to selective systems as grammar school systems, not secondarymodern school systems, be that we still have grammar schools, but nolonger have secondary modern schools? Speaking as a secondarymodern-educated person, I do not believe that anyone in the room wouldadvocate a return to the secondary modernsystem.</div><a name="0605023000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000313"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> No it could not, because we still have secondarymodern schools. If the hon. Lady checks the list of categories ofschool held by the Department for Education and Skills, she will seethat it contains several secondary modern schools. Although not allnon-selective schools in wholly selective areas are defined officiallyas secondary modern schools, they have, in effect, the same status asthose schools that used to be defined assuch.</div><a name="0605023000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000314"></a>Mrs.Dorries:</b> Is it not a failure of the Government that afteralmost 10 years in power, secondary modern schools are still inexistence? Are they not operating a comprehensivesystem?</div><a name="0605023000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000315"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> The hon. Lady makes an important point. If shecan be patient, I shall comment further on the grammar-comprehensivedivision in the hope of clarifying the point. The way in which theDepartment classifies our schools probably bears little relationship toreality. Some schools that are classified as secondary modernschools&#151;perhaps in Kent, Slough or Buckinghamshire&#151;have afar more comprehensive intake than some of the schools that areofficially classified as comprehensive schools. I am glad that shepicked up on my remarks on the important question of how schools areclassified. My preference would be simply to call them&#147;schools&#148;, but perhaps that is an idea whose time has notyet come.</div><a name="0605023000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It isimportant to raise the issue now, because for50 years oureducation debate has been too much hung up on the names that we giveschools. I do not believe that the concept of a grammar school is aprecise or accurate one, because some grammar schools are whollyselective state schools, some are non-selective state schools, and someare private schools that select to a greater or lesser degree byability and by the size of <div class="Column"><a name="Column551" />Column number: 552</div>the parents&#146; chequebook. The term &#147;grammar school&#148;is not helpful, nor is the term &#147;comprehensive school&#148;,which embraces an enormous range of schools with an enormous diversityof intake. We need to get away from the traditional framework ofdivisions between selection and non-selection, and between the controland running of schools by LEAs and a system of free-standingindependentschools.</div><a name="0605023000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000316"></a><b class="B">Mr.Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Is notwhat we need to get away from the ideological obsession with intake andthe assumption that the intake of a school determines its quality? Thereason for the degree of passion about school intakesis thatthere are too few good schools in thiscountry, with 23 percent. officially regarded as underperforming. Should not the priorityof all Members of Parliament be to create more good schools so thatthere is not such a clamour by parents to get their children into thefew good schools that exist? That, not admissions, should be ourobsession.</div><a name="0605023000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000317"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> I agree completely that our objective should beto create more good schools; paradoxically, that would make our currentobsession with choice became less relevant. If more good schools wereavailable, individual parents would be less anxious about their choiceof school, because the choice that they made would be less significantto and have less of an impact on their children&#146;s education.However, I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that therehas been an ideological obsession with intake; nor do I accept thatintake is irrelevant to the objective of building a system in which allschools are good schools.</div><a name="0605023000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">To continue my generalremarks&#151;I beg your indulgence, Mr. Chope: I shall move on to thespecifics of the amendments shortly&#151;the real issue seems to meto be not a battle between independent schools and LEA-controlledschools but the correct balance of decision making between theGovernment in Westminster, the local authority, school governors and parents. It is interesting that so much of the debate in Committee sofar has focused on the level at which decisions should be taken. Somehave said that certain matters should be determined by parents; othershave said that certain matters are for the governing body to determine.The Opposition have criticised the Government for being too centralist.The Government have argued that they want to increase parentpower.</div> <a name="0605023000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argumenthas moved back and forth between the Government and the Opposition, andthe central theme of the Bill seems to be securing the rightdecision-making structure, getting the right decisions taken at theright level and ensuring a balance between the legitimate rights ofparents and school governing bodies and the democratic responsibilitiesof local authorities and central Government. We must therefore focusfirst on what decision-making structure would be best, and then on whatrelationship between local authorities and the schools in their areawould be best.</div> <a name="0605023000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thehon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), with whom I have some thingsin common and many differences, has said that he deeply regrets thefactthat the Conservative Government who passed the <div class="Column"><a name="Column552" />Column number: 553</div>Education Reform Act 1988 did not go the whole way and allow all schoolsto opt out. He and other members of the Committee may be interested toknow that, within weeks of the Act receiving Royal Assent, I madeprecisely that argument&#151;albeit for different reasons from thehon. Gentleman&#146;s&#151;to my colleagues on the educationcommittee on which I was serving at the time. I argued that the onlyway in which we could conceivably maintain a coherent and equitablesystem following the passing of the Act, which I did not support, wasfor all schools to retain the same status: either all should stay in,or all should opt out.</div><a name="0605023000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was an element ofmischievousness in that argument: it would have been impossible for allschools to opt out, because the Government of the day were not preparedto allocate the funding necessary for all of them to becomegrant-maintained. Some of us thought that the way to defeat thelegislation was to highlight that anomaly as forcefully as possible,but that was not the majority view of my party or my colleagues. We allknow the history of the past 18 years: the opting-out process has ledto more inequality in the system and a greater hierarchy of schools, aswell as greater differences in funding, both capital and revenue,particularly in secondaryschools.</div><a name="0605023000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000318"></a><b class="B">Mr.Edward Leigh</b> (Gainsborough) (Con): It is strange, is itnot, that the two outriders on the Committee agree on the fundamentalpoint that all schools should be treated the same, regardless offunding?

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000319"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> That is an interesting point; I shall take it one

step further. I am not convinced that the key issue is whether all

schools are inside or outside the LEA framework or we move to the

hybrid system set out in the Bill. I believe that the relationships

between an LEA and a school and between schools are more important. It

is crucial that we get those relationships right and that LEAs are

given the right responsibilities. I think that the Government have got

the balance pretty well right in the Bill as

drafted.</div><a name="0605023000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think

that the debate on selection is the old debate between grammar and

comprehensive schools. Those terms are meaningless, because we have

moved on in the past 40 years. No one is arguing that there will be no

selection in the education system. The question is what is the

appropriate age at which the selection process should take place.

Nobody is arguing that universities should not select their

students.</div><a name="0605023000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said

that, perhaps we should move away from the concept of selection and

talk instead of allocation. That would bring in far more strongly the

matter of choice. In matching students to courses or institutions,

their choice&#151;or their parents&#146; choice in the case of

younger students&#151;must be crucial. Such decisions should be taken

not on the back of an arbitrary test taken on a wet Wednesday morning

in December, but on the basis of informed choice and advice about a

student&#146;s true ability and potential. We should move away from

the old debate about selection versus non-selection and instead discuss

the age at 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column553" />Column number: 554</div>which selection and allocation to courses and institutions takes place,

the means by which that happens&#151;not a single arbitrary test but

a process of assessment and informed advice&#151;and the purpose of

selection and allocation. That purpose must be to develop the potential

of all our pupils, not to institute and entrench social

segregation.</div><a name="0605023000273"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

am</div><a name="0605023000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000320"></a><b class="B">Meg

Hillier</b> (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op): I am

interested by my hon. Friend&#146;s preliminary comments on the

issue. What are his views on a test to divide children into ability

bands, from band 1 to band 4, which is widely used by my local

education authority in Hackney? Does he have any comments to make on

that method of one-off testing on a wet

Wednesday?</div><a name="0605023000042"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000321"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point, which I

shall come to later. There is a clause on banding systems; I shall have

some amendments on that, too, so I shall talk a little more about

banding then.</div><a name="0605023000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

important distinctions to make. We need to consider the purpose of

allocating children to schools. The purpose of banding is to create

more balanced intakes and to increase fairness, parity of esteem

between schools and the chance that every child&#146;s potential can

be enhanced. There is a difficulty with banding if it means that

children have to sit an extra test around the time of their 10th

birthday, but there are other ways to band children without imposing

that on them.</div> <a name="0605023000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parity

of esteem between schools, in contrast to the creation of a hierarchy

of schools, is crucial. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, it would mean that the question of

choice would become less significant. The agonising that so many

parents go through, particularly around the time of the transfer to

secondary education, would be greatly diminished. That way, we would

develop far more good schools and good school

places.</div><a name="0605023000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equitable

finance is one of the keys to bringing about that parity of esteem. I

am grateful that the hon. Member for Gainsborough stressed the

importance of equitable distribution of finance. I suppose that his

Lincolnshire constituency has things in common with my constituency, as

some of the shire counties have had cause to complain about lower

levels of funding over the years, as has my metropolitan district

council. However, there are good reasons for that and we must live

within the budgets allocated. The management and leadership of schools

are also important: putting the strongest emphasis on increasing the

recruitment of highly skilled managers is crucial. The chance of a

school succeeding, developing its own character and fulfilling the

potential of all its children depends on the quality of its management

and leadership, combined with an appropriate

curriculum.</div><a name="0605023000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

school&#146;s success depends also on its pupil intake. The hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that we have had an

ideological obsession with intake, but if so, I do not share that

obsession. I take a fairly pragmatic approach. I put this simple

question to the Committee: if schools such as 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column554" />Column number: 555</div>Eton were stuffed full of the sons and daughters of &#147;the

underclass&#148;, would they retain their high reputations? To me, it

is manifestly self-evident that there is a relationship between the

nature of the intake and the possibility of a school becoming a good

school.</div><a name="0605023000047"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000322"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I disagree fundamentally with the hon. Gentleman. He

assumes that people from certain social classes are less able than

others, and I simply do not accept that. What matters is whether,

within a school, classes are setted or streamed by ability. If that is

done, the intake becomes irrelevant. The bright children, whatever

their backgrounds, need to be stretched to their full potential, and

the less able must be given time and space to learn, to ensure that

they understand what is being taught and can learn at their own pace.

If that were done in our comprehensive schools, intake would be

completely

irrelevant.</div><a name="0605023000048"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000323"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s later

comment, but I would be the last person to say that there is a

relationship between a child&#146;s background and his or her

potential. In fact, I believe precisely the

opposite.</div><a name="0605023000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

advanced my argument about the importance of intake not because of any

ideological obsession, but because it is what the body of expert

opinion in Britain appears to have concluded. Hon. Members should read

the work of the National Foundation for Educational Research and that

of Professor Jesson, who is one of the Government&#146;s key

advisors, particularly on specialist schools. They should consider also

the work of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and

Development&#146;s and the programme for international student

assessment&#151;not just the United Kingdom&#146;s performance in

PISA, but the conclusions of the PISA study, which surveyed the

secondary education systems of all 37 countries in the OECD. The study

concluded that the countries in which there was greater equity between

schools and a more balanced distribution of pupils within schools were

the most able to fulfil the development of all their children and were

less likely to have the long tails of under-achievement that have

plagued the British

system.</div><a name="0605023000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman may have talked to head teachers&#151;I do not know whether

he went to the National Association of Head Teachers conference this

weekend. However, I thought that every head teacher from their own

experience would say that schools do not need a mathematically and

scientifically precise balanced intake, but a critical mass of able and

motivated students. Conversely, as far as possible we need to avoid

large concentrations of students with behavioural or severe learning

difficulties and distribute those pupils more equally between

schools.</div><a name="0605023000051"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000324"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> How then does the hon. Gentleman account for the

fact that there are comprehensive schools in leafy suburbs where 37 or

38 per cent. of children achieve five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C

and other schools, such as the Wellington school in Telford, which

creams of 40 per cent. of its children to grammar schools, where 73 per

cent. of children achieve five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C? Is that

not a result of what happens in the school? Wellington 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column555" />Column number: 556</div>school employs strict setting and streaming, whereas in other schools in

those leafy suburbs children are taught in mixed-ability

classes?</div><a name="0605023000052"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000325"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I do not think so. I think that differences in

the performance of schools with similar intakes are due almost entirely

to the quality of management and teaching and the flexibility in the

curriculum. It is clear that schools with similar intakes perform

differently. There is no dispute about that&#151;it is not the point

at issue, and I do not see the purpose of focusing the argument on

that. As I recall, Wellington school is in Trafford not Telford. The

hon. Gentleman has referred to it before and I think that it is located

in Trafford, but I might be

wrong.</div><a name="0605023000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group of

amendments is underpinned by the importance of balanced school intakes.

The amendments are particularly important because of the historic

change in Conservative party policy on education just a few weeks ago,

which means that in one respect there is now an all-party consensus on

school admissions: all three parties have pledged that there will be no

return to the 11-plus examination. I was delighted to see the shadow

Secretary of State himself appear on Teachers&#146; TV&#151;I am

looking for the reference but I cannot lay my hands on it&#151;some

weeks ago. He spoke forcefully about the brutality of the 11-plus and

implied that that examination&#151;the single test on the wet

Wednesday in December&#151;is not a rational, intelligent or useful

means by which to allocate children to secondary schools if we want to

develop the potential of all our

children.</div><a name="0605023000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 441 to 443 and new clause 51 would change the Bill so that clause

36(1) would apply only until school year 2010. After that, local

authorities and schools admission authorities would be obliged to adopt

a sort of comprehensive system of intake. Selection by ability, and

later selection by aptitude, would no longer be permitted. Given that

we now have an all-party consensus that there will be no return to

selection by ability, there is value in setting a date for the ending

of such selection.</div> <a name="0605023000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now

that that consensus has been established&#151;presumably the

Conservatives have good reasons for having come to share our view about

the inadequacies of the old 11-plus testing system&#151;it is even

more illogical that selection by ability should be acceptable in some

parts of the country but not in others. I fail to understand how all

three parties can say that a non-selective system should operate in

Sussex or Hampshire, whereas in Kent selection by ability can remain.

In Bury, which has one of the most coherent systems of secondary

education in the country&#151;good 11-to-16 schools feed into two

colleges&#151;we all agree that a non-selective system is needed, and

that is widely supported by parents, but in Trafford, the converse

applies. Nobody, certainly not the Conservative party in Bury, argues

that we should revert to a system of 11-plus

testing.</div>

<a name="0605023000056"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000326"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Is not that what local democracy is all

about?</div>

<a name="0605023000057"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000327"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> To some extent, it is. I have argued in relation

to other parts of the Bill that we should allow 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column556" />Column number: 557</div>local authorities the right to take decisions at certain levels.

However, I made the point in my opening remarks today that a key thing

for the Bill to establish is the right decision-making structure. We

have to agree which decisions should be taken by parents, governors,

local authorities and central Government. Given that the Government

have taken to themselves the power to decide virtually every aspect of

admissions policy, it seems increasingly anomalous that in one

respect&#151;the small amount of 11-plus testing that still

exists&#151;they should abdicate responsibility to the twisted

democracy of the grammar school ballot system. I shall say more on that

later.</div> <a name="0605023000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now that we

have consensus in favour of no return to 11-plus testing, I want to

argue the merits of setting a date for phasing it out, as the

Government have done in Northern Ireland. That process is not

uncontroversial, but I recollect that in debates in the House about the

proposed changes to the system of secondary admissions in Northern

Ireland, people were not defending the 11-plus test&#151;in fact, I

vividly remember sitting in the Chamber and listening to Democratic

Unionist party and Ulster Unionist party Members saying that they

accepted that 11-plus testing was a crude, arbitrary and brutal way of

allocating children to schools. Instead, they were saying that they

like grammar schools. That is at the heart of the dilemma. Nobody has

argued, even in Northern Ireland, for the restoration of the

tests.</div> <a name="0605023000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Northern

Ireland has a 2008 deadline for the phasing out of the tests and a

process for deciding what will follow them. The effect of the

amendments would be to achieve the same thing here. They are based on

the argument that there should be time for parents, governors and local

authorities to work out with Ministers what should replace the tests.

There are many options, and it is important that we spend time

exploring them. One option would be, as I said when we discussed school

expansion, for existing selective schools, many of which are small and

will face falling rolls over the next 10 years, to expand on the basis

of a balanced intake. That is a fairly painless way of changing the

character of certain schools. It is what Margaret Thatcher did between

1970 and 1974, when she abolished more 11-plus testing than any

Secretary of State for Education before or since, and it is a

legitimate matter for local discussion.</div>

<a name="0605023000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another would be something else

for which the noble Baroness argued strongly 30 or more years ago: that

the existing wholly selective schools should remain wholly selective,

not from the age of 11 but from the age of 16. The transformation of

the wholly selective schools into what we now know as sixth-form

colleges is another option that should be a legitimate subject for

discussion at local

level.</div>

<a name="0605023000274"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

am</div><a name="0605023000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is even an

argument, which I would not necessarily advance at this stage, but

which might appeal to a new-born Conservative party that is desperate

to reinvent itself, and particularly to those on its progressive and

libertarian wings. Given the important changes to our curriculum in key

stage 4 following the Tomlinson report, some of which will be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column557" />Column number: 558</div>discussed later in the Bill, the key point of choice over curriculum is

no longer at 11, but at 14. Therefore another option to consider what

might follow the ending of selection by 11-plus testing is to argue

that we should create a series of 14-to-19 schools. The current wholly

selective schools could thereby transform themselves, while retaining

their character and strengths, but opening up their facilities to even

more children.</div> <a name="0605023000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do

not want to act as an unpaid consultant to the Conservative party in

how it might improve its education policy. I am merely saying that here

is an opportunity for the more progressive and libertarian members of

the Opposition to take up an idea and run with it. By doing so they

could well gain greater credibility with some people working in

education.</div> <a name="0605023000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now

to amendments Nos. 209 and 230, which simply bring into the provisions

of the clause the academy schools, the city technology colleges and the

very small number&#151;I think there may be only one&#151;of city

colleges for technology of the arts. The arguments for bringing

academies into the system that applies to community, foundation and

voluntary schools have been well made earlier in the debate. I do not

think that it is necessary to repeat them now, other than to say that

there is one key issue about academies that needs stressing and which

perhaps has not been stressed to date.</div>

<a name="0605023000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because the academies&#146;

admissions policies are required to follow the national code of

practice, yet are entrenched within their funding agreements, academies

that are already established and have their funding agreement agreed

will be acting in line with the current code of practice on school

admissions. When the new code of practice comes into force at some

point in 2007&#151;presumably for the school year starting in

September 2007&#151;will the existing academies also be required to

act in accordance with it or will their funding agreement still protect

them, so that they merely have to have regard to the old code? That is

an interesting point. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond.

It supports the argument that academies and the small number of related

schools should be fully involved in the system that applies to all

other

schools.</div><a name="0605023000065"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000328"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> It is good to be back after our brief sojourn to

consider these important matters, given heat, if not light, by the hon.

Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) in speaking to his

amendments.</div><a name="0605023000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Children

from poorer families have far less chance of improving their lives in

Britain than they do in many other wealthy

countries.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">So said a

report from the London School of Economics, published in June 2005,

with which you will be familiar, Mr. Chope, as will other hon. Members.

That report showed furthermore that the decline of grammar schools had

helped deepen class divisions, effectively kicking the ladder away from

bright children. The study of eight countries carried out by the LSE

said that social mobility in Britain was lower than anywhere else

except for the United

States.</div><a name="0605023000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000329"></a><b class="B">Sarah

Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): The hon. Gentleman says that

the decline of grammar schools has kicked the ladder away from bright

children, but 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column558" />Column number: 559</div>what happens to those who would not have passed the 11-plus? Surely

their chances have

improved.</div><a name="0605023000068"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000330"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I shall deal with that matter in some detail during

my peroration because the hon. Lady has a fair point. The arguments

usually made against grammar schools, are not that they do not provide

opportunities for working-class children, who would otherwise not have

had such opportunities, but that they do not provide benefit to those

children not selected at age 11.</div>

<a name="0605023000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I hope to show today is

that typically the aggregate results in areas that have selection are

better; that the standards in primary schools are higher; and that many

of the schools in selective areas which are themselves not selective do

exceptionally well. So that the hon. Lady can research the matter while

I am on my feet, she might care to look at the Gleed girls&#146;

technology college in Spalding, an excellent secondary school. It

achieves better results than many comprehensive schools, despite the

fact that it is the neighbour of the Spalding high school, a selective

girls&#146; school, which itself, is exceptional. I will deal with

the point in more detail as we continue.</div>

<a name="0605023000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LSE report

states:</div><a name="0605023000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In

Britain, 38 per cent. of sons born in 1970 to the poorest quarter of

families were themselves in the bottom quarter of earners at the age of

30. Only 11 per cent. had reached the richest quarter. By contrast, 42

per cent. of those born to the wealthiest quarter remained amongst the

top earners at 30 and 16 per cent. were in the bottom quarter. There

was greater movement among those born in

1958&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0605023000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">the year of

my birth.</div> <a name="0605023000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">My story, a

story of a working-class boy who, by achieving a grammar school

education and subsequently a university education, was able to achieve

a lifetime ambition of becoming a Member of Parliament&#151;not that

one must have a grammar school or a university education to be an

MP&#151;is a useful example of what happened to many of my

generation, who otherwise might not have achieved their ambitions.

Indeed, they might have achieved far less than the generation that was

born

later.</div><a name="0605023000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000331"></a><b class="B">Ms

Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): Is it not

also the case that many working-class children who failed the 11-plus

went on to make up for that failure and developed in later life, went

on to university but had to work twice as hard to get there? Is that

not

unfair?</div><a name="0605023000074"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000332"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Yes, of course, many people develop talents and are

well educated and successful, notwithstanding what happens to them at

age 11, but many are not. Social mobility, by any measure, has declined

in this country. One of the factors in that decline, though not the

only one, of course, has been the dogmatic adherence, which we heard

again this morning, to a faded and thwarted comprehensive

ideal.</div><a name="0605023000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad that

that dogma is not shared by the Prime Minister. It is certainly not

shared by his education adviser, who made precisely the same point in

his book entitled &#147;A Class Act: The Myth of Britain&#146;s

Classless Society&#148;, which I refer to again. Lord Adonis said

that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column559" />Column number: 560</div>grammar schools were important in delivering social mobility to a

generation that would not have had opportunities before

that.</div>

<a name="0605023000076"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000333"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> If that is the case, why are the hon. Gentleman

and his party not arguing for the reintroduction of grammar schools

into every town in Britain?</div>

<a name="0605023000077"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000334"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> We argue, in amendment No. 45, that there should be

the opportunity for schools to select. We are not opposed to selection.

We argue vociferously for banding and streaming in schools. We argue

that what I described as a faded dream, or perhaps a nightmare that the

hon. Gentleman has endured for so long, has not delivered for children

in this country and that we need to think again. But it is important

that we focus on the large number of schools that are not grammar

schools. Our debate has been focused on the many children who do not

live in an area with selection. It is important that we raise standards

for all of our children, not just the most gifted, and it is vital that

we understand that there are many factors in a good outcome in

education: teaching and learning, curricular issues, home-school

issues&#151;the hon. Gentleman knows them

all.</div><a name="0605023000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Conservative

party is not preoccupied with grammar schools, and we do not focus only

on the children who attend them, but in light of the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s amendments it is important to focus on them now, as

the Committee considers this part of the Bill. That is why the

Conservative party has said what it has&#151;we want opportunity for

all children and we want more good schools of all

types.</div><a name="0605023000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is undeniably

the case that one of the effects of the comprehensive idea, an effect

that I am glad to say is now being broken up, was to undermine the

opportunities of very large numbers of working-class children. The LSE

study to which I referred found

that</div><a name="0605023000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an increasing link

between family wealth and educational achievement was partly

responsible for the marked decline in social mobility in

Britain.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, in

1970, poorer children had much less opportunity to improve their

socio-economic status as adults than those who were born when I was.

The LSE report felt

that</div><a name="0605023000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

abolition of grammar schools...reduced opportunity in a country

where parental wealth and a good education are strongly linked.

Uniquely among the countries studied, the life chances of poorer

children in Britain had become worse over

time.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report showed

that the decline of grammar schools has helped deepen class division,

kicking away the ladder from brighter, working-class

children.</div><a name="0605023000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000335"></a><b class="B">Mr.

James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): Myhon. Friend

makes a powerful case on why comprehensivisation, as implemented in

some places, has led to a reinforcement of class divisions. Is he aware

of the position on admissions to leading universities, including Oxford

and Cambridge, which we know is a matter of great interest in some

quarters? Is it not the case that the proportion of children from state

schools at those universities has decreased, in line with the sort of

comprehensivisation, dictated by social engineering, that we have

seen?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column560" />Column number: 561</div><a name="0605023000083"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000336"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> That is precisely the case that Lord Adonis makes

in his book, and he goes on to say that the trend that I have

described&#151;the blighted chances of working-class

children&#151;has resulted not only in the school system becoming a

matter of selection by house price and wealth, but has caused similar

effects in universities. At the very least, there is a case for

retaining existing grammar schools in the interests of social mobility

and for considering selection, as the amendment does, in academies, as

the Government have, and trust schools that empower local communities

and parents. All of them, like it or not, break down the idea that all

children, regardless of aptitude or ability, and of where they come

from, should end up being educated in large, bog-standard

comprehensives. The hon. Member for Bury, North and other people want

to impose the straitjacket of the

comprehensive&#151;&#147;straitjacket&#148; is not my expression;

it is the Prime Minister&#146;s.</div>

<a name="0605023000084"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000337"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting speech,

but given that class divisions have considerably changed, partly

because of the decline of manufacturing and the rise of service

industries, how does he define social

mobility?</div><a name="0605023000085"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000338"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I began to define it in what I said about the LSE

report, and I should be happy to let the hon. Lady have a copy of the

report. The LSE defines it by the way people move from one social class

to another in terms of wealth distribution&#151;the way people move

between, or across, the spectrum of wealth. I do not for one moment

claim that wealth should be the only arbiter of human happiness, nor is

it necessarily a perfect proxy for class, but it is of profound

concern.</div><a name="0605023000275"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

am</div><a name="0605023000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LSE report

found it &#147;deeply shocking&#148; that its evidence suggested

that fewer people move from one position in respect of wealth to

another during the course of their lifetime. The definition of social

mobility is not perfect, but it is good enough for the LSE and for

several other studies, which almost comprehensively suggest that social

mobility has

declined.</div><a name="0605023000087"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000339"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I do not dispute that this is an issue. The

question is how the hon. Gentleman defines it, because it changes the

parameters of the debate. Given that we accept that social mobility is

declining and it is important that it should be greater in all groups,

why is the hon. Gentleman so focused on the academic? Surely, all

children should have the ability to move between different bands of

income as they get

older.</div><a name="0605023000088"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000340"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> It is because there is a proven relationship

between educational attainment and family income. If people cannot

easily obtain an education that is best suited to their needs they are

unlikely to progress educationally and there is likely to be a direct

correlation, although not a perfect correlation, between that fact and

their chances of obtaining a different place in society.</div>

<a name="0605023000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not necessarily equate

wealth and happiness, but if we measure social mobility in those terms,

we see 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column561" />Column number: 562</div>that there has been a decline and it is almost undeniable that it is

linked to educational opportunity. I think the Committee would agree on

that.</div> <a name="0605023000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">At a risk of

doing the point to death, if the LSE study and similar studies are

right to say that social mobility has declined and that educational

opportunity and achievement are linked to that decline, we must ask

why. It is pretty clear that what has happened in my lifetime, since

1958 and since the decline of grammar schools in the 1960s and 1970s,

is that most people who obtain the best education for their children do

so on the basis of where they live, which is often a product of how

wealthy they are.</div> <a name="0605023000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

have moved from selection on the basis of ability to selection on the

basis of wealth. Of course, that is not exclusively true; many children

achieve against the odds, many good schools are situated in difficult

areas and many head teachers, governors and teachers are doing a superb

job in very challenging circumstances. But it is undeniable that wealth

has become the arbiter of opportunity in that respect and we need to

break that down. I guess that that is why the Government adopted their

policies. That is what the academies programme and the extension of

specialist schools, with all their strengths, are about, and it is what

the Bill is about. It is a recognition that the comprehensive system as

designed in the 1950s and still supported by the hon. Member for Bury,

North and others has failed generations of

children.</div><a name="0605023000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am making

the assumption&#151;perhaps an a priori assumption&#151;that

grammar schools do a good job. We should look at the evidence for that;

it has become clear since we have been able to measure value added,

because we can now see the difference between key stages 2 and 4 in

respect of a child&#146;s progress. The analysis of value added shows

very clearly that grammar schools do exceptionally well. We should bear

it in mind that a grammar school&#146;s intake is already

disproportionately able. The sort of children measured at key stage 2

who go to grammar school would already have achieved a great deal, and

a great deal will be required to take them on still further, but that

is precisely what grammar schools do.</div>

<a name="0605023000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year in my own county of

Lincolnshire, where the value-added system has been in place for some

years, the 15 best schools in terms of value added were all grammar

schools. Spalding girls high school, which I have mentioned already and

shall mention again, achieved the goal of being the best value-added

school among those grammar schools last

year.</div><a name="0605023000094"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000341"></a>Ms

Angela C. Smith:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for being so

generous with his time in giving way. Is it not true that two of the

most important factors in value-added measures are the quality of

teaching and learning in a school and parents&#146; support for their

children? Is it not important to support initiatives, such as extended

schools and Sure Start, to ensure that parents are supporting their

children, which is a key factor in improving performance in

schools?</div><a name="0605023000095"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000342"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Lady always speaks with great insight in

this Committee. Both things are true. The quality of teaching and

learning and the progress of the children is undeniably critical in the

success of a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column562" />Column number: 563</div>school, as is the home-school relationship, which I mentioned earlier in

my contribution.</div><a name="0605023000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may

be true to say that if parents have taken the trouble to get involved

in their child&#146;s education and back the school strongly, and if

the children attend a school that is able to attract good teachers and

good leadership, the children will do well almost regardless. That is

the implication of the hon. Lady&#146;s comment. My ambition, like

the Minister&#146;s, is to ensure that leadership, quality of

teaching and learning and home-school support is available for as many

children as possible, by learning some of the lessons that we should

have learned over the past 30 years about what works and what does not.

I doubt&#151;I put it no stronger than that&#151;that everyone has

yet learned those lessons and that there is not still considerable

ingrained prejudice, born of the dogma of a previous age, about what

makes schools effective. However, judging from her last contribution,

that is not a prejudice that the hon. Lady

has.</div><a name="0605023000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Grammar schools

make a big difference to the children who attend them and achieve

exceptional results measured by value added. But what about the

children who do not attend them? The hon. Lady makes a point about

children who are not selected to go to grammar school. I refer her to

the work ofDr. John Marks, which she will know, I have no

doubt. Dr. Marks has been studying educational standards for a long

time. I have the figures from his analysis of the five A to C grade

GCSE standard across types of school. His study, published in 2002,

suggests that the percentage of pupils in comprehensive schools

achieving five A to C grades was about 40 per cent. in that year. I

acknowledge that it has increased a little bit since then, because the

Minister will no doubt correct me if I do not. In the same year, the

figure was 63.5 per cent. in grammar schools and 34.1 per cent. in

secondary moderns. In other words, in a selective system as a whole,

the figure was 43.9 per cent. and in all comprehensives it was 39 per

cent.</div><a name="0605023000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, in

taking the average one is not necessarily suggesting that all secondary

modern schools do as well as comprehensives, but it is true that

secondary moderns do remarkably well for their children, given that

many of the brightest children have already been selected to go to

grammar schools. The effect of selection in an area is not the sorry

story that people would have us believe. Many secondary modern schools

are strong and do exceptionally well. My judgment about the post-Butler

system is not that it was structurally faulty, but that we did not

invest enough in resources or expectations in secondary modern schools.

We did not understand that without a disproportionate investment,

children who do not have the implicit advantages suggested by the hon.

Lady will not fare as well. We need to back all our children regardless

of ability and all schools regardless of

type.</div><a name="0605023000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I point to the

popularity of grammar schools. Much is said about the possibility that

people who do not go to grammar schools and parents whose children do

not get in are unhappy with selection by or within schools. Perhaps

they are even unhappy with 10 per cent. selection, but the poll figures

suggest otherwise. An ICM Research poll on the question of abolishing

the remaining 164 state grammar schools, albeit one conducted for the

National Grammar Schools 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column563" />Column number: 564</div>Association, found that 27 per cent. of people supported abolition and

61 per cent. opposed it. Those are remarkable figures, given that many

areas of the country have not had grammar schools for a long time and

that many of the children of those interviewed would therefore have no

opportunity to go to

one.</div><a name="0605023000100"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000343"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am delighted by my hon. Friend&#146;s paean of

praise for grammar schools. Surely the logic of it is that we should

allow grammar schools to be resurrected wherever people want

them.</div><a name="0605023000101"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000344"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> As I said in my hon. Friend&#146;s absence during

our last meeting, he is an outrider, but I am firmly rooted in the

cavalcade&#151;the limousine&#151;that he and my hon. Friend the

Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) are flanking. I understand

that our party, our shadow Secretary of State and our leader want to

focus on the schools that most people go to.</div>

<a name="0605023000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend might be right,

but the problem with his position is that for too long, Conservatives

have been caricatured as interested only in the most able

children&#151;the children most likely to go to grammar schools. I am

interested in all this country&#146;s children. This debate is our

first opportunity during the progress of the Bill to speak about

selection in such terms. It is certainly the first time that we have

talked about grammar schools. We have spoken about every imaginable

subject affecting children&#146;s progress, and in doing so have

shown our determination that all children should get the very best

education. For the vast bulk of children, that will not mean going to a

grammar

school.</div><a name="0605023000103"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000345"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I entirely accept what my hon. Friend says. That is

why we do not want to get stuck on the term &#147;grammar

school&#148;. The next Conservative Government want all schools to be

in charge of their admissions procedures so that if they want to move

gradually toward a selective system they can do so, as can schools in

the independent

sector.</div><a name="0605023000104"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000346"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The purpose of the Bill&#151;indeed, the purpose

of much of the cross-party consensus that has emerged on

education&#151;is to do precisely what my hon. Friend wants to do. It

is trying to provide for children of all kinds and with all types of

ability the sorts of opportunity that were once available only to a

minority of children. That is what I want to do, and that is the

position that the Government, falteringly and grudgingly, have come to.

The Opposition have moved away from the faded dream of the hon. Member

for Bury, North. Perhaps he will tell us something about his nightmare

now.</div><a name="0605023000105"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000347"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Given what the hon. Gentleman has just said about

extending opportunities to all children, why is he so opposed to my

suggestion that the most effective way to do that is to transform the

existing wholly selective schools into sixth-form

colleges?</div><a name="0605023000276"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

am</div><a name="0605023000106"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000348"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Gentleman published an alternative White

Paper, did he not? It is fair to say that he has a long track record of

opposition to selection. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column564" />Column number: 565</div>He has doubts even about partial selection in schools, as he made clear

in an earlier sitting. As the provisions that we are now considering,

and the amendments that he and other hon. Members have tabled, are on

precisely that subject, he would hardly expect me enthusiastically to

endorse them or to agree with what he said.</div>

<a name="0605023000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The best way to achieve

opportunity for most children in this country is to travel in a

different direction to that suggested by the hon. Gentleman. We are

aiming at the same end, but going there by different means. The mode of

travel that I have adopted is not terribly unlike that of the

Government.</div><a name="0605023000108"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000349"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> In judging the amendments of the hon. Member

for Bury, North, and without going back to a previous debate, will my

hon. Friend bear in mind that it was that hon. Gentleman who, in a

previous debate, was quite happy that up to 35 per cent. of children

should be condemned to remain in a failing school? Surely we should

focus on a structure, whatever it might be, that would lift children

out of such schools, rather than concentrating on social engineering to

the exclusion of standards and being happy when standards are low but

the needs of social engineering are

met.</div><a name="0605023000109"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000350"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s point is not dissimilar to

the one made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith),

that we should focus not on structure but quality. The Bill obliges us

to focus on structure because it is largely about structure. I

understand the reason for that, but it would be wrong for the whole

debate to be skewed away from the proper consideration of standards and

quality that my hon. Friend highlighted by the fact that we are, of

necessity, largely considering structural matters.</div>

<a name="0605023000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the Ministers would

agree that it is vital to debate all the factors that affect quality.

We have started to talk about them and I shall not repeat them, but

they are by no means all questions of structure. It is arguably the

preoccupation with structure that has meant that successive Governments

have failed to deal with some of the issues highlighted by my hon.

Friend. He, on the other hand, is a great champion of education and of

opportunity for all.</div><a name="0605023000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

mentioned Lord Adonis and shall return to that subject, but first it is

worth saying something about the system in Northern Ireland, to provide

an illustration of the effect of selection. Northern Ireland, as you

know, Mr. Chope, retains a selective system, with 11-plus exams still

determining the school of its children. Intriguingly, overall

achievement in Northern Ireland schools is substantially better than in

England and Wales. At GCSE level 52 per cent. of pupils in Northern

Ireland schools obtain five or more passes and the same pattern is

replicated at A-level. The number of pupils achieving two or more grade

A passes is 12 percentage points above that for

England.</div><a name="0605023000112"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000351"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> What proportion of children leave school in

Northern Ireland without a single qualification to their name? Would it

be 25 per cent?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column565" />Column number: 566</div><a name="0605023000113"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000352"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I do not have the figure, but I shall happily come

back to the hon. Gentleman with it.</div>

<a name="0605023000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact is that the selective

system delivers better results in Northern Ireland than the

non-selective system does here. When the matter of abolishing selection

in Northern Ireland comes before the House, we shall oppose the

Government, as my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for

Northern Ireland has made clear. We shall do so because what matters is

what works, and the system there works. To alter it would be more of

the dogma from which I hope we have moved away, and which is retained

only in a small and dwindling section of the Labour

party.</div><a name="0605023000115"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000353"></a>Meg

Hillier:</b> We are in danger of going down the route of

discussing Northern Ireland in a Bill that does not cover Northern

Ireland, but some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments cannot go

unanswered. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North made the point

about the number of children who leave schools in Northern Ireland

without qualifications. There is also a consensus that the 11-plus must

go, but that there will be some sort of pupil profile to help children,

parents and teachers select the right school. Northern Ireland has a

different type of selection, and I am interested to hear the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s comments, which do not seem to chime with the

opinions of his party&#146;s Northern Ireland Front-Bench

team.</div><a name="0605023000116"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000354"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> As the hon. Lady says, it would be wrong for me to

be seduced into a long and intricate debate about Northern Ireland,

which I was using merely as an illustrative example of how a selective

system compares with that prevailing in the rest of the

UK.</div><a name="0605023000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000355"></a><b class="B">Dr.

Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): Will the

hon. Gentleman give

way?</div><a name="0605023000118"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000356"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Not if it is about Northern

Ireland.</div><a name="0605023000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments

tabled by the hon. Member for Bury, North are not in the spirit of the

Bill. By contrast, our amendment No. 45 would open up to more pupils

the process of selection by aptitude. It is curious that schools can

select by aptitude children who show strength in languages, but not

those who show strength in mathematics. They can select those with

musical ability, but not those who are strong in English. We seem to be

dancing on the head of a pin by limiting schools&#146; capacity to

select to those areas that the Government have designated; for what

reason, I can only guess.</div>

<a name="0605023000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister say why the

subjects on the basis of which schools cannot select are set in stone?

Why are languages treated differently to mathematics? Why will she not

accept our amendment, which would allow schools to select up to 10 per

cent. of their pupils on the basis of strength and aptitude in any

subject? We know that some children show potential in one area and

others in a different area. It is quite wrong to slant the system

against some of those aptitudes on the basis of which schools are not

permitted to select.</div><a name="0605023000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

return to Lord Adonis. His sagacious ideas have been at the heart of

the Committee&#146;s considerations 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 567</div>and of the Prime Minister&#146;s thinking. In his study, he drew

attention to the effect of the abolition of grammar schools,

stating:</div><a name="0605023000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In the

late 1960s the state grammar schools and quasi-state direct-grant

schools were intact, and together easily outclassed the independent

sector in terms of academic

output.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the

outriders of the Committee&#151;they seem to have become advocates of

private education on one or two occasions, although I do not wish to be

unkind to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough&#151;that many

of our state grammar schools routinely outperform some independent

schools.</div> <a name="0605023000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

nothing against private education, although I did not have one, unlike

the Secretary of State. I hope that my children will go to the local

state schools. Grammar schools and other strong, high-performing state

schools do an exceptional job, and while we should celebrate the good

work of the independent sector, we should not suggest that it cannot be

matched and beaten by the best of the state sector.</div>

<a name="0605023000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Adonis goes on to talk

about the decline of grammar schools and says that, over a

decade,</div><a name="0605023000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this meritocratic

pillar of the state school system collapsed, due to the attack by the

political class upon

it.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">He goes on to say

that</div> <a name="0605023000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the comprehensive

revolution tragically destroyed much of excellence without improving

the rest. Comprehensive schools have largely replaced selection by

ability, by selection, by class and by house price. Middle-class

children now go to middle-class comprehensives in catchment areas that

comprise middle-class neighbourhoods, while working-class children are

mostly left to fester in the inner-city comprehensives their parents

can&#146;t afford to move away

from.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

sentiment seems comprehensively to make the case for a system that

breaks the stranglehold of comprehensive education. I want to see a

flowering of diversity, and all kinds of schools doing their best on

the basis of high-quality teaching and learning. Education has the

capacity to elevate and inspire, and to change lives. We must replace

the hypocrisy and faded, faulted idealism of the past with a better

vision for our children&#146;s future. When the actors in the

tragicomic drama of this Committee melt into the air, the brief candles

of our passions, our humour and, on occasions, our disdain, will

flicker and die. All that will be left is what the Bill does&#151;the

difference that it makes. Our amendments and the Bill will be judged by

the differences that we make to schools and children&#146;s chances.

I want to be judged as someone who tried to do his best to make a

positive difference. I reject the amendments tabled by the hon. Member

for Bury, North, and strongly endorse our amendments because I resist

and, indeed, resent the continuing attack on selection, which has done

so much damage in the past, continues to do so, and may do so again in

future.</div>

<a name="0605023000127"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000357"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Part of the difficulty in discussing grammar

schools in a Committee such as this one is the disproportionate number

of people who probably went to grammar schools. People tend to bring

their own prejudices&#151;either positive or negative&#151;to the

debate. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)

made an interesting speech. I suspect that there is a game of long-word

bingo going 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column567" />Column number: 568</div>on on the Conservative Benches. I have no idea what the word sagacious

means, but perhaps he will enlighten us later.</div>

<a name="0605023000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am bemused about what

the Conservatives&#146; policy is on selection and grammar schools.

As the hon. Member for Gainsborough rightly pointed out, the logical

extension of the argument made by the hon. Member for South Holland and

The Deepings is to extend grammar schools. It is not clear to me where

exactly they fit. Perhaps the point is that the Conservatives have an

instinctive love of grammar schools, and they must have been

disappointed that Baroness Thatcher did so much to remove grammar

schools and put in place the comprehensive system. That inconsistency

has played throughout the

party.</div><a name="0605023000129"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000358"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Perhaps I can help the hon. Lady with some

clarification of our policy, which is clear. We do not want to do

anything that damages good schools, and 168 grammar schools in this

country are good schools. When we have a system in which 23 per cent.

of secondary schools are under-performing, and probably a similar

proportion of schools are coasting, it is in nobody&#146;s interest

to damage 168 very good schools.</div>

<a name="0605023000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are clear that we are not

proposing, when we return to office, to bring back the 11-plus or to

extend selection in areas that do not already have grammar schools. We

are clear that that is our policy, and we want to focus on the 4,000

comprehensive schools and the 24,000 schools as a whole, and to make

them good schools. That would be our focus, not getting bogged down in

the distraction about admissions, which is what this debate, and the

debate that we shall have on the next clause, is all about. The clauses

have nothing to do with raising standards in

schools.</div><a name="0605023000277"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

am</div><a name="0605023000131"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000359"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The hon. Gentleman said that he is against

extending selection, but that is exactly what one of the amendments

tabled by his hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings

would do. I am not clear what the difference is between selection on

ability and selection on aptitude, as stated by the hon. Member for

Bury, North and, indeed, the hon. Member for South Holland and The

Deepings. The policy seems to be entirely

inconsistent.</div><a name="0605023000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for South Holland and The Deepings made some good points about

social mobility. In fact, those are the points that I would have

thought would have united the Committee, regardless of which party we

are in. However, there is a serious problem that the most important

predictor of a person&#146;s future attainment would remain his or

her parents&#146; ability. That is an unacceptable situation. The

hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton questioned some of the

issues to do with intake, but his hon. Friend the Member for South

Holland and The Deepings seemed, on the contrary, to support the

position taken by other members of the Committee that this is an

important factor in a school&#146;s attainment. Surely the question

is what do we doabout

it.</div><a name="0605023000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although a return

to selection, or an extension of selection, may help social mobility

for the few&#151; 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column568" />Column number: 569</div>perhaps the most academically gifted&#151;it would fail those who are

less academically gifted, or less academically able at the time of the

selection test. Of course, that is the point. Many young people develop

at different speeds in different subjects, and further selection would

leave behind those failed by the current system. Other hon. Members

pointed out the number of young people in Northern Ireland who leave

school with no qualifications, which is surely unacceptable. Focusing

entirely on the social mobility of the brightest will not solve the

problem. The answer lies in early years education and the extra help

that we need to give to those who are either disadvantaged through

income or underachieving. That is why we have argued for more targeted

funding, aimed specifically at individual pupils. However, that is not

relevant to this debate, and I shall not prolong it

further.</div><a name="0605023000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have

seen, what we do with grammar schools is controversial, although I

thought that it had ceased to be controversial, given that all parties

had agreed that they did not want a return to the 11-plus. The question

is what we do about that. I am entirely in agreement with the arguments

made by the hon. Member for Bury, North about the impact of grammar

schools and the fact that it is unhelpful and unacceptable to extend

the system. However, we need to take people with us, and for that

reason, new clause 51 is extremely helpful.</div>

<a name="0605023000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I would not support

amendment No. 441. The critical issue is the ballot. At the moment, it

takes a relatively large number of parents to trigger a ballot, and the

ballot takes place with feeder schools only. If we had a different kind

of ballot, which included all the schools in a borough, not just the

feeder schools that have an incentive to send pupils to the particular

grammar school, we would have a different effect. Taking people with us

is important. We are an instinctively localist party, and on this

subject, we would not wish to be dogmatic and to impose

that.</div><a name="0605023000136"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000360"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Will the hon. Lady consider two points? The first

was made by one of my hon. Friends. Why would we want to go down the

road of ballots of this kind? These are a small number of schools, for

the most part doing excellent work. Would it not be a distraction from

the principal job, which she rightly describes as improving standards

in all schools? Secondly, is it not true that most grammar schools draw

in a large number of feeder schools&#151;it is certainly true in

rural areas&#151;meaning that the ballot would not be quite as narrow

as she

suggests?</div><a name="0605023000137"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000361"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Although the hon. Gentleman is correct to say

that they are a small number of schools, they are concentrated in

particular areas. In some areas, parents have little choice in what

kind of school system their children go through. In areas such as Kent,

where there are so many grammar schools, an awful lot of children are

affected by the 11-plus, and that is why we need a ballot system and to

encourage all schools in those areas to take

part.</div><a name="0605023000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000362"></a><b class="B">Annette

Friend agree that the most 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 570</div>important thing is to engage parents in a full debate on schools? That

is what is lacking. I live in a grammar school area, with a successful

comprehensive school a quarter of a mile away, but we have never had a

full and open debate. That has been lacking. I would not impose a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000366"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I tabled four amendments in the group. I shall

start by dealing with clause stand part and new clause 8. Basically,

the new clause would remove clause 36, which is logically in line with

what I am trying to achieve in setting schools free. The famous

election manifesto that swept the Conservatives to power in 1951 was

entitled &#147;Setting the people free&#148;. I want to set the

schools free, and that is what my amendments would do. They also give

me an opportunity to make some general comments of a clause stand part

nature, which I hope might be

useful.</div><a name="0605023000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that

Committee members are interested in my views and are waiting

with breathless anticipation for the publication of my pamphlet on this

subject next

week.</div><a name="0605023000147"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000367"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jacqui Smith):</b> Will you be

autographing

it?</div><a name="0605023000148"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000368"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> It will be a virtual pamphlet. We are very modern;

it will be published on the internet by the Cornerstone Group, of which

my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings is a

member. The Cornerstone manifesto is based on the saying, &#147;The

stone that was rejected became the cornerstone&#148;. I often feel,

in this Committee, likethe stone that was rejected. However,

we live in hope. As my hon. Friend said, it is ideas that matter. When

our brief life in this Committee flickers out like an 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column570" />Column number: 571</div>extinct candle, I hope that our ideas, and those of the hon. Member for

Bury, North, will go on flickering in some shape or

form.</div><a name="0605023000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why do I want to

get rid of clause 36? Let us consider what it does. Elsewhere in the

Bill, and in previous legislation, as my hon. Friend the Member for

South Holland and The Deepings said, assessment of ability in music,

dance or sport is allowed in schools that specialise in such skills.

The prevention of assessment in clause 36 covers intellectual ability

in English, maths, languages, science and so on. My hon. Friend made a

good point. It would be useful if the Minister told the Committee why

she feels that there is such a distinction between dance, music and

sport, and English, maths, languages and

science.</div><a name="0605023000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is not

as strict a divide between the subjects as might be supposed, which is

also interesting. Recently, comprehensive schools have been encouraged

to specialise in certain subjects&#151;for example, technology,

science or languages. We should like the Minister to say whether the

clause forbids assessment in those subjects, even for admission to such

schools specialising in languages, science or technology. I suspect

that that is not so. I am sure that the Minister will say that schools

will be allowed to select a certain number of pupils who are

particularly proficient in languages, science or

whatever.</div><a name="0605023000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

confusing the issue in many ways. The public are also rather confused

about what is going on. We no longer have pure comprehensives or

grammar schools, apart from 165 of the latter, and yet increasingly

schools are being encouraged to specialise in music, dance and sport.

Those schools can be selective. Schools are being encouraged also to

specialise in languages or technology, and presumably to a certain

extent they will be selective as well. What is going on?</div>

<a name="0605023000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apparently, everybody in the

Committee except for myself is convinced that there should be no

selection at all in traditionally academic subjects such as English or

maths. Why is that? Is there something special about English or maths,

or is that a political issue? Going back to Lord Adonis, is it the case

that the Government recognise the sense of selecting some, or indeed

all, pupils in certain subjects, but that they do not have the

political courage to go that final step and say that if it is all right

to select some, or all, pupils because they are particularly good at

music, sport, technology or languages, it would be possible also to

select pupils proficient in, for instance, maths? It is well known that

maths is a skill that is often innate. True, a pupil might have a

brilliant or bad maths teacher, but it is often an innate skill so why

can we not select for those with such a

skill?</div><a name="0605023000153"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000369"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I notice that, like a celebrity on a chat show, my

hon. Friend plugged his Cornerstone paper. He is mistaken: our

amendment would allow selection, up to 10 per cent., on the basis of

academic ability in mathematics or one of the other subjects that he

described. So we are not quite as he painted

us.</div><a name="0605023000154"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000370"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I was addressing my comments to the Minister. I

recognise that the view of my hon. Friend is that selection should be

allowed to a certain extent. However, if my hon. Friend thinks that we

should 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column571" />Column number: 572</div>allow 10 per cent. to be selected, why not go the further mile and say

that schools should be allowed to select who they want? I accept that

he takes a perfectly moderate and sensible line, but I do not

understand why the Minister feels that it is not possible to accept my

hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. Presumably, we will find out in a

moment.</div><a name="0605023000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It makes sense

to suit children to the type of education offered and to select on

ability and aptitude for those with a propensity for academic

subjects&#151;leading on eventually to A-levels and university. The

clause accepts the good sense of admission by ability to the existing

designated grammar schools and that those 165 schools will be allowed

to continue to select on merit.</div>

<a name="0605023000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actually, the hon. Member for

Bury, North made a perfectly reasonable point. Perhaps I should not

have mentioned him because I might not be summarising his case fairly,

but why is there an exception for existing grammar schools? Is there a

logical intellectual reason that existing grammar schools should be

allowed to survive, especially considering the way in they schools have

been abolished in the past, because they have been in odd areas and it

was not logical to keep them? Why should some people be subjected to,

or enjoy, grammar school education in certain parts of the country, but

not in others? Surely there is no real case in logic for retaining just

165 schools&#151;pure grammar schools, selecting on ability&#151;in

certain areas because of geographical and historical accidents, but not

allowing them to exist in other areas. Is not the real reason that it

is not worth the candle&#151;it is politically too much of a hassle

to abolish the remaining 165? If there are 3,500 secondary schools, why

go to all the effort of having massive local campaigns just to get rid

of the last 165 grammar schools? That is a fair point, but that is

politics and does not relate to education, logic or

forethought.</div> <a name="0605023000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would

be useful if the Minister explained why she wants to leave those 165

grammar schools in place. There is a perfectly fair case to be made for

having separate schools to cater for separate abilities and aptitudes

with each school creating a climate, ethos and specialism in certain

subjects. That would be a good system. Hence the grammar school, the

music school, the sports school, the dance school, the languages

school, the maths school, the classics school&#151;any school that

one can name. Most schools will not want to

specialise.</div>

<a name="0605023000278"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

noon</div><a name="0605023000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can tell my

hon. Friends the Members for South Holland and The Deepings and for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that I fully accept that in recent years

the Conservative party has, in a way, got stuck in a rut over grammar

schools. I did not agree with the policy of setting up a grammar school

in every town, or of putting that to people in the manifesto. We were

stuck in a rut because many of us went to grammar schools&#151;I did

not do so myself&#151;and were of the view that they were the way

forward.</div> <a name="0605023000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">When so few

people go to grammar schools it is difficult to make them politically

popular. However, the fact that we do not want to call schools

&#147;grammar schools&#148; should not prevent us from adopting

what would be the popular policy of allowing them to be in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 573</div>charge of their own admissions procedures. I have made the point before,

so I do not need to labour it, that there would not be a revolution.

Most schools would evolve gradually; there would not suddenly be lots

of new-style grammar schools popping up all over the country. Most

schools, allowed to do what they wanted to do, would remain broadly

comprehensive.</div> <a name="0605023000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

leads me directly to my next point. The alternative to specialised

schools for grammar, music, dance, sports, maths or classics, and the

approach that the Government seem to prefer, is for children of all

abilities and aptitudes to be put together in one school, the

comprehensive, which then attempts to cater for all possible abilities

and aptitudes. We now know that the pure comprehensive model simply

does not work. If comprehensive schools try to run with mixed ability

teaching&#151;that is, all abilities in one class&#151;they will

fail; and that is what they are doing. My hon. Friend the Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has made that point many times, and he

is absolutely right. The usual situation is that the teacher aims the

degree of difficulty of the lesson at the middle band&#151;neither

the very bright nor the very dull&#151;with the consequence that the

very bright underachieve because it is far too easy for them, so they

are not stretched and they soon get bored, and the least able are also

neglected because they cannot cope, are similarly ignored and also get

bored.</div> <a name="0605023000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most people in

this room would now agree that the model of the pure comprehensive has

failed; it is not a good model. We have to consider how to deal with

that, and the answer is streaming. One way is to stream the children

once they are at the school, probably in an A stream, a B stream and a

C stream. Given the usual general mix of abilities in a comprehensive,

there will probably be four streams&#151;one A, two Bs and one

C&#151;because the majority of pupils will be in the B stream. The

trouble with that is that it sounds sensible but it assumes a big

school.</div> <a name="0605023000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more

sophisticated the streaming, the bigger the school has to be because,

for economic and educational reasons, each class has to be of a

sufficient size&#151;say 30 pupils. The so-called A stream in such a

school, comprising the able children who would not go to a grammar

school, merely means that a grammar stream exists inside a

comprehensive school&#151;so we have a system of hidden grammar

schools in many comprehensive schools. The Government claim that they

are committed to the comprehensive system, but there is a grammar

stream in many comprehensive schools.</div>

<a name="0605023000163"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000371"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> Would the hon. Gentleman concede that pupils in

many comprehensive schools are streamed according to ability and

achievement in particular subjects? They are not singularly labelled as

being in the A stream.</div>

<a name="0605023000164"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000372"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am coming to that point. That is what is called

setting. Setting means doing the same thing&#151;separating groups of

children according to ability and aptitude&#151;but doing so subject

by subject. Thus, in theory, a child might be in A set for English but

C set for maths. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis

and Littlehampton is committed to setting. However, with limited

numbers of staff, it 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column573" />Column number: 574</div>makes timetabling very complicated. It also, again, assumes large

schools, and in practice most able pupils in the grammar stream will be

in the A set for almost all, if not all, subjects. What is called

&#147;setting&#148; because it is more politically acceptable often

means much the same as streaming, and it necessitates large schools. To

make streaming work it is necessary to have a four-form entry. If there

are 30 in a class, that means 120 pupils in a year, so we are talking

about a school of about 800 pupils. That would work for a comprehensive

school of 800 pupils, but would it work for a comprehensive school of

600 pupils?</div> <a name="0605023000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Committee will see the point that I am trying to make. Because we do

not have the political courage to set up separate schools for people

who are academically gifted, and because we have to cater for them

within the comprehensive system, we often create a very complicated

timetable and structure. We have to have big schools because, to make

setting and streaming work within the economic constraints and the

constraints of timetabling, a large number of pupils is needed. Yet

many studies show that many pupils are happier in smaller schools. My

personal experience is that children are happy in a school as small as

600 pupils or even smaller. Why should we create a system that needs a

minimum of 800 pupils in order to work? Because we do not have the

political courage to say that we are prepared to let schools do what

they want, with some schools becoming grammar schools, we are set in

this bind. My new clause 8 addresses that problem.</div>

<a name="0605023000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 367 would simply

insert a new paragraph (c) in the list of

exceptions:</div><a name="0605023000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the school is

comprehensive with a grammar

stream.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am talking

about what happens in many schools now. As some comprehensive schools

attempt to cater for the most academically able child by streaming,

having the pupils of high academic ability in one stream, the less able

in another stream and the less able still in the third stream, the top

stream is often called the grammar stream. But if that stream is to be

educationally and financially viable, enough children of high academic

ability have to be admitted to the school. Such a school would

therefore wish to assess the academic ability of applicants in order to

produce a viable grammar stream.</div>

<a name="0605023000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I would prefer the

clause to be dropped completely, if we are to have it, which clearly we

will, and if we are to exempt grammar schools from the prohibition on

admission by ability, it makes sense also to exempt those comprehensive

schools that have a grammar stream. Why, if are we exempting grammar

schools, are we not exempting comprehensive schools with a grammar

stream? I think that I know the answer: it is do with politics, but I

am not sure that there is a logical reason for it. Why should we

prevent the many schools that have a grammar stream from operating

effectively? The amendment would allow those comprehensives that stream

according to ability to assess ability as part of their admissions

procedure.</div><a name="0605023000169"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000373"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend is giving a comprehensive analysis

of the value and importance of streaming and setting. He will know that

in-school selection of that kind is dear to the heart of

myhon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 575</div>Littlehampton. Is not the problem that effectively we have selection by

postcode and by wealth? We have to focus on what we do for those

children who are not at the best schools, streamed, set or otherwise.

How will we improve their chances using my hon. Friend&#146;s

techniques?</div><a name="0605023000170"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000374"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. The Minister

and Labour Members have to answer this point. No doubt for very good

reasons&#151;I would say ideological reasons and they would say for

reasons of common sense&#151;they have created the comprehensive

system. In so doing they have thrown away the ladder that allowed many

people to escape from inner-city ghettos: inner-city grammar schools no

longer exist. That is entirely reprehensible. We now have

comprehensives, which used to base admission purely on a catchment

area, but now tend to be much more open. As my hon. Friend has said and

as others have said repeatedly, we now have selection by postcode. I

fully accept that.</div> <a name="0605023000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

fully accept what my hon. Friends, particularly my hon. Friend the

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, are trying to achieve. My

hon. Friend is extremely concerned about the existing education

establishment, especially in the many schools that have set their

hearts against streaming and setting. He believes that many children

are stuck in a system, in bog-standard comprehensives&#151;to quote a

phrase&#151;and they cannot escape. He believes that the way to get

round that is to insist that all schools stream or set, or have a

combination of the two, so that they get rid of mixed ability

teaching.</div> <a name="0605023000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely

agree with everything my hon. Friend is trying to achieve. The only

problem with it is that historically Conservative Governments have

found it virtually impossible to impose their will from the centre,

however well meaning their efforts. There are a limited number of

Ministers, dealing with 20,000 schools and up against a very truculent

education establishment, not least the teachers&#146; unions. When we

tried to impose our will through central direction we were

frustrated.</div><a name="0605023000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully

accept where my hon. Friend is, and where he is trying to get to, but a

future Conservative Government would find it difficult to achieve their

aims in the way he suggests, so I have an alternative approach: to

allow schools to get on with it. My hon. Friend will immediately say,

&#147;What will then happen to the bad schools? Surely they will just

carry on.&#148; That is true in life. I would say that parents would

leave those schools if they had consumer choice. My hon. Friend will

argue that in many areas it is simply not possible to leave a school,

which shows that there are infinite grey areas in all these arguments.

No one has the correct solution but we must feel our way at least

towards approaching these problems logically and not just on the basis

of what is politically feasible.</div>

<a name="0605023000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I like about Lord Adonis

and what he has written is that he has accepted the logic of many of

the arguments. However, I feel sorry for him because he is caught in a

political system in which he simply cannot deliver on the logic of

those arguments, nor can the Prime Minister. Therefore, they have ended

up with a Bill which, although it was portrayed as being 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 576</div>tremendously important and making a dramatic change to education, will

make very little difference in many

areas.</div><a name="0605023000175"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000375"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point as 60 per

cent. of lessons in comprehensive schools still take place in mixed

ability classes, despite a clear pledge in Labour&#146;s 1997

manifesto that it would increase the proportion of setting. No one

underestimates the difficulty of doing so, but it can be done. People

said the same thing when I first raised the issue of synthetic phonics

four years ago, but now the Government are going to change the law, and

by September 2006 synthetic phonics will be taught in all primary

schools. That shows that with determination, good research and the

dissemination of that research, the battle can be won. We must engage

in it if we are to raise standards in our

schools.</div>

<a name="0605023000176"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000376"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> That is a very good point, fairly put. I accept it

completely and wish my hon. Friend well when he becomes an Education

Minister. If he can impose his will, that will be tremendous. However,

he might find, as did as our noble Friend Lord Patten, that the

education establishment he is dealing with is very unresponsive to that

sort of

change.</div><a name="0605023000177"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000377"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I hope that my hon. Friend will exclude teachers

from that because they have been victims of the kind of dogma that he

highlights. Most teachers know what works best and they are desperate

to try to put it in place. They resist these things just as much as my

hon. Friend. Teachers are good people, trying to do their best, and

they deserve our

support.</div><a name="0605023000178"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000378"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> That must be right and we all have to say it,

although, sadly, there are many teachers who do not agree with me or my

hon. Friends on the issue. We must accept that many teachers do not

believe in the kind of rigid setting and streaming that my hon. Friend

is talking about. It is idle to suppose that all teachers are on our

side and that there is a vicious education establishment&#151;a crust

on the top&#151;which is working against them, supported by Labour

Ministers. I am afraid that many teachers are fully wedded to the

comprehensive ideal. Good on them. Why should they not be? It is a

perfectly logical system. I suspect that many teachers are much more in

line with the hon. Member for Bury, North than with the Minister. The

hon. Gentleman fulfils an important role in this Committee, because he

is speaking up for many hundreds, if not thousands, of people in the

education establishment.</div>

hospitals. They do want a good school down the road, but I get no sense

that, when they look into the matter more deeply and talk things

through, parents or prospective parents have any great opposition to

the concept of setting and streaming. I may be wrong, and of course

there will be some who oppose it. It all goes to show that we live in a

very complex democracy with a huge variety of views, for which we must

cater in every way we can. It is very difficult for any political party

to impose a certain set of views on the nation as a whole, when we are

an increasingly diverse

society.</div><a name="0605023000183"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000383"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> My hon. Friend is making some pertinent and

important points. My understanding of public and parental opinion is

that people do want rigorous setting in comprehensive schools. What the

Conservative party and I want is for the issues, instead of being

debated behind closed doors by educationists, to be debated in the

open. Ultimately the public will be able to decide what kind of

education system they want. I hope that come the next general election

it will be a key factor in determining the

result.</div><a name="0605023000184"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000384"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> That is a fair point. It is good that we should

have that public debate. But what has dominated the papers for a whole

week? Has there been a sensible discussion in the tabloid or broadsheet

papers about the debates in this Committee? Sadly, the papers have been

dominated by other subjects, which I shall not delve into. That is the

world that we live in, and there is not much that we can do about

it.</div><a name="0605023000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am interested in

the subject because my son is going to a comprehensive school in

September. He has been admitted to the school but went to take a test

on Saturday. Admissions are not based on ability but everyone who is

admitted is then rigorously tested. Another comprehensive school that I

know about, to which my son might have gone, operates a different

system. Before applicants are admitted&#151;before they send out the

letter saying that someone can go to the school&#151;they are tested.

The school claims that that allows it to get pupils with a broad range

of abilities, so that a third will be very able, a third middle stream

and a third the least able. I have some suspicions about that&#151;I

suspect that it is doing a bit of cherry-picking&#151;although I

shall not name names and identify the

school.</div><a name="0605023000186"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000385"></a>Meg

Hillier:</b> I am not going to ask the hon. Gentleman to name

names; however, the school that I visited most recently, the Petchey

city academy in Hackney, which will not open until September, operates

that very form of banding, which all new schools are taking up in

Hackney. They have a very comprehensive intake. They take children in

equal distribution across the four ability bands. The head teacher

praised that, and is not the only head teacher in Hackney to have done

so. The hon. Gentleman is making dangerous comments if he is suggesting

that the approach is used to cherry-pick pupils, when it is actually a

method for creating the most comprehensive balance possible in our

complex education

system.</div><a name="0605023000187"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000386"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am sure that some head teachers who are fully

committed to the comprehensive system use 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 578</div>that system of tests before admission to create precisely such a pure

comprehensive school. That is undoubtedly right. There are head

teachers who are fully committed to the comprehensive principle, but

there are others, and there is a suspicion that they may use the

approach I outlined. Some comprehensive schools seem to manage to

achieve a very high-ability intake, and to do very well in the league

tables.</div> <a name="0605023000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without naming

names, I simply make the point that it is difficult to impose by

central diktat what will happen to schools. Certain schools will be

committed to a certain form and others will be committed to another way

of proceeding. However many controls are established, and however many

clauses like clause 36 are passed, many schools will circumvent them.

We all know that quite a lot of fiddling with the league tables goes on

in one way or another&#151;children suddenly not appearing in tests

and all the rest of it. There is no point in denying it; it happens.

That is why it is idle to suppose that we in this room can create an

education system entirely according to our own lights. We are dealing

with such a complex situation that, ultimately, many schools will go

their own

way.</div><a name="0605023000189"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000387"></a>Ms

Angela C. Smith:</b> I ask the hon. Gentleman to substantiate

his accusation that our schools are fiddling the league

tables.</div><a name="0605023000190"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000388"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am not going to substantiate it, because I would

have to name names.</div>

<a name="0605023000191"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000389"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I would happily give the hon. Lady cases that I

am aware of&#151;cases of schools that do not allow children with

special needs to sit certain exams or SATs because that would drop them

down the league tables. I would be happy to give her the

evidence.</div><a name="0605023000192"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000390"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am happy to name a school that does the opposite,

because it is one that my own children went to. Our Lady of Victory is

a primary school that had a 100 per cent. record. It no longer has that

record because it now teaches special needs children. The school

believed that it was its duty to admit special needs children, and it

immediately dropped down the league tables. Therefore, it is not listed

in any of the national newspapers, although it is a wonderful school

where 100 per cent. of the children achieve superb

results.</div><a name="0605023000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know

that such things go on in life. It is not a criminal offence; it is not

even necessarily wrong. Schools are just trying to get the best

reputation that they can, and we know that that is

inevitable.</div><a name="0605023000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to

amendment No. 368, which would leave out the words &#147;or

any&#148; in subsection (2). Clause 36 will ban admission criteria

based on ability</div>

<a name="0605023000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for all or any of the pupils who

are to be admitted&#148;.</div><a name="0605023000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we

want academic standards to be achieved in our schools, clause 36 is

wrong. But if we are to have clause 36&#151;this is the point made by

my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings&#151;we

should permit schools to assess at least some applicants for ability

according to their judgment whether that is necessary. Leaving out the

words &#147;or any&#148; would permit that. Clause 36 will not add

to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 579</div>education improvement in this country. Without it, the system would be

much freer, and would achieve better academic

results.</div><a name="0605023000196"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000391"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Of course, even without clause 36, the provisions in

it would still be law. The clause adds nothing to the Bill; it just

repeats provisions from the School Standards and Framework Act

1998.</div><a name="0605023000197"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000392"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Consequent legislation would have to be made, but

my hon. Friend understands the point that I am trying to make. I have

tabled the amendments to stimulate a debate on the need for clause 36,

and I commend them to the

Committee.</div><a name="0605023000198"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000393"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Clause 36, which is important to the Bill,

reaffirms the Government&#146;s long-standing and strong commitment

to preventing the introduction of any new selection by ability at

maintained schools. The debate has been interesting, with challenges

from various sides. However, I intend to consider some of the

amendments in detail as well as to respond to some of the broader

arguments.</div><a name="0605023000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I start with

amendment No. 45, tabled by Conservative Members, which would allow any

school to select up to 10 per cent. of its pupils in any target-setting

subject for the specialist schools programme. That would include

mathematics, science, history and English. Currently, only a small

number of schools select up to 10 per cent. by aptitude.</div>

<a name="0605023000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">To correct the hon. Member for

Gainsborough, it is not the case that a specialist school can select in

any subject in which it chooses to specialise. We restrict in

regulations the subjects in which selection by aptitude is possible.

Only in approved subjects can that

happen.</div><a name="0605023000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because the

amendment would apply to all schools, it would be likely to lead to an

extension of selection, especially in subjects that are proxies for

academic selection. We do not depend only on our interpretation of the

amendment to be clear about that. The debate has been revealing,

particularly the speech of the hon. Member for South Holland and The

Deepings. There may be some contrast between his approach and that of

the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. We have learnt

today that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings is a

member of the Cornerstone

group.</div><a name="0605023000202"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000394"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am the chairman,

actually.</div><a name="0605023000203"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000395"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that he is the chairman. I

am not sure that he is completely happy with the stated policy of the

Conservative party. He certainly implied that he wants a return to a

process of selection by ability that goes further even than is

suggested in the amendments. The fact that he spent most of his speech

arguing the success of grammar schools was confusing for members of the

committee. I estimate that, in a speech of about 36 or 37 minutes, he

spent about six minutes on the amendments. The rest was a paean of

praise for grammar

schools.</div><a name="0605023000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure

that the hon. Gentleman has moved away from the policy of having a

grammar school in every town. He even suggested at some points that

part of the problem with that policy was that it was not very 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 580</div>popular, that it was caricatured and that the Conservatives had

therefore had to take a different approach to achieve the same

objective.</div><a name="0605023000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

repeatedly said that we do not want to increase selection by ability.

The amendment could do just that, and it would lead to a blurring of

the distinction between selection based on aptitude and that based on

ability. Hon. Members have asked me to outline that distinction, which

is reasonably clear. Ability is generally described as an all-embracing

factor that suggests whether a candidate will be able successfully to

undertake a course of study, and it could be considered a predictor of

overall scholastic attainment. Aptitude selection, which is allowed in

a small number of prescribed cases, is much narrower. The school

admission code says

that</div><a name="0605023000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a pupil with

aptitude is one identified as able to benefit from teaching in a

specific subject, or who demonstrates a particular capacity to succeed

in that subject.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

measures potential, not prior, achievement or knowledge. There is no

need for prior teaching in a subject for someone to show

aptitude.</div> <a name="0605023000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

distinction applies to the testing that will enable schools to identify

aptitude, as opposed to ability. Unlike a test of ability, which we all

know is more likely to be passed by those who have been coached in a

particular area, we are careful that testing for aptitude measures a

child&#146;s propensity to succeed rather than their ability. For

example, there are a number of effective measures of aptitude in

prescribed subjects, such as tests for aptitude in music that measure

children&#146;s propensity to recognise pitch, rhythm, harmony and

texture; those for aptitude in physical education based on the

fundamental motor skills test devised by the Department of Education

and Training in Victoria, Australia; and those for aptitude in

languages that measure the propensity of children to recognise the

meaning of non-familiar languages. In subjects such as science and

history, it is much less clear that a distinction between aptitude and

ability can be

made.</div><a name="0605023000208"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000396"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Many music teachers may well dispute the argument

that one cannot be taught how to hear pitch, or that that ability will

not improve with teaching. I certainly

do.</div><a name="0605023000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the Minister

not recognise that in 2003, the chief schools adjudicator, Philip

Hunter, said about specialist schools that finding a difference between

the meaning of ability and aptitude

was</div><a name="0605023000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the sort of exercise

lexicographers get up to when they haven&#146;t enough to

do&#148;?</div><a name="0605023000210"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000397"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> I think that I have just explained that there is a

difference between ability and aptitude. Adjudicators have found it

possible to rule which tests successfully test aptitude and which

ability, so it is possible to make that

distinction.</div><a name="0605023000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

pm</div><a name="0605023000211"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000398"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The right hon. Lady has identified the difference

between testing for potential, as she put it, and testing someone on

what they already know&#151;something on which they could be coached.

As she will know, propensity or potential can be tested for in the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 581</div>case of mathematics. There is a great deal of academic evidence to

support that. So why not extend the arrangements to

maths?</div><a name="0605023000212"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000399"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Because I have drawn on the evidence about the

areas in which it appears to be possible to test for aptitude

separately from ability. There is a strong suggestion that what is

being tested for in the case of maths is ability and previous teaching.

That brings us back to the crux of our disagreement. We do not believe

that we should extend selection by ability. Conservative Members do.

That is a fundamental difference between us and the reason for my

opposition to amendment No. 45.</div>

<a name="0605023000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 45, and the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s speech, hid the objective of returning to selection

by ability, although the hon. Member for Gainsborough is at least

honest about wanting to go back, pretty much red in tooth and claw, to

selection by ability&#151;or perhaps that should be blue in tooth and

claw. His new clause 8 would permit any maintained school to select

part or all of its intake on the basis of aptitude or

ability.</div> <a name="0605023000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have

made clear, we are developing an admissions system with the aim of

establishing equity of access to schools. The hon. Member for

Gainsborough made his view very clear: it is that not only should there

be no limit to the basis on which schools select, but&#151;this is

clear from his amendments&#151;there should not be any structural

framework for admissions arrangements. Fundamentally, he thinks that we

should return to a free-for-all with respect to admissions, with no

limitation on the criteria that schools might use to choose pupils.

That is the key point. He is arguing not for parents to have as wide as

possible a choice of school for their child, but for schools to be able

to choose the pupils that they admit. That is another fundamental

difference between our

approaches.</div><a name="0605023000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 367 and 368 would have much the same effect, by a slightly more

back-door route. They would permit more schools to select part of their

intake on the basis of ability by removing partial selection from the

definition of schools with selective admissions arrangements. I got

slightly lost as we went down various routes such as grammar streams

and pursued other arguments.</div>

<a name="0605023000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">To make things clear, the

Government support setting. There is more setting in secondary schools

now than there was in 1997. However, the hon. Gentleman took us back to

a rigid set of arrangements, which even he suggested would be difficult

to replicate in a range of schools. What is more, his amendments place

no limit on the proportion of children who would be admitted to such

schools on the basis of ability. The proportion could be anything from

1 to 99 per cent.</div> <a name="0605023000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once

again, the hon. Gentleman is proposing a back-door route for the

creation of grammar schools. We want a clear framework in our

admissions system, and a set of transparent and objective admissions

arrangements about which parents can feel confident&#151;not the

free-for-all, or even the furtive return to selection by ability, that

Opposition Members seem to be proposing.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 582</div><a name="0605023000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought that the speech of my

hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North about amendment No. 210 and his

other amendments was pragmatic and thoughtful, although I did not agree

with everything that he said. The hon. Member for South Holland and The

Deepings seemed to have written off his comments before he had listened

to what my hon. Friend had to say. He was not dogmatic; he was

reasonably pragmatic in much of what he said.</div>

<a name="0605023000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 210 would have the

opposite effect to those that we have considered so far. Its intention

is to prevent the operation of any selective admission arrangement

except as part of pupil banding. I have made it clear, as does the

Bill, that we do not support selection by ability at age 11, and we do

not wish to see it extended. There will be no new grammar schools.

However, since the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, we have had

a consistent policy on the process for decision making in respect of

the 164 schools that remain wholly selective. My hon. Friend suggested

that that is an abdication of responsibility. I believe that it is

being clear about where responsibility for decision making should

rest&#151;with the governing bodies of schools and local parents. It

represents a consistent approach to devolving decision making to those

who are most likely to be affected by the selection arrangements of

particular schools. That is why we established the grammar school

ballot system.</div> <a name="0605023000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taken

together, new clause 51 and amendmentsNos. 441, 442 and 443

would continue the legislation that restricts selection by ability

until the academic year 2010-11, after which amendment No. 441 would

remove the current regime and new clause 51 and amendment No. 442 would

mean that selection by ability or aptitude in secondary schools would

be allowed only where a parental ballot of pupils in local primary

schools had been held. Amendment No. 443 would then ensure that any

regulation made under that provision would be subject to affirmative

resolution.</div> <a name="0605023000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not

believe&#151;largely for reasons that I have spelled out&#151;that

those are appropriate additions. There is already a system that allows

parents to decide whether to remove selection from existing grammar

schools: if 20 per cent. of local parents support it, a ballot is held.

On the point made by the hon. Member for Brent, East, the eligible

parents from whom the20 per cent. come are those whose

children are at primary schools that send pupils to the grammar school.

That is a pretty broad range of parents, and she would make it even

broader. They cover a wide range of primary schools in an area. If a

simple majority is in favour of the removal of selection, it is

removed. In addition, on partial ability, parents, schools, local

authorities and, in future, admissions forums have a right to object to

admission arrangements that allow schools to select part of their

intake by ability.</div>

<a name="0605023000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further&#151;I do not think

that this is the impact that my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North

would want it to have&#151;the new clause would require the

revocation or amendment of any provision under chapter 2 or 3 of the

1998 Act. As a consequence, we would have to revoke or amend clause 43,

which allows for new forms of pupil banding. As we will discuss when we

come to that, there are strong arguments in favour of pupil

banding&#151;for example, it can help to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 583</div>ensure a broader range of ability in a school. I do not think that he

would want that to be removed.</div>

<a name="0605023000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would also

require the revocation or amendment of provisions that allow admissions

authorities to select up to 10 per cent. of their intake by aptitude. I

think that that is my hon. Friend&#146;s intention. However, there

are arguments for schools to be able to select 10 per cent. of their

intake by aptitude in limited circumstances in respect of a limited

range of subjects outlined in regulations. We would not want those

provisions to be removed.</div>

<a name="0605023000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">To sum up, my argument is that

the provisions allow the removal of selection where there is a call for

it. The amendments would have additional and unintended effects, which

could adversely affect the implementation of the provisions in the Bill

that are aimed at increasing opportunities for deprived children. If

the amendments were agreed, it would require a further amendment or a

repeal to facilitate pupil banding. We have in place suitable

provisions to ensure that that decision making can occur. My hon.

Friend referred to it in his contribution&#151;the decisions are

made, in these circumstances, at the appropriate level for those

impacted on by the selective arrangements of the remaining grammar

schools.</div><a name="0605023000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

209 aims to extend the prohibition on selection to academies. Although

it has that intention, I hope that I can reassure the Committee that

academies are already required by law to cater for children of all

abilities. They have a clear legislative duty to provide education for

local children of all abilities. Section 65 of the Education Act 2002,

which amended earlier legislation to enable the establishment of

academies, requires them to

provide</div><a name="0605023000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;education for

pupils of different abilities who are wholly or mainly drawn from the

area in which the school is

situated.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,

their funding agreements require them to comply with the schools

admissions code and admissions legislation. Hon. Members referred to

the new code. I can assure them that we will update annexes to existing

academy funding agreements to reflect its provisions. Therefore, the

impact will be that existing academies comply with the conditions of

the new admissions

code.</div><a name="0605023000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Academies are not

permitted to conduct admission interviews with parents or pupils, or to

introduce selection by ability. As with other specialist schools, they

can introduce up to 10 per cent. of selection by aptitude for

prescribed subjects. Also, they can introduce banding arrangements as a

means to ensure that they have an intake that is representative of the

range of abilities of all applicants, as, in fact, my hon. Friend the

Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) described in

relation to the Jack Petchey academy. However, none of the existing

academies select by ability, and the Secretary of State would not

approve a funding agreement for an academy if it proposed introducing

such selection. Finally, amendment No. 230 would prevent city

technology colleges from introducing selection by ability. However,

CTCs do not select by ability. They operate pupil banding to ensure

that their intake represents a broad range of

abilities.</div><a name="0605023000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had

a good opportunity to debate not only the amendments, but some of the

broader issues to do 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column583" />Column number: 584</div>with selection. I hope that I have reassured hon. Members that we have

in place what we believe are the right limitations on further selection

by ability in our schools; an appropriate process through which, at the

appropriate level, parents and governing bodies can express their views

about selection where it remains in our grammar schools; and a suitable

balance that ensures that admissions arrangements can recognise

through, for example banding, the need sometimes to be able to make

changes to ensure that pupils with a broad range of abilities are

admitted to particular schools. On those bases, I hope that all hon.

Members will feel able not to press their amendments to a

Division.</div><a name="0605023000229"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000400"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for responding to

the debate, and particularly to the amendments that I moved, so

carefully. However, it seems that the arguments about selection and

non-selection cannot be dismissed as easily as the Opposition would

like them to be. I tried to explain that we should focus on admissions

policies, not on the names of schools. However, Opposition Members

insisted on focusing on the names of schools, and we were dragged

inevitably into an argument about defending a certain category of

existing schools. I am utterly relaxed about the names of schools

because it seems completely irrelevant, but I am extremely concerned

about having fair, open and transparent admissions policies. It is

inconsistent for the Opposition to argue that schools&#146; intakes

are irrelevant and that we should not be discussing them, but at the

same time to spend virtually the whole of their contributions defending

the importance of preserving grammar schools&#146; intakes. That is

utterly beyond belief.

</div><a name="0605023000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

their arguments about the superior performance of the existing 165

wholly selective schools, and presumably of the other 35 or so

partially selective ones, are so solid and valid, the logic of their

policies should be, as I said earlier, to reintroduce selection in the

whole of the United Kingdom and go back to John Major&#146;s old

policy of having a grammar school in every town. That is not their

policy, because deep down they know that selection does not work to the

advantage of all

children.</div><a name="0605023000281"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

I was grateful that thehon. Member for Gainsborough appreciated that there is no logic in thecurrent arrangements; they are arbitrary and arbitrary solutions do notnecessarily deliver the bestresults.</div><a name="0605023000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">On intake, itis not a simple matter of abolishing certain kinds of schools. I do notknow of anybody who has argued for the abolition of any grammar schoolssince the days of Margaret Thatcher, who was the last Secretary ofState to suggest abolishing grammar schools and abolished a largenumber of them. We have got to get away from the idea of <div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 585</div>abolishing schools or not supporting good schools. Wherever there aregood schools, I want more children to be able to attend them. However,we cannot consider schools in isolation from the wider system in whichthey operate.</div> <a name="0605023000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Themerit in my amendment is that the status quo would apply until 2010,after which there would be an end to selection throughout the country.However, selection would still be subject to the existing rules onparental ballots; in areas that are currently wholly or partlyselective, parents would still have the right to vote on whether to goahead with ending selection in 2010. That is entirely in line with our1997 manifesto policy that, ultimately, such matters should bedetermined by parents. All I am arguing for is that the Governmentshould change the default position and see through the logic of theirown position on selection&#151;and the logic of the LiberalDemocrats&#146; position and the Conservatives&#146; officialposition.</div><a name="0605023000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wantto digress for too long, because lunch time is approaching, but while Iam on this subject I shall say a little more. I have retrieved theshadow Secretary of State&#146;s quote that I mentioned, and it isimportant that we get it on the record. Recently, on Teachers&#146;TV, hesaid:</div><a name="0605023000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Lookingback to my friends from primary school, the brutality of theeleven-plus and the ones who went to secondary moderns that is one ofthe problems with theeleven-plus.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have tosay that there was not much grammar in that sentence. Hecontinued:</div><a name="0605023000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It'swhy David Cameron and I have said that we won't go back to theeleven-plus in parts of the country where it's disappeared, &#146;cosI think&#148;&#151;</div> <a name="0605023000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">heactually said, &#147;&#146;cos I think&#148;; I would notnormally expect him to use that word, but perhaps one of his brains wasnot in gear at thatmoment&#151;</div><a name="0605023000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;choosingat 11 whether someone can benefit from academic education ornot...there's too many kids who develop after 11 and are not inthe appropriateschool.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there we haveit: the words of the shadow Secretary of Statehimself.</div><a name="0605023000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">A range ofoptions could be considered to replace the status quo. We need an open,transparent public debate, not framed simply by arguments about themerits of individual categories of school, but focusing on theimplications of particular admissionspolicies.</div><a name="0605023000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have arguedthat 11 is far too early to select children on the grounds of academicability. Given that we now have a national curriculum, it is almostimpossible to see the logic of segregating children at 11. I understandthat, 30 or 40 years ago, long before the national curriculum, thosewho did not go to selective schools did not pursue externalexaminations and, as late as 1970, therefore 50 per cent. of them leftschool without a single qualification to their name. I can see that inthose days there was at least a logic in segregating children at theage of 11. Now that all children follow the national curriculum up tothe age of 16, however, it is increasingly hard to understand what thepurpose is. As hon. Members on both sides of the House know, the realpurpose is social segregation, not the liberation of eachchild&#146;s intellectual potential.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 586</div><a name="0605023000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have proposed severalalternatives. For example, in certain areas&#151;I know some of themwell, although I do not wish to name them&#151;the best solution,which would be to the advantage of all children, would be to change thecharacter of the existing wholly selective schools so that they becamesixth form colleges. Perhaps, in other areas, the option of a 14-to-19school may be pursued, which would be an easy way of enabling morepeople to gain access to the current wholly selective schools. It mayalso be that, in some areas, parents would see the advantages of simplyallowing the existing grammar schools to expand on the basis of amixed-ability intake, whereby all children who entered after 2010 wouldbe of mixed ability.</div><a name="0605023000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Myrecollection is that, early in the Government&#146;s first term, Ipublished a Bill on the 10 per cent. issue. The proposals in my Billwere based on the argument that, having reached 10 per cent. byaptitude, the logical way of dealing with the remaining wholly orpartially selective schools would be to bring down the proportion ofchildren that they admitted from 100 per cent., to 90 per cent., then80 per cent., gradually in stages, until it also reached 10 per cent.All schools would then be able to select a maximum of 10 per cent.,either on grounds of ability or aptitude. There is an argument to bemade for universal entitlement to10 per cent. selection, sothat all schools would be able to select that proportion based onability or aptitude. I do not wish to pursue that argument, but it is apossibility.</div><a name="0605023000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000403"></a>Mr.Leigh:</b> A fascinating possibility just occurred to me. Thehon. Gentleman has made the interesting point that there is logic inallowing all schools to select 10 per cent. by ability. I understandthat that would be the view of the official Opposition. I suspect that,even if my free-for-all solution, which is viewed as so radical, everhappened, most schools would probably move to that position. So it is areal possibility that, if the different models proposed by the hon.Gentleman, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehamptonand myself all happened, we would all veer toward the samething&#151;which I suppose is life, is itnot?</div><a name="0605023000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000404"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. The moresuch issues are discussed outside the traditional framework of blackand white or either/or solutions, the more we are likely to move towardsolutions based on sound educational reasons, rather than on historicalattempts to defend socialprivilege.</div><a name="0605023000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of theConservative party&#146;s difficulties, which has trapped it over theyears and led its more forward-thinking members to abandon the oldpolicy of wanting a grammar school in every town, is that its argumentsare increasingly outdated, inaccurate or irrelevant. Conservativesalways refer to social mobility. A number of recent academic studieshave identified a slow-down in social mobility in this country. Forinstance, the LSE study lists a number of factors that may havecontributed to that, one of which is the change in the nature of theadmissions policy for secondary schools. However, the study doesnot&#151;as the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepingswrongly asserted&#151;conclude that social mobility has slowed downas a direct result of the change in the <div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 587</div>admissions policy for secondary schools. There is no assertion in thatstudy of any relationship between cause and effect. It would be helpfulif the hon. Gentleman spoke to its authors and asked them exactly whatthey think about thatrelationship.</div><a name="0605023000246"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000405"></a>Mr.Hayes:</b> With all his understanding and knowledge ofeducation, is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that there is nocause and effect between educational opportunity and attainment, andsocial mobility or that the abolition of grammar schools had no effectin that regard? If he is saying either of those things, he is steppingoutside the research data. He must knowthat.</div><a name="0605023000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000406"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> No, I am not saying that. I am saying that theorganisation of education can play an important role in the extensionof social mobility; it is not the only contributory factor. There arewider economic and social forces that are probably far more important.My key point, however, is that the hon. Gentleman was inaccurate aboutthe LSE report; it does not conclude that the slow-down in socialmobility is related to the changes in admission policies or thedeclining numbers of grammarschools.</div><a name="0605023000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Oppositionwill also quote at length from the league tables, and they have manyopportunities to do so. I imagine that they have teams of researcherstrawling through them to examine the GCSE, A-level and value-addedscores in many of our selective schools. It does not come as a surpriseto me&#151;I do not think that it will surprise many Committeemembers&#151;that schools that admit children with the highest levelperformance at age 11 are likely to produce children with the highestlevel of performance at 16 or 18. Similarly, it is not a surprise thatthe value-added scores in some selective schools are particularly good.Clearly, if the intake is full of young people who have the greatconfidence boost from knowing that they successfully passed a test toget into their secondary school, that will obviously increase theirexisting high levels of motivation even further, making it easier toteach and stretch them. The league table results&#151;even thevalue-added results of individual schools&#151;are not directlyrelevant to the wider debate about the basic organising principles ofhow we allocate children to secondaryschool.</div><a name="0605023000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The otherclich(c) to which the Tories always refer is the changing patternof entry to Oxford and Cambridge universities. Why we focus entirely onOxbridge is beyond me. The decline in the proportion of children fromstate schools over a generation was <div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 588</div>entirely the result of the direct-grant grammar schools opting out ofthe state system in the 1970s. It is utterly dishonest to draw anyother conclusion than that. They also refer to the work of Dr. JohnMarks, the leading intellectual advocate for their position. I shouldhave thought that John Marks is not entirely neutral in this debate,but I will return to other academic worklater.</div><a name="0605023000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000407"></a>Mr.Clappison:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman brushes over his lastremark about independent schools, the now independent grammar schoolsand social mobility, does he accept that the children who went to thosegrammar schools before the 1970s were chosen because of their ability,whereas, after the 1970s, children were chosen on the basis of theirparents&#146; ability to pay? That explains a lot about socialmobility, which the hon. Gentleman has damaged with hispolicies?</div><a name="0605023000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000408"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> It is true that the former direct-grant grammarschools&#151;not all the former state grammar schools&#151;thatopted out of the state system in the 1970s became fee-paying schools.It was actually Lady Thatcher&#146;s policy that led them to moveout. However, we will not pursue that; it is a matter for anAdjournment debate on anotheroccasion.</div><a name="0605023000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Socialengineering is the other issue that is always mentioned. Whenever theConservative party wants to block any kind of social change,improvement or extension of opportunity, it is all about socialengineering. It is beyond me why 1,000 years of maintaining elitistforms of education to protect the social privileges of an elite is notsocial engineering, but extending educational opportunityis.</div><a name="0605023000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member forBognor Regis and Littlehampton is a great advocate of streaming; hebelieves that schools should be forced to stream. It is difficult tograsp how that is compatible with his policy of devolving more power toindividual schools to decide themselves how they operate. It isimportant to say that, during the recent inquiry by the Education andSkills Committee into the White Paper, we considered the latestevidence on streaming from research by the Institute of Education andwe included a reference to it in thereport.</div><a name="0605023000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000409"></a>TheChairman:</b> Order.
