               <p class="tabbed">One
of the main themes in the NHS Future Forum report was the need for
better collaboration and integration between different care sectors and
settings. Although it is acknowledged that there are many examples of
integration between health and social care, too often services have
been fragmented and have failed to join up for the people who use them.
The amendments strengthen and expand the provision in the Bill for
clinical commissioning groups, and replace the board’s current
duty in relation to
integration.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
listened to the concerns of the Future Forum and others that the
existing duties on the board and CCGs are insufficient to promote
integrated care centred on the needs of patients, we are responding

June:<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Government has listened to patients and charities. National Voices
called above all for ‘integration, integration,
integration’, meaning that patients should get seamless services
and continuous care. The government has highlighted that goal and given
duties to secure
it.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000619">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
inserting new section 13J into the National Health Service Act 2006,
the Bill places a duty on the board to exercise its functions with a
view to encouraging CCGs to work closely with local authorities in
arranging for the provision of services. We recognise that that could
be perceived as giving the impression that partnership working is an
end in itself, and I therefore seek to amend new section 13J with
amendments 73 and 74, which place a duty on the board to promote
integration by requiring it to exercise its functions with a view to
securing that health services are provided in an integrated way when it
considers that that would be beneficial to the people receiving those
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new duty is concerned not just with integration between health services
or health and social care services, but with the integration of health
and health-related services such as housing that might have an effect
on the health of individuals but are not health or social care
services. An equivalent new duty is being placed on CCGs, and I will
come to the relevant amendment in a moment. The amended duty requires
the board to exercise its functions with a view to securing that health
services, health and social care services, and health and other
health-related services are provided in an integrated way if it
considers that that would either improve the quality of health services
and their outcomes, or reduce inequalities in access to and outcomes
from health
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Integration
can be an effective means of tackling health inequalities. People in
disadvantaged groups, for example, often experience multiple
disadvantages and complex co-morbidities. The new duties to promote
integration would cover integration between service types, for example
between health and social care, and between different types of health
services. Whatever the combination and however the services are
integrated, the practical effect should be that services are
co-ordinated around the needs of the individual. The duty would apply
to the board in the exercise of all its functions, not just its
commissioning
ones.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
board will be able to promote innovative ways of demonstrating how
health services can be provided in a more integrated way, for example
by developing tariff currencies for integrated pathways of care, and
exploring opportunities to move towards single budgets for health and
social care, in line with the Government’s wider proposals on
community budgets. Amendment 117 puts the same duty to promote
integration on CCGs. Clause 192 already requires CCGs, as
members of health and well- being boards, to encourage
integrated working between 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 243<a class="bkMark" name="Column243">&#160;</a>
                  </div>commissioners of NHS, public health and social care services for the
benefit of the health and well-being of the local population. Amendment
117 builds on that requirement and takes it significantly further. CCGs
could comply with the duty, for example, by choosing to commission
services jointly with local authorities. To my knowledge, this is the
first time that a Government have proposed in primary legislation a
duty requiring NHS commissioning bodies to promote integration, and it
demonstrates our strong commitment to integrated services centred on

                  </span> It is a pleasure to
see you in the Chair today, Dr McCrea. Listening to a debate about a
Government amending a Bill that only a few short weeks ago they were

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Future
Forum rightly pointed out the difficulties with integration in health
care, including the difficulties in the national health service now. In
its paper, “Choice and Competition Delivering Real
Choice”, it stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It is
clear the health service now needs to drive integration in a way that
has simply never happened to date. In practice, current contracting
processes, funding streams and financial pressures can actually
discourage
integration.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000621">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is true in my experience of health care. It goes on:<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“There
needs to be a culture in the service that both encourages innovation
and supports collaboration…But there are still too few examples
where NHS organisations have worked with each other to provide that
integrated care. If commissioners want to commission integrated care
they will only succeed in doing this by creating a new market in
integrated care services and stopping the current commissioning of
episodic services from different NHS
organisations.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000622">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>We
are celebrating the 63rd birthday of the NHS today—I had my
piece of cake on the way in. That those words ring true is a bit of a
condemnation of our health care system, particularly when we realise
that 70% of the expense of the NHS goes on looking after people who
have long-term conditions—not only one condition, but two and
sometimes many more. We still have a disconnect, particularly between
primary and secondary care, so I hope the intention behind the three
amendments is to bring that under statute and ensure that the position
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have a question about what the Minister has just said. Members know
that on two occasions during the previous Committee sitting, I brought
up primary health care services that are not connected, such as
dentistry, pharmacy and optometry. The NHS commissioning board has a
responsibility to negotiate the national contract, but there is no
statutory responsibility to talk to those three services’
organisations. The original new section 13J in clause 19 said that the
board
must<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“exercise
its functions with a view to encouraging commissioning consortia to
work closely with local authorities in arranging for the provision of
services.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000623">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
genuinely thought that the intention behind amendments 74
and 117 was to bring in those wider health care services, as we call
them, although they are provided by the independent
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000036">&#160;</a>

would mention other primary care services provided in the community by
other health care professionals, but the only example he used was
housing. Housing is normally, although not in all cases, a local
authority function—there is social housing and some privately
owned housing. Are we talking about the wider health community that is
providing services to NHS patients now through primary care extended

England to help people with lifestyle issues and wider problems, such
as long-term conditions. I am pleased that the Minister has made that

               <p class="tabbed">The

commissioners and providers about providing the right type of service.
Does the Minister believe that that mechanism, under the newly amended
clause 19, will be used to ensure that integration in commissioning
takes place properly? The Future Forum and many others believe that
that has not been very good in the past, as I have mentioned. I would
genuinely like to hear him say that the problem will be addressed, and
one way or another, I hope that we will see proper integration of
services through the amendment. I would like the Minister to say that
it will be about the wider national health service family and not only
statutory public bodies, such as local authorities and NHS bodies. If
we are going to take a comprehensive view on improving health care and
the population’s health, it is integral to local commissioning
that the health of the public is high on the
agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000041">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
want to say a few words about the duty to promote integration, and I
shall repeat a point, as I have done many times today. We argued
strongly during the first proceedings that the Government’s
original Bill risked setting different parts of the NHS against one
another, even though integrating health services both within the NHS
and within social care is absolutely vital to improving care for our
ageing population and for people with long-term and chronic
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000043">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I want to
correct the Minister, because he listed a number of organisations that
he said welcomed the amendments. I do not think that they did, however.
They may have welcomed what the Government said they would do in
response to the Future Forum document, but those organisations had not
had a chance to read the amendments, and it is important that the
Minister is accurate in that regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000044">&#160;</a>

“amendment”. We shall see from the wonderful <em>Hansard

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am still
concerned about the duties to promote integration as they are set out
in the Government’s amendments. The proposals remain weak. It is
unclear why the duties to promote integration relate only to quality
and inequalities in access and outcomes. Why not consider promoting
integration where we think it might help to deliver more efficient
services that would secure better value for money, particularly
considering the financial situation of the NHS?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
importance that the Government have put on promoting integration is
also interesting, when we look at what appears to have been a leaked
document about the design of the NHS commissioning board, which has
been made public today. This relates to a point from this morning. As
hon. Members will recall, the Minister clearly said that he was unable
to answer my question about how much money would be spent on the new
NHS commissioning board. He was unable to answer my question about how
many staff would be employed, and precisely what all its functions
would be. He said that it was too premature in the process. Yet the
document, “Designing the NHS Commissioning Board”, which
was leaked today, and is described as<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000048">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>Perhaps the Minister will let me finish.
First, on the specific clause, there is very little so far about
promoting integration. If there is such a strong duty on the
commissioning board to promote integration, I have yet to find a
requirement for that. Secondly, the document clearly states: that the
new commissioning board will employ 3,500 staff. If David Nicholson,
the chief executive designate of the NHS commissioning board, knows how
many staff he will employ, he will have a good idea how much they will
be paid, as well as understanding the board’s different
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The document
gives a detailed explanation of what the board will do and what its
functions will be. It will work on five domains—for example, it
will have a finance director—and all are listed in the document.
If the assessment is so clear, why could the Minister not answer our
questions about what the board will cost and how many staff it will
employ? Does he know what is going on in his own Department, or is he
simply not prepared to tell MPs, whose job here today is to scrutinise
the Government’s huge reorganisation of the
NHS?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000053">&#160;</a>

of information about how the board will work locally, but the Minister

                  </strong> I am grateful to you, Chair, for allowing us to
raise the issue. It is important in light of the Minister’s
refusal to answer questions this morning that his own Department has
clearly got far along the line in thinking through. In conclusion, the
draft gives us a much clearer idea of the timetable for setting up the
board. Again, we received very little information on that from the
Minister. The draft
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000066">&#160;</a>

               <p>It
is fairly hot at the moment; I imagine that this is the summer, even if
it is a British summer. We are in the summer now. Why do we not know
the senior appointments and how much those people will be
paid?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000067">&#160;</a>

feel that we have not had as much information as I would expect from

board is to recruit 3,500 people during 2012-13, the year of its shadow
inception, presumably those 3,500 people will be recruited from the
strategic health authorities and primary care trusts that still exist
at that point. Will that not cause chaos?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000069">&#160;</a>

unable to answer the question put to him by the Leader of the

£850 million had already been spent on redundancy payments, that
the people made redundant would not be re-employed in the system, is
that there are clearly plans to do so. On that point, understanding

rightly, in pursuit of effective scrutiny—I finish my

said to her this morning when we discussed the future of the

               <p class="tabbed">This
morning, the hon. Lady asked about the timetable for the progress of
the commissioning board as a shadow authority and when it will start
operating in full. I gave her the dates, because there seemed to be a
little confusion on the hon. Lady’s part as to which years it
would be. I am sure that she remembers that. The bottom line is that
she may have a leaked document. However, the document has not been
published, and I do not wish to comment on leaked documents at this
point. I shall stick by what I said this

of the business that we are about, which is effectively scrutinising

that information that is freely given to the Select Committee should be

leaked, and it is therefore in the public domain. The chief executive

I did say to the hon. Lady that I will not be giving way anymore. Given
that the Chair has generously given a lot of leeway during the

amendment. I think that the right hon. Member for Rother Valley would
like an answer to his point about quality standards and integration. I
say to him that the integration duty applies to all the board’s
functions, including the publication of commissioning guidance, which
will be based on National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
quality standards. I hope that he finds that

also want to refer to another point that the right hon. Gentleman made.
I reassure him that the board will be able to promote innovative ways
of demonstrating how health services can be provided in a more
integrated way. As I said in my original comments, that includes, for
example, developing tariff currencies for integrated pathways of care
and exploring opportunities to move towards single budgets for health
and social care in line with the Government’s wider proposals on
community budgets. I hope that he finds that of assistance. For those
reasons, not withstanding the distraction of an apparent leaked
document, I urge my hon. Friends to support the amendments, because
they are an important way forward for
integration.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000088">&#160;</a>

prevent the commissioning board, Monitor, and in certain circumstances
the Secretary of State, from having a deliberate policy aimed at
encouraging the growth of the private sector over existing state
providers, or vice versa. That would apply to Monitor and the NHS
commissioning board in everything they do across all their functions.
It would apply to the Secretary of State when setting objectives and
requirements for the NHS, whether through the mandate and standing
rules for commissioners introduced by clause 16, or through regulations
under clause 17, and it would set requirements for procurement, patient
choice and competition. In effect, any deliberate attempt to vary the
market share of a particular category of provider based on ownership or
status would be
unlawful.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000101">&#160;</a>

competition—we think destructive competition—in the NHS.
I would like to raise a potential unintended consequence of the
provision. In future, the Secretary of State will be prohibited from
encouraging the growth of the public sector, which seems a curious
constraint. Will the Minister confirm that that is what is suggested in
the explanatory notes and tell us whether he thinks that such a
provision is sensible? It would, for example, stop the expansion of
health care to take into account social care or other aspects of the
public

the hon. Gentleman does not mind. As we will discuss when we debate
clause 56, promoting competition will not be an end in itself.
Competition will be about creating choice and driving up standards for
patients, and there will be no hidden agenda concerning privatisation.

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 252<a class="bkMark" name="Column252">&#160;</a>
                  </div>State could still undertake action that has the effect of varying the
market share of a particular sector, if carried out for some other
reason. For example—this answers the point raised
earlier—the board must have the freedom to commission services
from the best providers, regardless of what sector they are in. The NHS
does not have a monopoly on being able to meet patients’ needs
effectively. There are strong examples of non-NHS organisations that
provide high-quality care, for example through hospices. There are also
examples where the NHS has not delivered high-quality care or has been
poor value for money. However, the board could not commission services
with the purpose of favouring one particular
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000106">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> No, not yet. Similarly, Monitor could take
enforcement action against providers that were in breach of their
licence, even if those were of the same type. Although such actions may
have the effect of varying market share, that is not their purpose. The
amendments make it clear that Monitor, the NHS commissioning board and
the Secretary of State should act in a neutral and even-handed way. The
Government want the private and voluntary sectors to play their full
part in improving quality of care and choice for patients, but we are
not in the business of favouring one type over another; and we are
absolutely not in the business of privatising the health service. I
hope that the Committee will welcome the amendments and the reassurance
that they
provide.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000108">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The amendments are not a safeguard. Although I
may be mixing too many metaphors, I think they are a fig
leaf—and a confused one at that. The Government are trying to
convince patient groups, staff and other professional bodies that they
do not have a plan to increase private sector provision in the NHS.
Yet, at the same time they want the right wing of their Back Benchers
to think that they are still pushing ahead with competition and choice.
They are trying to have it both ways, and the amendments do not
convince
anybody.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
heart of the Bill is that Monitor still exists as an economic
regulator, and UK and EU competition law is still being enshrined in
the NHS in primary legislation for the first time. We shall have a
debate about whether Monitor is promoting competition or stopping
anti-competitive behaviour, and whether it should be an economic or a
sector regulator. However, the truth is that the heart of the Bill
remains the same. The Government now refer to any qualified provider
rather than any willing provider. The idea that there would be somebody
willing but not qualified is horrific. However, the policy still
remains. Amendment 75 says that no one should purposefully try to
increase the proportion, which is in direct contrast to what the Prime
Minister said when he launched his first attempt at public sector
reform, in the long-awaited White Paper. He said this in <em>The</em>

example is the prison health service contract in the north-east of

then I will give way. On the one hand, the Prime Minister tries to
convince people that he is pushing ahead with what he calls public
sector reform, where everything is opened up to any willing provider
and there is no longer a presumption that the state should provide.
Yet, somehow with the NHS, that is not going to be the case. Amendment
75 states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000115">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I hope that the Minister will answer that
question. It is not accurate for the Government to say that the
amendment creates a level playing field for providers, because that is
not what it does. It is important that the Government are accurate in
what they say about what they are trying to do. A level playing field, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 254<a class="bkMark" name="Column254">&#160;</a>
                  </div>as we discussed earlier, relates to a whole host of other issues, such
as whether the private sector contributes towards training, whether the
full costs of care are recognised, and whether there is equal access to
commissioning bids among all different sectors. Later clauses will have
a far greater and stronger influence than this clause on changing the
make-up of providers in the NHS. This is an attempt to mislead people
about the Government’s wider purpose and it is
insufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000122">&#160;</a>

unintended consequences in particular wordings. I warmed to the hon.
Member for Easington, as I normally do, when he said that what we
really need to look at is the practical, real-term consequences of the
wording under discussion, as opposed to any other sort of wording. It
is hard to gauge, because although we are ostensibly amending clause
19, we are also dealing in part with clauses 56 and 110. We will,
therefore, probably have a larger and more thorough discussion on the
issue when we get to the big debate on Monitor, which is on the horizon

               <p class="tabbed">I
want to make a few remarks that might be helpful while not stealing the
thunder of that debate. The amendments prevent Monitor from arguing for
a fixed quantum of public or private provision, which I think most of
us would regard—as an a priori principle—as a bad idea.
Monitor is fundamentally tasked, as are most of the organisations with
which we are dealing, with doing what is best for patients. None of us
know which mix of public and private provision would be appropriate to
actually do that. Monitor’s primary duty is to look out for
patients and be mindful of the benefits of competition and integration,
but it cannot take into account in advance any particular view of what
would be the right level of public or private provision, particularly
if it is going to adjudicate whether or not contracts are fairly handed
out. It cannot pre-empt its
judgment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000124">&#160;</a>

really what it says? The actual wording in the three amendments

               <p>which
seems to be a different concept. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about
never being able to stipulate what the precise quantum of any one

The hon. Gentleman has just said it stops any shift. A few minutes ago,

regardless, and the hon. Member for Easington seemed to be under the

wanted to happen. If the critique is correct, one hon. Member has to be
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000127">&#160;</a>

                  </div>the actual ownership of a service when making a decision? They should
not be seeking to vary it. The amendment does not say that they cannot

                  </strong> I think that is the theory behind it. There is a
sort of plausible contemporary view that the commissioners and health
service should be, as it were, provider agnostic and indifferent. My
suspicion is that they will not be indifferent; GP commissioners will
tend to have a bias in favour of the public sector. My view is that
there probably are good reasons for doing that, which need to be spelt
out. One good reason, which no one has alluded to so far, is that if
the choice of choosing 100% private sector means that the public sector
fails, the public purse bears the cost of that failure, and therefore
we cannot be absolutely and completely neutral. Any public provider is
a public investment and lives by virtue of the public will, and we need
to be mindful of it when we run the NHS. So, absolute provider
agnosticism makes little sense. It also makes little practical
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are certain retail outlets—supermarkets and so on—that
sometimes use their own people and sometimes use a commissioned
service. Safeway sometimes uses its own lorries and sometimes uses
Eddie Stobart lorries. When it decides what to do, it has to think what
to do with its own lorries at the end of the day, and therefore
absolute provider agnosticism is not possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A perhaps
more critical point is that commissioners in the NHS, unlike any of the
private or voluntary providers, have to have a view with regard to
long-term sustainability. They have to ask themselves whether a
commissioning decision will lead to the long-term sustainability of
services needed in their area. If the private or social enterprise is
the peg upon which that is hung, we have to bear in mind that the
private and the social enterprise are there because they are promoters
and supporters, and not necessarily because they have to be there. So
the issue about long-term sustainability and the public provider being
a public asset makes pure commissioner agnosticism, if I can put it
like that, very
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000131">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am convinced that the commissioners have the
flexibility, within the remit of the legislation, to take into account
all the factors that I have spelt out without falling foul of Monitor.
Again, I do not want to pre-empt the big debate on Monitor, but my fear
is that Monitor would prevent commissioners from taking important
considerations—apropos sustainability and the failure of a
service—into account. What we cannot have, and the reason why we
have this particular clause, is a situation in which someone can
commission a public service as a worse alternative, as something that
is qualitatively worse than an alternative service. None 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 256<a class="bkMark" name="Column256">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of us could go out there and argue that the public
should accept a public service that is second best, simply because it
is a public service. That is why I think the clause is phrased as it
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is hard to see why public sector provision—if it is, indeed,
inspired by public service ethos and unencumbered by any need to make a
shareholder profit and if it exists on a level playing field, which is
the crucial consideration that the hon. Lady has brought to our
attention—should not, in most circumstances and when it chooses
to do so, excel in its performance compared with the private sector.
The Government are taking especial pains—they should be given
credit for that—to level the playing field. I am convinced that
they intend and want to do that, and I hope that the legislation will
succeed in doing
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000134">&#160;</a>

exact purpose of the amendments. The greater problem is that the Bill,
in terms of introducing competition law, remains unchanged and
uninfluenced by the recent pause. Members will remember my interaction
with the Secretary of State in the first sitting on the recommitted
Bill, when I questioned him about the unaltered clauses 64,
65 and 66, which are the first three clauses that relate to
competition. I will not read it all out, but I remind the Minister, who
was sat next to him at the time, that his right hon. Friend
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000135">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“In
so far as Monitor will have licensing responsibilities, it will be able

the clause that I and that the Secretary of State were referring to

referred to the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.
That is what destabilises the national health service. It destabilised
it on the first day, and it remains destabilised in that way. Making

clinical commissioning groups’ duties in relation to public
involvement and consultation. The Government amendments are designed to
strengthen local arrangements for public involvement and consultation,
responding to the recommendations from the NHS Future Forum. I will
take the amendments in two sub-groups. The first sub-group includes
amendments 76 and 118, which amend the public involvement duty on the
NHS commissioning board and CCGs in new sections 13L and 14P of the
2006 Act by removing the word
“significant”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000148">&#160;</a>

NHS commissioning board and clinical commissioning groups are currently
required under new sections 13L and 14P to make arrangements to secure
that the public are involved first, in planning commissioning
arrangements; secondly, in developing and considering proposals for
changes in commissioning arrangements; and thirdly, in decisions
affecting the operation of commissioning arrangements. These sections
are modelled closely on the existing duties on primary care trusts and
strategic health authorities in section 242 of the National Health

               <p>The
rationale for this was to avoid unnecessary or disproportionate burdens
on commissioners. However, Future Forum and a number of charities that
responded to the listening exercise raised concerns that that could
restrict the scope for public consultation on major service changes and
create questions about what would count as a significant change.
Responding to these concerns, we have introduced the amendments to
remove the word “significant” and to bring the duties
into line with the current section 242 duty in the 2006
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000151">&#160;</a>

in the planning and development of commissioning arrangements. That is
a similar amendment to one that we debated during the first Bill
Committee proceedings, which the hon. Member for Islington South and
Finsbury withdrew. As I said, the drafting of new sections 13L and 14P
follow the existing wording in section 242 of the 2006 Act by stating
that individuals may be involved<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000152">&#160;</a>

Bill also provides a power, in new section 14P(3), for the board to
issue statutory guidance to CCGs in relation to this duty, to which
they must have regard. That could be used to make clear the importance
of proportionality and to provide examples of it. That flexibility is
there for a very good reason: to ensure that CCGs can act
proportionately in involving patients and service users. I think we
would all agree that a 12-week consultation on, for example, changing
the time of a surgery by 10 minutes would be wildly disproportionate. I
hope that removing the word “significant” from new
section 14P to bring the duty fully into line with the current duty in
the 2006 Act satisfies the general intention behind amendment 8 and the
concern previously expressed by the hon. Member for Islington South and
Finsbury that the duty, in being fulfilled,<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000154">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Turning
to the second sub-group, amendment 119  is an important
amendment that responds to the recommendation by Future Forum that the
board should place particular emphasis on the plans that prospective
CCGs have for involving the public when considering applications for
authorisation. It would require CCGs to include in their constitutions
a description of the arrangements they have made to fulfil their duties
under new section 14P in respect of public involvement and consultation
and a statement of the principles that they will follow in implementing
those arrangements. The board would need to be satisfied that a
prospective CCG’s proposed constitution is appropriate in that
respect when considering its application for establishment under new
section 14C. We also intend, Opposition Members suggested, in the
spirit of helpfulness, in the first Committee proceedings, to amend the
provision both for CCGs’ commissioning plans and for their
annual assessments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000155">&#160;</a>

will require CCGs to explain in their annual commissioning plans how
they propose to discharge their duty under new section 14P to involve
and consult the public, in addition to the current requirement that
they explain how they propose to discharge their duty under new section
14L to improve the quality of services. The Bill already requires that
a CCG’s annual report must explain how it has discharged its
duty to involve and consult the public. Amendment 136 will
require that, when the board conducts a performance assessment of each
CCG in respect of each financial

to those changes, amendment 78 will require the board to explain in its
annual business plan how it proposes to discharge its public
involvement duty under new section 13L, in addition to explaining how
it proposes to discharge its duty to improve quality under new section
13D. Amendment 78 also requires the board to explain in its business
plan how it proposes to discharge its financial duties under new
sections 223D to 223DB. The amendment brings the board into line with
the requirements on the annual commissioning plans of
CCGs.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000157">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">This
is a serious point. The Minister has removed the requirement that GPs
need only consult on significant service changes. Does that mean that
GPs will have to consult patients and the public if a bay in a hospital
ward closes, if a whole hospital ward closes, or if out-patient
appointments for dermatology, which have been discussed today, are
shifted out of hospitals and into the community? Would a GP service
have to consult if it decided to provide a different form of district
nursing, swap a well woman clinic or stop running smoking cessation
services? A number of people have rightly asked whether GPs might now
be required to consult on every single change. To keep it simple, as
the Minister likes it to be, will he say whether they have to consult
on the closure of a hospital ward?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000165">&#160;</a>

thought that if I made her feel comfortable by using the terminology of

decisions and the board will provide similar guidance for clinical
commissioning groups in due course. I think that we can guess that on
some of the examples that she gave, the answer will be yes. I do not

                  </strong> This is a probing amendment, so I will be relatively

safety is a paramount consideration for us all. I am chair of the
Patients Association all-party group and this is very much on our
agenda. It is clear that there is a long history on this subject. In
the past, information on risks and clinical safety has been not only
not disclosed, but at times covered up. One thinks of the Mid
Staffordshire and Bristol cases, and one thinks of the fate of
whistleblowers. Over the weekend, <em>The Independent </em>made quite a
deal about the fate of whistleblowers, which was not
encouraging.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000179">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">I
accept that no service is risk-free and that judgments on safety are
sometimes best made by informed opinion, but our concerns have been
accentuated by the abolition of the National Patient Safety Agency
under clause 274. I understand the argument for that,
because the Minister expressed it relatively clearly in our first
thrashing out of the Bill. He suggested that the NPSA was simply being
brought in-house to allay concerns about conflicts of interest with the
national commissioning board, within which it is hosted, and that there
would be a Chinese wall between the section of the national
commissioning board that deals with reporting patient incidents and
safety and the bit that does the commissioning. The general function
and objective behind it was to embed safety in NHS culture, and I think
we all applaud that. En passant, clause 274 also changes the NHS
Redress Act 2006. I served on that legislation, and I am not certain to
what it extent it is implemented or in force today. We might want to
revisit that territory.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The current
NPSA website has a series of protocols about disclosure, freedom of
information and transparency and a scheme for publication of data. The
agency put a very clear, overt and explicit system in place, which one
assumes will be replicated in part within the national commissioning
board. The board is also a commissioning body, however, as opposed to a
source of useful information on breaches of patient safety. It strikes
me that in the process of commissioning and monitoring contracts, the
board will acquire genuinely interesting information about the risks of
the service, but such information would not necessarily be formally
available to whatever branch of the national commissioning board
replicates the NPSA, because, as the Minister says, there will be a
Chinese wall between the two. That is why I am slightly concerned that
the national commissioning board is free to decide on the appropriate
person to whom information on patient safety may be disclosed, or
rather I will be concerned until the Minister has expanded on that
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It may not be
service users who have the biggest interest in knowing which of the
services that they are using are safe. In some circumstances, the
national commissioning board may not want fully to disclose information
about the safety of individual services. That may be, first, because of
a breach of contractual confidentiality that might occur from time to
time, or breaches of contractual confidentiality may be implicated in
disclosure. Secondly—as the hon. Member for Leicester West said
when we first discussed clause 274—clinical 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 262<a class="bkMark" name="Column262">&#160;</a>
                  </div>safety issues may hinge on commissioning decisions. A less clinically
safe environment might be produced by a
commissioning decision, so there may be a conflict of interests of
sorts.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000182">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, to
some extent it always weakens the authority of a commissioning body if
is completely and utterly overt about clinical safety. I have
noticed—this may  be a cynical observation—a
tendency for clinical commissioning bodies, particularly when they are
dealing with reconfigurations, to work out what configurations are
suitable and attractive given their overall objectives, and to cite
clinical evidence partially in favour of closing whatever facility they
wish to close and not giving an even steer. I have certainly noticed
that, as an accusation if not as a fact, when reconfigurations occur.
There are reasons, therefore, why a national commissioning board might
not be as overt and as explicit we would
like.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000183">&#160;</a>

has sparked a thought in my mind that has not occurred to me before. I
wonder whether he shares my concern about whistleblowers. Under the
Bill, clinical commissioning groups, as they are to be known, will have
licence to set staff terms and conditions, and there may be arms of
commissioning groups that are in the private sector or at longer
arm’s length from the NHS. Is the hon. Gentleman not concerned
that there might be less freedom for individuals working in the new
architecture to raise concerns? There might even be contractual
obligations on them not to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000184">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I have mentioned that concern, but the hon.
Gentleman has given me cause to reflect. The Secretary of State himself
has mentioned that clinical safety is not necessarily dealt with well
in the health service. Clinical safety considerations are often muddled
up with other issues, such as financial viability, and in many
configuration decisions pleas based on clinical safety are often
founded in a different sort of consideration. The different
considerations get enmeshed, and clarity and transparency are the
obvious
antidote.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000185">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. In the
previous Parliament, I sat on a Select Committee that considered
patient safety and produced a report. On whistleblowing, we thought
that there were a number of great weaknesses in the system. On
occasion, whistles are not blown, as in the Mid Staffordshire case, on
which we took evidence. In the recent atrocious events in a care home,
we see a situation in which the whistle was blown but ignored by people
who should have known better. The Health Committee in the previous
Parliament recommended that we should have a statutory body very much
like the one in New Zealand, so that anyone, no matter what their
contractual relationship with the health service, and whether they are
a patient or not, can go to that body, which can investigate, sometimes
anonymously so that the careers of people who want to alert the
establishment to patient safety issues are not
threatened.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000186">&#160;</a>

                  </div>and without leaving that decision solely to the discretion of the board?
Although there might be a Chinese wall between the two compartments of
the board, I would be much relieved to know that the transmission of
information through it went both ways. I am certain that if something
is reported to the NPSA arm of the national commissioning board, it
will be passed to the commissioners, but if the commissioners chance
upon something regarding the safety of services they commission,
certain interests they have might mean that they do not go for full
disclosure. That is my concern. The amendment is a probing one, and I
will welcome the Minister’s
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000188">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As all right hon. and hon. Members will appreciate,
patient safety is of the utmost importance and is at the heart of a
modernised NHS. The Bill aims to embed patient safety across the whole
of the NHS, for example through placing the definition of quality,
which includes patient safety, in legislation for the first time. I
thank the hon. Member for Southport for raising a number of interesting
and valid points, and I hope to reassure him with my
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
228 would require the board to make information it collected on patient
safety and its resultant analysis more widely available to such people
as it considered appropriate. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right
that information that can inform and enhance patient safety in the NHS
should be made available to everyone who would benefit from it. The
public are also entitled to know how the NHS is performing on patient
safety.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000190">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
requires the board to make appropriate information available to any
person it considers appropriate and to give advice and guidance to the
NHS. If the board did not make important information available to
people it thought could reasonably benefit, it would be in breach of
its duty. For instance, the National Patient Safety Agency currently
collects and analyses information on safety incidents in the NHS, using
the national reporting and learning system, and provides solutions to
safety issues that are identified. It then disseminates alerts or
guidance on urgent patient safety issues to the NHS through the central
alerting system. Those responsibilities will move to the NHS
commissioning board, covering the whole function, from compiling the
evidence, using issuing alerts and providing overall national
leadership for safety and quality improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our intention
is to bring that function under the responsibility of the commissioning
board to create a more direct link between learning from patient safety
incidents and reflecting that in how the board exercises its
commissioning functions, and, for example, the guidance it will produce
for clinical commissioning groups. We believe that that will enhance
our efforts to embed a culture of patient safety in the NHS. In
addition to NHS bodies, that information is currently also
used  to develop products for use by non-NHS organisations, the
devolved Administrations and international organisations. The ability
to share more widely allows the board to make the judgment as to who
else could benefit from the information and to recoup the
costs  of doing so while maintaining protections around
confidentiality. However, we would not want to remove the discretion
for the board to determine when it would be appropriate to provide such
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000192">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would also have the unfortunate effect of creating a greater obligation
for the board to make available all the information it gathered in
relation to patient safety, much of which is sensitive, confidential
and identifiable to individual patients. Notwithstanding the
protections offered by the Human Rights Act 1998 and by data protection
Acts, it remains important to provide some parameters for the board as
to whom it could share that information with. That would be difficult
to stipulate in legislation, which is why the clause allows the board
to use its judgment about what should be made available, and to what
audience.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 229
would provide powers for the board to disclose information under
section 13X for the purposes of patient safety. Once again, the hon.
Member for Southport makes an important point: the board should not be
prevented from disseminating important information that could help
prevent a situation in which patient safety is jeopardised. I hope that
I can reassure him on that point. Subsection 1(d) goes some way to
addressing that, as it allows the board to disclose information when
that is necessary to protect an individual’s welfare. There may,
of course, be incidences where the board may disclose information on
any potential threat to patient safety in order to prevent it from
materialising. However, in that case, the disclosure could be covered
under subsection 1(f), as being for the purpose of facilitating the
exercise of the board’s patient safety functions under section
13M.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is our
intention that the board should be able to disclose information where
that would be in the interest of patient safety. However, I am prepared
to look again at the clause to see if there is a need for the wording
to be made more explicit in that regard. I hope that that reassures the
hon. Gentleman and that he will agree to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000195">&#160;</a>

minor and technical amendments with a common purpose—to ensure
that when a commissioning body, either the NHS commissioning board or a
clinical commissioning group, exercises a function jointly or delegates
it to another commissioner as allowed by terms of the Act, it does not
affect the liability of that commissioner for its statutory
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000200">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">One of the
strengths of the proposed new arrangements for commissioning is the way
in which they will facilitate collaborative working between different
organisations. Individual clinical commissioning groups will be able to
join together, with suitable risk-pooling arrangements and sharing of
budgets, to commission more effectively low-volume but high-cost
treatments. The Bill gives CCGs the flexibility to adopt a lead
commissioning model for large providers. Such models will allow
effective management of the interests of a larger number of CCGs, not
only in the design of services and contracting, but also in any major
reconfiguration. The Bill also contains a power for regulations to
provide CCGs to exercise particular functions jointly with Welsh local
health boards in cross-border areas. In those instances, the
regulations may provide for any such functions  to be exercised
by a joint committee of the NHS commissioning board and the
CCG.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000201">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
the NHS commissioning board may exercise functions jointly with, or
delegate its exercise to, special health authorities, CCGs or other
prescribed bodies to ensure that the right arrangements are in place at
the right times for commissioning the services for which it has
responsibility, and ensuring that it exercises appropriate oversight of
the NHS. Among the commissioning board’s responsibilities, it
must ensure that it has systems for collecting and analysing
information relating to the safety of services, which it might delegate
to an individual or another NHS body, which allows it to exercise the
right expertise and capacities.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments will ensure that in all such forms of collaboration, joint
working and delegation of function, the liability of the board or CCG
remains unchanged. Functions and activities might be delegated, but the
liability—the statutory commissioning responsibility that is
placed on both board and the CCGs—cannot be delegated or
transferred to another body or individual. That safeguard is necessary,
not least to preserve confidence in the NHS among patients and
professionals who have voiced concerns and misconceptions that general
practice-led commissioning consortia might outsource their
commissioning functions and, effectively, abdicate their responsibility
to patients. That is clearly not so, and it was never the policy
intention. However, the amendments establish in the Bill the principle
that responsibility for statutory functions cannot be transferred and
remains vested in the commissioning
organisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000205">&#160;</a>

whole sections of commissioning can be outsourced to the private
sector. That was the concern raised by the Future Forum. The point that
I am making in scrutinising the Bill is that, in the
Government’s response to the Future Forum, they convinced people
that that would not be allowed to happen. The amendment does not
prevent it from happening, which is the impression that the Government
have given. It does not match up to what was said and many members of
the Future Forum and the wider public will be
concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000216">&#160;</a>

               <p>including its principal
function of commissioning. All it says is that even if the board hands
off any of its most important functions to a third party, the
commissioning group will ultimately retain legal liability. I would
have thought that that was a statement of fact. The analogy that I
would draw is that if a bank decides to outsource to the other side of
the world responsibility for providing advice from its call centre, the
bank is still responsible for the advice given, but that does not mean
that the recipient of the advice will be happy with the service
received.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000218">&#160;</a>

is that the Government have given the strong impression since the

services, are not privatised. The amendment will not prevent that; it
only says that ultimately, commissioning groups will retain legal
liability. That is not what the Government suggested they would do, and
the Opposition will certainly be working hard to ensure that
professional bodies, patients’ organisations and others know

opposite are in Government, unfortunately, and it is their role to draw

According to the amendment, that can still be outsourced to the private
sector. The amendment specifies only that legal liability remains.
Where is the clause that says that health and well-being boards can
call in the private sector commissioners to question them about their
decisions? It says that they can call in providers of services to
examine what they are doing—that is a new addition to the
Government’s plan—but not the commissioners. With the
greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, to whom I always listen, those
questions are more for his party and the Government than for ours,
because it is their legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000222">&#160;</a>

be outsourced to Capita. I regret that, but it does not alter the

exchanges between the hon. Members for Leicester West and for
Southport. Let me explain the matter. CCGs always remain responsible
for their functions. Yes, they can get support in how those functions
are exercised, as PCTs can do at the moment. However, the final
commissioning decisions remain with the CCG. The hon. Lady has asserted
on a number of occasions that CCGs could outsource their commissioning
functions to a private company. I have to tell her that using the term
“private sector commissioners” is not helpful because it
is a complete misnomer. There will be no such things. CCGs can be
supported by other bodies, but they are the commissioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000230">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me pick
up the point made by the hon. Member for Southport. The straightforward
answer to whether a clinical commissioning group could outsource its
commissioning functions to a private company is no. A CCG could not
transfer its commissioning budget to a different organisation and
arrange for that organisation to provide all the services that the CCG
is required to commission. It would be unlawful and it could not
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000231">&#160;</a>

               <p>Opposition Members are
concerned that that section opens up the possibility of GP
consortia—or clinical commissioning groups, as they are now
called—being able to generate additional income through charging
for services. Amendments 4 and 9 would place a clear duty on the
Secretary of State to publish guidance for both the board and consortia
that they must abide by when they are raising any additional income
under the Health and Medicines Act 1988. The Minister would no doubt
deny that there is any underlying aim or objective in allowing GPs or
others to charge for services. Despite some GPs who were mentioned last
week wanting to

pay for them, it is clear that that is not what the Government intend.
I am sure that they will join us in voting for our amendments, as it
would give ultimate responsibility to the Secretary of State to set
clear guidelines on how additional income is to be generated and in
which areas. Responsibility would finally lie with the Secretary of
State and not with GPs or others. It is on that simple and

those of the commissioning board and clinical commissioning groups, may
have been prompted by a misunderstanding. The provisions that the
amendments seek to amend are based on powers currently possessed by the
Secretary of State and PCTs under section 21(5) of the 2006 Act, which
was introduced by the previous Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000239">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those powers
play a valuable role. They allow the NHS commissioning board and CCGs
to raise additional income for improving the health service through
various means. I urge Opposition Members to listen carefully to this,
so that they do not misunderstand. Those means include selling
goods—for instance, assets in the possession of a CCG such as
vehicles; dealing with land if it is surplus to requirements; the
provision of training and development to, for example, another clinical
commissioning group; or marketing their intellectual property, for
example by developing and selling computer software for analysing local
demand. Any income raised through these means would be reinvested in
the health service.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000240">&#160;</a>

commissioning groups to charge patients for services that they receive
from the NHS, or to otherwise charge for work conducted in the exercise

critical part of my speech. They would not allow the board or CCGs to
charge patients for the services that they receive from the NHS, or
otherwise to charge for work conducted in the exercise of their

Gentleman’s question is leading. So as not to trip up, I shall
give the caveat that the examples that I gave were illustrative so as
to draw out when a body might raise funds by disposing of items that
were surplus to requirements, such as vehicles, land and so on. It has
nothing to do with charging patients for care. I am trying to repeat in
the clearest, loudest terms possible that that does not include
introducing charges for patient care. I do not think there is anything
to argue about; it is quite clear cut. Charging by commissioners in
exercising their duties is prevented not only by
the exclusion of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 271<a class="bkMark" name="Column271">&#160;</a>
                  </div>such powers from the Bill, but by separate regulations governing the
application of charging patients, which expressly prevent any charging
except in permitted circumstances in which it is a long-established
principle, such as prescriptions, dental care and hospital care for
overseas visitors in certain
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000243">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have also made clear our continuing commitment to the NHS constitution
and the rights and values it enshrines, including the principle that
NHS care is available free at the point of use to all those eligible to
use it. As we have already discussed, we intend to introduce a new
statutory duty for the commissioning board and CCGs to act with a view
to securing health services provided in a way that promotes the NHS
constitution, including raising awareness of it among patients, staff
and the wider public, for example when consulting on commissioning
plans. That means that now, more then ever, patients will know that the
NHS they know and love is safeguarded for the years

their duties to patients through the introduction of guidance. However,
the Secretary of State has already published guidance specifically on
the powers to generate income, which applies to NHS bodies, including
PCTs. Further to that, he can update the guidance to the commissioning
board and CCGs under his general powers in section 2 of the National
Health Service Act 2006, as amended by paragraph 1 of schedule 4 to
this Bill. There are therefore adequate safeguards to govern the
exercise of the powers. In fact, I would argue that they are more than
adequate. In the clause in question, there is a legal duty on both the
board and CCGs to exercise the power only in so much as it does not
interfere with the performance of their statutory functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000245">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I assure hon.
Members that there are sufficient checks and balances in place to
ensure that the powers pose no threat to the bodies’ fundamental
role as commissioners of NHS services. Monitor will have a role in
overseeing the transactional behaviour of the commissioning board and
clinical commissioning groups. The board will have to undergo ongoing
assessments of the commissioning groups’ performance. We have
also set out a coherent framework in the Bill for monitoring the
financial performance of a CCG and holding it to account through the
accountable officer. In addition, the Secretary of State can update the
guidance on the powers to generate income to apply it to the
commissioning board and CCGs or issue new guidance under the powers
granted to him by the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Requiring
the Secretary of State to publish guidance on how the commissioning
board and CCGs should use the limited powers they have to raise income
would not create safeguards greater than those already in the Bill. It
is wholly unnecessary, so I cannot accept the amendments. I hope that,
on reflection and based on my assurances, the hon. Lady will withdraw
her amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000247">&#160;</a>

Members know that proceedings up to and including schedule 3 must end

but it is appropriate for members to have a short comfort break, if
that is possible. Therefore, I propose a 10 minute
break when we finish dealing with this amendment. If there are

               <p class="tabbed">I have two
points in response to the Minister’s comments. He will remember
that on many occasions during the previous Committee, he reassured
Opposition Members that our concerns were nothing to worry about.
Monitor promoting competition in every part of the NHS whether or not
it was appropriate was nothing to worry about. Strong requirements on
Monitor, the board and commissioning groups to promote patient and
public involvement and ensure that they included the views of
clinicians were nothing to worry about. Education, training and
emergency service planning were nothing to worry about, nor were any of
the issues that in fact the Future Forum said we were right to be
concerned about. He will therefore not be surprised to hear that I do
not take his reassurance to colleagues at face
value.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000250">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have concerns. They relate to a clause—I hope that Dr McCrea
will not mind my saying this—that we did not discuss last week
because the Government have not given us enough time. I am referring to
clause 10, which deals with the power of consortia. It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000251">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Each…consortium
may arrange for the provision of such services or facilities as it
considers
appropriate”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000652">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>If
I had had the chance to discuss that clause, I would have said that
that provision was not strong enough to guarantee a comprehensive
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000252">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are additional concerns that clause 19 could give consortia the ability
to generate additional income by charging, not least because of the
experience in my own area, where a GP has indeed called for that to
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000253">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As the Committee will be aware, the Bill gives the
Secretary of State powers to intervene if an arm’s-length body
is failing to perform its functions. He can give a direction to that
body, discharge the functions himself, or arrange for another person to
do so. The powers of intervention are an important back-stop to make it
clear that the Secretary of State is ultimately accountable for
securing the provision of NHS
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000288">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Committee
previously agreed a Government amendment to the intervention powers for
Monitor, which would ensure that Ministers could intervene only when a
failure was significant and that the reasons for intervening would have
to be explained publicly. That was important to safeguard the
regulator’s independence and to ensure that intervention powers
were used only when appropriate. The Government amendments propose the
same changes for the commissioning board, which would ensure a
consistent approach. We have proposed similar amendments, which will be
discussed at a later stage, for the Care Quality Commission,
HealthWatch England, the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence and the Health and Social Care Information Centre.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000289">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
change to the intervention powers for Monitor was to add a condition
that the Secretary of State could not intervene in a particular case.
Instead, he would need to demonstrate that the failure was more
widespread. That further safeguard would protect regulatory
independence and avoid any perception that the regulator’s
judgment could be swayed on a specific issue through political
pressure. For consistency, we now propose to extend that condition to
the CQC and HealthWatch England, as a committee of the CQC; again,
those changes will be discussed later. As such a limitation would not
be relevant for the NHS commissioning board, we do not propose to make
a similar change to clause 19.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The board has
a wide range of functions relating to the health service. As a result,
in the event of significant failure it might be appropriate for the
Secretary of State to intervene in a particular case—for
example, if the board failed to allocate funds to a particular CCG.
Such a limitation would not be appropriate for NICE or the Information
Centre, because they are focused predominantly on supporting the health
and social care system as a whole, rather than on overseeing individual
organisations. Therefore, we have not proposed similar amendments to
clauses 242 or 265.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000291">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I want to ask a brief question. The Minister,
once again, gave a helpful example of something that the Government
would consider the board to have failed on—if it had failed to
give money to a clinical commissioning group. Is failure confined only
to matters of allocating resources? Would it be a significant failure
if the board did not deliver one of the many objectives outlined in the
document that we referred to earlier? If the board did not achieve the
outcomes specified under the mandate, would that qualify? Would it be a
significant failure if the board did not fully consult patients and the
public? How about if certain equality indicators were not
met?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The trouble
is that within the Government’s context, they say that they want
the board to be independent and that they will intervene only if there
is a significant failure. We have no idea what the Government consider
a significant failure of the NHS board to be—or should I call it
NHS England now?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000294">&#160;</a>

Secretary of State will still be required, under section 223B, to
allocate sufficient funds to the NHS commissioning board to enable it
to perform its functions. Because the level of the allocation depends
on the spending plans that the board will set out in its business plan
in response to the mandate, it will not itself be set out in the
mandate. Amendment 84 states that the board will instead be notified in
writing of the amount. The Secretary of State will then have a duty to
pay sums to the board up to that amount, and will only be able to make

               <p class="tabbed">As
I will explain, the amendments would provide for powers for the
Secretary of State to set limits in relation to expenditure on
administrative matters that are in terms of use of resources rather
than cash expenditure and are therefore covered under new section
223DB. Amendments 85 and 86 remove references to the limits on
administrative spend in subsections (4) and (7) of 223B.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000317">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The group of
amendments is also intended to clarify the NHS commissioning
board’s responsibility for the overall spend by NHS
commissioners. In future, funds will be allocated by the Secretary of
State to the NHS commissioning board, which will be responsible for
allocating funds and setting spending limits for individual clinical
commissioning groups. That differs from current arrangements, under
which both SHAs and PCTs receive funding directly from the Secretary of
State, who has wide powers of direction as to how the funds are
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000318">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
94 would introduce new sections 223DA and 223DB, replacing the current
duties on the use of resources. Amendment 88 would remove a single
overall resource allocation; instead there would be two resource
limits, one in relation to revenue and another for capital. As with the
expenditure limit under proposed new section 223D, those limits will
apply to the total use of resources by both the commissioning board and
clinical commissioning groups. The Secretary of State will continue to
have powers to specify which resources, and which uses of resources,
may or may not be taken into account for the purpose of those limits.
That will provide clarity about what would score in each
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000320">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Proposed
new section 223DB provides powers for the Secretary of State to set
additional controls on the use of resources. Rather than a cash limit
on administrative expenditure by the board, as under current
arrangements, the amendments would allow the Secretary of State to set
a limit on the total use of resources for administrative matters by all
NHS commissioners and a limit on the board’s own use of
resources for those purposes. It is still our intention to create, for
the first time, a fixed definition of the costs that will be covered by
the limits on administrative expenditure in regulations. Because there
will be limits on spending for administrative purposes, any underspend
will be available to invest in patient care.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000321">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments also allow the Secretary of State to set additional limits
on total capital or revenue resource use that is attributable to
particular matters. That is to comply with the technical limits imposed
by the Treasury in matters such as the depreciation of capital assets.
Amendments 141 and 142 amend clause 23 to mirror those changes in
respect of the financial duties that clinical commissioning groups will
be under. The board will be able to set capital and revenue resource
limits for each clinical commissioning group, and there will be a duty
to stay within those limits.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000322">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The board
will also be able to set additional limits on capital or revenue
resource use, including revenue resource use associated with
administrative matters where the Secretary of State imposes such limits
on the board. Amendments 107, 124, 137 and 147 make consequential
changes to reflect the new clause numbering.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000323">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth asked whether allocations to
clinical commissioning groups will continue to be weighted for
deprivation. It is for the commissioning board to decide the most
efficient way to allocate resources to clinical commissioning groups.
Under proposed new section 13F to clause 19, however, the board will be
under a duty to reduce inequalities in access to services and patient
outcomes, as well as to deliver any requirement in the mandate from the
Secretary of State. It must, therefore, have regard to the prospective
burden of disease and disability when determining allocations. Where
there is evidence that people from a more deprived background have a
greater need for health care services, we would expect 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 278<a class="bkMark" name="Column278">&#160;</a>
                  </div>allocations to be weighted towards more deprived areas. For those
reasons, I urge the Committee to accept the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000324">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This is a complicated set of amendments and I
will explain what I believe they really seek to achieve. The amendments
give the board or, as I will now call it, NHS England more freedom to
spend its money how it wants, but they give consortia, or clinical
commissioning groups, less freedom to spend the money how they want.
They also take away the Secretary of State’s ability to specify
for the board and individual consortia how much they may spend on admin
costs. That is my understanding of the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000325">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 85
deletes the current clause in the Bill that gives the Secretary of
State the power to tell the board and consortia how much they may spend
on administrative costs. Instead, it gives an overall limit, which
gives the board the power to shift money around, including resources
for admin
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000326">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
pattern is emerging. The commissioning board, or NHS England, will end
up being a super-quango that can spend as much money as it wants on
admin costs with far greater power over clinical commissioning groups.
I think that GPs and others who were enthusiastic about the
Government’s plans will see, step by step in the post-pause
Bill, their power and influence taken away by the board in ever more
centralised
control.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000327">&#160;</a>

the Minister says in his description of the financial changes, they are

spent.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000328">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I can be extremely brief. The hon. Lady raised two
issues. One of them was the funding of the administrative costs of the
commissioning board and the CCGs. We have always made it plain that a
global figure will be allocated by the commissioning board, for its own
use and for the CCGs. That has not changed. We have also made it clear
that the figure we have in mind for the CCGs for their administrative
costs will be somewhere between £25 and £35 per patient,
and we are looking at the experience of the current pathfinders to
determine the exact amount. There will be an incentive for the groups
to get cost-effective administration because they can use money saved
from that in patient
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000333">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister is saying, then, that any surpluses
that derive from saving on administrative costs can be retained by the
consortia—the groups—and invested in clinical or patient
care. Does the money have to be invested in that way, or could the
consortia choose to spend the retained surplus in other
ways?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000334">&#160;</a>

as meaning more freedom for the board and less for the CCGs, but I am
afraid that I do not share that analysis of the situation. We have
always said that the board will be responsible for accounting for NHS
resources, and the chief executive will be the accounting officer. The
amendments do not give the board any more substantial powers to set
spending limits than those that were in the clause previously agreed by
the Committee. There are additional powers to set technical limits on
matters such as the depreciation of assets, but only when such limits
are imposed on the Department by the Treasury and fed through to the
board and the
CCGs.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000340">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is a great pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Dr McCrea, albeit late in the day. I want to make two
brief points, on which I hope the Minister will at some point be able
to provide clarification. One relates to his statement that there will
now be a global sum of money. Does that change the previous position,
in which a distinction was made in the Bill between the moneys that
would be made available to the CCGs and to the board? Is it now one
global pot of money, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester
West has said, gives the board greater leeway?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000341">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My second
question relates to the point that I raised a moment ago. The Minister
did not precisely repeat what he said. He said that the money could be
available to reinvest in patient care, or would be available to
reinvest in patient care, neither of which answered my question. Could
the money be invested in something else, such as the salaries of the
people on the commissioning board, or the purchase of a new fleet of
cars?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000342">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I made it quite clear, and I really do not want to
drag this out. If the CCGs were particularly efficient and had some
money left over from their administration budget, they would be able to
use it on investing in patient care. They could not spend the money on
increasing their salaries, having a bonus or buying a fleet of
cars.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000343">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
underspends, I have been consistent and the matter is quite
straightforward. There will be an administrative budget for the
administrative purposes of the national commissioning board. The board
will distribute money when we have determined what the CCGs’
funding will be; it will be somewhere between £25 and £35
per patient, which will be distributed to the CCGs to spend.

                  </strong> I will speed through these amendments quickly,
because we are pressed for time. They return to territory that is
familiar from the previous Committee. We discussed the concerns of
right hon. and hon. Members about the need for appropriate governance
arrangements for clinical commissioning groups, and the need to ensure
that that was balanced by not imposing micro-management on the
commissioners. Our previous discussions of amendments that were
proposed by the Opposition to require consortia to have a governing
body resulted in the amendments being withdrawn, which is a clear sign
that getting prescriptions about governance arrangements right is a
tricky business.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000362">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments 52
and 53 were discussed in the 13th session of the first Commons Public
Bill Committee, and were accordingly voted against. We have always
regarded it as essential that statutory requirements that are placed on
clinical commissioning groups do not stifle local organisational
development or inhibit the potential of those groups to develop
arrangements locally to meet the needs of their patients and their
populations. The programme of local pathfinders is the practical
result, as groups of GPs come together to develop emerging CCGs and to
explore key issues with PCTs.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000363">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is for
those reasons that the Government have not hitherto proposed requiring
a particular model of governance for CCGs. The Bill as currently
drafted and scrutinised has many requirements relating to CCG
governance. Developing commissioning groups would need to take account
of these, as would the NHS commissioning board as part of its scrutiny
of a clinical commissioning group’s competence to deliver its
statutory functions, before granting authorisation. Since then, both
the Health Committee and the Future Forum have made recommendations
pertaining to the need to ensure robust governance in CCGs, reflecting
the concerns raised by
stakeholders.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000364">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">There
were similarities between the recommendations, which might be divided
into three categories: a concern that CCGs should conform to the
highest standards of governance; that the governance arrangements
should ensure absolute transparency and probity in the way in which
CCGs conduct their business, particularly in reaching the key
commissioning decisions; and the need to ensure that lay members and
professionals such as nurses or hospital doctors are represented in the
governing body of a GP-led
CCG.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000365">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
fully support Future Forum’s recommendation
that<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000366">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“commissioners

public, with independent members, to provide independent challenge,
including ensuring that consortia fulfil their duty for genuine patient
and public
involvement.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000653">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>We
do not need to debate in detail the principles on which we are in
agreement. Clearly, we all want clinical commissioning groups to attain
the highest standards of public sector governance, particularly
ensuring probity and managing any potential conflicts of interest,
engaging meaningfully with patients, the public and other health
professionals locally as well as with democratic representatives and
always acting
transparently.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000367">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
our response to the Future Forum, we indicated our willingness to make
the necessary legislative changes to deliver them. The necessary
amendments will introduce a more robust and comprehensive framework for
CCGs than the proposals of Opposition Members. The Government
amendments deliver some duties similar to those in Opposition amendment
5, but they reflect more effectively what is required to provide the
safeguards needed to ensure that CCGs attain those high standards of
governance. We accept the need for a governing body within the CCGs
with responsibility for ensuring good governance, and amendments 95,
98, 100 to 101 and 104 to 106 provide for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000368">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Unlike
amendment 5, our amendments provide a high-level function of the
governing body to ensure that the CCG has appropriate arrangements in
place to exercise its functions effectively, efficiently, economically
and in compliance with principles of good governance. That, of course,
embraces such standards as the Nolan principles, which the Future Forum
recommended. The Future Forum recommendation

               <p>is
one with which we entirely concur.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000370">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
amendments 96, 97 and 104 require that CCGs meet in public, except when
discussing confidential issues. Commissioning groups will also be
required to publish their constitutions and to give the commissioning
board a power to publish guidance on the publication of these
constitutions. The constitution of a CCG is already required to set out
arrangements to be followed by the group in reaching decisions.
Government amendment 102 adds that each CCG should set out specific
arrangements in the constitution for ensuring transparency on the
decisions of the consortium and the manner in which those decisions are
made. These arrangements might include building on the proposals for a
governing body with lay membership, with the potential to scrutinise
commissioning decisions and provide what the NHS Future Forum termed
“independent challenge”'; developing 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 284<a class="bkMark" name="Column284">&#160;</a>
                  </div>their relationship with local stakeholders and democratically elected
representatives in the health and well-being board, with whom the CCG
must consult on their commissioning plans; or developing the
relationship with patients and their
representatives.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000371">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
there are many ways in which this duty might be fulfilled, and we do
not want to be too prescriptive and risk preventing innovative and
imaginative approaches, as clinicians locally develop the groups that
best enable them to fulfil their statutory functions. As these
arrangements will be set out in the constitution, they will be
considered by the NHS commissioning board as part of its scrutiny of a
CCG’s competence to deliver its statutory functions before
granting authorisation and its ongoing oversight of the competence of
CCGs. In addition, the public will now also be able to scrutinise the
document when it is published. These amendments help to ensure quality
outcomes by putting in place safeguards and allowing the public a clear
view of how the business of commissioning is undertaken, and how they
can be major participants in the crucial decisions that affect their
health and well-being.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000372">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The governing
body will also have the function of determining the remuneration of
commissioning group employees and others providing services to it, and
it must have a remuneration committee. This committee will make
recommendations to the commissioning board’s governing body on
remuneration, fees and allowances with the scope for further functions
to be assigned to it as set out in the CCG’s constitution or in
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000373">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
section 14JA(7), which amendment 98 inserts, will enable regulations to
require governing bodies to publish prescribed information relating to
the determination of remuneration, fees and allowances payable to the
employees of the clinical commissioning group or others providing
services to it. Under new section 14JA(8), the board may publish
guidance for governing bodies on the exercise of these functions. I
hope that that reassures Opposition Members that amendments 52 and 53
are not necessary and are
over-prescriptive.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000374">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
responding to recommendations of the Future Forum, we have taken great
care to ensure that the statutory duties on CCGs are wholly
proportionate. We also recognise the need for ensuring, via the
flexibility of regulations, that CCGs are fully supported in
establishing these governing bodies. Regulations may make provision for
the qualification or disqualification of members, as happens currently
for PCT boards, and for the way in which members are to be appointed,
clarifying eligibility and tenure of
members.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000375">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
describing our amendments in some detail, I hope that I have reassured
Opposition Members that their amendments are no longer necessary, where
they address the same issues. However, there are some points raised by
amendment 5 that I have not yet addressed, and I would like to take the
opportunity to do so now.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000376">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 5
would put in the Bill requirements for appropriate representation. We
support the principle of involving patients and non-GP clinicians in
the work of the CCG and involving them as members of a governing body.
However, requiring in the Bill that the membership should include
appropriate representation of a range of clinicians is imprecise and
might be satisfied by clinicians entirely associated with general
practice, such a practice nurse, GP or a GP with a special interest. It
would be for the commissioning board to satisfy itself on the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 285<a class="bkMark" name="Column285">&#160;</a>
                  </div>appropriate representation. Our proposed amendment would allow us,
through permissive regulation-making powers, to specify the types of
clinicians who must be represented. We have made a commitment in our
response to the Future Forum that this should be a minimum of a doctor
working in secondary care and a registered nurse. The regulations will
ensure that this commitment is reflected in
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000377">&#160;</a>

this intention. It explained that nurses have a pivotal role in being

effectively commission services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000380">&#160;</a>

champion the interests and rights of patients and one with the
appropriate expertise to take an informed and independent view of the
performance of the CCG against its financial responsibilities. The
latter will act in the role of a non-executive director with
responsibility for audit with a dedicated sub-committee of the
governing body. As we heard in the evidence sessions, there is wide
support for that, especially from patient groups such as National

               <p class="tabbed">In
response to the requirement for local democratic representation, I
remind the Committee that health and well-being boards, with their
functions of collaborating with CCGs on joint health and well-being
strategies and their proposed role in scrutinising CCG annual
commissioning plans, will provide a powerful local hub for local
democratic involvement in commissioning, which is clearly set out in
the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000383">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendment 5 seeks to make specific provision in the Bill for the NHS
commissioning board to ensure, when it considers an application from a
prospective CCG, that the area that the group covers contains a
sufficiently large population. We all agree that it is essential for
CCGs to be able to commission to meet the needs of the population for
whom they have responsibility. However, the amendment is unnecessary,
because under clause 21 the board must be satisfied that the area
specified in the commissioning group’s constitution is 
<div class="columnNumber">

ensure that it can discharge its statutory
duties.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000384">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
amendment 5 is on the right track, it would respond neither practically
nor proportionately to concerns about CCGs and good governance. For
those reasons, I urge Opposition Members not to press the amendments to
a vote. Instead, the Committee should support Government amendments 95
to
106.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000385">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> This is an unbelievable U-turn by the Government.
We argued strongly that there was an astonishing omission from the
Government’s first Bill relating to people in clinical
commissioning consortia. Such people were to be responsible for
£80 billion—now it is to be £60 billion; I do not
know when or how that was changed. There was no requirement to have any
kind of effective board or governing body, and there was an astonishing
lack of concern about public money. For a Government who claim to be
concerned about spending public money, it was an astonishing omission.
It is Opposition Members who are concerned about effective spending of
taxpayers’ money, and I am glad that the Government now agree
that we were right all along.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000386">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In addition,
when the Bill was first in Committee, we debated an Opposition
amendment. Government Members, particularly the hon. Member for
Southport, who is not here, sadly, to represent the Liberal Democrats,
who are very concerned about democratic accountability, said that our
amendment was too prescriptive, referring to a series of clinicians,
health professionals, lay members and democratic representatives. Now,
however, lo and behold, the Government have completely changed their
mind and included the changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000387">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I withdrew
that amendment, Dr McCrea—you appeared to enjoy that part of the
debate—because I wanted to consider whether it was
over-prescriptive, but the Government have now tabled an amendment that
goes into minute detail in micro-managing the NHS. The regulations will
give the board the ability to determine the minimum and maximum number
of people in the CCGs; it will be able to determine the frequency of
their meetings; and it will even be able to determine the names of CCGs
and, according to the Government’s briefing on the amendment,
insert “NHS” before such names. Perhaps NHS Leicester
City, my old primary care trust, will become NHS Leicester City again.
It is astonishing.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000388">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
now accuses us of being too imprecise in amendment 5, because we want
“a range of clinicians” to be on the board. That would
give clinical commissioning groups the ability to specify not only
doctors or nurses, but other professions allied to medicine, such as
dentists or pharmacists, if they see
fit.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000389">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is astonishing that we are the ones who, in amendment 5, are
specifying broadly the different groups who should be included in the
group without going into excessive detail and micro-management. I will
press the amendment to a vote, because the Government have failed to
give us enough time to scrutinise the legislation. We include the
requirement for commissioning consortia to cover a sufficiently large
population, because, as hon. Members should remember, we are worried
that if groups are too small, and they have one or two expensive

commissioned by the Government to model how big
clinical commissioning groups should be, so that they do not go bust.

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to put on the record the fact that members of the NHS Future Forum
will be hugely disappointed that the Government have completely ignored
its recommendation that all providers of services to NHS patients
should also meet in public and publish their agendas. The Government
have not responded to that real concern of the Future Forum to make
sure that anyone who provides services to NHS patients should be
required to publish their agenda and meet in public, to ensure the
openness and transparency of which the Government are supposedly great
champions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000396">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have some questions for the Minister about concerns raised by the
Nuffield Trust and the NHS Confederation in their briefings on the
recommitted Bill. First, the amendments now say that the doctor and
nurse must be from outside the area of the clinical commissioning group
to avoid conflict of interest. How practical is that? If GPs can be on
the board, and they deliver services in the area, why cannot nurses and
doctors? Would that not give them knowledge and insight about the
patients and population for whom they are
commissioning?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000397">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
how will lay and professional members be selected? How will they be
remunerated and trained? Will there be national guidelines for clinical
commissioning groups, as there are now for primary care trusts, on how
people are chosen? They will have responsibility for the future of
health services in their area, and Labour Members want to be assured
that lay members and others will have sufficient training and support
to be able to do their job
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000398">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have already asked this, but how will the advice given by the doctors
and nurses on the clinical commissioning groups differ from the advice
from a clinical senate? The Minister said earlier that the senates 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 288<a class="bkMark" name="Column288">&#160;</a>
                  </div>will provide advice about any major service reorganisation, so what are
the clinical commissioning groups doing? That is precisely what
commissioning is. If the Minister does not understand that, he will not
enable the changes that the NHS needs to make to deliver efficiency
savings and improve patient
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000399">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
funding, what money will be made available to provide the locum cover
for clinical representatives or to pay lay representatives? Where is
the costing for that? How will that money be
found?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000400">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to make a serious point about safeguarding. I tried to raise the
issue in the evidence session, and it is something my local council is
concerned about. I have no idea who will be responsible for appointing
the person responsible for safeguarding children in different services
in the NHS. Many local councils are concerned that GPs have not often
been as fully engaged in the issue as they should have been, but they
will now be responsible for it. Will the Minister clearly say who will
be responsible for defining safeguarding leads throughout the
NHS?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000401">&#160;</a>

pleased that my hon. Friend has raised it. Successive inquiries into
tragedies where children have been abused, or, even worse, have died,
have shown that the root of the problem is often where communication
has broken down between the people involved in the care of that child
and the family. We cannot have a backward step here. We need
clarification, so that children can continue to be
safeguarded.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000402">&#160;</a>

am genuinely concerned about. The Bill is completely unclear about
where that responsibility should lie. I suggest to the Government that
the responsibility for deciding who will be the main person responsible
for safeguarding within the NHS should move to local councils as part
of their new responsibilities on health, because they may have more

earlier on, Dr McCrea. I would just like to ask the Minister a
question. We have all had correspondence with the National
Children’s Bureau. There is a governing body called Every
Disabled Child Matters, which consists of four groups. One of those
groups is Mencap, which is the organisation that contacted me. It is,
by and large, comparatively supportive of the Government’s
proposals, but it has a question I would like to put to the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
question relates to children with complex needs and to those who are
disabled. I do not want to be disrespectful to GPs, but nobody knows
everything. GPs have a lot of knowledge but do not necessarily know
everything they need to know. Sometimes help is needed for disabled
children, or for children with complex needs. If that help is needed,
we need to ensure that GPs are supportive and are able to offer that.
Will the Minister provide assurances that the regulations will ensure
that the governing body of each commissioning consortia must include a
clinician with experience of providing health care for children with
complex needs? That is the question Mencap asked me to put to the
Committee. In his response, can the Minister give conclusive evidence

already have legislation in place: the Public Bodies (Admission to

deal with the plethora of questions raised by hon. Members during the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I begin with
an issue raised by the hon. Member for East Lothian about child
protection, because it is important to put the response on the record.
We believe that safeguarding children is of paramount importance and we
expect the NHS to continue to improve how it does that. We will ensure
that clinical commissioning groups and the NHS commissioning board are
required to make arrangements to safeguard and promote
children’s welfare and maintain providers’
responsibilities for safeguarding. Furthermore, we will explore with
our key partners how best to ensure that professional leadership and
expertise for safeguarding children is retained in the new system,
including the continuing key role of named and designated safeguarding
professionals, whose critical importance was highlighted recently in
the Munro review of child protection. I hope that the hon. Members for
Leicester West and for East Lothian find that
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000456">&#160;</a>

clinicians on the boards of clinical commissioning groups will not be
giving advice on major changes to local services—which is what
the Minister previously said the clinical senates will be
doing—what on earth will they be doing? That is what
commissioning
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000465">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Let me classify and explain what the two groups
will do. A governing body is focused on governance issues, whereas
clinical advice from senates is focused on bringing together clinicians
from different settings to discuss how to provide joined-up care across
an area. I hope that that satisfies the hon.
Lady.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000466">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Strangford asked whether a CCG’s governing body
will include secondary care doctors with experience of caring for
children with complex needs. We will not make that a requirement,
because it would be too prescriptive, but I take the point, which is
important. We want to ensure that CCGs have access to expertise
through, for example, the senate and the networks. That is the way in
which we want to input the expertise, help and guidance needed to
achieve those
aims.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000467">&#160;</a>

recommendations from the clinical senates, or will they be duty bound
to take their advice on clinical
issues?<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000468">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> No, they will not, because the system will not work
like that. The senates are there to input advice. By definition, advice
can be taken, rejected, or partly taken. A senate is an advisory body
that will input advice based on its
expertise.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000469">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
point was made about the cost of the governing bodies of CCGs. The hon.
Member for Leicester West will groan at this, but we are awaiting the
updated impact assessment, which will reflect the additional costs, if
any, of the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000470">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
mentioned conflicts of interest and asked why a secondary care doctor
in the same area as a CCG would not be able to participate in its
proceedings. The answer, as we have said all along, is that we are
seeking to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest with such
individuals, which is why secondary care doctors should come from
outside the immediate area of the CCG, so as not to arouse the
suspicion, the allegation or the reality of a conflict of interest. We
have introduced that provision with the best of intentions and we
believe that it will
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000471">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also said that the board has wide-ranging regulation-making
powers, but it is not the board that has the regulation-making powers.
The Secretary of State makes regulations in agreement with Parliament,
and we will use the regulations only to set the core requirements for
governing bodies. Anything further is for local determination, based on
organisational needs. <em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> That is the
right way forward, whatever the hon. Lady is chirping from the
sidelines.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000472">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also suggested—this is now one of her old
chestnuts—that the provision represents gross micro-management.
Nothing could be further from the truth. It is not micro-management to
set down some basic parameters for a governing body. We do it for PCTs
and other public bodies and it is a proportionate approach for bodies
that are stewards of billions of pounds of public money. If we were not
taking such a reasonable and proportionate approach, the hon. Lady,
given the mood she is in, would be criticising us from the other side
of the argument. The hon. Lady’s approach to debating leaves me
in a no-win
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000473">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
regulations will allow us to set out processes to be observed by CCGs
when making arrangements for their governing bodies and their
committees. The regulations are a safeguard to prevent inadequate
arrangements that fail to ensure good governance, which I do not think
the hon. Lady wants. That is the purpose of our amendments. A governing
body of two people that meets once a year is not likely to be very
effective, so we have a regulation-making power should we need to make
requirements that ensure adherence to good practice. There is, of
course, no requirement for the Secretary of State to make regulations,
but he certainly will to ensure good
governance.<a class="bkMark" name="11070637000474">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As
we are coming so near to the knife, I will conclude my comments. If
there are any questions that I have not answered, which I do not think
is the case, I will ensure that we write to hon.
