Mark Francois</b> (Rayleigh) (Con): I welcome you back to the
Chair, Mr.
Benton.</div><a name="06060872000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Committee rose this morning, I was moving amendment No. 208. As I was
saying, in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, that have a
developed and successful real estate investment trust package, the
restriction represented by paragraph 11 does not apply. Recently, the
<i class="I">Financial Times</i> estimated that more than $300 billion is
invested in US REITs. In the American example, it is very common for
REITs of REITs to be set up. That creates a potentially attractive
retail product that helps to spread risks, particularly for small
investors, whom, as I said this morning, the Government are presumably
keen to attract into the
market.</div><a name="06060872000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The British
Property Federation has considered the amendment and argued in its
favour in the following
terms:</div><a name="06060872000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that REITs should be able to invest in other REITs without such
an investment being treated as part of the taxable income. The ability
to make such investments will be viewed as attractive by the management
of REITS and shareholders and indeed would be viewed as normal
commercial activity by the property industry. As currently drafted, the
restrictions imposed by this paragraph of Schedule 16 will therefore
restrict normal commercial investment strategies and restrict the
growth of the UK REIT
market.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Economic Secretary disagrees with the amendment, I ask him to explain
precisely why there is an objection to the eventual establishment of
REITs of REITs. As a form of investment vehicle, they might well help
attract a wider number of potential new investors&#151;as I said,
presumably the Government are keen to do that.</div>
<a name="06060872000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment would go some way
to enabling such additional forms of REITs to be established in the
United Kingdom, and thereby assist UK REITs to catch up with competitor
REITs businesses in other investment markets. Having put that case to
the Economic Secretary, I look forward to his
reply.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column489" />Column number: 490</div><a name="06060872000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000559"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> As the hon.
Gentleman acknowledged, the amendment would extend the UK REIT regime
beyond the Government&#146;s policy intentions. It would not be
consistent with the objectives of our reform to the property investment
market, as I shall explain in more detail in a second. Before I do, let
me say a couple of words about schedule 16 more generally and make a
couple of extra
points.</div><a name="06060872000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we
discussed earlier, clause 104 provides the definition of
&#147;property rental business&#148; that is used to determine the
activity that qualifies for exemption from corporation tax within the
UK REIT regime. That definition is critical to achieving the focus of
the regime and protecting the Exchequer from significant extra
costs.</div> <a name="06060872000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
that definition there are, however, a number of types of business and
income that fall within the normal schedule A definition, but do not
fit within the Government&#146;s policy aims for UK REITs. Schedule
16, to which I shall come in a moment, sets out a number of exclusions
and provides a regulatory power for those items to be changed in
future. As I said earlier, we passed draft regulations that affect
schedule 16 to Opposition Members, and to the public on websites, last
week.</div> <a name="06060872000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The type of
income that the regime is intended to capture within a UK REIT is what
I would describe as rents from bricks-and-mortar assets. The items in
schedule 16, such as incomes from the sites of mobile phone masts, wind
turbines or utility cables, do not fit within that remit. The
regulatory power is important because the market is fast changing and
different asset classes that do not exist today may emerge.</div>
<a name="06060872000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those Committee members, such
as the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), who have studied the
draft regulations in detail will have seen that in them we already
envisage two changes to the list in schedule 16. The Government have
chosen to release those proposed changes in draft regulations, to allow
industry representatives and other interested parties to comment on
them.</div> <a name="06060872000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subject to our
reaching consensus on those proposed changes&#151;which, as I said,
came from points made to us recently by the Law Society, the British
Property Federation and others&#151;we intend to introduce on Report
amendments to schedule 16 on those two points, rather than leaving them
just in the regulations. We wanted to get them into the Bill, but when
they came up it was too late to propose for today&#146;s sittings an
amendment whose drafting we could be sure met the concerns expressed to
us. We do not want to leave the two issues until the autumn, because we
know that changes need to be made, so we hope, with the agreement of
the House, to introduce amendments on Report. I think that that is an
unusual thing to do but, as I said this morning, it shows that we
intend to make changes when it is shown on the basis of consultation
that we need to do so, and to keep matters under
review.</div><a name="06060872000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, the
two changes come from points put to us by the Law Society and the
British Property Federation. The first change is to clarify that
owner-occupied property is not tax-exempt property for a UK REIT. We
shall discuss that issue when we reach clause 107. We need to be clear
that owner occupation is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 491</div>outside the ring fence, and it was put to us that we needed to make that
clearer than it was in the provisions. The purpose of the change in
schedule 16 is to ensure that if owner-occupied property is held, it is
kept outside the tax-exempt ring fence, rather than causing a breach of
a regime condition. We shall clarify that in an amendment on Report,
subject to continuing consultation on the precise detail of the
amendment.</div><a name="06060872000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
change is to extend the current exclusion of property held as part of a
development trade to property held in connection with any type of
property trade. In this context, a property trade generally refers to a
business holding properties for the purpose of generating profit from
resale. That is distinct from investment in property held for long-term
rental purposes, which is the focus of the UK REIT
regime.</div><a name="06060872000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change as
contained in the regulations is a response to representations made on
the legislation. The concern is that there would be a double charge to
tax where a company holding certain types of trading property entered
the regime. The change ensures that all trading property is held
outside the ring fence, so that no entry charge is collected and the
issue of a double charge is removed. We hope to clarify both points in
detail on
Report.</div><a name="06060872000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000560"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I am listening carefully to the Economic
Secretary and I am grateful for what he has said, but presumably his
second point has a particular bearing on clause
111.</div><a name="06060872000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000561"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> Yes, it does. I am sure that we will return to
those issues when we reach clause 111, but the appropriate place to
make the change is in schedule 16. It is in the regulations that were
published last week and that pertain to schedule 16. That is why I am
raising the issue at this stage, although in terms of the content of
the legislation it is a clause 111
point.</div><a name="06060872000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
208, which we have heard about from the hon. Gentleman, would remove
from the list of excluded classes of income or profit any dividends
received by a UK REIT that arose from shares held in another UK REIT.
Presumably the intention is to allow within the regime investments that
are a proxy for property investments rather than actual property
investments. However, it is not our aim to provide such a tax
exemption. Our aim in introducing UK REITs has been to create a regime
for investing in property that removes existing distortions in the
market. Those distortions arise where a company is directly managing a
portfolio of assets that is generating property rental income; we are
not talking about the shares held by such companies in other
companies.</div><a name="06060872000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
amendment was accepted and such a fund-of-REITs structure was allowed,
it would be necessary to add complex legislation to ensure that all the
other rules of the regime, such as the 90 per cent. distribution and
balance of business tests worked effectively. Otherwise, the Government
could not be assured that property distributions paid to the top
company of a UK REIT group were paid out to
investors.</div><a name="06060872000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give
more detail. A key problem could relate to the treatment of the REIT
shares in the hands of the holding REIT, given that they may give rise
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 492</div>dividends that are treated as coming under schedule A and normal company
dividends and the proportion of each would vary from year to year. In
turn that would mean that the proportion of the shares used in the
property rental business could change from year to year. That would
give rise to complex part-disposal computations and taxable capital
gains each time the proportion changed. We would need a detailed set of
rules to impose such a treatment. Given that it was never our intention
to support a REIT of REITs structure but to have a REIT regime that
supported direct investment in property, it is our view that it would
be wrong to proceed with the amendment. I would therefore invite the
Committee to reject it.</div>
<a name="06060872000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060872000562"></a><b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): Not having been
necessarily briefed on the amendment by my colleagues, I am inclined to
support the Government, much as it pains me. The concept that REITs
might invest in REITs much like the situation where the zeroes were
investing in each other causes some concern. Obviously, with the
potential risk from gearing in those situations, that would make them a
less secure form of investment. I would be uncomfortable with a tax
regime that encouraged REITs to invest in each other, so I would be
inclined not to support the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000563"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> First I shall respond to the Liberal Democrat
speech. The hon. Gentleman said that he had not been briefed, but part
of the Government&#146;s argument was that they were worried about
the capital gains tax implications and the Liberal Democrats announced
today that they want to increase the tax take from capital gains by a
factor of four, so I am surprised by the Lib Dem
position.</div><a name="06060872000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
directly to the Government&#146;s argument, I can understand why they
take such a position at this stage. All I would say is that if one
looks at the experience in other countries, particularly the United
States, allowing REITs of REITs to develop has been important in
bringing a lot of money into the property market. I wonder whether this
is a position that the Government are adopting today but might
reconsider in the future, depending on the extent to which the regime
takes off in practice. I understand why, at least today, the Government
are reluctant to yield on the matter. As this was a probing amendment,
I shall withdraw it.</div>
<a name="06060872000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make two brief
points. I can confirm to the Economic Secretary that I spent an
enjoyable weekend last weekend reading through all the regulations so
that I would be ready to debate REITs on Tuesday, and I am grateful to
him for having complied with the deadline that he promised the
Committee of having them out on 1 June. I tabled a point of order a
week before to ensure that they would be ready and he kept his word. I
place on the record the fact that we are grateful that he did
that.</div> <a name="06060872000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Economic
Secretary also mentioned two amendments that the Government will table
on Report. We obviously look forward to seeing the detail of the
amendments. I am grateful that he has confirmed that the Government
will want to return to REITs on Report. There is always competing time
for different aspects of a Finance Bill on Report, so I put down a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 493</div>marker that we, the Opposition, would like to return to REITs. The
Economic Secretary has said that the Government want to too and I am
sure that the usual channels will have taken careful note of that. I
look forward now to debating REITs with him on Report in
July.</div>
<a name="06060872000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000564"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I probably ought to have taken the opportunity to
welcome the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) to the
Committee. I omitted that and I apologise. If he chooses to join our
debates on Report we may have a further opportunity to debate REITs. I
look forward to the REITs discussions at that stage. Clearly, as I have
talked about the two amendments, there will need to be time to debate
those and other matters on Report.</div>
<a name="06060872000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point about the US made
by the hon. Member for Rayleigh, I just want to say to him that the US
and UK tax systems are quite different. We have to work within the
scheduler system that applies in the UK when we draw up an appropriate
framework for the UK REIT regime. If the core of the regime were to
move from its present alignment with the property income taxable under
schedule A, that would add layers of extra complexity. It is that extra
complexity, given our tax system, that we are seeking to
avoid.</div>
<a name="06060872000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000565"></a>Mr.

Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I read the
schedule in conjunction with the draft Real Estate Investment Trusts
(Excluded Business) Regulations 2006. Like the hon. Member for
Rayleigh, I am grateful to the Government for producing the draft
statutory instruments by 1 June.</div>
<a name="06060872000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I read the schedule and the
regulations together, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic
Secretary can clarify a point on them. In large parts of the
country&#151;certainly in England&#151;there are many houses on
long leasehold that are subject to ground rent. As the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Yardley will know, that is certainly the case in the west
midlands where my constituency is located. In recent years there has
been a business trend for companies to buy up the rights to receive
ground rents on long leases for houses, such as 99-year
leases.</div><a name="06060872000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Leasehold Reform Act 1967&#151;passed by a Labour
Government&#151;owner-occupiers of such houses can under certain
conditions buy up the landlord&#146;s right to ground rent, based on
a multiplier of that rent, the multiplier usually&#151;I
think&#151;being 11. The property then becomes freehold property
rather than long leasehold. My question is whether it is possible for a

Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I have a brief point
relating to the Economic Secretary&#146;s comment on the comparison
between the tax regime in the US and that in the UK. Unfortunately,
those who are involved in the REIT market look at it on a global basis,
and therefore one has to consider tax regimes all over the world,
including in the United States, notwithstanding the complexity of the
UK&#146;s own tax regime. Will the Minister reflect on that point and
give us his
comments?</div><a name="06060872000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060872000571"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): The Minister
referred to representations by the Law Society and he will be aware of
the society&#146;s representations on the classes of income and
profit that are set out in part 2 of schedule 16. I assure the
Committee that my remarks have nothing to do with Mrs. Gauke, although
it was Mrs. Gauke&#146;s ex-firm that made the
representations&#151;it is a very small world, is it not, but I fear
that Mrs. Gauke&#146;s contributions to the Committee have now been
exhausted and that she has nothing further to
add.</div><a name="06060872000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060872000572"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000573"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Indeed I am, so I may struggle somewhat. None the
less, the Law Society&#146;s representations highlighted a concern
about compliance costs that REITs might have to incur in respect of
rent from telecoms masts, wind turbines and the like. Have the
Government considered those representations and do they have any
thoughts on whether there should be qualifications whereby the
exclusion does not apply when that rental income is incidental to
property rental
business?</div><a name="06060872000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000574"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I had anticipated a discussion on car parks that
has not yet
arisen.</div><a name="06060872000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000575"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Give us the answer
anyway.</div><a name="06060872000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000576"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> It is 107. However, I can give some reassurance on
the point about telecommunications masts, because we looked at the
issue after the representations had been received, and the judgment
that we have reached is that it is rare for such a rent to be an
incidental part of a property rental business. The term
&#147;incidental&#148; refers to services that are provided to
tenants as a part of providing the accommodation, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 495</div>such as cleaning common parts of the building. The provision of a mobile
phone mast in a shopping centre that allows shoppers to use their
mobile phones in the building might qualify under the regime, but a
relay mast or a booster just for one geographical area would not. I
hope that that clarifies matters.</div>
<a name="06060872000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the broader point, of course
we are aware that we are in a global marketplace, and we want the City
of London to continue to be a strong centre not just for the British
property market but for expertise in investing in property markets
worldwide. That is why we have gone to such lengths to consult and to
learn lessons from other countries that have gone down this road; why
we have been very careful on a number of issues; why the commercial
property market has been closely consulted, and why we are encouraged
by the fact that a number of the large UK commercial property companies
have indicated that they will establish UK roots. I can offer
reassurance on that
point.</div><a name="06060872000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Picking up the
comments that the hon. Member for Rayleigh made earlier, an important
part of the tax regime, not just for UK REITs and the property
industry, but more broadly for British business, is our capital gains
tax regime. As hon. Members will know, it has been substantially
reformed since 1997 to reduce the rate of capital gains on long-term
investments from 40 per cent. to 10 per cent. Like the hon. Member for
Rayleigh, listening to &#147;Today&#148; this morning, I was
fascinated to hear about the tax cuts that were going to be offered by
the hon. Friends of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley, and by the
scale of resource that they are going to raise from large cars and
capital gains tax.</div> <a name="06060872000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can assure the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George
Young) that, independent of his concerns about large cars in the City,
if &#163;12 billion is going to be raised from large cars and capital
gains, there will not be much of a City left. Like the hon. Member for
Rayleigh, I am looking forward to the further details.</div>

George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 218, in page 98, line 23 [Vol I], at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) Condition 2A
is that a percentage of the assets of the property rental business to
be prescribed in regulations made by the Commissioners for Her
Majesty's Revenue and Customs is invested in residential
property.'.</div><a name="06060872000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
good news is that this is the only amendment that I have tabled to this
Bill, exercising commendable self-restraint. Also, the pitch for it was
rolled fairly substantially this morning, which means that I can set
out the case for it relatively briefly. In a nutshell, the amendment
would allow the commissioners of revenue and customs to specify that a
certain percentage of the assets of a company that wanted to be a REIT
be invested in residential property.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 496</div><a name="06060872000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
three reasons for that. The first is that it delivers the
Chancellor&#146;s policy. I quoted from his Budget speech this
morning. That quotation is now somewhere in the entrails of <i class="I">Hansard,
</i>so I shall not repeat it. However, he made it clear that one reason
for promoting the new vehicle was to encourage investment in
residential property. Without an amendment along these lines, there is
no guarantee at all that one penny of the assets of a REIT will be
invested in residential property. In a sense, this is the Kate Barker
amendment. It seeks to ensure that the vehicle that she proposed and
designed is used for the purpose that she had in mind.</div>
<a name="06060872000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second reason arises from
what the Economic Secretary said this morning when he was dealing with
clause 104 stand part. I think that he said that he would be concerned
if there were no investment in residential property. He certainly said
that he would keep the matter under review. However, all that he will
be able to do without an amendment or a provision like my amendment
will be to express concern. He will not be able to do anything, because
the condition for a REIT is set out in clause 106. As I understand it,
unless he has the powers that amendment No. 218 would give him, he will
be unable to do anything to require a REIT to invest in residential
property, so it would enable concern to be translated into
action.</div> <a name="06060872000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
reason for supporting the amendment is to avoid a difficult weekend for
the Economic Secretary. I do not want him to have to go back this
evening and tell the Housing Minister that he encouraged the Committee
to vote down an amendment promoting investment in housing. So if he has
his own self-interest at heart I hope that he will look sympathetically
at the amendment.</div><a name="06060872000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all see in our advice bureaux families in housing need who, for
whatever reason, cannot immediately be rehoused by the local authority
or by the housing association, probably because they do not have enough
points. For many of them the alternative is to stay where they are, in
many cases sharing with their parents, or the local authority will
suggest that they move into private rented accommodation. The more
progressive local authorities have a good dialogue with the responsible
landlords in their area. They have rent deposit schemes, they pay the
rent direct and a viable private rented sector in an area offers an
opportunity for households in housing need to get a home of their own
until such time as they score enough points to be rehoused by the local
authority.</div> <a name="06060872000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Home
ownership is beyond the means of those households, and homebuy, shared
ownership and similar derivatives are also not possible. At the moment
there is the buy-to-let market, which has thrived and which I welcome.
But my view is that the buy-to-let market, which is largely dominated
by the smaller landlord, should be complemented by a parallel market of
serious long-term institutional money invested in good quality
accommodation for rent, managed by registered social landlords or other
responsible agents to provide an increased supply of housing for such
households. My amendment simply enables that provision to be made. As I
said, I think that was what REITs, PIFs, HITs, or whatever they were
called initially, were all about.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 497</div><a name="06060872000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a nutshell, the amendment
helps the Chancellor achieve the ambition he set out in his Budget and
it helps the Minister for Housing and Planning in her ambition to
increase the supply of good quality accommodation for rent, but most
importantly it helps families in housing need. Against that background,
I hope that the Minister will feel that he can smile on the
amendment.</div><a name="06060872000096"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000578"></a>John
Hemming:</b> This perhaps goes to the nub of our perspective
on REITs: will they encourage a greater availability of affordable
properties? It is an interesting amendment, but whether it is the best
way of achieving that is unclear. All hon. Members have to be aware of
the difficulties in housing. Yes, there are a small proportion of
people who wish to be housed by the council because there is right to
buy, but generally there is a problem in finding affordable housing to
rent, particularly where revenue from the local authority is accepted.
All the changes to housing benefit and the like that are being debated
complicate the market. It means that REITs potentially offer a good way
forward to raise revenue, perhaps linked with registered social
landlords and perhaps with social landlords who are not
registered.</div><a name="06060872000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over lunch
I met a committee member from the Stockfield Community Association
which is a social landlord, but not regulated by the Housing
Corporation. Because its compliance costs are substantially lower, it
ends up in a stronger financial position. In a sense it is a REIT
equivalent, but it is a social enterprise rather than one owned by
private investors. Will we get more affordable property that people can
rent, remembering that in essence the only sort of society where
everyone owns their own property is one where the properties are all
mud huts? There needs to be a good rented market. Will REITs provide
that, and is the amendment a good way of ensuring that they do? There
is the further matter that I would not wish to see an environment where
more properties are produced but people who are dependent on the local
authority or central Government for housing benefit are excluded from
the
process.</div><a name="06060872000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000579"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I am delighted to support my right hon. Friend
the Member for North-West Hampshire. The REITs regime that the
Government have proposed is hedged about with a number of
qualifications and restrictions that aim to prevent investors from
abusing the tax exemptions. There are six conditions in clause 106,
four in clause 107 and two in clause 108. REITs will be subject to an
entry charge, a maximum shareholding requirement and a limit to the
size of a single investment as a percentage of the total property
portfolio. At the same time, they will be required to invest in several
properties, deliver a minimum profit distribution and adhere to an
interest cover ratio. Industry analysts have broadly welcomed those
restrictions, if only because they are less stringent than was feared
and because some of the conditions that caused the greatest concern
have been softened. Nevertheless, it is baffling that among all the
restrictions, the proposals do not make any requirement that REITs
should invest a percentage of assets in residential
property.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 498</div><a name="06060872000509"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15 pm</div>
<a name="06060872000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The form that REITs will take
has been defined, but their purpose has not. I hope that the purpose is
of greater importance than the form. The REITs regime appears to be
suffering from an identity crisis that would, at least in part, be
addressed by the amendment. We need look only as far as the
Chancellor&#146;s rhetoric on the REITs regime to appreciate that it
has evolved into something very different from the purpose that was
originally envisaged. In this year&#146;s Budget, he
said:</div><a name="06060872000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
attract more capital into house building, we are now legislating to
introduce for Britain the real estate investment trusts that are so
successful in the USA.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 22 March 2006; Vol. 444, c.
293.]</div><a name="06060872000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said,
one of the reasons why REITs are so successful in the USA is that they
are not necessarily subject to a listing requirement. The first part of
the Chancellor&#146;s statement interests me, because much of the
justification for the development of the UK REITs regime stems from the
Barker review of housing supply, of which we heard much earlier in our
debates. The interim report of the Barker review acknowledged
that</div><a name="06060872000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there may be merit
in the government looking at ways to promote greater interaction
between institutional investors and the residential property
market.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final report
was more explicit about the potential benefits of developing a
transparent investment vehicle for the residential property market. It
said that the benefits would include an increase in new build, better
maintenance, greater stability in the market and more involvement in
the management of subsidised housing. Although the Government have
since determined that a REIT regime would also be of benefit to the
commercial property market as well, the Barker review was the original
catalyst for its development.</div>
<a name="06060872000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The failure to include any
conditions on investment in residential property is an invitation to
the law of unintended consequences. Instead of giving investment in
residential property a shot in the arm, there is a risk that REITs
will, in practice, make little contribution to the property market,
because there is already no shortage of methods by which it is possible
to invest in the commercial property market. We need look only at how
the market is reacting to the Government&#146;s proposals.</div>
<a name="06060872000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to the imposition of a
listing requirement, which has severely restricted the class of those
who stand to make use of the REIT regime. As the Economic Secretary
said this morning, it has been announced in the past few days that
Britain&#146;s only listed residential property company, Grainger
Trust, will not convert into a REIT because the regime does not fit its
business
model.</div><a name="06060872000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000580"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that that
announcement has been made because of the alternative investment market
listing
requirement?</div><a name="06060872000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000581"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I will get on and finish my point if the Economic
Secretary will be
patient.</div><a name="06060872000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000582"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The answer is
no.</div><a name="06060872000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000583"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> And I shall help the Economic Secretary to flesh
out the point that he was trying to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 499</div>make. The reasons are twofold: first, the distinction that has been
imposed between rental income and sales profits, and secondly the
distinction between investment and trading properties, which is the
subject of amendment No. 209, tabled by my hon. Friends. The revelation
that the only residential property company that could enter the REITs
regime will not now do so is
worrying.</div><a name="06060872000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000584"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Gentleman has referred twice, I think, to
what he calls the only listed residential property company. He has not
mentioned McCarthy &amp; Stone, for example, which I believe is a
listed residential property company. That makes
two.</div><a name="06060872000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000585"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, but
we focused primarily on the Grainger Trust this morning and I wish to
deal with it in my remarks
now.</div><a name="06060872000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn briefly to
the Economic Secretary&#146;s question, as it is an important point.
The Conservatives believe that the alternative investment market will
increase the overall size of the market by allowing companies to be
listed on it. I am trying to address amendment No. 209, which is
focused on the housing market and trying to stimulate investment in
it.</div> <a name="06060872000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of more concern
is the news that Grainger is currently setting up a Jersey property
unit trust with &#163;220 million worth of market-rented homes. Given
that the REITs regime was also intended to make investment in the UK
property market accessible and stop the drain of investment to offshore
vehicles such as the Jersey property unit trust, we must question
whether REITs will be fit for purpose.</div>
<a name="06060872000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other hand, there have
been some positive indications from the residential property market.
The <i class="I">Financial Times</i> reported last week that a consortium of 17
housing associations, which collectively own more than &#163;10
billion worth of property, is looking to launch a REIT next year. We
are beginning to see evidence of a polarised property market in which
most REITs&#151;this is my concern&#151;will focus on commercial
property, while perhaps a handful are formed to invest in residential
property. I question whether those outcomes were foreseen when REITs
were first suggested as a means by which to stimulate the residential
market. Quite to the contrary, investment in residential property has
become merely an adjunct to investment in the commercial property
market.</div> <a name="06060872000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Investment in
housing should not be perceived as an inconvenient corollary to the
REITs regime; it should be integral to the scheme itself. The best way
in which to facilitate that is to require a percentage of total
investment into the residential property market. A requirement that a
percentage of assets should be invested in residential property, which
my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire seeks, would
ensure that REITs are focused on the need that they were originally
intended to
address.</div><a name="06060872000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000586"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I congratulate the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire on his amendment and the views that he has put
forward. I very much share his goal as, I suspect, do all Labour
Members. However, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 500</div>am not attracted to his amendment for two reasons, the first of which is
its practicality.</div> <a name="06060872000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will correct me if I have misread
the amendment, but it seems to say that any individual REIT must have
at least residential property, whatever percentage might be specified,
as well as commercial property, although it could be 100 per cent.
residential. So, he seeks to introduce a floor, but that would
introduce the concept of a kind of mixed REIT. In mature capitalism,
companies that thrive tend to be those that specialise. I suspect that
the effect, in practical terms, of his amendment, would be that we
would have what I would call mixed REITs and a situation in which a
broadly or predominantly commercial property REIT, which
had&#151;under regulations made under the amendment&#151;20 per
cent. of its holdings in residential, for example, would be even more
likely to buy in that 20 per cent. of rental residential
properties.</div><a name="06060872000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me to my second concern, which is shared by the right hon.
Gentleman and others. With a REIT regime, I am particularly keen to
encourage new build to increase the supply of residential property. I
do not have a crystal ball, but what I have just sketched out is that
if a predominantly commercial property REIT had to have some kind of
floor target of residential, it would be likely to buy that in, rather
than go into something that it knows even less about and in which it is
even less specialised: building residential property to
rent.</div><a name="06060872000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s approach is very cautious at the moment, in that
only listed companies can be REITS, which is probably desirable, but I
would prefer us to move towards a regime in which there is
encouragement for new-build residential property REITs. I will throw
out an example to the Economic Secretary. If a REIT that had more than,
say, 80 per cent. of its holdings in residential property and those
holdings were new build by that REIT, that company could be listed on
AIM rather than on the main stock exchange. It would be cheaper to get
listed on AIM and there would be the attraction of the lighter-touch
regulation of an AIM-listed company. That might encourage residential
property REITs to do new build. Companies would get to list under the
AIM regime only if they were a predominantly residential property REIT
and if a large proportion of their residential property had been built
by that residential REIT. AIM-listing would encourage and foster the
increased supply of private rented accommodation, which the right hon.
Member for North-West Hampshire and I, among others, wish to be
encouraged. There is a better mechanism than his
amendment.</div><a name="06060872000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060872000587"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): I broadly welcome the REITs
regime and initiative. My concerns with the amendment are similar to
those of thehon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob
Marris). The amendment suggests that a proportion should be invested in
residential property. Had it said that a proportion should be invested
in the development and building of residential property, I would have
supported it immediately because there are huge opportunities under the
REITs regime to provide rented accommodation particularly in areas in
which, at the moment, there is little or none.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 501</div><a name="06060872000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The danger with the amendment is
that, as the hon. Gentleman said, a business may simply buy in to
residential property in an area in which there is a solid rental market
and guaranteed high rental incomes. So I have concerns with the way in
which the amendment is worded. If it was to return, worded differently,
on Report, I am sure that we would all take a different view.</div>
<a name="06060872000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concerns about providing new
build residential property are similar to those of the hon. Gentleman
and others. The listing requirement is one of the major downfalls. The
stock exchange requirement with an entry level of at least
&#163;750,000, a minimum fundraising entry level of &#163;750,000
and ongoing advisory costs of &#163;250,000 a year minimum with a
commission of 2 to5 per cent. is an onerous burden. AIM is
half that: the entry level is &#163;300,000, as is the fundraising
amount. OFEX is even lower, with entry of &#163;30,000 plus and
&#163;100,000 plus only for fundraising. If we are to address the
issues raised in amendment No. 218 and provide more new build rented
accommodation, particularly in locales in which it is required, the key
thing is to consider the listing requirements as an encouragement to
small REITs who understand and focus on their own locales where there
is a particular shortage, requirement and
demand.</div><a name="06060872000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000588"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman intended to
be here this morning for our debate but because of logistical
difficulties beyond his control, he was not able to be. So, to save him
time, I tell him that the Opposition returned to the issue of
AIM-listing for many of the reasons that he elucidated. I said that we
intended to return to the matter on Report. That being the case I hope
that, for the reasons he outlined, we will have his support when we
return to
it.</div><a name="06060872000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000589"></a>Stewart

logistical difficulties this morning. I will say no more about listing
at the moment. I conclude by saying that the principle of the
amendment&#151;to deliver more new build rented
accommodation&#151;is a good one. If the Conservative party and
others are prepared to return on Report with new ideas on how to
facilitate that principle, I am sure that the Scottish National party
will view those ideas
positively.</div><a name="06060872000510"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30

turn to paragraph 3.117 on page 70 of &#147;Budget 2006&#148;, they
will find a paragraph to which I have no doubt that the Economic

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000591"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The issues that were raised by the hon. Members for
Birmingham, Yardley and for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), and by the right hon.
Member for North-West Hampshire, were debated this morning. In pointing
to the beginning of the consultation, and given the things that have
been said since, I hope that I have made it clear that the Government
intend that the UK REIT regime should be supportive of both commercial
and residential property. In that sense, we agree completely with the
hon. Member for Ludlow, the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire
and Committee members from all parties. I hope that I made that clear
this morning. I assure hon. Members who were not here, or were here but
mentally elsewhere, that a reading of <i class="I">Hansard</i> will make that
clear.</div><a name="06060872000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The document
that the hon. Member for Ludlow mentioned was drafted by Treasury
Ministers and officials and, at the time, I was with him on the Back
Benches, so I saw it for the first time when it appeared in the Vote
Office. I fully support and understand the sentences it contains, which
are consistent with the Government&#146;s approach from the
beginning.</div><a name="06060872000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure
the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire that the Government are
supportive, in REITs and more broadly, of increasing the supply of
residential housing to buy and to let&#151;that is the thinking
behind the Barker report&#151;which is why we are seeking to
implement the REIT proposals as we are doing. I do not anticipate a
difficult weekend with the Minister for Housing and
Planning.</div><a name="06060872000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000592"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on the point of
the
amendment?</div><a name="06060872000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000593"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I will come back to that in a moment. I assure the
right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire that, in our domestic
arrangements, we talk only about housing issues, at least when it comes
to Finance Bills. Imagine what it must be like spending the weekend
with Mrs.
Gauke.</div><a name="06060872000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000594"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Let the record show that it is very
pleasant.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 503</div><a name="06060872000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000595"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> Pleasant, constructive and engaged. We have not yet
had any detailed comments from the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), or from Mrs. Gauke, on the regulations that
were posted last Thursday. If there are other opportunities in the
debate to hear her views, we will obviously look forward to
that.</div><a name="06060872000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on to the
amendment&#151;</div><a name="06060872000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000596"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Moving on to the amendment, I shall try to be
helpful and say that it seems to allow the Government, by order, to
specify a zero percentage. If they wished not to constrain the
situation, they could specify a zero percentage to start out with. If,
at a later stage, they felt that it would be useful, they could make
use of the amendment, without bringing in primary
legislation.</div><a name="06060872000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000597"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The hon. Gentleman intervened before I had started
to talk about the amendment, following a speech in which he failed to
refer to that point. However, I am keen to see that he is getting into
the spirit of the Committee. I look forward to further
amendments.</div> <a name="06060872000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
let me first give an answer to the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire on his amendment. It would put a mechanism in place to make
involvement in residential property an absolute requirement for
becoming a UK REIT. I want to explain that I fully support his
objective of encouraging further investment in residential property. As
I said earlier, I look forward to, and would like to have, detailed
discussions with him on those matters. However, starting to make more
detailed, prescriptive&#151;one could almost say, interventionist and
regulatory&#151;requirements on the marketplace is not the right road
to go down..</div> <a name="06060872000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
also just say to the hon. Member for Braintree that the US regime,
which he referred to a number of times today, has no requirement on the
proportion of residential property. On the contrary, US REITs tend to
specialise in particular types of property. Therefore, the US model
does not have that kind of
prescription.</div><a name="06060872000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000598"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I absolutely agree with the point that the
Economic Secretary is making. We were trying to reflect the intent of
the Chancellor and the point that he made in his own Budget
statement&#151;to attract more capital into the house building
market. All we are trying to do is stimulate the housing market in the
UK, not replicate what goes on in the United
States.</div><a name="06060872000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000599"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> If the hon. Gentleman would allow me to get to the
point of replying, I would be able to respond to the amendment that we
are debating.</div> <a name="06060872000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
more general point of encouraging more investment in the housing
market, I have said repeatedly today that that is exactly what we want
to do in the commercial and, in particular, the residential sector. I
said earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West
that his concerns about pricing issues and REITs are not of major
concern. The main issue in the housing market is restrictions on the
supply of housing. I must say that the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 504</div>Member for Braintree would have far more credibility in Committee and in
lecturing us about the REITs regime in the context of the Barker review
if he and his colleagues had supported the recommendations of that
review. We have had either outright or de facto opposition consistently
over the last two years. We saw it yesterday in Prime Minister&#146;s
Questions in which a senior Back-Bench Member got up and expressed
hostility to the idea of more houses being built in his constituency.
There are many Opposition Members who have consistently done that that
and opposed the Barker review. Therefore, if the hon. Gentleman wants
to
encourage&#151;</div><a name="06060872000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000600"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="06060872000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000601"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> No, I will finish the point. If the hon. Member for
Braintree wants to encourage us to implement the Barker report, as
opposed to the REITs part of the Barker report, I would be glad to be
pressed by Opposition Members to do that. However, they have
consistently been pressing us not to implement the Barker report. That
leads to precisely the kind of social housing and residential housing
problems and obstacles for first-time buyers that we see in Britain
today. I will take the intervention from the hon. Member for Rayleigh,
but it would be nice to have some
clarity.</div><a name="06060872000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000602"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> We were having quite an interesting debate,
which the Economic Secretary decided to make partisan. Let me respond
in kind. Has he discussed the Barker review with the Secretary of State
for Communities and Local Government who is arguably one of the biggest
nimbys in the House of
Commons?</div><a name="06060872000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000603"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are drifting away slightly from the
amendment. The Economic Secretary will reply and we will return to the
amendment.</div>
<a name="06060872000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000604"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I apologise, Mr. Benton. I have discussed the
matter in detail with the Minister for Housing and Planning. She is
fully supportive, as are we and all members of the Cabinet, of the
implementation of the Barker report, including the requirements on
REITs. If we had some clarity from Opposition
Members&#151;</div><a name="06060872000148"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000606"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I am not taking another intervention. If we had
clarity from Opposition Members about their support for the Barker
report in full, including REITs, they would have more credibility on
those
matters.</div><a name="06060872000150"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000608"></a>Ed

want to get on, if that is okay with you,Mr.
Benton&#151;[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>]</div>
<a name="06060872000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000609"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The Economic Secretary has clearly
indicated that he is not giving way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 505</div><a name="06060872000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000610"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I have no desire to conduct these proceedings in a
partisan spirit, and certainly as regards Conservative Members. Any
opportunity to join Conservative Members in attacking the Liberal
Democrats seems to be totally appropriate, but I have no desire to move
away from the good spirit in which we have conducted matters so far. I
was moved almost to tears by the beauty of the burgeoning relationship
that seemed to be occurring moments ago between the Scottish National
party and the Conservative party. We look forward to seeing what other
directions that might take in the coming months, starting on
Report.</div><a name="06060872000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000611"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> Will the Economic Secretary give
way?</div><a name="06060872000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000612"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I should like, with your permission, Mr.
Benton, to move on to the amendment, because that would be sensible. It
would give HMRC regulatory powers to prescribe the proportion of
property rental, which, as I said earlier, does not happen in the US
system. The Treasury itself floated that idea as part of the first
consultation back in 2004, which we published in the Budget document.
We consulted and rejected that idea following a number of
representations that argued that that would not be the right approach
for implementing the Barker report proposals and, more broadly, our
objectives for REITs and residential and commercial property
sectors.</div><a name="06060872000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
explain why that is the case. If we were to go down the road of the
amendment, we would force UK REITs to invest a minimum proportion of
their assets, as stated in regulations, on residential property. That
would have several unintended and potentially quite undesirable
consequences. As noted earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West, were the amendment used to lay regulations
to prescribe a minimum condition, it would force companies that wanted
to be UK REITs into certain investment decisions that might not be in
the interest of them or their shareholders. Elsewhere in the world,
REITs have tended to specialise in certain types of property such as
residential property, shopping centres or other kinds of commercial
property. As my hon. Friend said&#151;I think that the hon. Member
for Ludlow hinted at this as well&#151;we fear that that route would
be overly prescriptive and regulatory, and potentially lead to
inefficient investment
decisions.</div><a name="06060872000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The US REIT
experience has tended towards specialisation&#151;specialist
residential REITs have been established focusing solely on specific
property types such as city flats or student accommodation. We fear
that forcing companies that specialise in commercial property to take
on residential property simply to pass that test could lead to lower
rather than higher standards of accommodation, and take away the market
flexibility and efficiency that we have been trying to
foster.</div><a name="06060872000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, we
consulted on that and decided not to go down that road. The decision
not to go down that road on this particular and prescriptive amendment
in no way weakens our intention to support residential as well as
commercial property investment, not just in general, but in particular
through the REIT regime. I said this morning to the hon. Member for
Rayleigh&#151;I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column505" />Column number: 506</div>say it again&#151;that we will monitor that closely this year and into
next year to keep it, and wider issues, under
review.</div><a name="06060872000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning,
we debated AIM. I shall not return to that other than to point out to
the hon. Member for Braintree that the company, Grainger, to which he
referred is in fact already listed on the full stock exchange. To link
AIM to Grainger therefore seems somewhat odd. On that basis, we
considered and rejected the amendment, and I urge the Committee to do
the
same.</div><a name="06060872000511"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="06060872000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000613"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I shall comment briefly on the amendment. This
morning, we had quite a detailed debate on the commercial versus
residential balance of REITs, in the clause 104 stand part debate. I do
not intend to reprise all of that now, but I think that my right hon.
Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire has done us a service with
this amendment. In a sense he has allowed us to have a second bite at
the cherry on some of those points.</div>
<a name="06060872000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see exactly what my right
hon. Friend is attempting to achieve here, and it is clear from our
debate this morning that there is considerable concern throughout the
Committee&#151;it is not confined to any one party&#151;about just
how successful the new regime is likely to be in fostering investment,
particularly institutional investment in residential property. However,
the Economic Secretary has reiterated his commitment that the
Government will keep the situation under review once the regime is
launched and will monitor carefully whether it is proving successful
for residential property, in light of Committee Members&#146;
concerns.</div><a name="06060872000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
received this morning the Government&#146;s commitment to review,
which the Minister has reiterated, I must say that although I can see
what my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire is trying
to do, I am not automatically minded to support his amendment if it is
pressed. Nevertheless, he has done us a service in giving us a second
bite at the cherry, and I look forward to his
decision.</div><a name="06060872000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000614"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for
his response and to Committee colleagues from all parties for their
speeches on my amendment. The position as I understand it is this: the
Government have introduced a new vehicle that they hope will be
invested in part in residential property. I tabled an amendment that
seeks to deliver Government policy, and the Government have told me
that it does not take the trick.</div>
<a name="06060872000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the statement of the
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West that there is a powerful
argument against obliging people to have a mixed REIT and I accept the
argument about specialisation, but I am not quite as easily satisfied
as my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh by what the Economic
Secretary said.</div><a name="06060872000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
say for the sake of argument that in two years&#146; time, not a
single penny has been invested in residential property through a REIT.
What will the Government do? We heard from the Economic Secretary that
he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 507</div>would keep the matter under review and be concerned if that happened,
but we did not hear any undertaking about what he would do in order to
achieve the objectives of Barker or to deliver the aspirations of the
Chancellor&#146;s Budget speech. I am slightly concerned that nothing
would happen.</div> <a name="06060872000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
happy to give way to the Economic Secretary if he will take me a little
bit further down the track on which he embarked this morning and this
afternoon and give me some assurance that the vehicle will in fact
generate some investment in residential property. Then I might consider
withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="06060872000167"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000615"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I reiterate what I said this morning to the hon.
Member for Rayleigh in particular. Over the course of this year and not
just when the regime begins, we will be monitoring closely whether
residential companies enter the regime. I explained that I was not
surprised that early indications had come from the commercial sector,
because of its larger scale and sophistication, but I also said that
there had been private and public indications that residential property
companies would come forward. I explained that the company referred to
by the hon. Member for Braintree had a different business model
entirely and would therefore never enter the regime. I will keep the
matter under review this year.</div>
<a name="06060872000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have asked the right hon.
Member for North-West Hampshire for a meeting to discuss residential
property investment more broadly, because I should like to learn from
his expertise. It is not for me to pre-empt the review, but I assure
him that we want to implement the Barker report on residential REITs as
well as to support the commercial sector. In return, will he urge his
colleagues to support the implementation of the Barker report?
Conservative Members have not supported its implementation, and we have
not seen the take-up of housing numbers that we would like. That is a
fundamental problem. People say one thing when they come to the House
to debate national policy and another thing when they return to their
constituencies to discuss things with local councillors. Will he join
me in urging Members from all parties to support the full
implementation of the Barker
report?</div><a name="06060872000169"></a>

George Young:</b> I am not sure to what extent you will allow
me to respond to the planning issues,Mr. Benton, but I shall
say this. I was the Minister for Housing and Planning, and I made
endless speeches on both subjects. My views are on the record and
remain unchanged.</div><a name="06060872000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Economic Secretary leaves me in a dilemma. He and his hon. Friend the
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West criticised the previous
Administration for creating legislation to promote housing investment
that made nothing happen. That was the HIP regime, to which they
referred this morning. My concern is that the same thing might happen
with residential REITs: that it is put on the statute book and there is
no response. The Minister was helpful, and I am happy to have a
meeting, but he did not say that he would then consider further fiscal
initiatives in order to get the objective that Kate Barker wants if it
has not been delivered by this specific piece of legislation. That was
the undertaking&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000617"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I quite understand where the right hon. Gentleman
is coming from, and thank him for allowing me to intervene. He has been
a Minister. Does he not recall that if he were in the situation of my
hon. Friend, and said, &#147;If we do not get any residential REITs
within two years&#146; time, we&#146;ll look at loosening the
fiscal regime&#148;, that would risk becoming a self-fulfilling
prophecy? For example, people would hold back and stay out of the
market for two years, in the hope of getting a better tax break in two
years&#146; time.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000618"></a>Sir
George Young:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am not sure that that is a serious
runner, because if someone put forward that argument, it would run the
risk that nothing would happen, and they would forgo the opportunity. I
suspect that there would be a dialogue, which would reveal the real
reasons for that. I hope that the Minister is able to go just a little
further, and say that he would be deeply disappointed if there were no
investment in residential property through a REIT, and that he will
reconsider the legislative framework with a view to seeing whether the
desired objective could be produced. He did not go quite that far. He
is nodding, which I hope means that he would be able to go a little
further down the road. I would be happier with that than with the
Government just expressing concern, and saying that they would keep it
under review.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000621"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> The magic word could be (a). I should like to
reflect on the point made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. He made
a slightly different point to that made this morning by my hon. Friend
the Member for Rayleigh, which also reflected a point made by the hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. It concerned the need for social
housing, which the Conservative party supports. However, we in the
south-east do not necessarily support the proposal to build houses
throughout the south-east. Surely it would be good for the Minister to
reflect on whether, if in a couple of years, there are no further
residential
REITs&#151;</div><a name="06060872000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000622"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000624"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I heard the points that the right hon. Gentleman
was making before he was intervened on by the hon. Member for
Braintree. I said to him at a meeting that I was clear with the hon.
Member for Rayleigh about our intentions in this area, how we will
review the situation and what outcome we want to see. I cannot go
further but I ask him to accept at face value the genuineness of my and
our commitment in this area. I did ask him whether he could encourage
Conservative Members to support the Barker review. It must start with
the hon. Member for Braintree, and then build outwards. That
intervention was a perfect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 509</div>example of the problems that we face in trying to get a consensus on a
proper approach to housing in this country.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000626"></a>John
Hemming:</b> It is an important point&#151;how do we
actually get more housing for people where it is needed? One of the
underlying difficulties comes from issues such as the availability of
water. Those planning issues must be taken into account. In terms of
the rainbow coalitions that exist across the country, there is actually
a Lib Dem-Conservative progressive partnership in Birmingham, and
Birmingham wants more houses built in it.</div>

conclusion. The Minister is a reasonable man, and he went as far as I
suspect his brief allows him to go in giving the undertaking. Without
prejudice to the possibility of bringing back on Report a related
amendment, which tries to take all the tricks that have been mentioned
in this debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<a name="06060872000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question proposed,</i> That
the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06060872000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000629"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> It is a pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend
the Member for North-West Hampshire after a very useful debate. The
clause introduces the basic conditions for a tax-exempt property rental
business within the REITs regime. I should like to raise with the
Economic Secretary a concern that has arisen about the treatment of car
parks associated with shopping centres operated by property companies.
He is flicking furiously through his papers; I did give him brief prior
notice that I intended to come on to
this.</div><a name="06060872000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
condition 3 says that the property rental business must not involve
property that would, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
practice, be described as owner-occupied. No difficulty should arise if
the property company leases a shopping centre car park to a third-party
specialist car park operator, as the rent received should be included
within the normal definition of property business income. The concern
is that if the property company manages the car park itself, that could
be treated as owner-occupation within the meaning of the clause. I
raise this because I understand that there is an increasing trend for
property companies to actively manage shopping centre car parks
in-house, partly to ensure that customers arriving by car have safe,
well maintained and attractive entry and exit points for their shopping
trips.</div> <a name="06060872000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The income
from the use of property as a car park in that manner might fall
outside the REITs regime. Not only does that seem to be illogical but
it could impose a significant administrative burden on property 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 510</div>companies that are obliged to carve out for tax purposes the income from
car parks that are managed as an integral part of their overall
property business in commercial terms. The British Property Federation
commented on the point as
follows:</div><a name="06060872000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
legislation is unclear as to whether income from car parks associated
with investment properties...is to be included within the tax exempt
business. In France, legislation specifically includes such income,
which is often a core feature of property investment because car parks
are seen as an essential component of the attractiveness of the
property.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
second very specific point of concern arises from the treatment of
property companies&#146; owner-occupied car parks. The precise terms
of condition 3 could be taken to mean that because a company&#146;s
business includes an owner-occupied car park at a shopping centre, the
entire property involved is tainted for REITs purposes, and cannot be
included within the exempt pool of income. That would have the peculiar
consequence that a company that outsources a car park to an external
manager could enjoy REITs status for its rental income from the
shopping centre, while a company that manages the car park itself could
not benefit from the same treatment for all the other rental income
from the
property.</div><a name="06060872000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Martin
Barber, the chief executive of Capital and Regional plc, wrote to HMRC
on the point recently. I have met him and he has given me permission to
quote from his letter for the purposes of this debate. He summarised
the problem relating to in-house car park management as
follows:</div> <a name="06060872000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;From
the advice that we have received this would not only disqualify the
rent from being REITable but the building as a whole would be
disqualified&#148;.</div> <a name="06060872000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">He went
on to say,</div><a name="06060872000481"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I should
mention that I understand in particular, relative to car parks in
shopping centres, the French Government has recognised this and has
specifically allowed the situation I describe.&#148;</div>
<a name="06060872000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that that was not the
Government's original intention, and the subject appears to have been
partially addressed in the recent draft regulations that we all enjoyed
reading. Specifically, the Real Estate Investment Trusts (Excluded
Business) Regulations 2006 appear to deal with the second point by
providing for the situation, in which case the car park would not taint
the building for REITs purposes. So the regulations clarify that
point.</div> <a name="06060872000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
regulations still do not appear to address the first point, that the
income from an actively managed car park would itself still be excluded
from the tax-exempt business, in contrast to the French system. Can the
Economic Secretary clarify whether that interpretation is correct? If
it is, why is the car park income still to be excluded from the
tax-exempt business, even if the building itself would no longer be
tainted for REITs
purposes?</div><a name="06060872000512"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
<a name="06060872000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000630"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> This clause is important, but I am happy to confine
my remarks to car parks. The hon. Member for Rayleigh is quite right:
when we spoke last week to confirm that the regulations were arriving,
he told me that he intended to spend his weekend focusing on car parks.
The hon. Member for Braintree does not want people to build houses in
the south. I do not know 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 511</div>whether he intends that they should live in car parks, but the car park
issue raised by the hon. Member for Rayleigh is more specific. It goes
to one of the important issues in the clauses, which is how we make a
proper distinction between business that should be included within the
tax exempt ring fence and businesses or services that should be
excluded from it. That depends on whether it is income that should be
qualifying because it comes under schedule A and therefore is a rent
income, or whether it is really schedule D&#151;trading
income&#151;in which case it is about the broader provision of
services.</div>
<a name="06060872000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a shopping centre provides a
free car park for its customers, it would clearly be part of the
provision of the shopping centre and would come squarely within the tax
exempt regime. On the other hand, a car park that charged for parking,
provided security for people&#146;s cars and was not used simply by
shoppers, but rented out a floor or two to local businesses would come
squarely within schedule D and so would be required to be outside the
ring fence. Clearly there will be borderline issues which will have to
be dealt with.</div> <a name="06060872000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had representations from Capital &amp; Regional and others. I
think that the guidance in part reflects those discussions. The hon.
Member for Rayleigh is right that the regulations make it clear that
that tainting fear will not arise. More broadly, I can assure him that
before the autumn we will provide detailed guidance on the car park
issue following consultation to make sure that all of the issues that
might arise in getting that distinction between schedule A and schedule
D have been picked up. The guidance will be as clear as
possible.</div><a name="06060872000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000631"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> On that point, the Economic Secretary will be aware
that there is a great deal of talk about the potential of taxing car
parks as an environmental measure. He said that where a car park is
currently provided free, it is clearly part of the operation and comes
within the tax exempt regime. In the guidelines that he will introduce
in the autumn will he consider what would happen where money had to be
collected at a car park that was free in order to pay an environmental
tax that was levied on an out-of-town car park in the way that he
described?</div><a name="06060872000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000632"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is
making, although I fear that he may be anticipating the proposals that
we are told will be forthcoming from the Liberal Democrats in the
coming weeks. Once we find out how they are going to tax big cars, the
environment and capital gains to the tune of &#163;12 billion, we
will all have to reflect on the proposals. That may be one of the
issues that we will have to consider with regard to the REIT regime. If
such a proposal were made we would need to consider how it was to be
incorporated. Given that, as of today, there is no such proposal on the
table, it is not an issue that we need to deal with
today.</div><a name="06060872000198"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000634"></a>Ed

that it will come under schedule D rather than schedule A.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 512</div><a name="06060872000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rule is that 75 per cent. of
the business of property companies must be within schedule A, tax
exempt within a ring fence. There is nothing to stop a company that has
a proportion of its income from car park services that come outside the
ring fence from continuing to provide those services and charging for
them. They will not receive favourable tax treatment but, as long as
the 75 per cent. rule continues to apply, there will be no reason why
they could not carry on that activity. I hope that I have clarified
both points for the hon. Member for Rayleigh. If that is the case,
hopefully we can
proceed.</div><a name="06060872000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000635"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000640"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 209, in page 100,
line 39 [Vol I], at end
add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(8) Where assets
involved in the property rental business are held as trading stock, any
profit accruing by reason of this section shall not be a taxable
profit.'.</div><a name="06060872000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
touched on this matter briefly when we debated schedule 16. The clause
concerns the specific issue of double taxation in relation to
properties that are held as trading stock. The background is that some
property companies hold some of their properties on trading account as
opposed to investment properties that are held on capital account in
the usual way. To some extent, that is a historical distinction but it
is still relevant for current taxation treatment. Primarily, however,
it is a technical accounting distinction that mainly affects companies
that specialise in residential property. We return, again, to the issue
of what the regime does for residential property. I gently remind the
Minister that that problem was one of the potential impediments to the
growth of residential property REITs that I mentioned to him this
morning. He said that he would deal with the issue in detail when we
got to this point of our deliberations, and that is what I wish him to
do.</div><a name="06060872000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
low rental yield on some residential properties means that the total
commercial return necessarily includes the eventual gain on the sale of
that property. In those circumstances, such properties are often
categorised as being on trading account even though they are occupied
by someone who is paying rent and they may be held for many years prior
to their eventual sale. The existing tax consequence of that
categorisation is that the profit that arises when the property is sold
may be taxed as a simple trading profit rather than as a capital gain.
As we are talking about a capital gain, I am sure that the Liberal
Democrats are paying particular
attention.</div><a name="06060872000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
clause 111(2),</div>
<a name="06060872000483"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Assets...involved
in property rental business...shall be treated for the purposes of
corporation tax as being sold...immediately before
entry&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06060872000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">to the
REIT regime&#151;</div><a name="06060872000484"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
re-acquired...immediately after
entry.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The deemed sale
and reacquisition is treated as being at market value. If the clause
stopped there, it would mean that all property assets entering into the
REIT regime would be subject to tax on the inherent taxable gain
compared with their original cost. However, subsection (7) states
clearly that</div><a name="06060872000485"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
gain accruing by reason of this section shall not be a chargeable
gain.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
problem arises, because the deemed profit on properties that are held
as trading stock does not enjoy equivalent treatment. Therefore, such
properties will be subject to corporation tax on notional profits above
their purchase price on entry plus the 2 per cent. entry charge
stipulated in clause 112. In other words, the measure potentially
represents double taxation on the properties in question.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 514</div><a name="06060872000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our proposed amendment remedies
the situation by providing that the notional profit of stock held on
trading account is not taxable other than for the 2 per cent. entry
charge that would apply to the other properties entering the regime in
the normal way. Unless that is done, the burden of potential double
taxation will particularly affect companies in the residential sector
to the point where it could make it difficult for such companies to
contemplate converting to REIT
status.</div><a name="06060872000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have attempted to address the issue via draft regulations&#151;the
Real Estate Investment Trusts (Excluded Business) Regulations 2006,
which seek to address the problem by amending schedule 16 along the
lines that the Economic Secretary outlined a few minutes ago. My
understanding is that the instrument effectively excludes all trading
property from the REIT regime. That prevents the possibility of double
taxation, but it gives rise to many more questions about the
applicability of the REIT regime to residential property companies
because the regulations say that such properties may not enter into the
regime at all.</div><a name="06060872000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
British Property Federation has obviously also been doing some reading
during the weekend. In response to the draft regulations, it argued as
follows:</div> <a name="06060872000486"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
would appear to be a stop-gap measure to address the specific concern
with regard to double taxation but it does raise a number of questions
as to how the regime will apply to companies considering conversion to
REIT status but who hold these types of properties in
practice.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The BPF goes
on to say:</div> <a name="06060872000487"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
summary, the
amendment&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06060872000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
other words, the
regulations&#151;</div><a name="06060872000488"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;proposed
by the Government does remove the double charge but it presents a
significant element of uncertainty for these types of
assets.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fairness, the
Government appear to have acknowledged that there is a genuine issue.
However, their proposed remedy seems unnecessarily complicated. Given
all that, and as there is no Government amendment on the point, though
there are regulations, we believe that it would be better to put a
solution in the Bill, which is what our amendment is designed to
do.</div><a name="06060872000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, given all the
issues highlighted in the debate on clause 104 stand part about the
balance of commercial versus residential property, I ask the Minister
to consider accepting our amendment in order to clarify the situation
without the need for additional regulations on this specific
point.</div>

from tax that the Government are tryingto put in place and

the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) acknowledges, we have
received representations that rightly pointed out that where property
is held as trading stock, the proposal as drafted would have had the
effect of charging companies twice on entry to the regime, which was
not our intention. Last week, we published regulations to make it clear
that trading stock falls outside the tax-exempt ring fence, which means
that there is no deemed sale repurchase for properties that are trading
stock, thus no profit will arise on them on entry, neither will there
be an entry charge. The double charge will not arise.</div>
<a name="06060872000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We produced the regulations
last week in order to inform these debates, although the regulations

purpose of publishing them for
consultation.</div><a name="06060872000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 209 is designed to deal with the matter in the Bill rather than in
regulation, but our fear is that it would not achieve its intended
purpose. It is designed to extend to trading property the same
treatment that applies to investment property at the point of joining
the regime. When investment property is transferred to the tax-exempt
business on entry to the regime under clause 111 there is a deemed sale
and reacquisition at market value. Any increase over cost would
normally fall to be taxed under the rules that apply to capital gains
and under clause 111(7) that gain is ignored for tax purposes. Instead,
a 2 per cent. entry charge is payable based on the market value of the
property. The amendment would replicate that for trading stock by
providing that any profit on the deemed disposal of trading stock is
not taxable. However, it does not provide parallel treatment because it
overlooks the difference between the workings of the capital gains tax
rules and the rules for taxing trade and profits that would apply to
trading stock.</div><a name="06060872000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference is that for capital gains purposes, providing that a gain is
not taxable automatically means that a loss in similar circumstances is
not relievable. For trading stock there is no automatic prevention of
tax relief for any losses. As drafted, the amendment would open up the
possibility of relief for losses where the profit in the same
circumstances is tax exempt. That undermines one of the key principles
of the tax-exempt ring fence and would expose the Exchequer to loss of
tax should companies try to manipulate their portfolios to crystallise
losses on trading stock.</div>
<a name="06060872000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that reason, we do not
believe that taking the route proposed by the amendment is the right
way to deal with the issue. It would potentially undermine the
tax-exempt ring fence and add a substantial extra cost to the taxpayer.
Our preferred option is to ask the Committee to reject the amendment in
the knowledge that we will consult in detail on the draft regulations
to ensure that the final regulations do not cause any undue problems
for those
concerned.</div><a name="06060872000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000642"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for
stressing that the regulations are in draft form. The final regulations
will presumably be dealt 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 516</div>with by statutory instrument sometime this autumn. I have a funny
feeling that he and I will end up debating the final
version.</div><a name="06060872000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled this
probing amendment to tease out the Government&#146;s thinking and the
Economic Secretary has given me some justification for amending
schedule 16 by regulation. Given that consultation is now under way, I
am grateful that he has acknowledged that there is a genuine issue to
be addressed, even if we do not entirely agree on the solution. It is a
problem that has to be overcome somehow. If it is accepted that
residential REITs should be fostered in the UK I am not convinced that
the Government&#146;s solution of just automatically excluding such
properties from the regime will necessarily be the right
answer.</div><a name="06060872000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put down
that marker with respect to the consultation that will now take place
and I do not entirely concede the point made by the Economic Secretary.
However, given that the Opposition have raised the issue, that a
consultation is under way, and that the Economic Secretary has realised
that something needs to be done, it is sensible to withdraw the
amendment and pursue matters in the context of the consultation.
Hopefully we can all come up with a solution in the autumn. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000643"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> The importance of the clause is that it sets
out the entry charge&#151;the membership fee&#151;that a company
will have to pay to become a REIT. It would be helpful if the Minister
explained the logic of the 2 per cent. entry charge that is set out in
the clause, because that was not something on which there was
consultation&#151;the Government took the view that it was a tax
measure and therefore something that was announced in the
Budget.</div><a name="06060872000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">No one who has
ever negotiated with the Treasury or with the Customs and
Excise&#151;HMRC as it is now known&#151;would argue that either of
them is a soft touch. There was some surprise, however, when
the2 per cent. rate was announced in the Budget. I am not a
regular reader of <i class="I">The Tax Journal</i>, but an article in the 3 April
edition
said:</div><a name="06060872000489"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
entry charge will be based on 2 per cent. of the gross asset value of
properties going into the regime. This is at the lower end of many
estimates&#148;.</div><a name="06060872000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the article was published, British Land has announced that it will
convert to a REIT. The business pages of <i class="I">The Times</i> reported on
what the company had said as follows:</div>
<a name="06060872000490"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The group said that it
expected a one-off conversion charge of &#163;287 million to convert
to a Reit, but the new structure would, in effect, wipe out &#163;1.3
billion in contingent capital gains
tax.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be quite
helpful, against the background of that equation, if the Minister would
set out how the Government arrived at the 2 per cent. rate, and if he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 517</div>could satisfy us that it represents a fair deal between the taxpayer on
the one hand and the company on the other, because when a business
becomes a REIT it enters a more benign tax regime and does not pay
capital gains tax on future property
disposal.</div><a name="06060872000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">At one point
in time there was a contingent liability of &#163;1.3 billion for
British Land, and that might have continued to grow if property values
increased, but it will be extinguished by a one-off conversion charge
of &#163;287 million. It would be interesting to know the discount
rate that the Treasury used in order to arrive at the 2 per cent.
figure.</div><a name="06060872000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 112(3)
contains a rather complicated equation. The explanatory notes
state:</div><a name="06060872000491"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
amount is 2 per cent. of the aggregate market value of properties that
are transferred...divided by the rate of tax applicable to the
company&#146;s
profits.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister explain that? If, at a certain point in time, the company is
not paying any tax on its profits&#151;perhaps because it is not
making any&#151;would it follow that there would be no entry fee, or
is it impossible to become a REIT without some sort of membership fee
being paid?</div><a name="06060872000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee should not let the clause through on the nod, because
substantial sums are at stake and it is the first time that the 2 per
cent. charge has been
debated.</div><a name="06060872000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060872000644"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I am pleased
that there is so much interest from the Conservative Benches in
relation to the Liberal Democrats&#146; tax proposals. Although this
is clearly not the right place for it to happen, I wait with interest
to see whether there will be any further detail from the Conservatives
on their tax
policies.</div><a name="06060872000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
brief questions on the clause to ask the Economic Secretary. The first
follows on from what the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire has
just said. I understand that the justification for the entry charge is
to ensure that the regime is of no overall cost to the Exchequer. I see
from the Red Book, in one of the appendices, that in the first three
years the introduction of the new regime will bring revenue into the
Exchequer. I am interested to know what the long-term projections are.
As the right hon. Gentleman said, businesses are leaping to convert to
the trust system because it represents a long-term tax benefit to them.
What assessment has the Treasury made of that
matter?</div><a name="06060872000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
have a question about clause 112(5), on the instalments that REITs may
elect to use to pay the entry charge upon conversion. What will happen
if a newly established REIT breaches one of its conditions in the first
four years, before it has paid all its instalments? Will the remaining
instalments fall or will the REIT still be liable for its 2 per cent.
entry charge even though it has fallen out of the
system?</div><a name="06060872000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000645"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The Government were clear from the beginning of the
consultation process in 2004 that a key objective of the introduction
of REITs was that it should not involve a cost or a loss of tax to the
Exchequer. As the right hon. Member for North-West 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 518</div>Hampshire made clear, that important consideration has led us down the
route of introducing the conversion charge. While it is true that the
numbers chosen were not consulted on, the overall concept of a
conversion charge was always a clear part of the
regime.</div><a name="06060872000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The entry
charge will be payable when a company elects to join the regime or when
a subsidiary company is acquired by an existing REIT. It will be 2 per
cent. of the market value of the properties transferred to the
tax-exempt property rental business of a UK REIT. A company may not set
any losses against that amount. It can choose to pay the full amount of
tax as part of its normal corporation tax payment in the first
accounting period in which it is in the regime, or it can spread it
over four years. The clause provides the Treasury with the regulatory
power to change the amounts of the instalments, but only as a result of
changes in interest
rates.</div><a name="06060872000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall answer
some of the points raised by hon. Members. The right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire asked about the rate of the interest used to
calculate the conversion charge. It is equivalent to the
Government&#146;s nominal discount rate&#151;a real discount rate
of 3.5 per cent, adjusted by the retail prices index. The right hon.
Gentleman also asked why we came to the figure of 2 per cent. Our
judgment was that that was the right figure to ensure, over a period of
years, that it would cause neither a net cost nor a net revenue rise to
the Exchequer. If we had gone above 2 per cent. it would have had a
deleterious effect on the number of companies choosing to move into the
REITs regime.</div><a name="06060872000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
our important debates on these clauses, the hon. Member for Braintree
has voiced his concern that companies will not want to join the REITs
regime, whereas the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia
Goldsworthy) has talked about companies flocking into it. She is right:
a number of companies have indicated that they will join, precisely
because the consultation allowed us to get the numbers right. I am
therefore confident that the regime will be
successful.</div><a name="06060872000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Member for North-West Hampshire asked whether the regime will lead
to substantial windfall gains for certain companies. I say to him that
one must always take with a pinch of salt the numbers that one reads in
the press about potential liability. When one is considering
introducing a new measure that will raise revenue, the numbers that
appear in the press are often substantially higher than those that turn
out to be
correct.</div><a name="06060872000514"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="06060872000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">One only has to
remember that a few days ago we were debating clauses on the
insurance industry. Back in the autumn companies feared that the cost
of introducing those clauses could run into the &#163;1 billion to
&#163;1.5 billion range. Actually, the numbers are closer to
&#163;100 million. Exactly the same thing applies
here.</div><a name="06060872000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000646"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> You changed the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000647"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> We did not change the rules; we clarified them to
ensure that they were clear. The same thing arises in terms of the
right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 519</div><a name="06060872000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000648"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> Will the Economic Secretary give
way?</div><a name="06060872000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000649"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I shall answer the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point; then he can tell me why he
disagrees.</div><a name="06060872000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this
case, we have introduced a regime that will be beneficial to some
companies that have a greater deal of potential capital gains in their
portfolios, therefore, ex post, as opposed to ex ante, it is not
surprising that stories appear in the press to the extent that their
gains will be substantial. On the basis of our investigations, before
the announcement in the Budget and afterwards, the capital gains
liabilities reported in the media do not provide an accurate picture of
the actual tax that would have been paid by companies if they sold
their properties. Also, many property companies have losses available
that would offset any charge on capital gains on conversion to UK REITs
status. Our judgment, before the Budget announcement and today, is that
this will still be a
revenue-neutral&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06060872000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am explaining to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne that in the
Budget documentation we show that, in the early years, the impact of
introducing UK REITs would give a net yield to the Exchequer of
&#163;35 million, then &#163;155 million and then &#163;130
million. However, it is a standard practice, as she will know, to
publish the net effect of a measure. The figures I have mentioned show
the net impact of a reduction of taxes at the corporate level, with
increases in tax at the investment level, including the entry charge.
However, in the later years there is a cost to the Exchequer of the
introduction of the conversion charge: over the period it ends up
netting out. We are confident that the measure will be introduced, as
we always intended, without an overall gain or loss to the
Exchequer.</div><a name="06060872000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000650"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> In which case, given the problems facing the
Treasury, bringing forward tax revenues may not be wholly
disadvantageous. The point that I wanted to make was this: is the
Economic Secretary saying that the figures given by the chairman of
British Land after the Budget, at the company&#146;s annual general
meeting, did not accurately recognise the entry charge and the
potential capital gains tax forgone? Surely, he is not saying that the
figures are
wrong.</div><a name="06060872000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000651"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The right hon. Gentleman, who has experience in
these matters and has spent considerable time on the Government Benches
in Committee, will know that that is exactly what I was not saying. It
would be wrong for me or anybody to comment on the tax or other affairs
of any individual or company. The only point that I was making is that
the general reports that one has seen in the press about the potential
scale of gains to companies because of the introduction of the
conversion charge at this level are not, in our view, fully accurate.
In fact, we will be introducing the conversion charge in a way that is
revenue-neutral to the Exchequer over a period of
years.</div><a name="06060872000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s underlying point is right; by introducing this
regime, we are substantially improving the tax position of companies
that invest in the commercial and residential property market for rent.
We are removing a situation in which, before the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 520</div>introduction of the REITs regime, a higher rate taxpayer would be paying
47.5 per cent. tax for indirect investment; that would be reduced to 40
per cent., because of the UK REIT. Similarly, a pension fund would be
paying 30 per cent. on indirect investment, but that would be reduced
to 0 per cent. as a result of the REIT. The right hon. Gentleman is
right. However, we are reducing a substantial incentive for investors
who are currently tax advantaged to invest directly to be able to
invest indirectly through a REIT regime. Property companies that are
going to transfer into the REIT regime will do so and get a substantial
ongoing benefit because of those changes to the tax regime and the
tax-exempt ring fence. The right thing to do is to ensure that that
does not happen at the expense of the taxpayer, hence the 2 per cent.
conversion charge, which we are confident has been introduced at the
right level, as I said. On that basis, I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="06060872000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000652"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I wish to make one brief, technical point on
clause 112. Subsection (7)
states:</div><a name="06060872000492"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Treasury may by regulations amend a percentage specified in subsection
(5) in order to reflect a change in interest rates&#148;.</div>
<a name="06060872000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a permissive power to be
exercised by regulation. For the avoidance of doubt, will the Minister
confirm that that works both up and down, and that if interest rates
were to fall, theoretically, the regulations could reduce the charge,
as well as increase them if interest rates were to
rise?</div><a name="06060872000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000653"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> It is for others to interpret that clause, but I
take it at face value. The Government intend the 2 per cent. conversion
charge to deliver a revenue-neutral situation for the Exchequer. As I
have said, that will be reflected in the way in which the system
operates, and therefore there is no intended symmetry. I hope that that
provides
reassurance.</div><a name="06060872000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000654"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I have a brief query. The clause deals with
ring-fencing and the definition of tax-exempt and tax-liable businesses
at the time that a company converts to REIT status. What happens if a
lease is signed before conversion to REIT status, and after that when
rent continues to be paid under REIT status? Is that tax liable under
the previous regime or the REIT tax
regime?</div><a name="06060872000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000655"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I am happy to answer that question. I think that
the Liberal Democrats will have to focus their interests increasingly
on the tax-exempt regime because they would find companies increasingly
attracted to tax exemptions were we to go down the road that they seem
to be proposing. As I understand it&#151;the detail has yet to be put
before us&#151;the proposals are for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 521</div>substantial tax increases on businesses, and particularly on
entrepreneurs, including in the property sector. So I understand her
concern about the clause, and I hope that I can give her some
reassurance to pass on, although I fear that once businesses read the

scant reassurance.</div><a name="06060872000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

under leases entered into prior to the UK REIT regime are not
tax-exempt. The answer to that question is, &#147;No, it does not
mean that&#148;. The reference to income relating to pre-UK REIT
businesses deals with unusual circumstances. For example, it would
exclude tax-exempt business damages awarded by a court to a company
after it entered a regime when the damages relate to an incident that
happened before that company entered the regime. I think that I can
reassure her on that particular

which a shareholder owns more than 10 per cent. of the shares.
Originally, the Government intended to impose a limit on shareholdings
of 10 per cent. which effectively could not be breached. That would
have been one of the hard conditions of the regime. However, following

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000657"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> That is
straightforward.</div><a name="06060872000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000658"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> As the hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary
position, it is reasonably straightforward. I concur, but to prove that
I have taken the trouble to read the regulation and the formula, will
the Economic Secretary take the Committee through how it will work in
practice?</div><a name="06060872000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000659"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I have one question on clause 114, which
deals with maximum shareholding. The REIT can be required to monitor
that maximum shareholding is not breached, but it cannot prevent such
breaches from taking place because it cannot control the behaviour of
its shareholders. Are REITs liable for tax penalties if they breach the
maximum shareholding condition, or do they just need to make sure that
they do not make distributions to shareholders who breach the
shareholding
limit?</div><a name="06060872000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000660"></a>Ed
Balls:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am grateful to the hon. Member for
Rayleigh for showing me that he studied the regulations. I could walk
him through the formula in detail. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I could,
actually, which is what should worry hon. Members, but I fear that it
would run the risk of becoming a post-neo-classical endogenous growth
theory moment, and we have had one of
those.</div><a name="06060872000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the
hon. Gentleman that the formula has been carefully drawn up in
consultation with the industry precisely to achieve the intention he
mentioned, which is to give us a bit more flexibility. As he knows, a
great deal of time was spent on consultations in 2004-05 partly to find
a way to introduce a UK REIT without causing substantial losses of tax,
particularly because of the operation of international tax treaties.
The 10 per cent. shareholding limit was necessary to achieve that aim,
but the industry was concerned that a rigid approach to it would be
difficult to deliver and
monitor.</div><a name="06060872000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
through the consultation, we have come up with a solution that achieves
Government objectives but gives us more flexibility at the same time. I
do not know whether the hon. Member for Rayleigh brought his copy of
the regulations with him, but to provide some clarity for the
<i class="I">Hansard </i>reporter, who clearly did not follow him as he read it
out, I shall pass him a
copy.</div><a name="06060872000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000661"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> May I confirm for the record that I most
definitely brought my copy of the regulations with me? If the hon.
Gentleman thinks that I can carry around a formula like that in my
head, he flatters me a bit too
much.</div><a name="06060872000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000662"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> In that case, maybe I could have mine
back.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column522" />Column number: 523</div><a name="06060872000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I read out a quote this morning
from the British Property Federation that commented on how we have
listened to the property industry&#146;s views and concerns. That is
a good example of the Government listening and presenting a
solution&#151; although the formula that the hon. Member for Rayleigh
read out sounded complicated&#151;that is designed to create
flexibility and to avoid an overly heavy-handed and regulatory approach
to delivery. He may intervene to confirm that. However, he probably
favours the formula rather than opposes it. An intervention confirming
that he supports the regulation would be
welcome.</div><a name="06060872000515"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45pm</div><a name="06060872000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000663"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> The Economic Secretary is right that the
Government consulted with the industry. What I am prepared to say is
that we favour, in principle, that that is no longer a hard requirement
and that the Government have introduced flexibility into the system in
the treatment of the dividends. Therefore, if the original position was
that the 10 per cent. limit was absolute and the new position is that
one can, in certain circumstances, go beyond 10 per cent. subject to a
tax charge, that is better than the original hard 10 per cent. limit.
That I am prepared to confirm to the
Minister.</div><a name="06060872000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000664"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Rayleigh. We
can both agree that a long equation can sometimes be helpful in
providing flexibility and a solution to a problem. It shows why the
consultation was successful and also that the Government were sensible
to provide draft regulations to inform the
debate.</div><a name="06060872000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">To provide
some reassurance to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, she
asked whether the tax charge applies only when the distribution is made
rather than when there is an excess shareholder. The answer to that is
yes. It applies only if the dividend is paid to the excess shareholder.
I hope that gives her some reassurance. On that basis, I hope we can
proceed.</div><a name="06060872000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000665"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I made the comment to the Economic Secretary about
the reason for the 10 per cent. because of the potential risk of loss
of revenue due to overseas unit holders being able to claim the benefit
of double taxation treaties. If it were not for that, and I
donot know if the Economic Secretary would agree,
the10 per cent. rule would be undesirable. The Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said that it may limit the
number of companies that will be likely to convert to a REIT at the
outset and will subsequently constrain the creation of new REITs
through spin-offs, demergers and so on.</div>
<a name="06060872000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at an international
comparison of REITs or equivalent vehicles&#151;Australia does not
have a maximum percentage, Canada does not have a maximum, and nor does
the US. One can quote other countries. Is the Treasury engaged in any
negotiation on amending those international taxation treaties so that
it is no longer necessary to have the 10 per cent.? If so, what
progress has been
made?</div><a name="06060872000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000666"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> We could have decided to attempt to renegotiate the
series of tax treaties that we have with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 524</div>other countries. Alternatively we could have decided to consult with the
industry to ensure that the 10 per cent. rule works in a flexible,
rather than a rigid, way. A number of large companies are saying that
they are going to move over to the UK REIT. That shows that the 10 per
cent. rule will not be the obstacle that the hon. Gentleman
fears.</div> <a name="06060872000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer to
his question is that we have not sought to renegotiate tax treaties. We
have instead sought to re-introduce a flexible solution to the issue.
If we had not done that, the introduction of a UK REIT would have been
held up for some time.</div>
<a name="06060872000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000667"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> To avoid doubt, I am not critical about the
introduction of the 10 per cent. rule. It seems the quickest way in
which we could have progressed. However, given that we have done that
and bought some time, is it not possible to, at the same time, look
again at those international taxation treaties to see what, in the
fullness of time, may be a disadvantage. However, I accept the point
that time will tell on
that.</div><a name="06060872000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000668"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I can provide reassurance on that point. All the
time, we are considering tax treaties and renegotiating them, and my
experience has been that the process can take considerable time. If a
tax treaty is renegotiated, many issues need to be considered. As we
move forward and renegotiate tax treaties in future, we will ensure
that the UK REIT issue is fully factored into them. However, we shall
not seek to renegotiate all the tax treaties for that purpose, and we
shall certainly not renegotiate all of them before we introduce a REIT
regime&#151;that is why we have gone for the 10 per cent. rule. We
shall factor the REIT regime into future discussions.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000669"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 103, line
28 [Vol I], after &#145;section', insert &#145;106(5) or
(6),'.</div><a name="06060872000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000670"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments Nos. 169, 146, 152 and
153.</div><a name="06060872000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000671"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> Clause 116, which contains the key conditions for
companies wishing to join and remain in the UK REIT regime, has already
been debated in the Committee of the whole House. As discussed during
that debate, those conditions are key to the regime and of a type
generally within the control of the company. On that basis, a breach of
one of those conditions will result in removal from the regime, with
effect from the end of the previous accounting period.</div>
<a name="06060872000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, following discussion
with industry representatives, it has come to the Government&#146;s
attention that in some circumstances companies might breach conditions
3 and 4 through no fault of their own. Those conditions relate to being
listed on a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 525</div>recognised stock exchange and not being a close company. It has been
argued, and the Government have been persuaded, that a company could
become close without being aware of the fact, due to the actions of
shareholders.</div> <a name="06060872000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has
also been argued that during a takeover, a company in the process of
being absorbed by another UK REIT, which was itself listed, might be
delisted from a stock exchange. It might also fail the close company
test at some point. In that case, the company being taken over would
lose its UK REIT status under the current rules with effect from the
end of the previous accounting period. In addition, the company
carrying out the takeover would be forced to pay an entry charge on the
assets of the target company&#151;assets that would have already been
subject to an entry charge at an earlier date.</div>
<a name="06060872000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both situations would be unfair
to the participating companies, so it is proposed that instead of such
companies being ejected automatically from the regime, the conditions
be added to clause 116, which subjects such companies to the minor
breach conditions in the same way as clauses 107 and
108.</div><a name="06060872000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments to
clause 130 are connected to those to clause 116. The latter add the
listing and close company conditions to a list of minor breaches of the
regime&#146;s conditions; the former stop breaches of those two
conditions from resulting in automatic rejection from the regime. Mr.
Benton, I ask you to note that there are connected amendments to
schedule 17, which will be discussed in due course; they are also in
the spirit of those changes and clarifications.</div>
<a name="06060872000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of what the hon.
Member for Rayleigh said earlier, as the amendments respond to
particular industry concerns I hope that they can be welcomed by the
Committee. I commend them all.</div>
<a name="06060872000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000672"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> To respond directly to the Economic
Secretary&#146;s last comment, we indeed welcome the amendments to
clause 116, which are grouped with the sensible contingent amendments
to clause 130, which we also welcome. I welcome them not least because
we called for something similar in the Committee of the whole House
debate on 3 May. We gratefully welcome the Minister&#146;s acceptance
of a good idea.</div> <a name="06060872000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key point is that the conditions of clause 106 are such that any breach
could result in the automatic disqualification of the company concerned
from the REITs regime. As I put it at the time, that represents a
sending-off offence rather than a booking, as applies to some other
conditions in the Bill, which are covered by the minor or inadvertent
breach procedure in clause 116 and which are further fleshed out by the
draft Real Estate Investment Trusts (Breach of Condition) Regulations
2006.</div><a name="06060872000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
amendments seek to apply the minor or inadvertent breach procedure for
two of the clause 106 conditions: condition 3, the recognised stock
exchange listing requirement, and condition 4, the restriction on REITs
being close companies&#151;that is, those controlled by five or fewer
shareholders. As I asked at the time, with reference to clause 106,
why, in principle, should a company be forced out of the REIT 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 526</div>regime because it is controlled by five or fewer people? It would be
interesting to hear the Government&#146;s thinking. For instance, a
company that breached the condition would automatically be removed from
the regime. Companies might therefore be required to monitor their
shareholdings continuously, to ensure that the condition was not
breached.</div> <a name="06060872000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because the
actions are to some extent, however, outside the company&#146;s
control, the management might not be able to anticipate, or even
prevent, such a breach, even though, were it to occur, it might cost
them their REIT status, and, in some circumstances, might not be their
fault. The Government amendments appear to recognise that potential
unfairness, and, although they do not remove the two conditions, they
have in effect introduced some tolerance of minor or inadvertent
breaches. They have made them yellow card rather than red card
offences. That is judicious of the Government and we therefore welcome
the amendments.</div>

Goldsworthy:</b> I want briefly to say that I too welcome the
amendments. The provisions deal with inadvertent breaches, which may be
beyond the control of the real estate investment trust. Allowing such
breaches to cause them to lose their status would, in turn, make the
REIT system a less attractive and more unstable option for investment;
the amendments would give greater
certainty.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000679"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> Amendment No. 150 seeks to amend a minor drafting
error, and I shall then turn to amendments Nos. 210 to 212, which would
make changes to the part of the clause that introduces a development
test into the regime. All the amendments relate to the same part of the
clause, so it might be useful if I first explain how the development
test works and what its purpose is.</div>
<a name="06060872000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I stated at the outset of
the debate on part 4of the Bill, the Government&#146;s aim
is to correct inefficiencies in the property rental market by
equalising the tax treatment between direct and indirect investment in
property. Because there are no such inefficiencies in the property
development market, the Government do not intend to give a tax
exemption to corporate income derived from developing property for
sale. The test contained in the legislation seeks to establish rules
for what happens when a company develops property, rents it out for a
short time and then sells
it.</div><a name="06060872000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although case law
on what amounts to a trading profit is well established, its
application can lead to prolonged discussion with the Revenue. To avoid
that discussion and provide certainty, if a rental asset is developed
and sold within three years of completion, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column527" />Column number: 528</div>the gain on sale is worked out on the basis that the property was never
within the ring fence.</div>
<a name="06060872000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Development for the purpose of
this test means that more than 30 per cent. of the value of the asset
when it entered the regime has been spent on further development. The
test does not automatically mean that the gain will be taxed as a
trading gain, only that it will fall outside the ring fence, where the
normal case law rules will apply to determine whether it is a trading
profit or a capital gain. However, the Government appreciate that
treatment of the disposal as being part of the taxable business is
inconsistent with having collected an entry charge on the asset. The
clause therefore provides a mechanism for a refund of part of the entry
charge in such
circumstances.</div><a name="06060872000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
consultation, concern was raised about the existence of the development
test and some commentators felt that the existing case law would be
sufficient. For those who do not know the details of the existing case
law&#151;I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West
does&#151;</div><a name="06060872000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000680"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Remind
me.</div><a name="06060872000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000681"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> These are called the indicia of trade, or badges of
trade, and date back to the 1820s. A number of indicators can be used
in deciding whether to count a capital gain as a trading capital gain
for these purposes.</div>
<a name="06060872000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is, however, important to
remember that the tax-exempt environment offers a far greater incentive
for a company to try to manipulate the factual evidence to ensure that
a tax exemption is obtained. In practice, the discussions about what
constitutes a trading profit are often protracted. This test simply
acts to add certainty, and tax profits on disposal in the same way as
would have been the case had the company not been a UK REIT. The
profits may be taxable either as trading profits or as a chargeable
gain depending on the facts. There is no element of penalty.</div>
<a name="06060872000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn to the Government
amendment. As originally drafted, the clause established as the base
cost for determining the value of any development the earlier of the
date of entry of the property into the regime or the purchase of the
property. Responding to concerns expressed by the industry during the
consultation period, the amendment would change that to the later of
the two dates, as it would clearly be wrong to use as a base cost the
value of the property when it was purchased should that purchase have
happened before the company entered the regime. That is in line with
the Government&#146;s intentions in this
area.</div><a name="06060872000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three Opposition
amendments, Nos. 210, 211 and 212, have been proposed to this clause.
The first seeks to add a definition of the phrase &#147;completion of
development&#148;, and links that with the practical completion of
the main building contract. In the Government&#146;s opinion, such
clarification does not need to appear in statute, but is best dealt
with through guidance. That is because property development encompasses
a vast number of possible scenarios and any definition of
&#147;completion of development&#148; is likely to fall short of
being able to be dealt with in all cases. It would, therefore, add to
the complexity rather than solving the problem.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column528" />Column number: 529</div><a name="06060872000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">In simple cases, the proposed
definition might well deliver what is required. However, in many other
cases, including phased development, the definition might well result
in a more restrictive position than would be ideal. If, as we would
prefer, the position is dealt with through guidance, a comprehensive
explanation can be given and the approach can be updated as necessary
to reflect current industry practice. I do not want to suggest to
Opposition Members that we are unsympathetic to their intention, but
the issue would be better dealt with in guidance than in
statute.</div><a name="06060872000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
211 proposes that, in the determination of whether the 30 per cent.
development cost threshold is breached, each development of property is
assessed separately. Again, although the amendment reflects to an
extent the position that may be adopted in practice, the matter is
better dealt with in guidance, so that all possible scenarios can be
covered flexibly and effectively without complex primary legislation.
It is likely that further guidance would be needed to clarify the
meaning of the phrase &#147;each development of property&#148;.
Little would be achieved by trying to establish that detail in primary
legislation.</div><a name="06060872000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance on all the UK REIT legislation will be published within three
months of Royal Assent, in line with usual practice, and I will
endeavour to ensure that that guidance is published as early as
possible. Again, there is no lack of sympathy with the intent, but we
must take a practical view on how best to achieve the objective. I
therefore invite the Committee to reject the
amendment.</div><a name="06060872000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 212 would change the application of the test in a way that could be
costly to the Exchequer. It would mean that if a property was acquired
by a UK REIT, subsequently developed and sold after three years, the
disposal profit would automatically be tax exempt. To ensure that its
disposal profit was tax exempt, a UK REIT would have only to develop a
property and hold it for three years, even if there was a clear
intention to develop for the purpose of reselling at a profit. That
would be a clear subversion of the intention of the regime, which is to
encourage the long-term holding of property for investment purposes,
and development to the extent that it supports that aim. The amendment
would allow property trading activity within the tax-exempt ring fence
and would be wide open to abuse.</div>
<a name="06060872000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">From a technical standpoint, it
would also mean that the tax-exempt ring fence, which has been
carefully drawn around schedule A rental profits, would potentially
include trading profits as well. The rules dealing with calculation of
tax-exempt profits provide a mechanism only for calculating schedule A
income, for the simple reason that that is the type of income for which
the regime is designed. If the amendment was accepted, consequential
changes would be needed to the rest of the legislation that have not
been considered.</div><a name="06060872000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand why the British Property Federation and others would like to
support such an amendment: it would provide for them a safe harbour
rather than, as they would refer to it, the choppy waters of the
current position. However, we are trying to achieve the right balance
between providing flexibility and clarity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 530</div>for the industry and ensuring that the revenue base is properly
protected. I can promise the Committee that, in the operation of the
regime and in the guidance, we will keep a firm but sensitive hand on
the tiller. On that basis, I urge the Opposition to drop their
amendments.</div><a name="06060872000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000682"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 210 to 212. The
proposed REITs regime allows for a company to have essentially two
streams of business, one being tax exempt and the other being residual
business remaining taxable as a company. Clause 125 deals with the
movement of assets from the tax-exempt business to the residual taxable
part of the company. In particular, it deals with certain development
properties. However, hon. Members will appreciate that the precise
definition of a development property is not straightforward. A property
company might have one initial intention with regard to a development,
but might then quite legitimately do something different to take
advantage of commercial
circumstances.</div><a name="06060872000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
give a simple example. A company might develop a building with a view
to keeping it as a long-term investment, but it might then receive an
attractive offer to sell it at market value that it decides to accept,
in contrast to its original plan. With clause 125, the Treasury has
given itself certain parameters within which a developed property will
always be deemed to fall outside the REITs regime. Our amendments are
designed to provide an equivalent degree of certainty for the taxpayer.
One can summarise that by saying that what is good for the goose is
good for the
gander.</div><a name="06060872000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
210 would clarify the application of the three-year period within which
a disposal of a developed property automatically pushes it into the
taxable category. Clause 125 refers to the period of three years
beginning with</div><a name="06060872000502"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
completion of the
development.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
property industry, the term &#147;completion date&#148; is
potentially ambiguous. The amendment would clarify the requirement. It
refers to</div><a name="06060872000503"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;practical
completion of the main contract for the relevant building
works.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">That terminology
is well understood in the property industry, and it is essentially the
point to which the architect certifies that the building is complete,
subject to any minor residual works, which are often referred to in the
trade as &#147;snagging&#148;.</div>
<a name="06060872000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The certification by the
architect is often used to trigger payments under the construction
contract. John Richards, the chief executive of Hammerson plc, recently
wrote to me on the issue of REITs. Although he gave a broad welcome to
the proposed regime, he expressed a concern about clause 125(7). He
said:</div><a name="06060872000504"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
drafted, the provision will create uncertainties, as after the major
part of the development has been executed there is often a long tail of
minor works. It should be made clear that for these purposes a
development is completed on the date of practical completion of the
main building
contract.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
210 would include such well understood industry terminology in the
clause to provide clarity in the definition of when the three-year
clock effectively begins to tick. That should help to avoid unnecessary
disputes between HMRC and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 531</div>taxpayers. It would help to provide clarity, and we hope that the
Government will not resist it.</div>
<a name="06060872000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
amendment No. 211 would remove ambiguity in the interpretation of
clause 125 by stipulating that the 30 per cent. cost threshold to
define development should be applied separately to different programmes
of work. In other words, if a company spends money on a project to
improve a property beyond 30 per cent. of the fair value, that would
constitute development, whereas spending only 20 per cent. would not.
The ambiguity might arise if a renovation project cost 15 per cent. and
a separate project some time later cost a third of 15 per cent. The
British Property Federation explains the problem in its briefing note
as
follows:</div><a name="06060872000505"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
amendment seeks to ensure that each development of property is
considered uniquely for the purpose of deciding whether it is in breach
of the 30 per cent. fair value limit imposed by the
clause.&#148;</div><a name="06060872000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">So each
development property would be considered on its own for the 30 per cent
test.</div> <a name="06060872000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
212 would apply the three-year cut-off point after the development in
an equitable manner. The existing clause states that if a property is
disposed of within three years of completion, it falls outside the
REITs regime. The amendment matches that, saying that if a property
were disposed of after three years of completion, it would fall within
the REITs regime. Again, that would provide greater certainty all
round. In summary, I hope that the amendments are similar, and that the
Government will accept them. It is my intention to press amendment No.
210 to a
vote.</div><a name="06060872000364"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000683"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I will not repeat the remarks that I made in
introducing the amendment, but I should like to say to the hon. Member
for Rayleigh, as I tried to explain in detail a moment ago, that we
understand the need for clarity here. We understand that there is
ambiguity, and that leads to uncertainty. The question is whether the
uncertainty can be cleared up through the amendments that he has
tabled. Our fear is that what he seeks to do by tabling the amendments
will fail in practice. Although he hopes, by introducing those terms to
the Bill, to clear up uncertainty, our fear is that all the amendments
would do is introduce further ambiguities.
</div><a name="06060872000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, although
it is the case&#151;I accept at face value what the hon. Gentleman
says, because it has been put to us by the industry&#151;that the
terms that amendments Nos. 210 and 211 introduce are commonly
understood by the industry to apply in the normal course of business, I
also explained to him that there are a substantial number of exceptions
to the normal course of business. The moment that we introduced a
definition into primary legislation without clarifying how we will
operate in all the exceptional circumstances, I fear that all we would
do would be to compound the problem of uncertainty rather than solve
it. That is why, as I explained in my opening speech, the solution,
rather than adding ambiguity and uncertainty onto ambiguity and
uncertainty, would be to use the process of publishing guidance in
order to provide the clarity that he seeks.</div>
<a name="06060872000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I am absolutely clear
that ambiguity in the operation of the tax system must be dealt with,
to do that in primary legislation would be a mistake. The common
practice is to make clear in statute the law, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 532</div>intent and rules of the game but then, having done so, to use guidance
and discussion with Revenue officials to ensure that the application in
practice is understood fully by the
industry.</div><a name="06060872000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not in any way intending to pour cold water on the points made by
the hon. Gentleman and by people in the industry&#151;those points
have also been made to us&#151;but I urge him not to press the matter
to a vote. Instead, I ask him to accept that guidance is a better route
for dealing with the issues that he raised. I urge the Committee to
reject the amendment. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>]

listened to the Economic Secretary&#146;s argument but I am not
convinced. The purpose of amendment No. 210 is to introduce in the Bill
a clearly understood term that will allow people in the industry to
know exactly where they stand. Therefore, we are not introducing
ambiguity into the process but removing it. Everybody in the industry
understands what the term means, and if the Economic Secretary were to
include it in the Bill, it would give much greater clarity and there
would be far fewer test cases and long debates between property
developers and officials of HMRC. In that sense, we would make
everyone&#146;s life easier. I can understand sometimes why a
Treasury Minister would not want such clarity, but there is a good
common-sense case for it. As I am not persuaded by the Economic
Secretary&#146;s argument, it is my intention to press amendment No.

amendments to schedule 17, which applies the conditions of the UK REIT
regime to groups of companies. Amendment No. 162 has in effect already
been discussed, so I shall address it quickly before dealing with the
other amendments. It is connected to our earlier discussions on clauses
116 and 130. It provides that in a takeover situation involving two UK
REITs, the target of the takeover will not lose its REIT
status.</div> <a name="06060872000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendment No. 160. For the purpose of the balance of business test,
which requires at least 75 per cent. of a company&#146;s business to
be property rental, it was always the Government&#146;s intention to
apply a definition of property rental business uniformly across a group
UK REIT, whether or not the group&#146;s business is carried out in
the UK and regardless of the country 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column533" />Column number: 534</div>of residence of the group member that owns the property. Following

aim in the Bill as drafted. Amendment No. 160 will ensure that we
do.</div><a name="06060872000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
154 to 156 relate to the treatment of overseas members of a group. They
follow recommendations from the British Property Federation and others,
and clarify the treatment of UK property held by overseas subsidiary
companies for the purpose of the entry charge. They provide that such
property will be subject to the entry charge, and that the charge will
be assessed as income tax, which will be freestanding&#151;in other
words, companies will not be able to offset losses against it. The
amendment will ensure that an entry charge is collected in all cases in
which the regime confers a tax exemption on a flow of rental income and
ensure that no loss of tax or manipulation of the regime can result
from unclear
drafting.</div><a name="06060872000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 161 is also on UK property held by foreign subsidiaries, and will
ensure that the Bill reflects the original policy intention that a tax
exemption should be conferred when dividends are paid by overseas group
members when they relate to property in the UK. The draft legislation
provided that only rental income from UK property that was paid up as a
dividend by a foreign subsidiary directly to a UK parent company would
qualify for tax exemption. The amendment would correct that to provide
that dividends relating to rental income on UK property would be
tax-exempt where they are paid through an intermediate foreign
subsidiary too.</div> <a name="06060872000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final amendments to schedule 17, amendments Nos. 157, 158 and 159,
consist of minor changes in respect of drafting issues. They would
bring the terminology in line with that used elsewhere in the
legislation and would clarify which financial statement is to be used
in calculating financing costs in relation to the interest rate cover
test. They are all minor corrections, and I trust they will not be
controversial. On that basis, I commend all the amendments to the
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000714"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> In principle, the schedule makes necessary
modifications to the REIT regime as it applies to groups of companies.
In practice, many of the largest REITs businesses will be groups of
companies. Many of the paragraphs of the schedule involve complex
interactions with other parts of the tax code as a result. As a
Committee, we just made a number of drafting amendments at the behest
of the Government that tidy up the legislation rather than
fundamentally alter it. As I said, given that, I would like to make two
further points on the schedule and the attendant regulations before we
agree to it.</div> <a name="06060872000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
profit to finance cost ratio of 1:1.25, because of the complexities of
a group structure this will inevitably apply slightly differently. The
draft regulations, specifically the Real Estate Investment Trusts
(Breach of Profit: Financing-Cost Ratio) Regulations 2006, appear to
apply the same fairly simple provisions to a group as to a single
company in this regard. However, in view of the inherent complexity of
group structures, can the Minister assure the Committee that the
simplicity of the 1:1.25 test for individual companies will, in
practice, as far as possible, still be extended to group REITs,
particularly because the formula has to be adjusted for intra-group
transactions between component companies? We would like reassurance
from the Government on that point.</div>
<a name="06060872000430"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000715"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Is not the 1.25 for group REITS contained and
clarified in the regulations to which the hon. Gentleman referred,
under regulation
3?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column535" />Column number: 536</div><a name="06060872000518"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="06060872000431"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000716"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right, in that it is in
the regulation. What I want from the Minister is an in-principle
assurance that will stand in <i class="I">Hansard</i> that the Government want it
to operate the same for groups as for individual companies because of
intra-group transfers. I do not want to redesign the universe; I just
want the Minister to say in principle yes, and we will be happy. I am
glad to know that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob
Marris) has read the regulations. I would have expected nothing
less.</div> <a name="06060872000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
schedule introduces a requirement to create separate accounts for tax
purposes for group REITs as opposed to relying on normal commercial
accounts from which tax is computed, as would be the normal practice
for almost any other company. The detail of this requirement is set out
in the draft Real Estate Investment Trusts (Financial Statements of
Group Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations 2006, which I know we
all enjoyed reading last
weekend.</div><a name="06060872000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
having defined the requirements, has the Treasury carried out a
regulatory impact assessment of the additional cost of providing those
accounts? I know that it carried out an RIA to go with the earlier
consultation, but has it carried out a specific RIA relating to this
particular requirement? We should bear in mind that additional audit
requirements are likely to follow because for the purposes of REITs the
Government require group REIT companies to provide very specialised
accounts, which most other companies and lines of business would not
have to prepare.</div>
<a name="06060872000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having imposed an additional
burden on group REITs, bearing in mind that all the accounts will have
to be audited, not least if they are companies listed on the stock
exchange, can the Economic Secretary reassure the Committee that the
Government have considered in detail what the additional burden will
be?</div><a name="06060872000435"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000717"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I am glad that the hon. Member for Rayleigh has
perused the regulations with such diligence; I do not know whether Mrs.
Gauke was involved. I can provide some reassurance on both points.
First, he is absolutely right that the ratio is slightly
different&#151;</div><a name="06060872000436"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000718"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I have taken advice on the latter point and I am
assured that she was not.</div>
<a name="06060872000437"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000719"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> This is a momentous
moment.</div>
<a name="06060872000438"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000720"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> As moments often
are.</div><a name="06060872000439"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000721"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> It is the first time in this Finance Bill that Mrs.
Gauke has not had a view. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Or she has not
expressed it. I hope that it was not due to the lack of diligence of
the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire in seeking her
views.</div> <a name="06060872000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rayleigh raised two points. First, he is absolutely right
that in the case of groups the interest rate cover test is different
from that of a single company regime, in order to deal with a variety
of ways in which a group can finance its activities. But 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column536" />Column number: 537</div>the intention is to achieve exactly the same effect for groups as for
single companies. Therefore, the answer to his question&#151;are we
trying to achieve the same intention and do we want to achieve the same
degree of simplicity?&#151;is yes. I can say that for the record, so
that we can be held to account on that
issue.</div><a name="06060872000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
hon. Gentleman asked whether there was a separate RIA for group REITs
compared with individual REITs. Our approach was deliberately to raise
the issue in consultation with the industry to see whether anything
needed to be considered over and above the RIA for single companies. I
assure him that the issue was raised and discussed with the industry.
In consulting on these clauses it was part of our thinking to ensure
that there is not an excessive regulatory
burden.</div><a name="06060872000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
reassurance, I hope that the Committee will agree to the
proposal.</div><a name="06060872000443"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000722"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
assurance on the first point. On the second point, I hope that he
realised that it was a legitimate question, because we are talking
about preparing specific additional accounts for these companies.
Nevertheless, I am grateful for his assurance on that matter, too. We
are content to agree to the
schedule.</div><a name="06060872000444"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000723"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> The Opposition had tabled an amendment to delete
clause 143 from the Bill, for reasons that I will come on to. The
Government then tabled a similar amendment at almost exactly the same
time&#151;so similar, I understand, that our names were then
effectively added to the Government amendment, which is unusual, but
essentially, we had exactly the same idea, I suspect for similar
reasons. However, I see from the selection list that the amendment has
not been selected, so I seek your guidance, Mr. Benton. It is my
understanding that we want the clause to be deleted from the Bill and
that the Government also want it to be deleted, not least because they
were kind enough to write to us in late May and tell us that that was
their intention. I would be happy to move deletion, unless the Minister
wants to, bearing in mind that we ended up signing his amendment. As a
courtesy, I shall allow him to move deletion if he
wants.</div>
<a name="06060872000449"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000724"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It seems straightforward that if the hon. Member
for Rayleigh and his party are unhappy with the clause, the effective
thing to do would be to vote against it when I put the
question.</div>
<a name="06060872000450"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000725"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I am grateful for that guidance,Mr.
Benton. We would have voted against the clause in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column537" />Column number: 538</div>any event; it was just that I understood that the Government also wanted
to get rid of it, but the Minister did not
stand.</div>
<a name="06060872000451"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000726"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I am grateful, Mr. Benton, for your guidance and to
the hon. Member for Rayleigh for intervening in the way that he did.
There was a danger of the rather soporific flow of the clauses leading
us down erroneous paths. I confirm that it is our intention to withdraw
the clause from the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000727"></a>Sir
George Young:</b> This will be a brief intervention, as I am
sure that the Committee wants to make progress. The clause repeals
housing investment trust legislation, so perhaps the best thing to do
would be to have a moment&#146;s silence while that stillborn infant
is laid to rest.</div> <a name="06060872000455"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause repeals some provisions of the Finance Act 1996, when HITs were
put on the statute book, which raises the question: what were the
Government doing between 1997 and 2003, when they started the Barker
exercise? Given that they wanted the private sector to invest in
housing and given that HITs were not taking off, what activity was
going on? Why has it taken them nearly 10 years to come up with
legislation that they think will be more effective than were
HITs?</div>
<a name="06060872000456"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000728"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> We discussed this issue this morning. As the right
hon. Member for North-West Hampshire made clear, the vehicle&#151;the
housing investment trust&#151;was introduced by his Government in the
Finance Act 1996. Consultation with the industry has confirmed that no
company sought to obtain the exemptions that were provided for in the
1996 Act. I explained this morning that the reason for that was that
the regime was insufficiently flexible, too heavy-handed and too rigid.
The honest answer to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is that
we gave the legislation substantial time in which to succeed but it did
not do so and, because it failed for a number of years, we have come up
with an alternative regime that we intend to succeed. The one thing we
cannot be accused of doing is not giving the legislation a chance. As
might have been said in &#147;Monty Python&#148;, it turned out

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000729"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> We come to the end of our odyssey on REITs,
because this is the last clause of part 4 of the Bill. It deals with
commencement. It says, in essence, that the REIT regime will come into
force on 1 January 2007. If you will indulge me, Mr. Benton, I have a
few remarks to make at the end of the debate on this part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06060872000462"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the record,
we have gone beyond the scheduled time this afternoon and finished
later than we would have done. That is a tribute to the determination
of Members from all parts of the Committee to make sure that the REIT
regime is scrutinised in detail. I hope that we have done good
service.</div><a name="06060872000463"></a><div class="hs_Para">We touched on
a number of important issues. The issue of listing on AIM cropped up
again in a number of guises, this time in the context of the balance
between commercial and residential property in the REIT regime.
Considerable concern was expressed throughout the Committee about the
residential element of the REIT regime. We are grateful for the
Minister&#146;s commitment that the issue would be reviewed both in
the run-up to commencement under clause 146 and afterwards. We will see
how that pans out in practice. There are genuine problems that need to
be addressed. We hope to return to the issue of AIM-listing on
Report.</div><a name="06060872000464"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under clauses
116 and 130, we amended the clause 106 conditions and turned two of
them from red cards to yellow cards. For reasons I will not repeat,
that was right. Under clause 125 we kept the Government Whip on his
toes and made sure that we pressed the Government on an important
matter on which, I hope, they will still listen. On clause 143, with a
bit of cross-partisan co-operation we managed to delete an unnecessary
clause from the
Bill.</div><a name="06060872000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one last
remark. As a personal valedictory, I pay tribute to my old college
friend Mr. Michael Halcrow, who was the tax manager at Hammerson plc a
few years ago. Like others, such as the British Property Federation, he
provided me with a great deal of detailed briefing and advice. These
are complicated matters and it is thanks largely to him that I have, I
hope, managed to navigate them. I place that on the record.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column539" />Column number: 540</div><a name="06060872000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">We look forward to seeing how
the regime operates in
practice.</div><a name="06060872000519"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
<a name="06060872000467"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060872000730"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I shall be brief so that we can move on. As the
hon. Gentleman said, our aims were debated at length and I set out our
position clearly. I also said that it was our intention to ensure that
residential as well as commercial property was central to the REITs
regime. I did not say that there would be a review; a review can often
mean an e-mail address, a consultation document, a team and an office.
I said that I would keep the matter closely under review, and that is
what I shall do. Just to be clear about it, in discussions today with
the hon. Member for Rayleigh and the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire, I made clear our determination to ensure that the regime
works as we all agree it must.</div>
<a name="06060872000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">I end by saying that our
debates on these clauses have been constructive. First, there were few
difficult or contentious issues, which is substantially the result of
the excellent consultation conducted by HMRC and the industry; a number
of issues had already been dealt with, and the Government were
therefore able to respond to concerns before they came before the
Committee. Secondly, whether or not it was the result of using outside
experts, the Opposition&#146;s amendments did not need to be
withdrawn simply because they had no substantive basis; they often
pointed to issues that the Government had already been able to address
or that we shall address in guidance. I urge the Committee to let the
clause stand part of the Bill, so that we can look forward to having a
well-functioning UK REITs regime.</div>
