<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome all members of the 
Committee to the first sitting of the Standing Committee 
on the Greater London Authority Bill. I anticipate a 
stimulating, interesting and constructive debate. Tedious 
repetition and discussion of matters that are not relevant 
to the Bill will not be tolerated. I am sure that the 
Committee's proceedings will be very agreeable, and I 
hope that all hon. Members enjoy the forthcoming 
debates.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Greater London Authority Bill, 
the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and 
half-past Four o'clock, and on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It gives me great pleasure to move the sittings motion 
for the Standing Committee on the Greater London 
Authority Bill. I am pleased that we are meeting under 
your chairmanship, Mr. Winterton. I believe that you were 
first appointed to the Chairmen's Panel 13 years ago. 
Since then, you have ably chaired many Committees. My 
first experience of your chairmanship was in 1993, when 
I sat on the Committee that considered the Leasehold 
Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill. That was 
an enjoyable experience. It was a long Bill, and I recall 
all sorts of highlights from the Committee's debates. 
Because you kept the Committee so effectively in order, 
Mr. Winterton, little tedious repetition occurred, and your 
watchful eye ensured that there was little irrelevant 
debate. However, I remember a moment of pure joy when, 
in the midst of discussing extremely complex 
technicalities, we discovered that something that the 
Committee had been discussing for more than half an hour 
did not exist. That is one of the joys of Committees, and 
I hope that hon. Members will have pleasant experiences 
during the Bill's passage.
<P>
You will be ably assisted, Mr. Winterton, by Mr. O'Hara, 
Mr. Benton and Mr. Stevenson. The fact that you require 
three assistants is an indication of the size and complexity 
of the Bill. I am sure that you will all keep a watchful eye 
on us.
<P>
Many members of the Committee who are here today 
spoke on Second Reading and during the first two 
Committee sittings on the Floor of the House. I am 
delighted to see extensive representation of hon. Members 
who have a real interest in the Bill and want to see it 
proceeding constructively onto the statute book so that 
London can, once again, have an elected city-wide 
authority. On Second Reading and on the first two 
Committee days, I was struck by the thoughtful and 
constructive nature of many of the contributions made by 
hon. Members in all parts of the House. I hope that that 
good-spirited approach of constructive scrutiny continues 
throughout the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
The sittings motion sets the times and days for the 
Committee's discussion of the Bill. It is proposed that 
we should meet on Tuesdays at 10.30 am and 4.30 pm 
and on Thursdays at 2.30 pm. The programme motion 
that was passed by the House on 13 January provided 
for the Committee's proceedings to conclude at
12.50 pm on 30 March. I hope that hon. Members will 
find that those arrangements are satisfactory and that 
they contribute to orderly, successful and detailed 
scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottway </B>(Croydon, South): I should like 
to associate myself with the Minister's remarks. I am sure 
that the Committee will be invigorating, and will no less 
reflect your personality, Mr. Winterton, than the 
Committee to which the Minister referred.
<P>
The Opposition do not intend to engage in tedious 
repetition. We may find parts of the Bill tediously 
repetitive, but we do not wish to approach it in that way. 
The Minister spoke of the important and useful 
contributions that were made on the Floor of the House. 
The Opposition also appreciated his constructive approach 
to some of our points.
<P>
The sittings motion sets a fast pace. Anybody with an 
O-level in mathematics will work out that the Committee 
has to deal on average with 10 clauses a sitting. That is 
more than in some Committees, so the pace will have to 
be kept up.
<P>
Rumours suggest that the House may not sit for a week 
in February. The Business Sub-Committee may have to 
reconvene to reflect on that possibility, although I gather 
that it is far from a foregone conclusion. Otherwise, the 
Opposition support the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood):</B> I, too, 
associate myself with the warm comments made on both 
sides of the Room about your chairmanship, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
I should like, however, to add a few words of warning. 
It is not our traditional practice to timetable legislation 
from the outset as has been done in the sittings motion. 
The Bill is immensely complex and is of the greatest 
significance to our constituents and to Londoners in 
general. I am prepared to take as long as is necessary 
to ensure that the Bill emerges from the Committee in a 
thoroughly analysed and perfected form. That is our job 
to improve legislation. If we take it at a rush and at a 
pre-ordained pace that may not accord with the 
seriousness of the issues that arise, we could be doing a 
disservice to our constituents and to London as a whole.
<P>
I do not know the precedents, and I have not cited them. 
I doubt, however, whether many Bills that have come 
before a Standing Committee are as long and as complex 
as this one, or have so many ramifications for local 
government and for the conduct of important matters 
relating to London, such as transport, the environment and 
many others. Of course, I want orderly and constructive 
progress, but I doubt whether our consideration can, as the 
Minister hopes, occur in the full detail that the Bill merits.
<P>
I hate to go back over past days, but the Committee 
should understand that sittings motions can be very 
significant. In 1984, the Civil Aviation Bill would have 
artificially limited the number of air transport 
movements into Heathrow to 275,000 a year. The 
Government of the day had a vast majority. It was not 
as big as that of the present Government, but it was 
sufficient to ensure the usual rapid and constructive 
conduct of business. The Committee denied the Bill a 
sittings motion, even though it had been agreed to with 
a huge majority on Second Reading. The Bill was killed 
thereby. Sittings motions are not mere formalities, and 
they can have more importance than is immediately 
apparent.
<P>
The sittings motion has much to do with reform of the 
upper House and with the vast amount of legislation that 
the Government are bringing forward in this Session, 
which they started unnecessarily late. That is why we have 
the motion that we do. Prima facie, because the issues are 
so complex and would usually require so much time, the 
other place will need an immense amount of time to make 
good deficiencies in the scrutiny that we shall give the 
Bill under the timetable that has been set before us.
<P>
To be candid, I will do my best, but I doubt whether, 
given the rigid timetable, that will be as good as 
Londoners deserve. The Bill is thoroughly complex and 
deserves the maximum time devoted to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes (Southwark, North and Bermondsey):</B> I also welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Winterton. I have sat under your chairmanship before and I know that you are a no-nonsense Chairman, which is what we need with a Bill of this 
size.
<P>
As regards the Committee, timetabling and sittings 
motions, I am a progressive or a moderniser, rather than a 
conservative. It is better to conduct business in an orderly 
manner and to tackle everything that we need to. In that 
way, we will not, as in the past, spend ages on the first 
half of the Bill but no time on the second half. I therefore 
welcome the constructive approach that has been 
expressed by the Minister, his Whip, my Conservative 
colleague who leads for his party, and his Whip. As a 
result, we have been able to agree, under your 
chairmanship, on the remit of the Committee's sittings 
we will come in a minute to the timetable which is a 
welcome bit of progress.
<P>
I want to make two other observations. We have 
decided not to take up the new opportunity that is 
available to us to sit at 9 am on Thursdays. In case there 
is any doubt about the matter, that was for the 
convenience of staff, not of hon. Members, all of whom 
were keen to be here at 9 am every Thursday. We 
understood, however, that staff would want a bit of time 
on Thursday to prepare for the later debates. Out of 
thoughtfulness, we therefore gave staff the benefit of a 
little leeway. I am sure that they will be grateful to us for 
at least the next two and a half months.

<P>
Some of us have sort of been here before. I have not 
quite finished the maths, but I think that very few 
members of the Committee were in the House, let alone 
on the relevant Committee, when the Greater London 
council was abolished. I was. It was an unpleasant, 
undesirable and lengthy process. I opposed the legislation 
as hard as I could. We sat through the night and into the 
early hours of the morning.
<P>
Once, during the paving Bill, a sitting started in 
Committee on the Floor of the House at 3.30 pm on a 
weekday, and we sat without interruption until 10.30 pm 
the following evening. Some of us were flagging a little 
by 8 am. I went to have a shower downstairs. A member 
of the then Tory Government in the next shower was 
bemoaning the fact that the Liberals were keeping him up 
all night because of their opposition to the Bill. The news 
bulletins that were being broadcast over the radio in the 
old member's shower room downstairs said that the 
Liberals were keeping people up all night. The person in 
the next shower made a very rude comment about Liberals 
to the effect that they were all over the place and that he 
could not even go to the shower without broadcasts telling 
him about them. What he did not realise was that there 
was even a Liberal in the shower next to him who had 
overheard his rude comments. So, we put up a fight then, 
but it was not very satisfactory as a timetabling procedure. 
Although there needed to be opposition and there was 
fearful opposition it was not very humane as far as staff 
and Members of Parliament were concerned. We have 
progressed since then.
<P>
I share a treble joy with my colleagues. First, compared 
with those old days, there are now hordes of Liberal 
Members who could sit on this Committee. In those days, 
there was a limited choice of London Members on the 
Liberal Benches. Secondly, we have a much more orderly 
mechanism for debating the Bill. Thirdly, we are putting 
right some of the things that that earlier Committee did 
wrong, and Liberal Members rejoice that we are going to 
get on with that now.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): I am fairly 
certain that I join other hon. Members in welcoming you to 
the Chair, Mr. Winterton, but perhaps you should ask me 
again after a few sittings to see whether we can confirm 
that. Certainly, you have already by your reputation, 
imposed yourself on the Committee, Mr. Winterton and I 
suppose that that is a good sign.
<P>
That is the good news. The bad news is that I do not 
share the welcome that has so far been given to the 
sittings motion. I fear that it is the beginning of something 
rather sinister, flowing from the so-called modernisation 
of the House. If this is one of the first tests of that 
modernisation, it bodes ill for the willingness and ability 
of the House properly to scrutinise the Government.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I am shocked and surprised at the result of this very 
early test of the House's response to the modernisation 
proposals. I recall my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow 
(Mr. Gill) asking the Leader of the House the following 
question:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The right hon. Lady has been at pains to explain that the number 
of hours that the House works will not be reduced. Will she tell 
us, frankly, whether she is satisfied that the opportunities for Back 
Benchers to hold the Executive to account will not be reduced as a 
result of the proposals?"	 [Official Report, 16 December 1998;
Vol. 322, c. 989.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Leader of the House said in reply, "Absolutely and 
categorically."	 It could not be more simple or 
straightforward.
<BR>



<P>
You will recall, Mr. Winterton, as will others here 
present, that in the good old days, when the former 
Conservative Government were held to account by the 
Opposition, Committees would commence at 10.30 am 
and sit until 1 pm. They would recommence at 4.30 pm, 
sit until 7 pm and, after a brief break in the evening, 
would continue until at least 10 pm. Misty-eyed nostalgia 
has already been evinced by the hon. Member for 
Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), who 
recalled that sort of thing. Indeed, his escapades in the 
shower have already been confessed to the Committee.
<P>
I had some part to play in Committee proceedings from 
the Government Benches and that was the way things 
were giving the Government a tough time was the 
Opposition's job. Now we are told, if I have read the 
sittings motion correctly, that the Committee will not avail 
itself of the opportunity on which great emphasis was 
laid in the modernisation debate in order to allay fears 
that there would be a reduction in the hours of Committee 
sittings to commence sitting at 9 am on Thursdays. The 
hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said 
that that is all to do with staff. Well, that may or may not 
be so. I am, on this occasion, much more interested in 
Members and what they do properly to hold the Executive 
to account and, at the first test, Members have failed. 
We have copped out and said that we will not avail 
ourselves of the opportunity to meet at 9 am on 
Thursdays, but that we will meet at 2.30 pm on 
Thursdays.
<P>
It gets worse, because the sittings motion says and I 
stand to be corrected on this; indeed, I hope I will be 
that the time for conclusion of proceedings is 6.50 pm. 
That seems to be saying that not only will we finish at 
6.50 pm or 7 pm on Thursdays, but on Tuesdays as well. 
So the Tuesday sittings have been reduced in length and, 
potentially, in effectiveness. We are all off the hook. The 
Government are off the hook because Ministers will not 
have to sit in Committee for very long, and the rest of us 
are off the hook as well because we can skip away from 
the Committee sitting at 7 pm on Tuesdays. It looks as if 
I am going to be corrected, and perhaps the sooner the 
better, before I get too much further in this diatribe. Are 
there any volunteers?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am happy to help the hon. 
Gentleman who is making, as is his custom, a forthright 
speech. It is my understanding, from the Business 
Sub-Committee that I chaired some days ago, when the 
Opposition parties and the Government agreed the 
timetable for the Bill, that it is hoped that the Committee 
could complete its deliberations each Tuesday by 7 pm. 
However, that does not prevent it from sitting thereafter 
if it is necessary so to do in order to complete the various 
parts of the Bill that are supposed to be completed within 
a certain period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful for that, Mr. Winterton. 
However, you have only half reassured me. A nod is often 
as good as a wink in this place, especially when deals are 
done in a cosy fashion between those on the Front 
Benches and business managers. I can see how convenient 
it will be for the Government who, as can readily be 
seen from the arrangement of Members, dominate the 
Committee to draw the Committee's proceedings to a 
conclusion every Tuesday at 7 pm. After all, the 
Government will judge such matters, as they have such a 
huge majority in the Committee as elsewhere. I am only 
half surprised that the hon. Member for Southwark, North 
and Bermondsey should have so happily complied, as he 
and his colleagues are already half in bed with the 
Government anyway. I have no complaints about that, nor 
does it surprise me.
<P>
We were reassured by the President of the Council and 
Leader of the House categorically and absolutely that 
there would be no reduction in Members' opportunity to 
scrutinise the Executive especially in Standing 
Committees, where scrutiny of legislation is supposed to 
take place. However, at our very first test, we in this 
Room have all failed miserably. We now say that we shall 
meet only from 2.30 pm until 7 pm on Thursdays, and not 
at 9 am, and that, if we proceed with our business quickly 
and not hold matters up too much, we all hope and 
expect of course we would to finish at the convenient 
hour of 7 pm on Thursdays, rather than continue 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I could help the 
Committee and the hon. Gentleman [{**epHon. Members: 
"Right hon. Gentleman."	] Thank you, the right hon. 
Gentleman; I give him his correct title, well earned. The 
references to 6.50 pm and 12.50 pm mean that at the 
eighth sitting, the Committee would adjourn at 6.50 pm; 
at the 17th sitting at 6.50 pm; and at the 27th sitting at 
12.50 pm. That is intended to give the Committee 
constructive guidance. On other Tuesdays, there is no 
reason why, if the need arises, the Committee cannot, at 
the discretion of the Chairman, adjourn for a break in the 
evening so that Members can attend to other matters and 
have something to eat, and reassemble after a specific 
period say, an hour and a half for a civilised dinner. 
The right hon. Gentleman is therefore incorrect to say that 
the time for debate will have a tight limit. Ultimately, I 
am, as Chairman, in the hands of the Committee, but there 
could be some relatively late sittings on Tuesday 
evenings. I hope that that helps the Committee and the 
right hon. Gentleman.



<p5**}Mr. Forth: I am now seven eights reassured, because  we are edging our way towards the possibility of greater  and more effective scrutiny, albeit within the constraints  of the programme motion previously agreed, which is  useful. However I shall conclude my remarks, because  the point has more or less been made we are left with  the unsatisfactory nature of Thursday sittings and with the  fact that the Committee has breached the undertaking  given by the Leader of the House that there will be no  diminution in the effectiveness of or time available to  Back Benchers. I very much regret that on such an early  occasion, so soon after the debate in which my hon.  Friend the Member for Ludlow quizzed the Leader of the  House the Committee has decided that it will take a  leisurely approach to scrutiny of the Executive. <P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Simon Hughes: Just so that the right hon. 
Gentleman knows our position, I took the view that if we 
needed extra time and, as you, Mr. Winterton, said that 
we could sit on Tuesdays into the night, that was a far 
better option than sitting either early on Thursday 
mornings for a limited time an hour and half or two 
hours only or late into Thursday and Friday, as some 
Committee members' homes are not just down the road. 
Just as many hours are available, but at a more logical 
time of the week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Again, I find that reassuring., We shall see 
how many hours the hon. Gentleman spends in 
Committee, and how far the words that he has just uttered 
have any meaning or substance. That will be much tested 
over the next few weeks.


<P>
There is no point in trying to push the matter to a vote, 
because not only are the Government in control but a deal 
has been done with my hon. Friends on the Front Bench 
another nod and a wink that even I, with my alleged 
insensitivity, have noticed. I will leave the matter there, 
but I wanted to put on record my great unease about the 
way in which things are developing and the extent to 
which, under the guise of so-called modernisation, the 
opportunities available to Back Benchers to do the job 
that they are supposed to do are being limited. It is bad 
enough having a Government with such a huge majority; 
what is making it worse is the advantage that is being 
taken of that majority to reduce the effectiveness of the 
House. I fear that the sittings motion is a graphic 
illustration of that process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cities of London and Westminster):</B> My hon. Friend the Member for 
Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) entered the House 
long before I, but he suffered a reversal in a far distant 
city before representing part of the greatest city in the 
world. Of the ordinary serving members of the Committee 
I therefore have the longest continuous service. As 
Chairman, Mr. Winterton, I exclude you, although you are 
far senior to me and because of that I shall treat you in 
Committee with even greater veneration than I do in the 
normal course of events.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> That does not say very much.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I hesitate to remind you, Mr. Winterton, 
of two occasions, with a 10-year gap, when you were kind 
enough to say nice things about me, but I want to 
reciprocate. I cannot immediately recall whether I have 
sat under your chairmanship, but if I have I am confident 
that it was a pleasurable experience and one to which I 
look forward again.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for 
Ruislip-Northwood and my right hon. Friend the Member 
for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), I am concerned 
about the pace at which the Committee will move. I 
served on the Committee stage of what became the Local 
Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, when the then 
Government had been in office for as long as the present 
Government. It was a major Bill which dealt, albeit on a 
broader canvas, with the same subjects that we are dealing 
with, and which was likely to have long-term 
implications.
<P>
The Government side was led by my right hon. 
Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King). One of 
the disadvantages with which he had to contend was 
the fact that I was the Whip. The Opposition were 
led by the then shadow Secretary of State, now Lord 
Hattersley that showed how seriously the Opposition 
took the measure. There was no timetable, no guillotine 
and we sat in Committee for 125 hours. By my 
calculation, unless we sit into the evenings, we shall sit 
for about two thirds of that time. The 1980 legislation 
had 149 clauses and 26 schedules more schedules than 
the present Bill, which has 21, but even the Government 
would not argue that 128 extra clauses are the 
equivalent of five extra schedules. Although that Bill 
was much shorter, we gave it 50 per cent. more 
scrutiny, without a timetable imposed by the 
Government.
<P>
I therefore have apprehensions about the amount of 
scrutiny that the Bill will receive and the consequences 
for London. Those apprehensions are heightened by the 
information from the Minister for London and 
Construction that he had previously sat on a Bill which 
discussed a non-existent issue for 30 minutes. If we are 
to go down such cul-de-sacs, the limited period available 
to us of just over 80 hours will be further reduced.
<P>
When I was a Minister in the Treasury, we took the 
view that that which could not be measured did not exist. 
That view had been put to the test some years previously 
by the Foreign Office when there was concern in the 
Brussels embassy about whether Ernest Bevin, the 
Foreign Secretary at the time, would be able to get 
through the door between the main spare bedroom and 
the main spare bathroom. The embassy sent a telegram to 
London saying, "Please verify diameter of Secretary of 
State."	 A telegram came back from the Foreign Office, 
demonstrating what those of us who know and love it had 
always suspected, namely that its staff are more literate 
then numerate "Unable verify diameter but 
circumference 60 inches."	 The fact that the debate on the 
non-issue in question lasted 30 minutes suggests that a 
measurement could be made. That is, however, still not a 
cul-de-sac down which we would want to go.
<BR>



<P>
Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and 
Chislehurst, I ask myself why there is a hurry and why 
we are subjected to the present timetable. Myself replies 
that in 1980 the then Government could look forward to 
18 years in government. They would have plenty of 
time four Parliaments in which to carry out the 
programme on which they had been elected. The present 
Government know, however, that they are on the short 
commons of a single Parliament. Opposition Members 
must, therefore, like slaves in one of Barbarossa's galleys, 
reply to a Stakhanovite rhythm that the Government's 
business managers set. Like my hon. Friend the Member 
for Ruislip-Northwood, I fear that London and Londoners 
will be the losers as a result of scrutiny that is much more 
skimpy than what was then the Local Government, 
Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill received.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and 
Bermondsey and I are the only inner London Opposition 
Members and will, therefore, have to work in an even 
more Stakhanovite way than the rest of the Committee. 
Consequently, our apprehensions for inner London will 
be greater.
<P>
Although we have treated the matter lightly, the 
Government are under some obligation to explain, in the 
spirit of the times, why the amount of time that is made 
available for the scrutiny of major Bills is being so 
drastically reduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had an interesting debate, 
which has been marked by a clear distinction between the 
views of the three Front Benchers and those of the three 
Conservative Back Benchers who have expressed concern 
about the timetable.
<P>
The Government have sought to adopt a timetable that 
allows a full opportunity for constructive discussion and 
proper scrutiny. Many of use have served on Committees 
for long hours, including through the night, and we know 
only too well that lengthy sittings do not necessarily 
equate with effective scrutiny. Quality and quantity can 
be very different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> On that point, the Minister must recall as 
will some, although not many of his hon. Friends that it 
was the Opposition's tradition in the past two, three or 
four Parliaments to spend a day on the sittings motion, 
frittering away time at the start of the Bill and making 
frivolous speeches. Surely, it was the Opposition's 
responsibility then, as it is now to make sure that the 
time was best used. I would be happy to take that 
responsibility. What I object to is the Government putting 
constraints on any flexibility that the Opposition might 
have had in previous Parliaments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have to tell the right hon. Gentleman 
that the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottoway), 
who leads for the Conservative party, has discussed the 
matter fully with us and has reached a view on what is a 
sensible timetable that would allow proper and full 
discussion. I totally respect the Opposition's right to agree 
a timetable and a procedure.
<BR>



<P>
As I have already made clear, we are allowing and 
envisage 27 sittings under the sittings motion. That is a 
considerable number. As you said, Mr. Winterton, it is 
right and appropriate for the Committee to have the 
flexibility to sit late during its deliberations if that proves 
necessary. I return to my earlier point, however, that late 
sittings, lengthy interventions and lengthy contributions 
do not necessarily mean detailed and intelligent scrutiny. 
We have all heard people speaking at length without 
contributing enormously to the sum of human wisdom, 
enlightenment or even pleasure.
<P>
The sittings motion strikes the right balance. It allows 
an orderly procedure and ensures a framework in which 
the Committee will be able to scrutinise every aspect of 
the Bill rather than simply get caught in some of the 
sterile trench warfare of the past. In such circumstances, 
sometimes only two or three clauses are subject to proper 
scrutiny and the whole mass of subsequent clauses are 
glossed over because the Committee has obsessively 
focused on a few initial ones. That is not our intention. 
We want all aspects of the Bill to be considered. It is 
complex and detailed, and has wide ramifications. We 
will continue to try to maintain a constructive relationship 
with both Opposition parties to ensure effective scrutiny 
within an orderly timetable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I referred to the Local Government, 
Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill, which was not 
guillotined. The Government allowed it to run its course, 
so that the Opposition could say everything that they 
wanted to say, and the Committee stage ran for 125 hours. 
May I infer that some of the Minister's remarks would 
not have applied to that Bill or to the way in which his 
noble Friend, Lord Hattersley, conducted it? If we need to 
sit for 125 hours, will the Government raise any problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I assure the right hon. Gentleman that 
if he wishes to behave like a slave in Barbarossa's galley 
to keep the Committee sitting through the night, it will be 
his choice, subject to you, Mr. Winterton, deciding that 
contributions are not unnecessarily repetitive or tedious. I 
am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would never make 
such contributions.
<P>
The Government do not wish to curtail reasonable and 
proper scrutiny. We do intend, however, to ensure orderly 
progress through a complex Bill and to allow proper 
consideration of all its aspects. I hope that that can be 
done in a sensible, mature and constructive spirit, without 
resort to some of the less constructive aspects of 
opposition that have sometimes characterised proceedings 
in the past. I shall not comment on the Local Government, 
Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill, as I was not in the House 
during its passage. I hope, however, that consideration of 
this Bill will be marked by thoughtful and constructive 
contributions from all hon. Members, and by proper 
scrutiny of detail. That should occur within a sensible 
time frame that allows hon. Members to do their work in 
the Committee while doing the other work in the House 
for which all of us are responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister implied the presence of 
a rift between Opposition Front and Back Benchers in 
respect of the sittings motion. I should like to make it 
clear that I have much sympathy with the points that 
have been made. The motion sets down a framework 
in the face of a resolution of the House of a programme 
motion that specifies a finishing date of 30 March. The 
Minister may recall an earlier suggestion that we finish 
before 30 March. That proposal was resisted because 
of Opposition pressure.
<P>
I have agreed with the Minister on two milestones 
between now and 30 March for the orderly consideration 
of the Bill. There is no question of Opposition Front 
Benchers dissociating themselves from the views of 
Back Benchers.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

The Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that there are 
financial resolutions in connection with the Bill. Copies 
are available in the Room. I also remind the Committee 
that amendments should be submitted in good time so that 
they can be considered for selection properly and 
appropriately. As a general rule, my co-Chairmen and I 
do not propose to select starred amendments, including 
any that may be reached at an afternoon sitting of the 
Committee. I hope that all hon. Members have taken note 
of that.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Resignation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 134, in 
page 4, line 30, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3) Any London member elected as a member of a registered 
political party who resigns his party whip shall be deemed to have 
created a vacancy"	.</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is as important as any that will be 
discussed during the Committee's proceedings. As 
members of the Committee are aware, the assembly will 
be elected by a form of the additional member system, 
whereby 14 members will be elected on a constituency 
basis and 11 members will be elected from top-up list. 
Candidates who properly submit their names for a list, 
which can be as short as a list of one, can be elected to 
the assembly. Those members will owe their allegiance 
to the political party under whose colours they stood for 
election. The list will be a closed list. People will tick a 
box for, for example, the Conservative party, the Liberal 
Democrats, the Labour party, the Green party or the 
British National party. Some candidates will owe their 
election to the new assembly entirely to their party 
membership. During their four-year term of office, some 
members may reach a point at which they choose to 
dissociate themselves from their party. That has happened 
throughout the history of democratic politics and will 
continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My hon. Friend is making an 
important point. is not his amendments particularly crucial 
in terms of the regime that purports to run new Labour? 
As I understand it, the rules of the Labour party now 
stipulate that the whip can be taken away from individuals 
who do not toe the party line. That constitutional change, 
which has been imposed on the Labour movement, means 
that the electorate can be even less certain that the person 
on a list whom they elect will stay as an official member 
of the Labour party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My hon. Friend makes a strong point. 
He may like to consider some of the later amendments 
relating to that issue, especially amendment No. 143 to 
clause 19.
<P>
Members of the assembly will owe their allegiance to 
the political party under whose colours they have flown. 
If they later dissociate themselves from that party they 
may refuse to take the whip or be sacked from the party 
what then is their position?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Mike Gapes (Ilford, South): I am intrigued by that 
line of argument. In all political parties, including the 
Conservative party that was elected to the House of 
Commons in 1992, Members of Parliament have had the 
Whip taken away from them or have resigned the Whip. 
What is so different about what he suggests?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I suggest that the hon. Gentleman 
concentrates and looks properly at the amendment. The 
essential difference is that those hon. Members were 
elected in their own name rather than that of their party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that 
when he stood for election in Croydon he stood as a 
Conservative candidate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I stood as a Conservative candidate, but 
my name was on the ballot paper. We are now entering 
the territory of how much weight a personal vote carries. 
In some cases, that is a negative factor. I can think of 
several people who may lose votes as a result of standing 
under their own name, and some who would do a lot 
better if they flew under party colours alone. Hon. 
Members who make an effort in their constituencies and 
engage in constructive dialogue with their constituents 
gain a personal following.
<BR>



<P>
My feeling is that with a personal following, the 
number of votes can fluctuate between 500 and 5,000. But 
there is nothing in the amendment on that point. No names 
are bandied around and there is no personal vote 
members are elected on the strength of their allegiance to 
their party. If they cross the floor, they have lost their 
mandate; it is as plain and straightforward as that. There 
is no justification for their presence on the assembly, they 
have no personal vote, and the party that supported them 
can no longer rely on their support.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
This is a modest proposal, but one with deep 
implications. If the situation should arise, under the 
amendment such a person would be deemed to have 
resigned and created a vacancy. He could of course stand 
for re-election, but the rules for a vacancy would then 
come into play. Under the Bill as drafted, the next person 
on the list will become the party's representative. The 
person on the list who just failed to get elected will take 
the place of the one who has given up his party 
membership. I do not think that that is an undemocratic 
principle. On the contrary, it is enshrined in democracy. 
Messing with proportional representation and introducing 
a ridiculous system of AMS is the inevitable consequence 
of playing around with the electoral system. If someone 
has a party mandate and forfeits it, they should forfeit 
their seat and make way for the next person on the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I hope that the Committee will not 
deem me too subjective if I confess that I am perhaps the 
only Member here to have received a "Dear John"	 letter 
telling me that I was no longer a member of the party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Livingstone (Brent, East):</B> Me too. I think 
that I have had more than one.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Wilkinson: I defer in this, as in so much else, to 
the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone). I hope 
that he is permitted to make a contribution on this very 
important amendment, tabled by, among others, my hon. 
Friends the Members for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) and for 
Croydon, South.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South went 
to the heart of the matter. The amendment illustrates the 
inherent dangers of having two classes of assembly men. 
That is what Lord Jenkins proposed for this place, and I 
hope that his proposals will prove abhorrent. But that is 
what Londoners will be lumbered with 14 constituency 
representatives who are industrious, diligent, hard 
working, committed [Hon. Members: "Labour"	.] We 
shall see about that. and there will be 11 who owe 
allegiance, in essence, to the electors as a whole 
[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I want only one contribution at 
a time.
<BR>



<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> But those people will owe allegiance 
much more to the party managers who put them on the 
party list, and whose critical judgment members must 
always reckon with, if they wish to maintain their position 
on the list, stand again and have a continuing career.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South 
pointed out, rightly, that if any member of that rootless 
fraternity of 11 is denied the party whip or resigns it, in 
all equity, and in all justice to the people who elected 
them, he or she should not remain on the assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty (Harrow, East):</B> I do not see that, 
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point about a member 
resigning the party whip. The amendment says nothing 
about a member being denied the party whip. Would 
whips and party managers be given all the more power if 
that were included? The amendment contains nothing 
about causing a vacancy if the whip is taken away from 
a member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> As with many amendments, the sense 
is clear. Whether a member resigns the whip voluntarily 
or is compelled to do so is really of no concern to electors. 
What is of concern to electors is that the individual who 
was elected on a party ticket can no longer be regarded as 
either supporting or being worthy of that party affiliation, 
which is what counts. The individual may have worthy 
qualities that befit him for a high place on the list, but the 
Londoner the elector casts his vote ideologically and 
doctrinally, knowing that the 11 individuals will espouse 
a particular programme put forward by a particular party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton):</B> 
Following on from the intervention made by the hon. 
Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), does not the 
hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood feel that a 
distinction should be made between someone who resigns 
the whip and someone who is denied the whip? Surely in 
the latter case, it is being used to enforce party discipline, 
and that person could still be a party member but not take 
the whip, whereas in a case of resignation, it is an issue 
of the person's conscience, which did not apply at the 
time of the election.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Wilkinson: In practical terms, there is in essence 
little difference. Hon. Members present in the previous 
Parliament will recall the glorious episode when several 
members of our party refused to vote for the European 
Communities (Finance) Act 1994. Several of us received 
Dear John or Dear Chris, or Dear Teresa letters. My 
former colleague, the hon. Member for Holland with 
Boston, was so incensed by our treatment that he 
voluntarily resigned the Whip. However, the status of the 
two categories those who had the Whip taken away and 
the hon. Member who voluntarily resigned it was in 
essence the same. Neither were members of the 
parliamentary party, and neither could be deemed 
officially supportive of the party line although we knew 
that we were, probably, more Conservative than those 
who remained with the Whip.
<P>
That is past history, but it is important for the election 
that we are debating, as is the point made by the hon. 
Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes). The amendment 
as drafted could, perhaps, be interpreted as referring to 
the territorial 11 with the constituency link. The ballot 
paper will show not only candidates' names although I 
am sure that members will primarily be elected on their 
character and commitment to local issues, none the less 
significant to electors will be candidates' party affiliation. 
The amendment as drafted therefore contains an 
ambiguity. I would prefer it to state that members of the 
assembly elected on a party list who resign the whip shall 
be deemed to have created a vacancy.
<P>
My hon. Friends have highlighted a grave deficiency 
in the alternative member system. They have done the 
Committee a service, and I wholeheartedly support the 
amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I join hon. Members in 
congratulating you, Mr. Winterton. I cannot say that I 
have served under you before, because this is the first 
time that I have been placed on a Committee considering 
a Government Bill. I cannot even offer wonderful 
reminiscences about sharing the showers with other hon. 
Members. The nearest that I can offer is that I was once 
stuck in a jacuzzi with Charlie Whelan, which is not quite 
the same.
<P>
I interpreted the amendment was proposing that 
someone would cease to be a list member of the assembly 
only when he or she resigned the whip. However, I 
worried that the whip might be withdrawn, resulting in a 
court case over whether the whips tried to get rid of 
someone, saying that he or she had constructively 
resigned by, for example, consistently voting against the 
party. It is now clear from what Conservative Members 
have said that the intention of the amendment is to give 
more power to the whips.
<P>
The power of the Whips is one of the most evil and 
corrupting influences in this country, and one which 
obstructs democracy I do not want to give them any 
more. Nothing has done more to bring the parliamentary 
process into disrepute than the slavish way in which hon. 
Members vote against what they believe, simply because 
Whips bludgeon them with their threats and powers of 
patronage. I intend never to vote to increase the power of 
Whips at any point in my political career. I should 
therefore be appalled if the amendment were accepted.
<P>
We also need to recognise that one of the factors that 
will be taken into account when people are considered for 
inclusion on the list will be how they are viewed by the 
public. Every Londoner will have two votes to cast: one 
for their constituency representative and one for the list 
member. I do not believe for a moment that when parties 
draw up the list of those extra 11 members, they will not 
take into account who will be the most popular and 
attractive person to head it. They will aim to assemble a 
group of people that will cause Londoners to think, "Well, 
I might vote Conservative for my constituency member 
because it is someone I particularly like, but the Labour 
list looks better than the Tory list or the Liberal list."	 I 
am certain that a vast amount of energy will be expended 
in Tory central office, Millbank tower and the Liberal 
Democrat headquarters in trying to come up with a list of 
the people who will attract the most votes.
<P>
Londoners will be influenced by who is on the list. For 
a person on the list then to be removed, having been 
elected and possibly having influenced the number of 
people being elected, would undermine what little direct 
accountability the list members would have to London. 
People who seemed attractive and whom one felt would 
make a contribution might be elected, only to be shuffled 
to one side, by resigning or by having the whip 
withdrawn. Real old hacks would then come along, work 
their way up and get co-opted without people ever having 
voted for them. I therefore hope that the amendment will 
be withdrawn; it sets a dangerous precedent.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall (Uxbridge):</B> I also and as the 
member of the Committee most recently elected to the 
House welcome you as Chairman, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
I am very aware that my first Whip in my brief tenure 
here my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South 
is sitting in front of me. I would be interested to know 
what the hon. Member for Brent, East used as a whipping 
system when he was across the river, as leader of the then 
Greater London council.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Livingstone, a brief intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Very brief. Under the first package 
of proposals that I put to the Labour group, there was to 
be a whip; we asked people to vote, but would never take 
any action against a member who did not follow the whip. 
Rebellions gradually petered out and self-discipline came 
into operation.
<BR>



<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I find that very interesting. I wonder 
whether the system worked.
<P>
The concern that has been raised by members on both 
sides of the Committee leads to the inevitable conclusion 
that the proposed form of proportional representation will 
have ramifications. I agree with the hon. Member for 
Ilford, South that all hon. Members were elected because 
of the colour of the rosette that we wore, not because 
we are exceedingly fine people. However, we still have a 
legitimacy as individuals because we were elected on an 
individual basis.
<P>
What worries me about the proposed form of 
representation is that there will be two types of assembly 
member: those who are there because they have been 
given the legitimacy of their constituency and those who 
are there because of their loyalty to the party. I do not 
know how often members of the party list system would 
resign their party whip, because they will have been 
chosen certainly under the Labour party's method of 
selection for their intense loyalty to the party and will 
owe their advancement to that loyalty. The threat of losing 
one's job and salary as a result of resigning the party whip 
would concentrate anyone's mind. There are men and 
women of such principle, but I suggest that they are 
relatively few. The prospect of submitting themselves to 
re-election if they crossed the Floor might also 
concentrate the minds of hon. Members in this House.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for 
Ruislip-Northwood that the amendment would perhaps 
have been clearer if it had pointed out that the list referred 
not to all members of the assembly, but to those elected 
purely on the party list system. If someone who is there 
simply with no equivocation because of party 
allegiance loses that allegiance, he or she should not be 
deemed fit to represent the people of London in that 
capacity. As I said, I hope that people would stand down 
of their own accord, but I fear that that would not happen. 
I therefore feel that such a provision should be enshrined 
in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow (Sutton and Cheam):</B> I also express 
my pleasure at serving on this Committee and at the 
prospect of the many weeks before us in which we can 
study the Bill in detail.
<P>
During this debate I reread the amendment to clarify 
whether the speeches of the hon. Members for Croydon, 
South and for Ruislip-Northwood coincided with the 
words of the amendment. The hon. Member for Harrow, 
East and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and 
Surbiton (Mr. Davey) put their finger on it: the 
amendment would not have the effect that Conservative 
Members wish.
<P>
The amendment is solely about resigning the party 
whip. It is not about giving additional power to the whips 
to exercise discipline and control over their party 
members in the assembly; if it were, we would not support 
it. It refers solely to the electorate's right, having voted 
for a list, to be certain that the candidates who are elected 
continue to serve the cause for which they were elected If 
members cross the floor which is what the amendment 
is about and why we support it they are no longer part 
of the party or the list from which they benefited in the 
election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> On a point of clarification, I used the 
words "crossing the floor"	. The hon. Gentleman's 
interpretation of the amendment is what was intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman used the word 
"sacking"	 during his remarks, an idea that was certainly 
expanded on in one or two other speeches. As I 
understand it, the amendment does not deal with the issue 
of sacking. As long as we are clear on that, we support 
the amendment. We believe that it is an appropriate 
safeguard to build into the Bill so that the electorate would 
continue to have in the assembly the people for whom 
they voted via the lists we are clear that the provision is 
solely about list candidates.
<BR>



<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Would it not be ingenuous to stress 
the niceties of language to much? Is not it the case 
certainly in this place and probably in the assembly, 
wherever it is located that members will be induced to 
fall on their swords? This happened shortly before 
Christmas to two distinguished members of the Labour 
Government they were judged to have resigned, but 
everybody knows that they were pushed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We are perhaps reaching the point where 
the official Opposition will have to publish explanatory 
notes to their amendments. Amendment No. 134 as 
drafted has a very different meaning from the one that 
Conservative Members are trying to place on it. We are 
happy to support the amendment with the intention that is 
clear on paper, but not in the terms in which Conservative 
Members have spoken to it. We shall still vote for it, but 
not on the basis on which it appears to have been 
supported. However, having looked at some of the debates 
that took place during the passage of the legislation for 
the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, I do not 
think that the issue of vacancies arising under AMS was 
adequately explored. It will be useful to explore it as we 
consider the issues surrounding such vacancies in the next 
two or three clauses.
<P>
I hope that the Government will be able to give us an 
idea, in their response to the debate on the amendment, as 
to their thinking. When voters cast a vote for a list of 
candidates from a particular party, and the successful 
candidate later crosses the floor or resigns the whip, how 
do we ensure that we take into account the fact that the 
electorate's expressed wish to have that person represent 
them as a Labour, Liberal Democrat of Conservative 
member has been denied? The amendment would have 
that effect that is why we support it. We would not 
support it if it were about giving whips more control. In 
that respect, the hon. Member for Brent, East may have 
been beguiled by the persuasive arguments of the official 
Opposition into thinking that the matter is about control 
by whips when it is about control by the electorate.

<P>

<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I also congratulate you on your 
chairmanship, Mr. Winterton. My only experience of it 
was in an exemplary two-minute official Business 
Sub-Committee of this Committee, which was quite 
wonderful to behold, and I look forward to experiencing 
much more of it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood was right 
about there being ambiguities in the amendment, but 
wrong about their location. The amendment refers to any 
"London member"	. As he will know, clause 2(2)(b) 
clearly defines London members as those on the list. Who 
the London members will be is explicit the ambiguity 
lies elsewhere in the amendment. It does not deal with 
crossing the floor or sackings, so there is no sensitivity 
in-built for the electorate. The whips could sack whoever 
they liked, and he or she could stay; but if people resigned 
as a matter of conscience, they would have to go. The 
amendment would be, in some inverse fashion, a charter 
for whips. I do not accept the comments of the hon. 
Member for Sutton and somewhere.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Cheam.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> That's it the hon. Member for Sutton 
and Cheam (Mr. Burstow). Thank you very much,
Mr. Winterton.
<P>
Let me say in passing that I wish right hon. and hon. 
Members on all sides would stop the demonisation of our 
kindly friends, the Whips. [Laughter.] We can all play 
games, but we are talking about internal party politics. 
The notion that they are the most evil feature of 
democracy is abject drivel. I say that with great respect 
for my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East, whose 
constituency is almost next door to mine.
<BR>



<P>
The amendment makes no sense. It would not alleviate 
any concerns that the electorate might have about the gap 
in the list being fulfilled. It would do nothing when it 
comes to members crossing the floor or being sacked. It 
is silly, inherently flawed, a technical monstrosity and 
bears no relation 
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Yes, I shall give way, but only if the 
hon. Gentleman does not call me names. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that I have 
never called him names. I have, of course, thought of 
some on many occasions.
<P>
Let us consider some of the minority parties, apart from 
the Liberal Democrats. If one Green party member was 
elected to the assembly and then crossed the floor, would 
not the electorate of London who voted for the Green 
party, thinking that they had at least one representative on 
the assembly, feel very disillusioned if that member then 
became a member of the Liberal Democrat party, for 
example?
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> That is a valid point, extremely well 
made, but it is not covered by the amendment. [Hon. 
Members: "Yes it is."	] No, it is not. A Green party 
member could cross the floor, especially if he was a single 
member. He would not have resigned the whip and no 
one could sack him, so he would not be covered by the 
amendment, unless he sacked himself or resigned the 
whip.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Let me finish the point first, please. You 
are not privatising the Post Office now. To whom does 
the member resign? Whom does he tell that he has 
resigned the whip? The amendment does not make sense.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Davey: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I said that I would do so. The hon. 
Gentleman must be patient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman 
is saying. I do not know if the Labour party allows 
members of other parties to join it. In the case of the 
Liberal Democrats, one would have to resign from the 
Green party before one could join us. The point made by 
the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) was well 
made.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I have to tell the hon. Member for 
Uxbridge that if he has the hon. Member for Kingston and 
Surbiton behind him as a supporter he should worry. I do 
not think that the hon. Member for Uxbridge's point was 
well made at all. The Labour party is, perhaps 
uncomfortably for some people, littered with members of 
other parties. Some of those parties are now extinct; some, 
perhaps in the case of that of the hon. Member for 
Kingston and Surbiton, are about to be.
<P>
The wording of the amendment bears no relation to any 
of the legitimate points that have been made by 
Opposition Members about the sensitivity of the electorate 
in filling the gap and about crossing the floor and being 
sacked. If Opposition Members are serious about the 
matter they should withdraw the amendment and return 
with one that is not technically flawed.
<P>
<B></B><P>
The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda 
Jackson):  It is no fault of mine, Mr. Winterton, that mine 
is the first female voice to welcome you to the Committee. 
I should not like you to think that that shows any lack of 
respect or appreciation; it reflects a situation in the House 
that all Labour Members are committed to changing in 
the near future.
<P>
I am tempted to urge the hon. Member for Croydon, 
South to withdraw the amendment immediately, because 
neither he nor his Back Benchers appear to understand it. 
As other hon. Members have said, a great deal of 
confusion surrounds the amendment's aims. The hon. 
Member for Croydon, South spoke of resignation, and 
subsequently of crossing the floor. As my hon. Friend the 
Member for Brent, East pointed out, if the amendment 
concerns resignation, it would do nothing to ensure that 
the interests of Londoners were represented by the list 
members in the assembly. It would simply strengthen the 
whips of the various political parties.
<P>
I admire the courage of the hon. Member for 
Ruislip-Northwood. His earlier contribution appeared to 
lead to the possibility of his receiving yet another Dear 
John letter: he had strong arguments about the sittings 
motion, as evinced by his party managers, and is clearly 
in disagreement with the amendment.
<P>
The amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any London member elected as a member of a registered 
political party who resigns his party whip"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I love the idea that the only people who are going to be 
elected are male 
<BR>



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall be deemed to have created a vacancy"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why would that happen? It is impractical in the extreme. 
Any assembly members who were aware that that was to 
be the axe that would fall on their suspecting head if they 
resigned their whip would never do so. They would retain 
their right to argue and to exercise their vote, not 
necessarily with regard to their political affiliation. If the 
hon. member for Croydon, South means that someone 
who crosses the floor actually joins another political party, 
that is not what the amendment says. In the light of recent 
defections from the European Parliament, and of the 
history of the previous Administration, I can understand 
the hon. Gentleman's sensitivity in that area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My mother always used to say that I 
had a weakness with language. When I used the phrase 
"crossing the floor"	, I meant it synonymously with 
resignation. I think that most people would understand 
that. If the Minister is a little confused, I am glad to have 
been able to enlighten her.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It seems to me that it is not my confusion 
that needs clarification, but that of the hon. Member for 
Croydon, South. Amendment No. 134, which was tabled 
in his name, makes no reference to crossing the floor in 
terms of changing one's affiliation. It has specifically to 
do with resigning a party whip. As I said, if that 
punishment were exercised, nobody elected to the 
assembly under the list system would opt for that course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> In general terms, I accept all that 
the Minister says. Does she agree that somebody resigning 
the whip ought to remain under a new affiliation or under 
no affiliation for the duration of the assembly? Such a 
person would have been elected on a list as a party 
member.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The tradition of the House and of local 
authorities is that a person who has a change of heart, 
perception, argument and commitment retains his or her 
elected office until the next election. I can see no reason 
why the assembly should be different, even if it is a 
unique form of city-wide government.
<P>
I do not agree with the suggestion that people on a list 
system will be elected only to toe their specific party line, 
although I admit that the hon. Member for Southwark, 
North and Bermondsey did not argue that. As I said, 
members will be elected to a unique form of government. 
The strategic nature of the authority and issues that affect 
all Londoners will be central to the decision-making 
process and to candidates' election campaigns, regardless 
of party labels.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am not arguing that there should be a 
different rule because the assembly is a new form of 
city-wide government. The elections will be the first in 
England to occur on a list-system basis. The European 
elections will also occur this year. Does the Minister 
believe that assembly members elected on a list and who 
resign should remain for the normal period of election, 
even though they are present in the assembly under 
different colours from those under which they were 
elected?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Yes; my argument is that until the next 
ordinary election comes along, the duly elected member 
should maintain his or her position. The hon. Gentleman 
is missing my point. Candidates will not present 
themselves as list members or as prospective members of 
the assembly in a way that is based exclusively on a party 
political affiliation, although that will be central to their 
campaigning. This specific and unique form of city-wide 
government relates to the concerns of all Londoners. It 
moves away from exclusive parochial interests. The 
constituencies are larger, and the whole system will 
ensure that Londoners will not be represented only by the 
major parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the hon. lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall give way just relax.
<P>
The system moves away from the exclusive 
decision-making process of the major political parties, and 
will afford opportunities for smaller parties and for 
independent candidates to stand for election. It is based 
on reality, which is that people in London realise that their 
problems can often be solved only by a strategic view 
based on this new form of city-wide government.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I became agitated because of the words 
that the Minister uttered, which were stimulating, even if 
I was not entirely convinced by some of her comments. 
Given the arguments in support of rejecting the 
amendment, would it not be better to use open lists? The 
electorate would then have a genuine say in who is 
elected. The closed list gives no say in who is elected, 
and the people vote merely for the party and get the list 
in the order in which it comes, no matter who is on it.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I cannot get my head around that 
argument. The hon. Gentleman began by saying that 
candidates will be validated by the vote only because of 
a party-political system. He is now saying that that should 
not apply, because nobody knows for whom they are 
voting. He cannot have it both ways. Either the thrust of 
his argument is that we, as individual electors in London, 
go with the party regardless of the name on the list, or it 
is that the Bill should introduce a system in which we 
vote exclusively for the individual. The closed list does 
not mean that we will not know for whom we are voting 
on the party list when we stand in the polling booths, 
because the list of names will be there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Minister is as courteous as ever. 
She is helping the Committee a lot. [Hon. Members: "Is 
she?"	] Yes she is. She is helping the Committee to 
understand clearly that she does not appreciate the way in 
which the members of the assembly who are returned on 
the list will be elected. They are elected by sole virtue of 
the arithmetical proportionality of the votes cast for 
parties. That is incontrovertible.
<P>
The amendment should stand, because it recognises the 
fundamental fact that, by resigning the whip, members 
would have dissociated themselves from the party 
allegiance that was the basis for the electorate's choice. 
Such members are chosen arithmetically, and there is a 
formula in the Bill to make that clear.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Again, it seems to me that there is 
confusion in the hon. Gentleman's mind about what his 
argument is. Is he arguing against the closed list on the 
basis that the only loyalty that list members of the 
assembly can justifiably call their own is membership of 
a political party?
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is now arguing that there must be 
a personality dimension. That, however, is not what the 
amendment says. It deals with the removal of members 
from office if they resign their party whip. I have pointed 
out already that if that is the likely outcome of such an 
action, no one will resign. They will stay where they are 
possibly arguing, as the hon. Gentleman has had occasion 
to do, against the party line, and voting as they see fit.
<P>
The basis of my argument is that people will be 
returned to the assembly because they have a 
commitment about which their parties will quiz them 
when the lists are being drawn up to approach the 
problems of London from a strategic rather than a 
parochial, or, in some instances, an empty party political 
point of view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> May I put to the Minister an 
example that I think shows the folly of her argument? A 
group of Conservatives, elected on the party ticket, could 
decide two years later as the hon. Member for 
Ruislip-Northwood would do to resign the whip on an 
issue of conscience. On an issue relating to London, all 
or half the Tory group might become independent 
Conservatives. Similarly, a group of the Minister's 
colleagues on the assembly might decide that they were 
unhappy, resign the whip and become the old Labour 
group. Does she seriously argue that they should be 
allowed to continue for the rest of their term? Will she 
answer that question?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> If the hon. Gentleman sits down, I will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That would be very illuminating.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I have already pointed out that I think 
that what applies to the House and to local authorities 
should also apply to the assembly. What is revelatory 
about the most recent question asked by the hon. Member 
for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is the implication 
that he believes that those who are returned to the 
assembly either from a constituency or through the list 
system should have as their prior regard, responsibility 
and commitment not the best government for London but 
what most closely suits their party political remit. That is 
somewhat surprising.
<P>
It is our view that the amendment does not meet the 
variety of requirements that Opposition Members have 
mentioned. I strongly urge that it be withdrawn.


<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> No sooner had I sat down after my first 
speech in Committee than I received four telephone 
messages, including one from a constituent who has such 
confidence in her Member of Parliament that she rings 
him up during the small hours when the House is not 
sitting. I stress that she is an elderly lady older than 
either you Mr. Winterton, or myself. Because of the light 
whipping that Conservative Members enjoy, I was 
allowed by the Whip to go out and take those telephone 
messages. I was therefore absent during the first five or 
six speeches on the amendment. However, in a manner 
similar to the Aristotelian definition of drama which 
may be appropriate, given the Minister's dramatic past 
members of the Committee have illustrated all the merits 
of good speeches. They tell the audience what they are 
going to say, they say it, and then they tell the audience 
what they have sad. During the 22 minutes since my 
return to the Committee, I have formed a clear picture of 
what went on in my absence, and I believe that I would 
be able to rehearse the speeches made by individual 
Members.
<P>
Regardless of any deficiencies and defects in the 
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend those who lead 
for the Government will readily recall occasions when 
they have tabled such [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want conversations 
taking place when a Member is addressing the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Those leading for the Government will 
recall having moved amendments that were described by 
the previous Government as defective. However, we can 
get to the substance of the amendment and what 
Opposition Members are arguing about. I refer to the issue 
on Second Reading, as I saw that there would be a 
problem.
<P>
The Minister says that, although people are elected 
under a party political label, they are actually elected to 
carry out a strategic function, and that therefore their party 
political label does not matter. However, if someone were 
to leave the party through which he had secured his place 
on the strategic authority thanks to the number of votes 
cast for that party, not thanks to his bright blue eyes 
it is not for me to question the Minister's motives, but 
Conservative Members have other views on proportional 
representation yet continued to sit, I can think of no 
swifter way to discredit the list system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow (Sutton and Cheam):</B> We welcome the 
move to the additional member system proposed in the 
Bill. We have already had some debates on the Floor of 
the House regarding the precise operation of that system, 
and there will be more.
<P>
Clearly the system as currently drafted is far from 
perfect, and the amendment attempts to address one of 
its consequences. What happens when a vacancy arises 
because a member of the assembly has resigned? The 
Minister might be right to say that that is highly unlikely 
because no turkey will vote for the Christmas. However, 
for her to rely on the idea of the parliamentary tradition 
of this place, which is elected on a different basis from 
that on which list members of the assembly will be 
elected, is risky.
<P>
As the Minister has rightly said, we are talking about a 
new and unique institution, which will break new ground. 
The assembly will be elected on the proportional basis, to 
guarantee that it is as inclusive and as wide-ranging in its 
membership as possible, and is thus able to scrutinise the 
activities of the mayor. If, over the life of an assembly, 
its membership and its proportional mix can be whittled 
away, as the Bill will currently allow, Londoners will 
have a right to question whether the Bill genuinely reflects 
their concerns.
<BR>



<P>
The amendment would not do what the official 
Opposition say that it would, and we therefore support it. 
It addresses and raises an issue that needs to be considered 
by Ministers. It may not be a perfect amendment, as has 
already been accepted even by some of the official 
Opposition. I hope, however, that Ministers will reflect 
further on concerns about how the list system will operate 
in respect of vacancies created. That is an important issue, 
which will affect the confidence that Londoners have in 
the new institution.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson rose </B><P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Ottaway rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not know whether the Minister 
wants to reply, but I am happy for her to do so.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Yes, I would like to touch on two points 
made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of "resigning"	, but I 
presume that he means resigning the whip. If individual 
members actually resigned and removed themselves from 
the assembly, that would be entirely different. However, 
he means resigning the whip, and I do not intend to repeat 
the arguments that I have already advanced.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of scrutiny, and 
painted a picture of many members from the list system 
losing their party affiliations. His argument was that that 
would in some way reduce the powers of scrutiny. I would 
have thought that his proposal would inevitably reduce 
the powers of scrutiny to mere party political replication 
of arguments that depend on party loyalty, as opposed to 
what is best governance for London and Londoners.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I shall follow on from the points 
made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and 
Westminster (Mr. Brooke). He said that if the 
Government persist in opposing the amendment, or persist 
in opposing the spirit of it, there is a danger that their 
system will become discredited.
<P>
I had the opportunity recently to speak to New Zealand 
Members of Parliament about the introduction of the 
equivalent of the additional member system in New 
Zealand. It has become unpopular for two reasons. The 
New Zealand First party, before the first election under 
that system, promised that it would go into coalition with 
the Labour party if there was a hung Parliament. After 
that election it reneged on that promise to the electorate, 
and that caused consternation among those who had voted 
for New Zealand First.
<P>
The second reason why the additional member system, 
called MMP in New Zealand, has become discredited is 
that one or two list Members of Parliament from different 
parties in the New Zealand Parliament switched parties 
and did not resign. An awful lot of the electorate feel that 
they have been cheated. They have gone to the polls and 
voted for parties, and the Members who were returned by 
their votes have cheated on them. That has caused a lot 
of concern although people can almost forgive New 
Zealand First for reneging on its promise, because it 
secured other things, including some manifesto 
commitments, in the coalition agreement that it made with 
the National party. The electorate can forgive that aspect 
of the MMP system that operates in New Zealand, but 
they cannot forgive the type of behaviour that is covered 
by the amendment.
<P>
I urge Ministers to think of the electorate's perception. 
Weasel arguments can be used to say that a person could 
operate without a party whip and not resign, but the moral 
opprobrium of London would come down on such an 
individual. There would be a campaign in the Evening 
Standard and other parts of the London media for that 
person to resign. That is what the electorate would want.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Iain Coleman (Hammersmith and Fulham):</B> Is the 
moral opprobrium of the electorate similar to the moral 
opprobrium expressed by the electorate in Islington in 
1982? In that year, the Liberals or the Social Democratic 
party, or whatever they called themselves in those days 
took control of the council for three or four months, after 
more than 20 people who had been elected as Labour 
councillors changed sides. When those councillors stood 
for re-election later in 1982, not one was re-elected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for that intervention, because 
it enables me to strengthen my argument and explain to 
the hon. Gentleman and to the Committee why we feel so 
strongly about the amendment. We are talking about an 
electoral system different from the first-past-the-post 
system under which those members of Islington council 
were elected. They were elected not just under the party 
label, but as individuals. We are debating a party list, 
which is a totally different system. We are not used to it, 
so perhaps we have not got our minds round the different 
culture that will be involved. We owe it to the electorate 
to try to do that, because if we do not, they will realise 
the fact.
<BR>



<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept the 
fact that, although the party machine will determine where 
someone stands on the list, there will be major debates 
about who is on each party's list? Those included will 
figure in the Evening Standard and the other local 
newspapers, and will campaign around London. The 
names on the list will affect the number of votes that the 
list attracts.
<P>
Therefore, although I have every sympathy with 
someone who is disgusted to see all those ghastly old 
Labour people go off and join the Social Democratic 
party a lot of them have come back, I am sad to say 
the amendment introduces a dangerous principle. 
Londoners will vote for the people on the list, and the 
amendment would allow the party machine to "de-elect"	 
them. That would put the machine above the will of the 
electorate.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Davey: The hon. Gentleman seems to see the 
wisdom of Liberal Democrat policy more as every day 
passes. He argues against closed lists and we agree with 
him. Closed lists are an imperfect system. Nevertheless, 
that is the system that we have, and the amendment would 
reduce its negative effect. The electorate look to the 
Government to think again and table another amendment.
<P>
In the spirit of co-operation that we saw on the Floor of 
the House, where the Government proved that they were 
listening to the strong arguments of the Opposition and 
agreed to re-examine legitimate issues, I hope that the 
Minister will see some room for manoeuvre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I start with a small remark in support of 
the Whips, who have come in for a fair amount of stick 
in the debate. As someone who was a Government Whip 
in the last two years of the previous Parliament, when the 
majority was down to zero and whipping was taken into 
a new dimension, I am reminded of the famous remark 
by Enoch Powell that Whips are as necessary to 
democracy as sewers are to a city.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I would say that that was an 
endorsement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendment reflects the fact that, in 
any form of democracy, there will be a whipping system. 
Some members of the Committee have sought to put 
different interpretations on the meaning of the 
amendment. It means quite simply what it says it means. 
[Interruption.] Perhaps I should warn the Committee that 
I have proposed quite a few amendments for debate over 
the next few weeks, and their drafting is no better or 
worse than the amendment now before us.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> We will explain them to the 
hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The object of the amendment is to 
stimulate a debate. In her reply, the Minister sought to 
pull the amendment apart in an analytical way. I always 
consider that to be the last refuge of any Minister when 
the merits of an amendment cannot be argued out. As we 
consider the various amendments, I hope that the principle 
of each can be considered, and the Government will say 
whether they are for or against them. If they find some 
merit in our proposal, the amendment can be redrafted.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brent, East spoke about the list 
system with some affection, and implied that the names 
on the list would be immediately recognised. As people 
sit in the pub in the depths of Croydon or Brent, they 
would look at the list and say. "That's the list for me."	 
Indeed, they talk of nothing else in the Dog and Duck.
<P>
It is ludicrous to believe that the list if it is seen 
will carry any merit. Who will be on the list? Among 
members of the Committee, the hon. Member for Brent, 
East would be recognised, as would the Minister for 
Transport in London, because of her previous career. A 
number of members of the Committee occasionally pop 
up on television, and perhaps might be recognised by
1 or 2 per cent. of the electorate in London.
<P>
However, let us not get carried away with the idea that 
the names on the list will be persuasive and that people 
will say, "That lot are a better bunch than the other lot."	 
They will say, "Where does my party allegiance lie?"	 
They might vote for an individual under one system and 
for a party under another. The London members of the 
assembly will have no mandate other than that they have 
been elected as party members.
<BR>



<P>
To be fair to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and 
Bermondsey, he put his finger on the problem when he 
asked the Minister what would happen if the whole lot 
crossed the floor I am talking about resignation. The 
Minister said that they should still be allowed to stay. That 
is a fairly extreme proposal, which illustrates the strength 
of the amendment and the weakness of the Minister's 
response. We shall therefore divide the committee.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I should have thought that Londoners 
would be extremely interested in the attendance record of 
their assembly men. They would want to see strict 
disciplines in the Bill to ensure good attendance on the 
part of their representatives. In normal local government 
practice, six-month intervals might be sufficient to ensure 
continued membership. Her Majesty's Government have, 
however, led us to believe that the responsibilities of 
assembly men are so various and intensive that they 
would surely need to be present more than half yearly, 
which is the requirement in the clause.
<BR>

<BR>



<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
In their wisdom, my hon. Friends on the Front Bench 
have thought fit not to table an amendment. Presumably, 
they hope that the three participating parties will reach a 
consensus in a clause stand part debate as to what 
members' required periodicity of attendance should be.
<P>
As we see from the clause, we are talking not only 
about attendance at a full meeting of the assembly; 
attendance at a committee or sub-committee will do. 
Furthermore, subsection (3)(b) refers to a member acting
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as a representative of the Assembly or the Authority at a meeting 
of any body of persons."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For those free spirits who will be list members of the 
assembly, it is particularly important that there should be 
strict discipline regarding attendance. My reading of 
subsection (3)(b) is that a member of the assembly could, 
for example, go as a fraternal delegate to another 
assembly that represents another city in this country or 
abroad and that that would count as his qualifying 
attendance for a six-month period. I am certain that the 
electors of London would not regard that as good enough, 
and I do not regard the stipulations as good enough. The 
individuals concerned will be paid and need, therefore, to 
be seen to give value for money. I am not saying that they 
should clock in as if they were going to work in a factory, 
but they should jolly well attend more than once every six 
months. The requirement in the clause is deficient, and I 
hope that a consensus to that effect will emerge in 
Committee.
<P>
The other aspect of the clause that I find interesting and 
which merits some comment is the dispensation that 
would be granted to members of Her Majesty's armed 
forces in time of war or emergency and to members of 
other services of the Crown in similar circumstances and 
which would preclude them from attending the assembly. 
The stipulation of emergency or wartime duties in 
subsection (4) is important because it recognises in statute 
the obligations of members of the Territorial Army, Royal 
Naval Reserve and Royal Auxiliary Air Force. In my 
constituency, we have No. 1 maritime headquarters unit 
of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. Just next door we have 
the Royal Naval Reserve unit at HMS Northwood. 
Assembly men would be citizens twice over because they 
would already be giving their time to serve their fellow 
citizens as members of the reserve forces. It would have 
been wrong for Her Majesty's Government not to 
recognise that their additional duties would preclude them 
in emergency or war from attending the assembly and that 
they should not suffer disqualification as a consequence.

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> In looking carefully at the clause, has my 
hon. Friend considered the possibility of elected assembly 
members simultaneously being Members of Parliament or 
of the European Parliament or of their holding another 
elected office? That possibility is admitted in the Bill, 
except in clause 20, which rather delphically states that a 
person may be disqualified from being mayor or an 
assembly member if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he holds any of the offices or appointments for the time being 
designated by the Secretary of State"	.
<BR>



<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does my hon. Friend agree that we may see the 
emergence of dual or triple mandates based on assembly 
membership together with that of this House and perhaps 
the European Parliament? that might bring into play 
possible conflicts in terms of members' time, which may 
have a bearing on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My right hon. Friend makes an 
extremely significant point, which exemplifies the 
importance of a clause stand part debate.
<P>
The specific dispensation relating to members of the 
reserve forces or to those who are conscripted from the 
assembly to serve in Her Majesty's armed forces in times 
of emergency or war, or those who serve in a civilian 
capacity in emergency or war in the service of the 
Crown ought to be or could be extended, perhaps, to 
Members of this House, Members of the European 
Parliament or to members of other elected bodies, as my 
right hon. Friend suggested, but I do not believe that it 
should.
<P>
Members of the assembly might be able to combine 
their function as such with membership of the House of 
Commons if they were Members of Parliament for 
London constituencies, but it would be much harder for 
Members of Parliament representing constituencies 
beyond the home counties. Of course, there are hon. 
Members who aspire to office in the Scottish Parliament 
or the Welsh Assembly and others who have dual 
mandates in this House and in the Northern Ireland 
Assembly. We have always comprehended that such dual 
mandates are useful on occasions. When people were 
simultaneously Members of the European Parliament and 
of this House, the House undoubtedly benefited, and I 
hope that the European Parliament if it is not beyond 
redemption benefited as well.
<P>
The clause deserves further scrutiny. I hope that 
additional Committee members may grant it such 
scrutiny, and I should be interested to hear the 
observations of the Government on my brief remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Like the hon. Gentleman, Liberal 
Democrat Members had concerns when we first saw the 
clause. From what the Minister said on Second Reading 
and in the Committee of the whole House, it was clear 
that the body that is being set up is not like local 
government. While the provisions are borrowed from 
local government, assembly members and the authority 
will be very different from local councils and councillors.
<P>
The assembly will be a unique form of city-wide 
government. The members, who will have great powers 
to consider the strategy for management of the city, will 
also be very high-profile politicians in comparison with 
most councillors. There is a great difference, and it 
therefore does not necessarily follow that the Bill should 
merely borrow local government practices.
<P>
Moreover, many members of the assembly will be full 
time, and the excuses and rationale of the provisions in 
local government will not apply. Clearly, a councillor 
with a business that is under pressure may not be able to 
attend local council meetings, but many members of the 
London assembly will be full time.
<BR>



<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> The hon. Gentleman 
offered us the thought that some or many of those 
relatively high-profile politicians will be full time. Will 
he offer an opinion on how much he thinks they ought to 
be paid if they are full time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am not sure whether I would remain in 
order if I answered that, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can help the hon. Gentleman. The 
question does not relate to this clause. If the hon. 
Gentleman cares to make a quick observation, I will 
permit it, but I trust that he will not give a lengthy 
response to the intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Not having considered standing for such a 
post I am very happy with my current position  all I 
can say is that I have not even considered the salary.
<P>
The point that I was trying to develop was that in local 
government, councillors often have employment concerns 
which may sometimes mean that they are unable to attend 
meetings. That might be a good reason not to borrow local 
government provisions. Most if not all members of the 
assembly should be focusing on the business of the 
assembly full time. On reflection, however, we concluded 
that six months was probably right. It is not a theological 
issue, but is probably right on practical grounds, given the 
problems that an assembly member may be experiencing 
in their private life. They might become ill, for example. 
A separate provision could be made for that, but the 
person might not want the whole world to know that they 
are ill, preferring to recuperate in quiet, so six months is 
about right on compassionate grounds. Another example 
might be that of an assembly person who is having 
difficulties at home; this period may take off some of the 
pressure to deal with those family difficulties.
<P>
The final reason for our not tabling amendments to the 
clause and accepting the proposed six-month period is that 
assembly members are not executive members of the 
authority. I am sure that the Minister will say that they 
will have one or two executive functions on some of the 
boards that the Bill establishes; but there will be 25 
assembly members, and presumably provision will be 
made to have deputies for people serving on the various 
boards. I do not know whether such a provision is in the 
Bill, but I imagine that it will be contained in the workings 
and standing orders of the assembly.
<BR>



<P>
The operation of the authority can continue if one or 
two assembly members happen to be ill or away. The 
executive actions will not come to a grinding halt. That is 
not the case with the mayor, a point that we will debate 
later. However, the authority will not lack the ability to 
do its job if one or two assembly members are away.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members will not oppose the clause, 
but we should like to probe Ministers on their reasons for 
borrowing local government provisions.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> If I understood correctly the 
contributions of the hon. Members for Ruislip-Northwood 
and for Kingston and Surbiton, there seems to be a 
meeting of minds on the clause. It provides for the 
disqualification of an assembly member who fails for a 
period of six months to attend meetings, and those 
meetings are also defined in the clause.
<P>
I am somewhat surprised that the hon. Member for 
Kingston and Surbiton dismisses the basis on which we 
have included the clause in the Bill namely, that its 
provisions already apply to local authorities under the 
Local Government Act 1972. There is nothing, surely, that 
precludes the introduction of such a proviso from such a 
source, given, as we have already established, the unique 
nature of the Bill. There is very little virtue in reinventing 
the wheel if the wheel, in this instance, has been shown 
to work.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood welcomed 
the exemptions afforded to members of the assembly if 
their duties are such at a time of national emergency that 
they have to be absent. No one would argue with that. As 
he pointed out, such people are, in a sense, giving twice 
as far as public service to their community is concerned.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was somewhat anxious that there 
could have been a dual responsibility for members of the 
assembly by virtue of being either Members of the 
European Parliament or, indeed, of this place. I was not 
aware that Members of this place who are already 
representatives of the European Parliament could 
justifiably be argued to be failing their constituents either 
in this place or in the larger European constituency. The 
hon. Gentleman touched on the dual responsibilities that 
will come into being with regard to the Scottish 
Parliament, as well as the devolved Assemblies in Wales 
and Northern Ireland. It is right to underline the 
importance of these proposals and the commitment on the 
part of those who present themselves for election, but it 
should not be possible for such responsibilities to be 
treated lightly, and that is why the clause is in the Bill.
<P>
The contribution of the hon. Member for Kingston and 
Surbiton, which tended to focus on the high-profile nature 
of members of the assembly, went against his own 
argument. This particular form of city-wide government, 
innovative as it is, will be the focus of interest not only 
in London but around the world and clearly those 
members of the assembly who are sent to perform their 
functions for and on behalf of the people of London, and 
who are aware of the high-profile nature of their position, 
would be extremely chary of not fulfilling those duties to 
the extent allowed by their time and abilities.
<BR>



<P>
Time will move on, however, and once the assembly 
has been in place for some time, its unique nature will not 
necessarily be as newsworthy as it is at the moment and as 
it will be when it first comes into being. The Government 
therefore believe that the Bill should contain a safeguard 
to ensure that people returned to the assembly many 
decades from now will take their responsibilities as 
seriously as those who will elected for the first time next 
year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for 
Kingston and Surbiton said, the clause is lifted form 
previous legislation, which is perfectly legitimate. The 
Bill does not contain one aspect of that legislation, 
however, regarding local authorities. Local authorities and 
councils can grant extensions for a member coming up to 
the end of a six-month period, which will delay 
disqualification. Local authorities may use the provision 
in rare circumstances, such as when an elected member 
has a severe illness. I may have missed such a provision 
in the Bill, and I should be grateful if the Minister would 
point it out.

<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I understand that the matter is dealt with 
in subsection (2). The Bill recognises compassionate 
grounds for absence. The hon. Gentleman mentioned 
absence that is caused by the illness of an assembly 
member or his or her family, within the wider 
circumference of care and concern. I have little doubt that 
the assembly would be cognisant of such factors, and that 
it would exercise compassion in the manner specified.

Clauses 7 and 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Date of casual vacancies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in 
page 6, line 22, leave out from `shall' to end of line 26 
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"give public notice of any casual vacancy among the Assembly 
members, and shall convey such notice in writing to the Greater 
London returning officer"	.
<P>
The amendment is much simpler than the previous one. 
The Bill denies the public notice of a vacancy among 
London members. Even if the next name on the party list 
were to fill the vacancy, public notice would be desirable. 
Such notice would also be important when a vacancy 
remains unfilled, or when a London-wide poll occurs. If 
a vacancy arises, there should be a public dissemination 
of the information. That is what the amendment seeks to 
achieve.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendment would extend the 
provision of the Bill by giving public notice of assembly 
vacancies, including notice of London member vacancies 
as well as constituency member vacancies. The 
amendment is logical only if considered in the context of 
the hon. Gentleman's proposed new clause 8, which 
would provide for by-elections to be held to fill two or 
more vacancies created by the departure of list members. 
When a by-election is to be held, it is entirely appropriate 
that public notice should be given of a vacancy as a proper 
part of the electoral process.
<P>
As we shall discuss later, the Government do not accept 
the hon. Gentleman's case for by-elections to fill London 
member vacancies, and so we believe that the amendment 
is unnecessary. if a vacancy arises in a constituency seat, 
the proper officer of the authority must give public notice 
of the vacancy as required by subsection (2) (b). That is 
right and proper as part of the process of informing the 
public of an impending election to fill that vacancy. 
However, vacancies in London member seats will be 
filled not by election but by a process in which the 
returning officer ascertains, in consultation with the 
appropriate party officials, which person from a party list 
is to fill the vacancy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Has the Minister given any thought to what 
will happen if, in admittedly unlikely but not impossible 
circumstance,s the list becomes exhausted? Because of 
death, resignation or other mishaps, a party may have 
worked its way right through the list so that there is no 
one left to be appointed in the way that the Minister has 
just described. Would that not provide both a problem 
and an opportunity, perhaps giving rise to the by-election 
opportunity that my hon. Friend is reaching for?
<BR>



<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hypothetical situation that may 
arise when a party's list is entirely exhausted could well 
occur in the case of the right hon. Gentleman's party, 
which seems to be losing members, particularly in the 
European Parliament, at a rate of knots. The Conservative 
party will doubtless soon have no Members of the 
European Parliament because of defections.
<P>
However, I have no doubt that in the case of the Greater 
London assembly the situation will be different. A 
provision exists for the creation of lists. The electorate 
will vote and, proportionally to that vote, seats will be 
allocated from those lists and there will be reserve 
members. Unless there were to be an extraordinary large 
number of people defecting from their parties, as has been 
the case with the Conservative party in Europe, it is 
extremely unlikely that the situation that the right hon. 
Gentleman has envisaged will occur.
<P>
In any case, the Government do not propose elections 
to fill London vacancies. We envisage that those 
vacancies will be filled by the next person on the list until 
that is exhausted. By the end of that process, I am sure 
that it will be almost time for the next general election 
and further members will be elected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I must press the Minister. He is asking the 
Committee to take a leap of faith to believe that what I 
have suggested is so unlikely or impossible that there need 
be no provision for it. Let me try again. Suppose that the 
Minister's party were to win a landslide election victory 
in London of the kind that occurred in May 1997, and that 
the vast majority of members elected were therefore from 
the Labour party. Let us then suppose that a considerable 
number of those members were to resign or that an 
aeroplane were to fall out of the skies onto them on their 
way to a cushy delegation of some kind. The Minister 
owes it to the Committee to say nothing of the people 
of London to say how he envisages that assembly being 
properly filled with representative members in the event 
that a list, of whatever party, is exhausted. That is not a 
trick question or an unfair question. It is perfectly 
reasonable, and we are entitled to a proper answer from 
the Minister other than, "Trust me, it won't happen."	
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman says that it 
is not a trick question, and I accept that it is perfectly fair. 
However, the answer that I have given is also perfectly 
fair and proper. If there were a landslide in an election, it 
is likely that the party benefiting from it would have a 
substantial number of constituency members elected. Let 
us assume that a party wins eight of the 14 constituency 
seats and is entitled to an extra four or five on the list. 
That would mean a landslide proportion of the votes going 
to that party. Four or five of the places from the list of up 
to 25 members would have been taken. It is extraordinary 
to envisage a situation in which 20 members subsequently 
disappear from the list, so that there is therefore no one 
left on the list to fill the vacancies. That is the reality that 
the right hon. Gentleman clearly has not grasped, and that 
is why his intervention is not appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> May I develop that point further? There 
may be other situations in which the party that has been 
successful in securing a large number of list members may 
find that they have only a small number of people left and 
that the majority of those may have already chosen to 
decline the invitation to fill a seat because they have been 
elected to another institution or found something else to 
do with their lives. In that case, the Minister would have 
a problem if the list were exhausted. How do the 
Government intend to deal with that?
<BR>



<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman described a 
situation in which a party's membership is decimated. 
Given that the total number of list members who can be 
elected is 11, it is extremely unlikely that any one party 
will receive an overwhelmingly large proportion of that 
number. Furthermore, as there is provision for 25 
members on the list, the idea that those numbers will be 
exhausted is very far-fetched.
<P>
Any party that puts forward 25 members for its list, 
which it is entitled to do, will have a boundless supply of 
replacement candidates to fill the vacancies. The 
circumstances envisaged by the hon. Gentleman are 
unlikely to arise. For those reasons, we do not believe that 
the amendment is appropriate. We shall debate such issues 
further when we reach the relevant new clause, which has 
been tabled by the Opposition. It is not right for provision 
to be made for elections to fill London seat vacancies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> As I have explained, I am new to the 
House and I do not fully understand the Minister's 
argument. Is he saying that, because the situation that we 
are discussing is unlikely to arise, no provision should be 
made for it? If it did occur, however unlikely that may 
be, the Bill would be inadequate, because it contains no 
provision to deal with it.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Raynsford: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman 
understands that if we were obsessed with providing for 
every possible eventuality, we could end up with a much 
larger Bill. We are making provision for all reasonable 
eventualities and we have made it clear that, with 
provision for up to 25 members on the list, and no 
mathematical possibility of any party having more than 11 
of those list members elected, in fact no party is likely to 
have more than six or seven members on its list elected 
there will be a boundless supply of reserve candidates. 
Therefore it is not necessary to hold elections to fill 
vacancies on the list.
<BR>



<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Does not the debate exemplify yet 
again the grave deficiencies in the alternative member 
system? It has emphasised the distinction between 
assembly men, as we now know them to be, and London 
members. I thought that they were all part of the same 
assembly, not that different nomenclature would be 
required. If an assembly man dies or has to be replaced, 
the people of London will face a by-election, but if a 
London member has to withdraw from the assembly for 
any reason, the next person on the list will replace him, 
if available to do so.
<P>
By-elections reflect the actual state of political opinion 
in the capital, but moving people up the list would not. 
Political opinion can shift greatly over a four-year term, 
and an unrepresentative person could be elected as a 
London member by virtue of simply moving up the list if 
a vacancy was created. That is wholly undemocratic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> People on the list would have had 
their names put on that list at the time of the previous 
election, and details would have been published by their 
respective parties. The fact that there may have been a 
subsequent change in public opinion would not invalidate 
their position on the list. If someone is the next one on 
the list to fill a vacancy, it is reasonable for him to do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> The debate reminds me of the most 
extreme London election that has ever taken place in 
1967, when the Labour party was almost wiped out. There 
was a complete imbalance in the votes. The Conservatives 
had about 55 per cent. of the vote, while Labour received 
about 35 per cent. Under the electoral system that we are 
discussing, the Conservatives would have won 21 of the 
directly elected seats. No, they would have ended up with 
21 seats to four; no, 10 seats to hang on, I will come 
back in a moment.
<BR>



<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall respond briefly to my hon. 
Friend. The mathematics that I was trying to explain I 
accept my hon. Friend's point that perhaps I did not do 
so sufficiently clearly is that given the 14 constituency 
seats, a party that has done exceptionally well may win 
the majority vote, and could win 12 seats or even more. 
In such a situation, it would be unlikely to qualify for 
more than a tiny number of additional top-up seats. That 
was what I was trying to put across when I said that a 
party that benefited from a landslide would not have its 
list denuded; it would probably retain 20 or so members 
on that list.
<P>
On the issue of nomenclature, I should say, for the sake 
of the hon. Member for Uxbridge I apologise, it was the 
hon. Member for Ruislip, North who raised the matter that 
all members are referred to as assembly members. Those 
from the list are known as London members and those 
elected from constituencies are known as constituency 
members. They are all described as assembly members; 
some are London assembly members and others 
constituency assembly members. I hope that that is clear.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> As the hon. Member for Brent, East and 
I are both members of the Select Committee on Northern 
Ireland Affairs, I feel that it is incumbent on me to come 
to his assistance and give him time to work out his 
calculations.
<P>
In response to an intervention by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Uxbridge, the Minister relied heavily on the 
law of reason. Does he recall the definition of an act of 
God in Blackstone's law dictionary as an act that no 
reasonable man would expect God to commit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Yes, I am familiar with that. As the 
right hon. Gentleman will know, the legal profession has 
for many years sought to use every possible eventuality 
to enable them to pen ever more obscure clauses to 
legislation, which has earned them a good living and 
created longer and longer legislation.
<P>
We seek to put in place procedures that respond to all 
normal, reasonable circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Having located my basic error, I can 
now say that had the 1967 election taken place under the 
proposed new arrangements, the Conservative party 
would have had nine of their 11 members in reserve and 
the Labour party would have had four or five. So many 
vacancies would not arise during the four-year term of an 
assembly of just 25 members. It would be more 
appropriate to worry about what the Government are 
doing to protect the assembly from being struck by a small 
passing meteorite.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. 
As I do not envisage circumstances in which a small 
passing meteorite will affect the assembly, I hope that the 
Committee will accept the logic of our position and agree 
that clause 7 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This is a debate on amendment
No. 135 to clause 9, not on whether clause 7 should stand 
part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> As often happens, the points that have 
been made have strayed wider than is justified by the 
words in the amendment. The Liberal Democrat members 
of the Committee do not support the amendment because 
it would not give Londoners who voted for a list the 
confidence that any member who left the assembly would 
be replaced by the next person on the list.
<P>
However, the debate has raised an important issue 
albeit one that is subject to statistical probabilities of the 
sort raised by the hon. Member for Brent, East and one 
that requires the Government to reflect further. That is, 
what would happen in the admittedly unlikely event of 
the list being exhausted because those still left on the list 
chose not to take up a place, or because of the decease of 
several members or the occurrence of the other 
eventualities about which hon. Members have speculated? 
I urge the Government to reflect on the matter as we 
approach Report stage, because such a provision should 
be included in the Bill, and not dealt with through panic 
measures when the event occurs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This modest amendment has led us from 
Northern Ireland, through acts of God, to the idea of the 
Conservatives winning 55 per cent. of votes cast at an 
election.
<BR>






<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Jim Dowd (Lord Commissioner to the 
Treasury): An act of God?
<P>
<B>Me. Ottaway:</B> Perhaps, as the Government Whip says, 
an act of God. We also had a useful intervention by the 
Minister asking that a completely different clause stand 
part of the Bill.
<P>
I suspect that debate will focus on the amendments 
tabled in my name to clause 11, which will be interesting, 
although we may not reach the amendments until 
Thursday. However, the modest amendment before us 
raises a fundamental point: notification of a vacancy 
should be given to the greater public. We shall therefore 
divide the Committee.
<P>
Question put, That the amendment be made: 
<P>
The Committee divided: Ayes 6, Noes 21.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee 
long; I merely seek clarification from the Minister on the 
wording of subsection (1)(b):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in the case of non-acceptance of office by any person who is 
required to make and deliver a declaration of acceptance of office"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does that mean? Will assembly members, be they 
constituency members or London Members, be required 
to declare an oath of loyalty to the Crown, for example, 
or will some other declaration be required? The 
subsection refers to a subsequent part of the Bill, which I 
have not been able to find. Before the Committee moves 
on to subsequent clauses, will the Minister explain the 
cross-reference to the later part of the Bill, and what it 
means in respect of potential non-acceptance of office 
occasioned by a person's not having made the 
appropriate declaration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that I can satisfy the hon. 
Gentleman's curiosity. All right hon. and hon. Members 
and those with experience of local government will be 
familiar with the reference to the case of a person not 
making the declaration of acceptance of office. It is a 
simple process that takes place immediately after the 
election and before the member takes up his or her 
position, whereby the elected member accepts the office 
that has been bestowed on him or her by the electorate. 
We carry out such procedure in the House in one way, 
while local government does it in a different way.
<P>
The principle of acceptance of office is fundamental. If 
an individual does not accept office, he or she clearly 
cannot serve, and a certain procedure comes into play. 
There are no special circumstances that relate to particular 
oaths required. It is a normal procedure to safeguard the 
proper workings of the democratic process. I assure the 
hon. Gentleman that we shall discuss the later reference 
to the position when we discuss clause 23.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Wilkinson: But no oath of allegiance under the 
Crown?
