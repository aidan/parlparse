							<a name="08022898000310"></a>The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):
						</b> Welcome to the Chair,
Mrs. Humble. I was addressing a question from the hon.
Member for Cheltenham. The rate of compliance for the renewables
obligation between 2005-06 and 2006-07 raised a query in his mind about
the delivery of less generation. However, that is a technical one-off
effect of the tightening of the cap on co-firing. It will be rectified
by the reforms that we propose to introduce through the Bill. We are
making the RO more efficient and effective, thereby driving faster and
wider deployment. If he would like a more technical explanation, I am
happy to give him one in writing if that would be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08022898000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022898000311"></a>
							<b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): I am grateful for the
Minister&#146;s response. I was not aware of that effect. If it is
the true explanation for the shortfall this year and it is a one-off
effect, that is encouraging, but I would not mind, as well as the
technical explanation that he has promised me, an analysis of the
percentages over the past five years or for as long as the renewables
obligation has been in existence, so that we can establish whether
there is a trend.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>
					<a name="08022898000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000312"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I wonder whether one issue in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s mind is that there is something known as headroom in
the renewables obligation, so we are always setting a percentage figure
somewhat higher than where we actually are. That is how we incentivise
people to come forward with investment, but I am happy to supply any
other information that I can to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="08022898000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northavon, who is not here this afternoon, referred to
&#147;Rock Around the Clock&#148;&#151;I think that we have had
the last of those jokes now. He was the second speaker on the Liberal
Benches this morning, so he was very much the Comets to the hon. Member
for Cheltenham&#146;s Bill Haley.</div>
					<a name="08022898000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Northavon
asked what the criteria were for establishing the bands. Bands were set
on the basis of criteria in proposed new section 32D(4) of the
Electricity Act 1989. In particular, the cost data came from a study by
Ernst and Young, but we also took into account other criteria,
including the cost to consumers. We have also paid heed to the results
of our recent consultations on proposals, which supported a limited
number of bands. Consultation has led to some minor changes to the
bands to which he
referred.</div>
					<a name="08022898000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000313"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for
Northavon, who apologises for not being present this afternoon, will be
grateful for the information that the Minister has given, and I am sure
that the consultation was right about having a relatively simple
framework of bands. That is obviously desirable, but is the study by
Ernst and Young in the public domain? If so, can it be supplied to all
members of the
Committee?</div>
					<a name="08022898000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000314"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I am advised that the study is in the public
domain. I will ensure that, in the most practical way, it is available
to members of the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08022898000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon also asked whether a European super-grid was
a good idea. Given the development of offshore wind in a number of
member states and the European target for 20 per cent. of all our
energy to come from renewables by 2020, a super-grid is an interesting
long-term idea. Obviously, it raises a range of regulatory and other
issues. I have personally discussed those ideas with Mr.
Adamowitsch, who is the EU offshore wind co-ordinator. I can see why
the hon. Gentleman might smile at the idea of Brussels having such a
co-ordinator, but Mr. Adamowitsch is a distinguished former
Energy Minister from Germany. He visited the UK last year and we
discussed those matters.</div>
					<a name="08022898000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the offshore
transmission regime, which we will discuss next, is to enable
transmission of the significant amounts of electricity generated from
offshore renewables in offshore waters&#151;offshore wind, but
potentially also wave and tidal&#151;to the Great Britain grid, to
meet our renewable energy targets.</div>
					<a name="08022898000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022898000315"></a>
							<b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): I am fascinated by the mention of
Mr. Adamowitsch. Only the Germans could
try to co-ordinate wind; it is a fascinating challenge. Will the
Minister clarify how the super-grid will be considered? If the area
where the wind energy was generated was part of British territorial
waters, but the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>energy happened to be used in Denmark or Holland, for example, would it
count as part of their renewable quota or as part of our renewable
commitment?</div>
					<a name="08022898000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000316"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I cannot give a definitive answer, as this is just
a pipe dream at the moment&#151;or a wind dream. No doubt, those
questions would have to be considered. At present, there is debate
about what counts towards hitting the 2020 European target. I hope that
if there was a super-grid, which would no doubt sometimes be sending
electricity one way and sometimes another way, we would come to some
sensible arrangement about how it was chalked against the different
national targets. I assume, although I do not want to suggest that this
is the definitive answer, that if electricity came from a wind farm in
British territorial waters it would count against our own target, but
it is too early to make a judgment about
that.</div>

							<a name="08022898000319"></a>Dr.

that my constituency is largely powered by French electricity because
we buy it from French generators. How do they take account of energy

England?</div>

I take refuge on the island of Alderney, one of the Channel Islands. My
wife is a native of the island, which has ambitious plans for tidal
power. My way of relaxing away from the UK is to discuss tidal power
with the people of Alderney. I mention that because of another little
complexity: as every schoolgirl knows, the Channel Islands are not part
of the United Kingdom and are actually not part of the European

						</b> I am not interested in swapping holiday stories
with the Minister, but I am interested in whether he can give us some
more clarity about the exporting issue. When we discussed it this
morning, he said in relation to renewables obligation certificates that
if the energy was generated in the UK and sold to a company in the UK,
it could be exported through the interconnector to France or wherever.
Through the super-grid that would not necessarily be possible, because
it would be sold directly from the super-grid to a country abroad. I
realise that he may not have the answer now, but I know that he is
promising to send me a tome, or a long letter, so perhaps the
information could be included. In the responses we have had from the
Minister there is a lack of clarity about how the process would
work.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000329"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> To be fair, electricity from various sources will
go into the grid, and some may then go to another country, but we
cannot colour the electricity from renewables green and trace it. We
certainly need to work through the issues that the hon. Gentleman
raises, but we cannot track renewable electricity electrons through the
system, which is why we have renewables obligation certificates to help
track renewable electricity. We should not get too insular about it,
however, because we are signed up to a Europe-wide target. At the end
of the day, the objective is that Europe should hit its renewables
target, and we no doubt need to work together in all sorts of ways to
achieve that.</div>
					<a name="08022898000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
three new clauses before us, which have been moved by Labour Members,
Liberal Democrat Members and Conservative Members respectively.
Although they all focus on renewables, they focus particularly on
microgeneration and the virtues of a feed-in tariff system, and I shall
now address those issues.</div>
					<a name="08022898000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context of the EU 2020
renewable energy target, the issue of how we increase the deployment of
renewable energy has become ever more urgent, as these debates have
shown. We certainly recognise that the issue represents a major
challenge, and work has already begun to identify the actions and
measures that will help us to achieve our share of the EU target. There
is no doubt that we will need significant deployment of different
renewables and generating stations of all sizes, from large offshore
wind farms, such as the future London Array, which we expect to be the
world&#146;s largest wind farm, at 1 GW, to smaller, local
generation, which can be below 10 kW.</div>
					<a name="08022898000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 14 would introduce a
feed-in tariff for  all sizes of energy generation. Feed-in
tariffs are sometimes presented as a kind of magic bullet that will
solve the real or imagined problems of the renewables industry. I do
not believe that is true, and accepting the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div>new clause at such a crucial point in the development of the renewables
obligation would send entirely the wrong message to industry. It could
damage investor confidence and result in significant delay to projects
coming online.</div>
					<a name="08022898000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the debate about the
rights and wrongs of any support mechanism, we must not overlook the
success of the renewables obligation so far. Renewable generation has
almost trebled since its introduction in 2002, and the reforms in the
Bill will triple it again by 2015. However, the delivery of more
capacity is not simply a matter of the financial support mechanism; a
broad range of factors is at play&#151;not least the planning
system&#151;and we are working hard to address them all.</div>
					<a name="08022898000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also be careful when
making comparisons with other countries. Most continental feed-in
tariffs operate on the basis that there is a vertically integrated
network operator that can be obliged to offer a tariff. That, of
course, is not the case in the UK, where suppliers are separate from
the network operators. That separation allows suppliers to choose where
they buy their energy, which in turn drives efficiency and innovation.
That does not fit well with a more rigid system in which the
Government, in essence, fix the price. Simply imposing on suppliers an
obligation to pay a tariff will not guarantee that we have an effective
support mechanism for the UK market.</div>
					<a name="08022898000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">People sometimes talk about
feed-in tariffs as though they were cost-free, but that is simply not
the case. As with any support system, there are cost implications. In
2007, the International Energy Agency published estimates for Germany.
Between 2000 and 2012, the German feed-in tariff regime will result in
payments of €68 billion, of which between €30 billion and
€36 billion will be the additional costs of renewables. By 2012,
the annual cost will be between €8 billion and €9.5
billion. Solar photovoltaics will provide 4.5 per cent. of
Germany&#146;s renewable electricity, while taking 20 per cent. of
total payments. Those important figures should enter our debate, which
is why I asked the hon. Member for Cheltenham whether he had any
financial information for us. Such things need to be factored
in.</div>

Horwood:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The Minister raises important questions
about public practice and how the system would work in a liberalised
energy market such as we have. They are perfectly fair points. However,
none of the new clauses oblige the Government to replace the renewables
obligation wholesale with a feed-in tariff system tomorrow. The kind of
costs he mentioned for the established system in Germany&#151;a
rather larger country&#151;do not apply in this case. This is about
enabling powers to allow him, through two of the new clauses, to
introduce feed-in tariffs aimed at decentralised energy and
microgeneration initially on a much more modest scale and cost to the
public finances. He is being a little unfair in citing those
numbers.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000331"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Of course, I am coming to that. I make those points
because part of the naivety of the debate&#151;not necessarily in
Committee but generally&#151;  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>somehow suggests, &#147;Britain bad, Germany good: good old feed-in
tariffs&#148;. However, everyone would recognise that the costs that
I have cited are very considerable.</div>
					<a name="08022898000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the debate about energy
policy in Britain is to inform the public and ourselves that, at a time
of rising global energy prices, we are now, perfectly properly, adding
to those prices because of the environmental measures that we take.
That could be at European level through the emissions trading scheme or
through renewables obligations and so on. We must look at the price
impact on the customer&#151;something that is often not done during
the debate. A feed-in tariff regime underestimates the costs of
renewables. Unlike the RO, a feed-in tariff regime covers only the
costs of the generator and it imposes other costs on the electricity
supply chain&#151;for the use of a network, for example, and for
balancing the variable nature of some renewable generation. Those
become hidden subsidies in the feed-in tariff regime, which will be
passed through to consumers. The RO allows the market to take account
of those costs in contracting with renewables generators.</div>
					<a name="08022898000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 14 does not, on my
understanding, remove the RO. It seems to envisage a situation in which
the RO continues to run alongside a new regime. Before we decide to
introduce any additional incentives for renewables, we must carefully
consider how those schemes would interact. That will be a key element
of our analysis in developing a strategy for the EU 2020 target.
However, it is by no means a given that a Government-set tariff is the
best approach. For example, people often claim that a feed-in tariff
provides a more predictable support mechanism. We understand that the
German Government recently announced that they would be reducing the
level of the feed-in tariff for solar photovoltaics in Germany by
around &#163;120 per megawatt-hour. That was after the subsidy had
already been reduced by around 50 per cent. over the past 10
years.</div>

Horwood:
						</b> No, on the specific issue of the adjustments to
the German system. On further investigation, the Minister might find
that those changes were grandfathered so that new entrants were earning
the lower rate of the feed-in tariff. More importantly, they are a
measure of the success of the German photovoltaic industry because they
reflect a lesser need to subsidise the expanding and successful solar
industry. Therefore, they are a measure of the success of feed-in
tariffs, not a weakness.</div>

forward, it is good to be as specific as possible, so that new
investors can do their arithmetic properly for the
investment.</div>
					<a name="08022898000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of
the arguments for why we should not introduce a feed-in tariff in the
Bill also apply to new clauses 6 and 8. I will not reiterate the
points, but since the new clauses are more specific and seek a power
permitting the introduction of a feed-in tariff for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div>microgeneration and decentralised energy, I hope that the Committee will
bear with me if I make two additional points.</div>
					<a name="08022898000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we are clear that
microgeneration has an important role to play in our renewable energy
mix. That is clear from what I have already said. Our commitment is
proven by the focus and support that the Government have given to
microgeneration. In 2006, we saw our first-ever published
microgeneration strategy. We have made &#163;86 million available in
capital grants in the low-carbon building programme to reduce the cost
of buying and installing equipment. We have provided independent
certification of products and services, and a route for complaints with
the microgeneration certification scheme. This spring, we shall remove
the need for planning permission for most domestic installations that
have little or no impact beyond the host property. My hon. Friend the
Member for Southampton, Test focused, in part, on that in his
speech.</div>
					<a name="08022898000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
all. Proposals in the Bill will enable the Secretary of State through
the order to allow microgenerators to double the number of ROCs that
they can receive at present. That is a significant advance. We have
already taken steps to simplify the process for microgenerators under
the RO, including allowing them to make annual claims for ROCs and
simplifying the accreditation forms. We shall continue to simplify the
access of microgenerators to, and benefit from, the
RO.</div>
					<a name="08022898000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the most
recent changes that we made last April, the number of microgenerators
accredited under the RO has increased by 250 per cent. For example, I
am especially pleased that Ofgem will shortly be making an online
accreditation system available that will make accreditation to the RO
easier. The significant amount that the Government have already done,
or have in train, demonstrates our commitment to the growth of
microgeneration.</div>
					<a name="08022898000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point, however, is that, although we remain convinced of the
benefits of microgeneration and its potential role, against the
background of rising energy prices and the inevitably constrained
resources available in the economy to tackle climate change, we are
also conscious of the fact that microgeneration is more expensive than
a number of other large-scale forms of renewables. That is inevitable,
given the state of that technology. Therefore, any decision that we
take in the context of further support for microgeneration needs to be
balanced carefully against whether additional resources might be more
cost-effectively targeted at other forms of renewables. Such options
could include renewable heat, which can be cost-effective for
households that are not connected to the gas grid. Members of the
Committee might like to note that most of the estimated 100,000
microgenerators in the United Kingdom are reusing renewable heat
technologies.</div>
					<a name="08022898000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">For all
those reasons, when giving evidence to the Committee on Tuesday 19

Wicks:
						</b> Indeed. I was grateful for the opportunity to
announce that, as part of the renewal energy strategy consultation that
my Department will conduct in the summer, we will include consideration
of the role of microgeneration and distributed energy going forward.
That will include looking at other support options, such as feed-in
tariffs. All those arguments strengthen my view that it is premature to
amend the Bill with the powers under the new clauses in advance of the
work on the renewable energy strategy and the consultation in the
summer. It is not until we have completed that work that we should
consider whether additional legislation is necessary and, if so, of
what
type.</div>
					<a name="08022898000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reiterate my support for microgeneration, notwithstanding some of the
issues that I have raised, not least because it enables the citizen to
take action against global warming. We often debate climate change and
renewables in terms of big institutions, such as Ofgem, the European
Union and member states, and talk about big programmes, but there is
growing concern among most of our citizens that we are part of the
problem of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions in respect of our dwellings. More
and more constituents want to become part of the solution. There are
different ways in which they can do that, but one is if we can
facilitate the development of
microgeneration.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000338"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> The Minister&#146;s remarks
were perhaps influenced by a traditional civil service approach, but he
was rather like a man building a monumental castle with lots of
ramparts in defence of current policy and then opening a little back
door to enable us to discuss feed-in tariffs during the consultation in
the summer. Having said that, it is very welcome that the Government
are to include feed-in tariffs in that consultation. I would like to
put on record my appreciation to the Minister for that
concession.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000339"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I join the hon. Member for Cheltenham in saying we
are pleased that the Minister is to consult formally on this issue, but
that has to be tinged with disappointment that he is not prepared to go
further.</div>
					<a name="08022898000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, new clause 6 simply gives the Secretary of State a power
to introduce feed-in tariffs at some time in the
future. It does not require him to do so; it does not specify how.
Looking at the time scale, the consultation process will start later in
the year. One assumes that will run for some months and that there will
be a further few months while the responses are evaluated before the
Minister comes back to the House to give a statement. If at that
point&#151;we are looking at the middle of next year&#151;the
Government decide that feed-in tariffs are the right way forward, we
then have to find a slot in the legislation programme, presumably in
the following Session. So realistically we are looking at two years
before feed-in tariffs could be on the statute book. That is an
appallingly unsatisfactory delay.</div>
					<a name="08022898000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government are to decide
relatively soon following this consultation process to go down the
route of feed-in tariffs&#151;and I hope they do, especially for
microgeneration&#151;it would make sense to have the enabling clause
in this Bill so that they can immediately lay the measures for how they
are going to do that before Parliament in secondary legislation. This
is an opportunity to take a year of delay out of that process. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div>
					</div>
					<a name="08022898000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the
contributions we have had have emphasised that time is not on our side.
We know we are lagging behind others in microgeneration. All of us, I
believe, want to see a step change in the approach we are taking
towards that. Indeed, we put forward a document just before Christmas
on microgeneration&#151;I imagine it was on the Minister&#146;s
wife&#146;s Christmas list for him to read while they were in the
Channel Islands. We talk about how one makes every home a generator;
how one encourages more people to go down the route of photovoltaics;
how one stimulates an incredible change in the culture of this country
towards electricity generation.</div>
					<a name="08022898000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment, there is
enormous enthusiasm but confusion among the public. They want to do
more but they do not know how to. The ROC system is part of that
confusion. Feed-in tariffs would give much greater clarity, certainty
and predictability. We have not had a single witness who did not agree
with that&#151;apart from the Minister himself. Every other person,
in their written and oral submissions, said that they support the
inclusion of feed-in tariffs in the Bill. All we are looking for is the
capability to introduce this through secondary legislation in a shorter
time scale than would be required if we had to go again through the
whole process of primary legislation. We waited a long time for this
energy Bill and it would be very unfortunate if the Government passed
over this
opportunity.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> I was just thinking whether we had waited a long
time for the Energy Bill. I do not think we should apologise for the
fact that we have looked at energy strategy most carefully. We had the
energy review, which I led for the then Prime Minister. We then
consulted and had an energy White Paper. These are quite complex
issues.</div>
					<a name="08022898000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
loth to support any new clause that did not put us in the right place.
I have said that I am open to the argument. In terms of incentives for
microgenerators&#151;both the householder and perhaps the management
committee of the small community building, the church hall or
whatever&#151;we are not necessarily in the right place. I have
acknowledged that. I have detailed the things we have done and I think
we have done them quite well. We are not in the right place and I want
to see how we can get there. We are going to do that through our
strategy review.</div>
					<a name="08022898000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we legislate now, we could get to the wrong place. I said earlier that
we would look at feed-in tariffs but we will also look at other
mechanisms. There should be no theology about this. How do we enable
and facilitate microgeneration? That is the issue. I would be reluctant
to support a new clause now that might not be right. Through our
renewable energy strategy, which is looking at the whole of
renewables&#151;the macro as well as the micro&#151;we can work out
whether we need to do more, what the best mechanism is and how we
should proceed then.</div>

Jamie Reed</b> (Copeland) (Lab): Energy policy cannot exist in
a bubble or in a vacuum. We are now discussing energy policy in the
context of climate change and security of supply, but we also need to
discuss it in the context of its social consequences and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div>impacts, not least energy costs to the consumer. The witnesses we heard
during our evidence sessions were asked, by me and I am sure by other
Members on a number of occasions, what they believed the consequences
of feed-in tariffs would be on what one might ordinarily describe as
working class people. They were asked if this issue was a middle class
obsession and if they had concerns about the effects of feed-in tariffs
upon energy consumers at the poorer end of the social strata. Before
the Minister finishes his speech, can he address that issue because we
do not exactly know the answers? That is another good reason for us not
rushing headlong into the feed-in tariff culture, as proposed in the
new clauses here today.</div>

that I am always concerned when we have systems that mean the poor pay
more for energy, albeit inadvertently, and that is true for food as
well in many respects. Better-off people with bank accounts and credit
can often pay less for energy. When we move forward with a potential
support system, we have to be careful that we are mindful of the
factors that my hon. Friend raises. I am bound to say that, in my
Department, we are considering how we can bring the worlds of
microgeneration and our concerns about fuel poverty together. That is a
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs responsibility, but
we developed the energy efficiency commitment into what will now be
called CERT&#151;the carbon emissions reduction target&#151;and it
will now include a microgeneration element. At the moment, I am looking
to see whether we might do more through our low-carbon building
programme to tackle fuel poverty. That is sensible and it addresses the
socio-economic issues that my hon. Friend raises. If we can use new
technologies to tackle old social evils such as fuel poverty, we begin
to get to the right place.</div>

interesting. It is unfortunate for many of us that the Bill will not
give us the opportunity to talk about fuel poverty. Indeed, the
amendments that Conservative Members have tabled on fuel poverty and
those on social tariffs by Labour Members have been ruled out of order
because of the way that the Bill has been defined. That is unfortunate.
Will the Minister agree to see whether he can come back on Report with
a clause that would try to achieve what we are seeking? In other words,
that is a clause that would create a permissive environment so that he
could introduce feed-in tariffs through secondary legislation at an
early stage. If it was deemed, as a result of the consultation process,
that that was the right way forward, the tariffs could be brought in
earlier than if they had to go through primary
legislation.</div>

I will not go as far as the hon. Gentleman is tempting me to go, for
the reasons that I have established about our need to develop a
sensible strategy. It is too soon to say whether other recommendations
in that strategy will require future legislation, but I suppose that it
is possible. There could therefore be future legislative opportunities.
For the reasons that I have indicated, I do not think that I can

have figures that photovoltaic systems cost around 30p per kW hour at

legislation, or whether there is, as Opposition Members feel there is,
a question of a requirement for yet more primary legislation and
delays? After all, we have had endless energy reviews and Select
Committee reports on renewable
energy.</div>

for the measure, and overwhelming support within the industry and

the pamphlet that I referred to, which discussed how the proposal would
be paid for. It would be paid for out of the auctioning of the EU
emissions trading scheme. That would provide a phenomenal amount of
money, which the Government could use to pay for feed-in tariffs. It
would not require any taxation increases or charges elsewhere. A sum of
money exists that has not yet been allocated, so it cannot be a
spending commitment that the Chancellor would want to take into account
in trying to hold us to account.</div>

</div>
					<a name="08022898000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the funding point,
is the hon. Gentleman confident that his proposal will have no negative
effect at all on those poorer people who struggle with their energy

irrelevance?</div>

							<a name="08022898000355"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point is wrong;
but to deal first with his first point, going down the route of
renewable energy will push up costs. Typically, of a &#163;1,000 bill
at the moment &#163;80&#151;8 per cent.&#151;is related to the EU
emissions trading scheme, the carbon emissions reduction target and
other charges in relation to renewables policy. The consumer is already
paying more for that element, and one expects the cost to rise over
time. However, that does not mean that one should not be looking at
doing more to get energy from renewables.</div>
					<a name="08022898000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a separate issue,
however, which is what the Government feel they should be doing about
fuel poverty, and measures such as the winter fuel allowance and trying
to ensure that the people most likely to be in fuel poverty have the
means to pay the bills. One issue is an energy policy issue and one is
a benefits policy issue. Clearly they are both issues for the
Government, but one should not damn the desire to move towards
renewables because of concern that there will be costs that will not be
covered elsewhere. There is a responsibility to cover those costs
somewhere else.</div>
					<a name="08022898000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
answer to the second point is that we do not see any reason why people
in fuel poverty could not benefit from microgeneration. If a large
block of social housing had on its roof photovoltaic cells, providing
electricity for the people who lived in those properties, and a wind
turbine next to it, not only could they get their electricity from a
wonderfully green source, but there would be scope for putting the
excess&#151;over and above that which they need&#151;back into the
grid and they could then derive an income from
it.</div>

scale microgeneration can deliver not only revenue to communities from
the sale of electricity, but reduced fuel bills. The Carbon Trust is
already developing an important precedent for it in the partnership for
renewables initiative, which exactly illustrates the point that he very

point returns to the clause more generally. I have two concerns, one of
which relates to exports. We have not had a clear answer about the
issue from the Minister, but the Bill is quite clear. Proposed new
section 32B (3)
says:</div>
					<a name="08022898000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

					<a name="08022898000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) that the
generating station, or, in the case of a certificate issued otherwise
than to the operator of a generating station, a generating station
specified in the certificate, has generated from renewable sources the
amount of electricity stated in the certificate,

Britain (or the part of Great Britain stated in the
certificate).&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022898000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">From what
the Minister has said today, particularly about the super-grid, we do
not have clarity about the provision&#146;s meaning. The proposed new

the super-grid does not sell to customers in Great Britain, but exports
directly from British territorial waters to Denmark, Holland, Germany

for it? We must have greater clarity about the process than we have
received from the Minister so far. He, himself, was slightly confused
about how it might work, so I hope that during the course of this brief
intervention, the people who are scribbling furiously at the back may
be able to give us some initial guidance.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> Why does the hon. Gentleman need greater clarity
now? We do not have a super-grid; it is an idea. I think that it is a
great idea&#151;an interesting idea. The European Union thinks that
it is a good idea, it has asked former Minister Adamowitsch to examine
it and we have had preliminary talks. However, the hon. Gentleman talks
as if the grid is about to get up and running and as if it is a
critical issue that we need to know about by Tuesday. The same
situation has occurred once or twice during our debates, regarding
provisions that will not be introduced for many years.</div>
					<a name="08022898000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will not the hon. Gentleman, in
a kind moment, concede that we have time to think through the issues
rather than imply that, in the Bill, I must be absolutely precise about
the way in which some renewable electrons in Cheltenham sometimes find
their way to Prague? Is he, in asking me that question, being fair, or
is he, I suggest very kindly, being slightly
ridiculous?</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman will be very lucky to get an
admission that I am being slightly ridiculous; it would be an unusual
admission to make. I always seek to be kind, apart from on the
&#147;Today&#148; programme at seven minutes past 7 this morning,
when I was in a slightly different mode. There is an important issue
before us, however. We are making an Act of Parliament, a statute that
will exist for many years to come, and the provision potentially puts a
big hurdle in the way of the super-grid. I do not know whether
Airtricity, the company that is looking to develop it, has been
consulted on the issue, but if it will not be able to use the ROC
system for the generation of wind power offshore, which it would
directly export from British waters to Germany or somewhere else, there
is a potential flaw in the Bill and we are right to address it
now.</div>
					<a name="08022898000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister will tell me that Airtricity and others have been consulted
and are completely happy with the provision, in which case I am more
than happy to withdraw my concerns. If they are happy, we should be.
However, my fundamental concern is that there is a distinct lack of
clarity about what that aspect of the clause means, and I am simply
trying to get the Minister to give us greater
clarity.</div>

see its introduction as being some time ahead. However, in the context
of the European Union&#146;s 2020 target and the detailed discussions
that are now taking place between member states and the Commission, the
issue of what a nation state&#146;s target means and whether some
renewables might be generated in another European country if it were
more cost- effective is being discussed. Those issues are not entirely
dissimilar to this one. If and when there is a great grid of wind
farms&#151;perhaps tidal and wave&#151;we can address the
implications of that in a timely fashion. I will make sure that we
consider the matter as part of the renewable energy strategy that we

Wicks:
						</b> This clause makes two supplementary provisions to
the new RO sections of the Electricity Act 1989, as set out in clause
36. Subsection (1) aims to ensure timely delivery of a banded
renewables obligation. We have set ourselves a challenging timetable in
which to introduce our proposals to allow industry to take advantage of
the benefits of the RO as quickly as possible. That is particularly
important in the light of the EU proposals on renewables that were
published recently. Our aim is to bring forward the renewables
obligation order with the relevant change by April 2009, which was a
commitment we gave in the 2007 White Paper on
energy.</div>
					<a name="08022898000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The nub of the
point is this: to meet the timetable, it will be necessary to carry out
a consultation before the Bill has fully passed parliamentary scrutiny.
Subsection (1) allows us to consult on the draft renewables obligation
order before the Bill receives Royal Assent and to take account of the
responses to that consultation. The order will, of course, be subject
to further parliamentary scrutiny and will be debated in both Houses
before being passed.</div>
					<a name="08022898000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections (2) and (3) of the
clause allow consequential amendments to be made by order to references
in the Electricity Act 1989. The purpose of the provisions is to ensure
that, once the legislation has been passed and Northern Ireland makes
an order amending the Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 to reflect
the changes, references in the 1989 Act to the Northern Ireland order
can be changed to refer to the correct numbering. Subsection (2) allows
us to extend section 32K(2) to cover ROCs issued by the Northern 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>Ireland authority under the old regime so as to extend provisions
relating to the transition from the old regime to the new one in

						</b> Just a brief description&#151;the purpose of this
clause is to clarify the operation of section 67(1)(c) of the Utilities
Act 2000. The Secretary of State has the power to preserve, modify,
replace or otherwise deal with arrangements which relate to the
non-fossil fuel obligation, the original support mechanism for
renewable electricity before the RO was introduced. The non-fossil fuel
obligation, or NFFO arrangements, were put in place through orders made
under the original section 32 of the Electricity Act 1989. Under the
NFFO, electricity suppliers enter into fixed-term contracts with
generators for the purchase of renewable electricity. That ensures that
renewable generators get a specified price, as set out in the contract
for their renewable electricity. The last of those contracts runs up to
2018.</div>
					<a name="08022898000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2000 Act
replaced the NFFO regime with the RO and made provisions for the
continuance of NFFO contracts. In particular, section 67(1)(c) provided
a power whereby the original NFFO arrangements could be preserved,
modified, replaced or otherwise dealt with. The amendment to section
67(1)(c) clarifies that the Secretary of State has the requisite powers
to preserve, modify, replace or otherwise deal with arrangements which
have replaced original NFFO arrangements. I move that this clause stand

option of a unified approach to the RO across the UK. First, subsection
(1) allows the authority, Ofgem, to carry out work in administering the
RO on behalf of its opposite number in Northern Ireland, Ofreg. This is
the arrangement at present, which works well. The amendments made by
this clause ensure that the authority can continue to act on behalf of

reforms in Northern Ireland. The provisions in subsection (2) ensure
that the Northern Ireland authorities can pass an order under article
56 to take account of the amendments in this legislation as well as the
original sections of the Electricity Act 1989. It will enable the
operation of a UK-wide RO regime. While it maintains the requirement to
consult in the Province, the clause allows that consultation to be done

all parts of the UK. That will be the burden of our current discussions

towards an allocation in the range of five ROCs for wave power and
three for tidal power&#151;the Minister has been talking about
considerably less&#151;will he try to persuade the Scottish Executive
to reduce to what he wants, or will he persuade the rest of the United

time frame on when those discussions might reach some sort of

						</b> Those are discussions that we are having already. I
cannot quite predict the time frame. I am afraid that I am rather left
repeating myself: we would want a common regime. I do not want to say
at the moment that the Scottish Executive should reduce to what we
say&#151;we have to have a proper discussion about that. But I see
the advantages of uniformity. Ultimately, decisions on banding for
Scotland are for Scottish Ministers. We are working with the devolved

						</b> This takes us on to a new section of our
legislation, concerning offshore electricity transmission. Clearly,
given our discussion about the importance of offshore wind to our
renewables strategy&#151;and perhaps one day, hopefully, that of
marine energy, wave and tidal&#151;this is a significant and quite
technical part of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08022898000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are putting
in place a framework to encourage the development of electricity
generation from offshore. There are already plans to develop more than
8 GW of offshore wind in UK waters, and in December last year my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform announced draft plans for developing up to a further
25 GW of offshore
energy.</div>
					<a name="08022898000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK has the
best offshore wind resource in Europe, and an important part of the
framework to utilise this resource is the effective development of
offshore electricity networks, which are needed to ensure that
electricity generated by offshore renewables can be delivered to shore.
Under the Energy Act 2004, the Secretary of State already has powers to
introduce a regulatory framework to govern offshore electricity
networks connected to Great Britain. Those powers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>allow for the Secretary of State to make changes to existing industry
codes, agreements and licences for the purposes of regulating offshore
transmission and
distribution.</div>

					<a name="08022898000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Energy Act
2004 also amended the Electricity Act 1989 to provide for the
authority&#151;Ofgem&#151;to make regulations facilitating the
selection of an offshore transmission licence holder by a competitive
tender exercise. The additional powers that we are seeking in the Bill
supplement the Energy Act 2004 powers in relation to offshore
transmission.</div>
					<a name="08022898000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the Energy Act 2004 was passed, the Government have been working with
Ofgem to develop the detail of the offshore licensing regime for Great
Britain that will be implemented using the Energy Act powers. The
regime we are developing will apply to the conveyance of electricity
generated offshore by high-voltage lines, regulated as transmission.
Once the regime comes into force, it will cover offshore lines of a
nominal voltage of 132 kV or more.</div>
					<a name="08022898000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been consulting with
industry stakeholders and other interested parties on the policy
options for the new licensing regime. The Government decided that an
offshore regime that mirrors, so far as possible, the onshore
regulatory regime&#151;including a price-regulated
approach&#151;was most likely to assist the development of offshore
renewable generation and would enable a co-ordinated approach to be
taken to the building of new electricity connections needed to connect
those projects to the Great Britain onshore grid.

mishear&#151;that the same planning requirements would be brought to
offshore proposals? He has not mentioned tidal turbines and other ways
of generating electricity&#151;he is talking about cables at the
moment&#151;but is this the time to tell the Committee what planning
requirements would apply to offshore tidal turbines and other ways of
generating electricity
offshore?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000380"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> No, I do not think that this is the time. If there
is an opportunity for saying more about that in due course, I might do
so, but I am trying to talk about the grid mechanism. However, I will
try to find a way of accommodating the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question
in due course if I can&#151;not necessarily during this
debate.</div>
					<a name="08022898000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result
of our chosen regulatory approach, offshore renewable generators will
receive similar access rights to the grid as generation connected
onshore. The Government have also concluded that, because such
transmission assets are new and there are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>no incumbent licensees, there should be competition for offshore
transmission licences that authorise the conveyance of electricity from
specific offshore projects, rather than awarding one licence for the
conveyance of electricity from all projects in an offshore area. We
believe that that competitive approach to licensing offshore networks
will give new parties the opportunity to enter the market, thus
bringing innovative solutions and helping to keep down costs for
developers and electricity
consumers.</div>
					<a name="08022898000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of clause 40 is to supplement the existing powers and enable the
authority&#151;Ofgem&#151;that will have responsibility for running
the tender exercise to select offshore transmission licence holders and
to recover the costs it incurs through the process. At present, the
authority is able to recover the costs of undertaking its duties and
functions only through a combination of licence application fees and
ongoing licence
fees.</div>
					<a name="08022898000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 40 will
allow the authority to fund its role in the tender exercise by
requiring those parties that cause the authority to incur costs in
running the tender process to contribute directly towards meeting those
costs. We consider that approach to be a more appropriate than the
existing cost recovery powers, as it increases transparency and ensures
that the costs of running the tenders are met by those who participate
in the tendering exercise and not licence holders
generally.</div>
					<a name="08022898000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 40
will enable the authority, by regulation, to create new mechanisms to
recover its costs in carrying out and administering tender exercises.
Since the precise details of the tender exercise are still subject to
consultation with industry stakeholders and other interested parties,
clause 40 has been drafted to provide flexibility in relation to the
form of payments to be required and the participants from which they
can be recovered. However, we are clear about the broad objectives that
we are trying to achieve through the use of these mechanisms. In
particular, the mechanisms are intended to ensure that participants in
the tender process are appropriately committed to the exercise and that
the costs are met by the appropriate
persons.</div>
					<a name="08022898000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The authority
has recently published a document that sets out proposals for a
five-stage tender process that would lead to the selection of an
offshore transmission licence holder and therefore the award of a
licence. To prevent the excess recovery of costs, the Bill includes a
provision&#151;proposed new section 6D(5) of the Electricity Act
1989&#151;that will require the authority to take steps at the end of
each tender exercise to ensure that the total amount that it has
obtained from the participants in the tender exercise does not exceed
the actual costs
incurred.</div>
					<a name="08022898000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) constitutes a technical amendment to the Electricity Act 1989 to
ensure that the definition of &#147;relevant offshore line&#148;
includes electric lines that are located in GB internal
waters.</div>
					<a name="08022898000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
clause 40 introduces schedule 2, which will give effect to proposed new
schedule 2A to the Electricity Act
1989.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000381"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am grateful to the Minister for his
detailed explanation of the clause. Most of what he has described
appears to be fairly technical and concerns the details of financial
arrangements. To that extent, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>the Opposition support the Government&#146;s approach, as there is
clearly no point in having wind turbines across the North sea if they
cannot be connected to the national grid.</div>
					<a name="08022898000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said earlier, the
Government have set ambitious targets for offshore wind generation.
Will the Minister tell us a little more about what he thinks that will
involve and how we will get there? He has talked about the fact that
the Government expect about 8 GW to come through anyway; as of
December, they have said that they want a further 25 GW on top of that.
That is an enormous challenge. Does he believe that the measures are in
place to encourage that, and if not, what additional measures are
needed to make it happen? Some people say that, to meet that target,
two turbines a day will need to be constructed; some say that ten will
be needed. What is the Minister&#146;s assessment of how many
turbines a day will be needed to meet the target? It seems
challenging.</div>
					<a name="08022898000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister tell us a little more about what he thinks the load factor
will be for offshore wind? We understand that offshore wind probably
has a higher load factor than onshore wind and that it may be 40 or 50
per cent. Is that also his assessment? To what extent has he had
information about how offshore wind, when it does blow, ties in to when
we need it most? Is there evidence to show that there is more wind in
the winter, when there is greater electricity demand? Is there more
wind in the morning and in the evening, when there is also a higher
electricity demand? Is there a better match between offshore wind and
when electricity is needed than there is, perhaps, with onshore
wind?</div>
					<a name="08022898000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
raises the whole question of the obligations on the National Grid, with
regard to its connection of renewable energy sources. The problem at
the moment is that it has to connect elements in the order in which
applications are made. That causes significant problems. Some onshore
wind farms already have planning approval but will not get a National
Grid connection for some years. Equally, some onshore wind farms have
been given their National Grid connection, although they will be stuck
in planning for some years.</div>
					<a name="08022898000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to be general
agreement that the way in which the National Grid operates should be
changed, and it should be able to give priority access to renewables,
both offshore and onshore. That has been covered in some of the
representations that have been made to us. Scottish and Southern Energy
said:</div>
					<a name="08022898000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
addition, the current regime for access to and charging for the GB
transmission system is undermining Government policy by sending a
signal not to invest in new generation in those areas with an abundance
of natural renewable resource. Renewable generators with consent are
being held off the grid due to the access regime. Transmission charges
are extreme, volatile and unpredictable; hence potential investors
cannot gain sufficient confidence to commit to substantial new
generation capacity. The Energy Bill is an opportunity for the
Government to align the regime for access to and charging for the GB
transmission system with its wider energy policy objectives, and
particularly it is an opportunity for the Government to address the
access and charging issues for the UK transmission system that
currently block renewable
energy.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022898000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds said that it wanted to give
sustainable electricity priority access to the national grid. The
British Wind Energy Association said:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>
					<a name="08022898000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In particular
Ofgem&#146;s interpretation of its rules mean National Grid cannot
invest in upgrading connection and cabling for new wind farms until
developers are able to underwrite their costs. Companies are unable to
do this until their schemes are approved and they have secured finance,
which can take several years: under current arrangements they would
then have to wait further for grid upgrades before they can generate.
Ofgem fears that early investment in system reinforcement would result
in stranded assets being built. BWEA believes that Ofgem must relax its
rules regarding National Grid&#146;s investments, allowing it to
adopt a &#147;predict and provide&#148; policy towards connection
and grid access
issues.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022898000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the WWF said in its submission that it would like the Bill to give
renewable electricity generators priority access to feed their power
into the national grid. Will the Minister tell us how far the clause
goes in assisting the giving of priority access to the grid for
renewable sources, particular those that are
offshore?</div>
					<a name="08022898000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022898000382"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): I did not hear the
hon. Gentleman clarify the Conservatives&#146; policy on onshore
wind, but I note that their quality of life report
said:</div>
					<a name="08022898000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Onshore
wind is now at market competitiveness with internal rates of return
(IRR) hitting 25 per cent., and so should receive no further support
through the proposed banded competitive feed-in
tariffs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022898000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that
the clause is about offshore transmission, but the hon. Gentleman has
referred to onshore transmission and has indicated that there are some
difficulties with onshore wind connection to the grid. Is that still a
definitive statement of Conservative party policy regarding onshore
wind?</div>
					<a name="08022898000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000383"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I am very grateful for the opportunity to clarify
this matter. The quality of life report was a submission written to the
party board. It was never party policy. We asked various people with a
great deal of expertise in those areas to make recommendations on what
we should include. That recommendation has not been taken
forward&#151;others have, but the more we looked into that one, the
more we recognised that the costs of onshore wind have gone up. We
believe that the Government are right in continuing the ROC system with
a single ROC for onshore wind. I hope that I have clarified where we
stand on the matter.</div>
					<a name="08022898000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will know that we
have tabled a new clause in relation to Ofgem&#146;s remit that could
enable the issue to be addressed in terms of priority access. Some have
suggested that a document&#151;MOD 148&#151;will provide the
answers to that, but it would be helpful to have the Minister&#146;s
assessment for how the national grid should operate in those
circumstances. It is clearly in no one&#146;s interest to have people
investing in renewable energy sources if they cannot connect them to
the national grid.</div>
					<a name="08022898000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000384"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his opening
remarks and, indeed, to the hon. Member for Wealden for his comments. I
agree with much of what he said about the importance of priority
access, and I thank him for his useful clarification that the
well-regarded quality of life report is not actually Conservative party
policy. We had suspected as much.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>
					<a name="08022898000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some of his remarks, the hon.
Gentleman strays off the subject of transmission, which is the subject
of the clause. In Gloucestershire, we now very clearly understand the
difference between generation transmission and distribution. Generation
is where the electricity comes from; transmission is how it gets into
the county; and distribution is what stops when the substation is
flooded&#151;that raises the general issue of critical infrastructure
that I will return to.</div>
					<a name="08022898000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause addresses a
potential gap in policy. We are&#151;not literally, I hope&#151;in
uncharted waters; a new area of policy with the development of things
such as the super-grid. Obviously, new arrangements must be put in
place to cope with these developments. We must look at whether the
competitive tendering process is the right way to go. I was a little
concerned when looking, as I always do, at the Minister&#146;s impact
assessment that he signed off on 9 January. It identifies problems that
the policy is designed to address. One of those is the lack of a
compulsory transfer scheme if commercial negotiations fail between
asset owners. That is fair enough. The second problem that it
identifies is that</div>
					<a name="08022898000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Authority&#146;s&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022898000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;Ofgem&#151;</div>
					<a name="08022898000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;existing
powers of cost recovery do not enable it to recover its costs from
participants in running competitive tenders to identify an offshore
transmission
licensee.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022898000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">That might be
true, but it rather underlines the fact that the competitive tender
process appears to have been taken for
granted.</div>
				
					<a name="08022898000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08022898000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as I can
see, the impact assessment does not identify risks associated with that
policy or compare it with other approaches. I was interested to hear
the Minister say that different options had been consulted upon and
explored, because normally they tend to show up in the impact
assessment. However, on this occasion, that does not appear to be the
case. One paragraph
begins:</div>
					<a name="08022898000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
policy options have been considered? Please justify any preferred
option.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022898000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer
reads:</div>
					<a name="08022898000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government has considered (1) the option of proceeding without further
powers for the Authority, i.e. do nothing. Its preferred option is (2)
taking new legislative powers to establish mechanisms to enable Ofgem
to run an efficient and effective tender process and avoid potential
delay from commercial negotiations failing to the transfer of property,
rights and liabilities. Delays to establishing an effective
transmission licensing regime would delay the further development of
offshore renewable
deployment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022898000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
true, but essentially it identifies a financial risk to Ofgem and a
problem with the process. It does not explore other options, such as
extending the current regime without resorting to offshore renewable
transmission.</div>
					<a name="08022898000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
national grid was not developed on the basis of competitive tendering
processes, but was the result of good old-fashioned central planning.
It might be heresy for a new Labour Minister even to consider it, but
perhaps it is not wise to think that critical infrastructure is always
best developed by the lowest bidder, which is in effect what we will
have, especially if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>that lowest bidder is not the National Grid, but a company developing
untested technology on a large-scale.</div>
					<a name="08022898000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact assessment does not
address the risk of quality failings. I would be grateful, therefore,
if the Minister could reassure me that serious quality risks were
identified and considered in the various consultations and policy
options that he explored in advance of drafting the clause. We in
Gloucestershire now know the importance of critical
infrastructure&#151;if something goes wrong, it has a real impact on
people&#146;s
lives.</div>
					<a name="08022898000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned
that the regime in clause 40, which is quite long, differs from other
licensing regimes established elsewhere in the Bill. The Committee has
discussed on a couple of occasions already consistencies and
inconsistencies between different licensing regimes. In other places,
we have been reassured that environmental concerns were paramount and
that many conditions could be attached to licences concerning matters
such as public health. However, on this occasion, we appear to have
been presented with a provision fixed very narrowly in commercial terms
and that assumes that the cost-effectiveness of the competitive
tendering exercise is the only consideration. The impact assessment
promises us 10 per cent. efficiency savings&#151;I think&#151;from
the introduction of the competitive tendering exercise, but it does not
mention quality
risks.</div>
					<a name="08022898000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
very specific questions for the Minister. What conditions does he
imagine will form part of the tender specification in respect of the
following: first, the environmental impact of new transmission
infrastructure with particular regard to the marine Bill and how any
tender would interact with marine management under that Bill; secondly,
the proven experience of companies tendering for a contract in
delivering high-voltage transmission in other arenas, particularly
large-scale national infrastructure, such as offshore; and, thirdly,
the importance of establishing that there is good technological grounds
for the tendering company being able to establish an interconnection
with the existing national grid? I should like specific answers from
him, if possible, on those three
matters.</div>
					<a name="08022898000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said, we are discussing 8 GW of capacity, possibly rising to
as much as 33 GW of UK electricity generating capacity being placed
offshore. He is now frowning from a sedentary position, but his exact
words were, &#147;8 GW and then a further 25&#148;. Was that not
right? Did he mean a total of
25?</div>

a super-grid or a super-grid was delivered by any other company, it
would be absolutely essential to get the thing right. The potential of
offshore renewables is huge and they will be essential elements of the
national infrastructure. Perhaps we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>should have a self-denying ordinance among all members of the Committee
that we do not tell the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)

						</b> Again, it has been an interesting debate although
very little of it has been about the clause even though the clause is
important. It is quite detailed and relates to the carrying out and
administration of tender exercises for selecting the holders of
offshore transmission licences. It provides express powers for the
authority to recover its costs in relation to such tenders, as I
outlined earlier. On that&#151;perhaps
understandably&#151;colleagues have hung several questions that are
not strictly to do with the clause, but which really need a larger
debate on environmental impacts.</div>
					<a name="08022898000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everything we do offshore,
whether the oil rig or wind farm, involves the careful assessing of
environment impacts. We would not give a licence in waters where
dolphins might be under threat, for example.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> No, it is not in the clause
because that is not about dolphins. We cannot hang everything on the
clause, although there might be opportunities for raising some issues.
It is unfortunate that the hon. Member for East Devon has left the
room, although he might be coming back at which time I shall answer his
question.</div>
					<a name="08022898000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wealden asked about electricity networks. Given our
programme on offshore wind, it is clear that, during the next 10 to 15
years, the UK will need to deliver a significant increase in the
proportion of our energy from renewable resources. The implications for
that for offshore wind are considerable. It sets an unprecedented
challenge for our electricity networks, and highlights the urgent need
to tackle any barriers to grid access for renewable generators. That
means considering the longer-term, technical and, indeed, regulatory
challenges of high levels of renewable generation. I assure him that we
are working closely with industry, the National Grid and Ofgem to
ensure that the grid is fit for purpose in the quite challenging times
ahead as we move to a low-carbon energy system in the UK and Europe. We
particularly need to ensure that the system can efficiently accommodate
the expected expansion in renewable generation to 2020 and
beyond.</div>
					<a name="08022898000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Together with
Ofgem, the National Grid and the industry, we are undertaking a number
of initiatives to address short-term, medium-term and long-term
grid-related barriers to renewable generators. As we develop our
renewable energy strategy, we will need to consider what further
measures beyond the current transmission access review we should take
to deliver grid access in support of our targets. The transmission
access review led by Ofgem and my Department is examining the framework
for grid access for renewables to ensure that it remains fit for
purpose. An interim report was published last month and a final report
and recommendations are expected in May of this year.</div>
					<a name="08022898000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Wealden
asked for further details about the offshore transmission regime. We
always expected a significant contribution from offshore wind, but I
cannot go into detail about how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>many wind turbines will be built over what period. We are the licensing
body; we look at environmental impacts; we provide a regulatory
framework. At the end of the day, it will be for commercial developers
to come forward with their own proposals and I cannot prejudge that in
any
detail.</div>

							<a name="08022898000388"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> The difficulty the Minister has is that the
Government have set the target. They have said that they want by 2020
the 8 GW that is planned already plus another 25 GW of offshore wind,
so 33 GW in total. They must, in reaching that target, have worked out
how that is going to be achieved, how many turbines are going to be
necessary, what the construction rate is going to be and to make sure
we have the skills available to erect them. My assumption is that that
work has been done by his Department so that the Secretary of State can
come forward with that target. As the work has been done, it would be
good if the Minister could share it with the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="08022898000389"></a>Malcolm

targets should be in 2020 for all energy coming from renewables. That
is where we are.</div>
					<a name="08022898000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is thinking about the Secretary of State&#146;s
statement about our ambition for the development of offshore wind and
how that will influence our licensing procedure. We cannot be in the
business of saying there will be so many wind turbines or so many
biomass plants. We have a licensing regime that we hope will facilitate
a massive expansion of offshore wind.

fact that I do
that.</div>
					<a name="08022898000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Wealden also asked me about load factors. Yes, offshore wind has a
higher load factor than onshore wind. There is certainly a significant
resource offshore. We are currently undertaking a strategic
environmental assessment to assess some of the environmental impacts as
we go forward with a potential 25 GW coming from this
resource.</div>
					<a name="08022898000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked me about priority access for renewables. We have a
proposed new clause on this issue, which we will come to later. I would
be grateful if I could deal with that matter then.</div>
					<a name="08022898000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Cheltenham
was interested in what other options we were considering. He mentioned,
as a good central planner, the possibility of the National Grid doing
this work. As he knows, National Grid has a long-held onshore monopoly
business which is regulated by Ofgem. The new regime for offshore
transmission provides the opportunity for new companies to enter the
market and bring new and innovative solutions to grid-connect
offshore.</div>
					<a name="08022898000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have consulted extensively with industry on the
establishment of the new regime and have concluded that the best
approach is the use of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>competitive tenders to select offshore transmission licence holders. In
the consultation with stakeholders the extension of National
Grid&#146;s onshore monopoly was not supported by any offshore wind
developers. A number of capable and experienced partners have expressed
an interest in becoming offshore transmission owners. We, therefore,
believe it is right to test the market by competitive tender to find
the best candidates to build these new offshore connections. National
Grid should be able to enter such tenders, provided that it does not
interfere with its role as the Great Britain system operator, which the
Government have already announced that they intend to extend
offshore.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000392"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments
and his explanation that the consultation was a bit more expansive than
we might have guessed. We might not have guessed because there is no
mention of those options having been discussed in the impact
assessment. It simply looks at the option of doing nothing or having
the current regime. Is it possible for him to place on the record or to
supply to Committee members any details of the consultation that has
taken place and of the risks that might have been identified with going
down the competitive tendering
route?</div>

Gentleman and send copies to the Committee.</div>
					<a name="08022898000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was again asked by the hon.
Member for Cheltenham about the regulator recovering costs in the
future. Certainly, there are similarities between what Ofgem will be
doing with the competitive tenders for licences for offshore
transmission owners and Ofcom&#146;s function. The similarities are
competition for licences, which I have said is very important; a
process run by a regulator, which is key to this; a process set out in
regulations; and the ability to require deposits, which can be refunded
in whole or in part. However, there are instances in which the regimes
differ, and clause 40 is by no means identical to Ofcom&#146;s
powers. Clause 40 has been developed to be fit for the purpose for
which we intend it, namely, the offshore transmission
regime.</div>
					<a name="08022898000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham asked about the environment and I suggested to
him that there was a wider debate to be had about offshore
environmental issues. They do not actually relate to the clause.
Participants who are building assets will need to secure consents for
their lines, which will require them to undertake environmental impact
assessments, just as is the case now. I hope that that satisfies
him.</div>

							<a name="08022898000394"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I regret to say to the Minister that he has not
satisfied me, particularly about the new provisions coming in under the
marine Bill. Although he keeps suggesting that some of the issues that
I have raised do not relate to the clause, I think that they are
perfectly germane to it because it establishes the licensing regime.
Therefore, it is perfectly valid to ask what conditions tenders will be
issued under. The environmental considerations are absolutely
important. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>The regime established here today or by the passage of the Bill should
be consistent with the new regime introduced in due course by the
marine Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000395"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I am trying to say that this is an important clause
and that it is about the way in which licences for grids will be
regulated and about certain issues of costs for Ofgem. It is not a
whole clause saying for the first time, &#147;Let&#146;s build
offshore wind and let&#146;s consider the environmental
impacts.&#148; That is covered elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="08022898000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall say something about
planning because I was asked about it by the hon. Member for East
Devon, but I was hoping that he would have returned to the room before
I mentioned this. We expect that once the proposals in the Planning
Bill and the draft marine Bill are in place, the following planning
arrangements will apply. I say &#147;expect&#148; because the draft
marine Bill has not yet been published and the Planning Bill is going
through Parliament, and I do not want to prejudge anything. If both go
through, as we assume at the moment, the planning regime will be as
follows. Generating stations with capacity greater than 100 MW will be
considered by the infrastructure planning commission and those under
100 MW will be considered by the marine management organisation, which
will be part of the new regime of marine spatial planning. I should add
that currently all stations with a capacity greater than 1 MW are
considered by the Secretary of State. The connecting cables will be
considered as part of the project being considered. Therefore
developers will not have to seek planning permission for the cables
separately. I hope that goes some way towards answering the hon. Member
for Cheltenham, although I fear not far enough to satisfy him, because
he wants to hang a whole debate about the marine environment on this
particular
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000396"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I do not want to try the Minister&#146;s
patience, but I am not raising issues about the whole offshore
generation of electricity here. I am specifically talking, as the
clause does, about the transmission infrastructure and how that will
impact on the environment and other issues about the proven experience
of contractors and the interconnection with the existing grid. His
answer to the hon. Member for East Devon goes some way towards
answering some of that, although it is rather surprising that there
will be this separate licensing or tender regime if it is simply going
to be part and parcel of the main projects themselves. That is quite a
surprising
revelation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000397"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> No, I do not think it is. I think I am right in
saying that the hon. Gentleman is more ambitious about this clause than
I am. It is really dealing with some rather important matters, but in
terms of environmental concerns, this clause does not establish the
regime&#151;much of it was established in the Energy Act 2004. These
technical powers supplement that. The environmental impact will be
considered through the planning process and any strategic environmental
assessments, as I hoped I had made clear earlier. The environmental
issues will be looked after and the fact that they are not mentioned in
this clause is neither here nor there. We have legislative cover for
that already.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>
					<a name="08022898000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman also asked
about technical competence. We expect that participants in the process
will have a proven track record in delivering major electricity
infrastructure. The assessment of those in the process will need to
take account of technical competence to ensure that the grid is fit for
purpose. Existing UK and European players have expressed an interest in
building offshore infrastructure.</div>

						</b> Once the new offshore transmission regime goes
live&#151;currently expected at the end of 2009&#151;all projects
that connect to shore via lines of 132 kV or above will be covered by
the new licensing regime. This means that some projects that have
already been built or are currently under construction will need to be
subject to the new tendering process for offshore transmission
licences.</div>
					<a name="08022898000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">To date, the
sub-sea cables and associated equipment that will convey electricity
from offshore generating stations to the shore have been developed by
generator-developers. Careful consideration has therefore been given to
the specific arrangements that will need to be put in place for
offshore projects that are already completed, will be completed or will
be well developed by the time the new regime goes live. Ofgem will be
running a competitive tender process to select the holders of offshore
transmission licences in respect of these transmission
assets.</div>
					<a name="08022898000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">For these
projects, once an offshore transmission licensee has been selected
under the tender exercise, any transmission-related property, rights
and liabilities held by the generator-developer or other relevant asset
owner must be transferred or made available to the offshore
transmission licensee within a reasonable time. This will enable the
licensee to perform its licensed and statutory obligations and convey
the electricity generated to the onshore network. Schedule 2 enables
the authority, in certain circumstances, to make a scheme transferring
property, rights and liabilities from the existing owner to the
successful bidder for the offshore transmission
licence.</div>
					<a name="08022898000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect
that it will be in the relevant parties&#146; interest to reach a
commercial agreement as to the terms of the transfer. In most cases,
therefore, we would not expect the authority to be asked to use the
powers set out in the schedule to make a property scheme. However, the
power to make a property scheme will help to ensure the efficient and
timely transfer of property, rights and liabilities from the owner of
the assets, usually a generator-developer, to the successful bidder for
the offshore transmission licence if they cannot reach an agreement
through commercial negotiations. This will provide certainty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>and reassurance to tender participants for certain transitional
projects. It will also help ensure that the parties involved are not
placed under undue pressure by a third party seeking unreasonable
commercial advantage.</div>
					<a name="08022898000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall highlight a few key
features of the property scheme. The authority may make a scheme only
upon application and the scheme provisions must be necessary or
expedient for the offshore transmission licence holder to perform its
functions. There are also provisions in the schedule covering
compensation, protecting third-party interest and an appeals
mechanism.</div>
					<a name="08022898000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the compulsory property scheme will be used only in a small number
of circumstances, and consider that the existence of the powers will
now encourage parties to seek fair commercial negotiations where

					<a name="08022898000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are creating a framework for
ensuring that the operator of a new nuclear power station is
responsible for, and makes prudent provision to meet, the full costs of
decommissioning and their full share of waste management costs. By full
decommissioning costs, I mean the costs of dismantling the nuclear
power station at the end of its generating life, removing all station
buildings and facilities and returning the site to a state agreed with
the regulators and the planning authority, and the release from the
control of the nuclear site licence. This is likely to be a state
similar to greenfield, depending on the state of the site before the
construction of the station. By full share of waste management costs, I
mean the costs that are directly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>attributable to disposing of new-build higher activity waste in a
geological disposal facility, a contribution towards the fixed costs of
constructing such a geological disposal facility, a significant risk
premium over and above those costs&#151;to take account of
uncertainties around the cost of constructing such a facility and the
time when it will be able to accept new-build waste&#151;and the cost
of waste pending transfer for
disposal.</div>
					<a name="08022898000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 25 will ensure that an operator will have to set out, as part of
the decommissioning and waste management plan, what activities they
would undertake by way of detailed technical and operational planning
for the decommissioning and waste management and disposal activities
that take place once the station has ceased generating electricity for
the final time. It is important that this activity can be regulated as
part of the funded decommissioning programme, because it will ensure
that the operator starts to think in detail in advance about how those
decommissioning activities will take place. As clause 41 is drafted,
the operator will be required to set out in its decommissioning and
waste management plan how it will account for the decommissioning and
waste management and disposal activities throughout the life cycle of
the station. By making this amendment, the Government want to ensure
that the operator of a new nuclear power station also makes provision
for, and  sets out, the preparatory activities associated with
decommissioning and clean-up of the power
station.</div>

26 allows the Secretary of State, if needed, to make an order that will
mean that the preparatory activities specified in amendment No. 25 can
become designated technical matters. A designated technical matter is
one that must be provided for in the independent fund for
decommissioning and waste management. It is also therefore, by
definition, an activity on which an operator can spend resources from
the independent fund. The effect of amendment No. 26 is to ensure that
not only will preparatory activities to the decommissioning and
clean-up of a power station be regulated, but that the operator must
make financial provision for those activities when the station is
generating electricity. I ask hon. Members to consider these technical

Wicks:
						</b> Where a person applies for a
nuclear site licence and intends to construct a new nuclear power
station&#151;by &#147;person&#148; we mean a corporation as
well&#151;that person must give written notification to the Secretary
of State of the application. They must also prepare and submit a funded
decommissioning programme for approval.</div>
					<a name="08022898000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">In brief, the clause requires a
programme to address three key matters. First, it requires that the
funded decommissioning programme must make provision for the technical
matters involved in the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal
of hazardous material during the operation of a nuclear site and for
decommissioning and cleaning up of a site once that station has ceased
generating
electricity.</div>
					<a name="08022898000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
it requires operators to set out estimates of the
costs of taking the steps in relation to &#147;designated technical
matters&#148;. These matters are decommissioning, waste management
and waste disposal, which take place once the station has been shut
down for the last time, plus certain additional decommissioning related
activities that are undertaken during the generating life of the
station. The Secretary of State may specify the latter category of
designated technical matters by affirmative order, which comes under
clause 41(6)(a). Designated technical matters must be costed by the
operator and paid for from the independent
fund.</div>
					<a name="08022898000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
operators are required to set out details of the security that they
will put in place to meet the costs of these designated technical
matters&#151;we have just passed an amendment that relates to that.
Not all the matters relating to a decommissioning programme will be
designated as technical matters. In other words, even though the
operator will be expected to provide details of all the steps necessary
to decommission the installation and clean up the site, he will not be
required to provide cost estimates for all those steps, nor to provide
security to meet all those
costs.</div>
					<a name="08022898000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">As regards
waste and decommissioning-related activities undertaken during
electricity generation but that are not designated,<b class="B"> </b>the
Secretary of State will expect payments to be made from operating
expenditure at the time these expenses are incurred. An example of this
could be packaging and disposal of low-level waste during the operation
of a power station. At this time, the operator will have ready access
to sufficient moneys to meet such costs. These costs will therefore not
be subject to regulation, although the activities to which they relate
will be. More information on this point is set out in the guidance, and
we are currently consulting on that.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>
					<a name="08022898000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our nuclear White Paper which
was published in January, we said that the Government had determined
that</div>
					<a name="08022898000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;independent funds,
outside of the control of nuclear operators, should be created to
accumulate and manage payments from the operator to meet the full costs
of decommissioning and a full share of waste management
costs.&#148;</div>

							<a name="08022898000408"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> Can the Minister tell the Committee whether this is
a new stricture on the operators, or has this always happened in the
past when licences have been granted? Can he also tell us how long a
new-build nuclear power station is likely to last? Further, in relation
to the separate fund he just mentioned, is he talking about a
hypothecated fund, a deposit made by those who are granted licences to
be put in an escrow account, given the fact that anything might happen
over the period of
operation?</div>

							<a name="08022898000409"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I shall return to the hon. Gentleman on the first
point. I gave a fantastic answer to his planning question earlier while
he was absent, but I cannot immediately give him a fantastic answer to
that point. I also want to make sure that I fully understood the
question about whether this is a new power. We have not built any
nuclear power stations in recent times. Our main concern here is to
ensure that the companies pay the full cost&#151;over the whole life
cycle of nuclear generation and decommissioning&#151;and that there
is a properly protected fund that is separate from the normal accounts
of the company and that can be used for this purpose in due course.
That is the nature of our policy.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000410"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Is it not the case that the distinction is that
the last nuclear power stations to be built were constructed by the
industry when it was nationalised? Therefore, by definition, the
Government would have taken on responsibility for the waste at the time
those stations were being planned and built. The difference now is that
one is looking at the private sector to do that and therefore new
obligations on the industry are necessary to make sure that they
dispose of its own waste and cover the associated
costs.</div>
					<a name="08022898000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000411"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman&#151;that is
the essence of the point. The Government certainly now take on the
responsibility of the nuclear legacy&#151;for disposing of that waste
and for funding its disposal. It is a different ball game. When it
comes to moving forward that will depend on private sector
investment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000414"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> I think my hon. Friend just moved on. I will just
play back to him what I think he said so that he can clarify it to me.
I think he said that when one of these new power plants is operated,
the person operating it will be making money, so we know that they will
have this money to manage the site. We are not too worried about that,
but when he turns the plant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>off, he stops making money. We must therefore ensure that he has some
money put aside to cover the long-term costs. The question is how long
do we expect him to plan for those long-term costs. We have just been
through a chapter dealing with carbon capture and storage and we said
that there will come a time when the state takes responsibility for the
liability. At what point will the state be liable for radioactive
waste? I believe that the state should take responsibility for it at
some point.</div>
					<a name="08022898000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000415"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I better understand my hon. Friend&#146;s
concern. Our principle and endeavour is to ensure that companies pay
the full costs of the nuclear energy facility that they have brought
into being. That includes their forecasts of final deep geological
disposal. We are consulting on where that deep geological disposal
might be, but we intend for the operators to pay the full costs. Deep
geological disposal will not only be there for the legacy of nuclear
waste, which is a state responsibility, but it will have to be bigger
to ensure that it can take the new waste too. The operator will pay the
full costs of extra space, and it will also be charged to ensure that
it also pays for some of the infrastructure of the disposal facility.
Once that is done, the responsibility of the company ends and that of
the state takes over. Has that helped my hon.
Friend?</div>
					<a name="08022898000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000416"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> It is very helpful. Let me ensure that I
understand it. The operator will have paid something towards the cost
of creating the depository and the cost of transporting the material
and putting it safely there. At the point at which the waste is put in
the long-term depository, the liability ends and the state takes
over.</div>
					<a name="08022898000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000417"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Yes, that is our plan.</div>
					<a name="08022898000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for East Devon
asked how long a nuclear plant might exist for. Our planning assumption
is 40 years. That might be a conservative assumption for the purpose of
cost estimates, and it would be open to new-build operators to suggest
and make the case for alternative station lifetimes in their funded
decommissioning programme. The Secretary of State will consider
alternatives on a case-by-case basis. However, the planning assumption
is 40 years.</div>
					<a name="08022898000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000418"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> In terms of the operation of the site, is not the
planning assumption for the current generation of nuclear power
stations that the sites will remain contaminated and will effectively
still be in the process of final decommissioning for something closer
to 100 years?</div>
					<a name="08022898000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000419"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I answered the question because I was asked how
long the nuclear reactor might be up and running. As I said, our
planning assumption is 40 years, and I have explained that there could
be some flexibility around that. It might be a conservative assumption.
Of course, after that, it will take much longer for the site to return
to an original greenfield state&#151;that brings us to a range of
technical issues about interim storage and so on. The hon. Gentleman is
right to imply that once the generator is switched off, things do not
magically return to normal the next day.</div>

							<a name="08022898000420"></a>Dr.
Iddon:
						</b> The hon. Member for Cheltenham
implied that the site would be left contaminated. That is surely not
the point; it would not be left contaminated by radioactive
waste.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022898000421"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Of course, it will not be left contaminated, but I
was conceding the point that, after 40 or 50 years, there will be a
period before the site can safely be returned to greenfield or
whatever. That will be for a number of years and there are issues about
interim storage and so on However, obviously no one will leave the site
contaminated; that would not be allowed. Both the hon. Member for
Cheltenham and my hon. Friend were right&#151;I am feeling
generous.</div>
					<a name="08022898000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
about the new regime. The hon. Member for Wealden helped me to answer
the question. The Health and Safety Executive requires operators to
make provision for decommissioning activities. This is part of licence
condition 35, as the hon. Gentleman knows and as it says here helpfully
and in some detail. These new provisions make it a requirement for
operators to set aside funds to decommission the plant and manage
waste.</div>
					<a name="08022898000289"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="08022898000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that has
been so exciting, I am trying to remember where I was. I think I was
trying to make a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>speech on clause stand part. This is what I was about to
say&#151;after those very useful interruptions. As set out in draft
guidance, independent funds are the primary form of security that the
Secretary of State would expect to see put forward in a programme to
meet the operator&#146;s decommissioning, waste management and waste
disposal costs in accordance with clause 41(7)(c). Clause 41(8) allows
the Secretary of State to charge a fee to the person submitting the
programme. This will allow the Secretary of State to recover the costs
of considering the programme, including obtaining advice to verify
certain aspects. It is important that the Secretary of State can rely
on this verification because of the level of detail that will be
expected in a programme.</div>
					<a name="08022898000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the licence holder of a
power station changes, the prospective licence holder will have to
submit a programme to the Secretary of State for approval. The
prospective licence holder must obtain approval before he takes over
the operation of the station. This will ensure that there is a funded
decommissioning programme covering the station at all
times.</div>
