of guidelines has already been issued to aid compliance with the Data
Protection Act 1998, what are your views on the need for a further code
of practice in the form proposed in the

responsibility for the data protection aspects of CCTV, but I suspect
that there are more issues around it that we do not have responsibility
for. The trick will be to get the two regimes to synch. It is notable
that the proposals in the Bill concern only England and Wales; of
course, we have responsibility for the UK enforcement

local government and the police, but there is a wider issue, many
citizens would feel, about the use of CCTV cameras in the private
sector, or by private contractors working for public authorities. We
can do so much in enforcing the Data Protection Act in respect of the
personal information captured on CCTV, but we do not claim to do the
whole thing, so we need to work very closely with that new regime to
make sure that it is
effective.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000022">&#160;</a>

engagement with the Home Office in drawing up the CCTV proposals,
because some of the things are not absolutely clear to us, but we will
make things work as best we can. It is important for the various

together, and to liaise and
co-operate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000024">&#160;</a>

proposed surveillance camera commissioner does not have a complaints
handling function or an enforcement function. Those who have complaints
about the use of CCTV, particularly about personal information, will
continue to complain to our office. Indeed, the existence of the code
may generate more complaints to our office. Equally, if there are
questions of enforcement, it is possible that the surveillance camera
commissioner will turn to our office and ask us to use our powers to
help enforce the provisions of the code that he or she will oversee.
There are boundary issues that will have to be dealt with but, as we do
with other regulators, we will work closely to ensure that things are
as seamless as possible for the individuals who have complaints and

I make no complaint; we have been closely engaged with the Home Office,
but on a very broad front. The transparency and accountability agenda
pops up with different Departments all over Whitehall, and I cannot say
that we have been idle since the election. We have been involved on
very, many fronts. I had a useful discussion with the Minister shortly
after his appointment, and there is more detail to be worked through. I
value this opportunity of talking to the Committee about it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In terms of
the overlap between commissioners, we need to be very clear that the
Information Commissioner is established by Parliament with two primary
pieces of legislation to enforce: the Data Protection Act and the
Freedom of Information Act 2000. I know there are voices saying,
“We need to have a privacy advocate or a privacy tsar.”
My problem with that is that privacy is at one end of the spectrum
while accountability and transparency is at the other end, and someone
has to make the judgment. You can make that judgment if you are charged
with upholding information rights in the public interest, but if you
are specifically identified as Mr Privacy and expected to come down on
the privacy side all the time, it is difficult to make judgments about
the release of official information or the extent of granularity of
crime mapping, or something like that. It has to be a balanced
responsibility. I do not mind a number of specific commissioners
dealing with specific approvals for different things, as long as we
co-ordinate, as long as we talk and as long as we have memorandums of
understanding and we all stick to our individual knitting, but make
sure that the knitting does not get muddled

regulator. We have worked closely with him, both in his capacity as
CCTV regulator and in his capacity as forensic science regulator, which
I suppose is his full-time permanent role. We have seen with him a
division of responsibilities, in that he is really interested in the
standards of operation of CCTV systems, particularly things such as the
quality of the images that are produced. At the end of the day, are
they good enough to apprehend offenders if they come into the hands of
the police? Our direction is more about protecting the privacy of the
individuals whose images appear. Those are two different roles. We have
developed a very good working relationship, and I am confident that if
he was the surveillance camera commissioner, we would develop a good
working relationship as well, but as the Information Commissioner says,
we would need to develop memorandums of understanding. What is key is
that it is clear not just to us but to individuals—to the public
we are intending to

as the Information Commissioner is concerned is to make sure that there
is no abuse of people’s rights to the protection of their
personal information under the Data Protection Act. As David said, we
are not directly involved in making sure that the CCTV cameras work and
that the images are useful for the detection of crime. There are lots
of other interests that people have in CCTV. But it is not what the
Information Commissioner is there to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000038">&#160;</a>

does not come across as an over-bureaucratic response. It is just that
I am a commissioner appointed under statute to enforce a couple of
pieces of legislation. If I stray beyond that and say it would be a
jolly good thing if CCTV did this or that, I am going beyond what I
have powers to enforce. It is much better if I stick to applying the
Data Protection Act in the CCTV world, which is difficult enough given
that CCTV is now very much involved not just in looking after public
space on behalf of local authorities or central Government, but in
parking control at Tesco. It is about automatic number plate
recognition. It is about all sorts of other private activities, which
technology is making us more and more able to deal with. The
Information Commissioner will not be able to tackle every aspect of it,
but looking at the data protection side of it, there is a lot we can
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000039">&#160;</a>

cameras do not work, we are not concerned, because cameras that do not
work cannot intrude on someone’s privacy and that is what our
driver is. If they do not work very well, there may be an issue,
because you identify the wrong person and that intrudes on privacy. But
the police and law enforcement agencies and the wider private sector
have a very clear interest in cameras that are efficient, can detect
crime and can be used as evidence to bring people to court. That is not
really the interest under the legislation that we are given to pursue.

where you get information from a database by pretending to be someone
else, or by tricking staff at the call centre, bank or, unfortunately,
the local doctors’ surgery. That definitely breaches the Data
Protection Act, and we deal with it. But the whole row about phone
hacking comes under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, and we
have to leave that to the police. So I do not have a view about

                           </em> Our major concern regards section
55 of the Data Protection Act, where there is unlawful release of
private information, often without the knowledge of the data
controller, by rogue members of staff. It is important that that is
effectively enforced. The Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice,
who was at our data protection officers’ conference in
Manchester the week before last, was quite strong about the need for
the courts to take effective action to enforce section 55. He talked
about pursuing actions for the restitution of the profits of crime.
Some of the scams and operations are extraordinarily profitable. We are
waiting to hear the sentencing in one case where we were told that
members of staff were making £70,000 a year over and above their
basic salary by selling customer information to rival companies. It is
very important that we see effective action by the courts. It is often
seen as a victimless crime, but it is not. It is not pinching the
office stationery or making long-distance phone calls from the office,
but selling people’s personal information, very often in nasty
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000047">&#160;</a>

should be proper safeguards for RIPA powers, and a proper process of
authorisation. We have in the past, certainly, said that we prefer the
judicial route—that there should be judicial authorisation. That
is our preferred route, from a human rights view, as well as being an
independent

is a role for Government in balancing the proportionality—it is
resource-intensive—and which types of RIPA-based activity are
appropriate for judicial authorisation and which for more
administrative authorisation. We ourselves have access to traffic data,
essentially, and that is not a judicial authorisation process. We would
be more than happy to go through a judicial authorisation process, but
I wonder whether it is necessary. We are subject to supervision by the
interception of communications commissioner, and we are inspected by
another commissioner, so there is that sort of approach. From a purist
view, yes, judicial supervision is the better
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000052">&#160;</a>

company owned by more than one local authority is brought within

single local authority falls under the Act, while a company owned by a
number of them does not. The whole logic of back-office shared services

there is a lot of guidance now about public appointments, to make sure

key thing is not just modernisation but also the independence of the
Information Commissioner. The Information Commissioner must be in a
position sometimes to tell truth to power—to say difficult
things to very senior people. It is an independent position; it is an
appointment under royal prerogative and I can be sacked on joint
resolution of both Houses of Parliament, but at the moment there is
nothing in the legislation to say what the crimes would be. There is a
very clear understanding that if I or one of my successors should fall
down on the job in a number of specific ways those would be grounds for
that resolution.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000068">&#160;</a>

independence of the Information Commissioner, it is an important part
of the back end of the Bill that I have reassurance that that
independence is being strengthened. The independence arises from an
appointment that is a one-shot; you do not have to spend your time
worrying about whether you are going to be reappointed. The Minister
has made it clear that the Justice Committee will effectively have a
power of

                           </div>veto over the appointment. The appointment will be made in the normal
way, with advertising, selection interviews and so on, but then the
Committee of the House of Commons will have the final say.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000069">&#160;</a>

think that the term of office, as specified in the Bill, could be put
slightly differently. At the moment, it says five years. I think that
no less than five and no more than seven would be a slightly better
arrangement. It so happens that my three predecessors had seven years,
because they had a five-year appointment and then an extension. I do
not speak for myself. I know absolutely that it is a five-year
appointment and that is fine. It suits me well. However, I think that
the next commissioner in particular, who will come in at a time when
the next data protection directive is being implemented, would probably
benefit from having up to seven years, which might make it more
attractive to some candidates. I think that my predecessor, Richard
Thomas, has put in a submission to the Committee on that point. There
might be some people who have a look at the job and say, “Oh,
I’ll have to make myself very unpopular to very senior people
over five years and that’s it. I tell you what—I
won’t apply.” I think that it would be cleverer if what
was on offer was up to seven
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000070">&#160;</a>

can charge for certain things at the moment, but as I understand it you
have to get the agreement of the Secretary of State to do so. The Bill
removes that requirement, and it allows you to charge for certain
services and to employ the number of staff that you want. Again, that
is trying to strengthen the role and the independence of the
commissioner. Can you give us some indication of the sort of things
that you might charge for that you currently do not charge for? Also,
what sort of control will there be on that process? Will there be a
market force control? Given that people have to comply with the law,
what check will there be on the charges that you make or who you make

“We’ll have 200 of those, please,” I think that it
would be reasonable for a company to pay a fee that covered the cost of
those. That is all it is about. It is an illustration of the way that
the office was originally set up that you cannot move without asking

have to give all the money back to the Consolidated Fund at the end of

circumstances that the legislation demanded or any exceptional
circumstances that I could see, was a mistake. If the view is that
Cabinet Committee material can never be made public because that is an
affront to Cabinet collective responsibility, that is what the

says that it is a matter for the judgment of the Information

the Committee is that deleting the DNA is one thing, but you also need
to delete the associated name record on the police national computer at
the same time. That is not specifically in the Bill, and we think it is
an important safeguard. Proportionality is the name of the game. We
like the direction of travel. I do not know whether David has

welcome the direction of travel. The indefinite retention of DNA on
people who have been arrested but not proceeded with, or charged but
not convicted, is contrary to the data protection principles and good
data protection practice. Protection in legislation places limits on
retention, so information should only be retained as long as it has a
value—not just some value, but a value that overrides the
privacy intrusion that goes with lengthy retention. The indefinite
retention that we have seen and that was taken up in the S and Marper
case has always offended us and we have been unhappy with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000086">&#160;</a>

welcome the move to much shorter retention periods. We welcome the
previous proposals as going in the right direction, which were 12-year
periods and six-year periods. We were unhappy with those because we
thought they were too long and not supported by the evidence of
reoffending and the use of the information. If we have any concerns
about the present arrangements, it is not that they are too long. They
make sense and the value in drawing them from the Scottish model is
that they appear to indicate more of an intuitive approach than an
evidence-based approach. When you are talking about intruding into
people’s privacy, we like that to be based on the
evidence—how useful is this information in detecting crime and
how does that usefulness fall away after time? We are very happy to go
with the periods in the Bill, but that should not be the end of the
story. There should be an ongoing process of gathering evidence about
how useful this information is and a regular review of those retention
periods.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000087">&#160;</a>

the system in Scotland. In some ways, it is difficult to comment. If
you do not have the DNA, you do not know who you might have caught had
you had it. We are concerned with the idea that this is all about
catching criminals and there is no balance in terms of privacy.
Actually, there are two public interests. There is a strong public
interest in catching criminals, but there is also a public interest in
protecting the privacy of individuals. Up to now it has all been on one
side, and we welcome the balance. It always existed in the Scottish
model. There is no doubt that any reduction in the retention periods
will reduce—perhaps only marginally—our ability to catch
someone. The way to have the maximum ability is to keep the DNA of
everybody in the land. It is about the balance between the two, and we
think that this system is
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000091">&#160;</a>

delete the entry on the name database. It is absolutely routine and
understandable for the police to access the police national computer to
see who they are dealing with. We do not want a situation where the DNA
has been deleted but there is something on the name database, so the
policeman or woman immediately treats the individual concerned, who is
innocent of the previous offence, as “probably” or
“likely to have.” It is that sort of thing. If it is
logical to get rid of the DNA

put the clock back to where it was before we had indefinite retention
of DNA. The only reason the arrest record is kept indefinitely is
because it is the link to the DNA on the national DNA database. The
principle should be that, once the DNA is not kept, the information on
the police national computer should go as well. It is not immediate. We
are talking about prescribed offences and there is a three-year period
with a two-year extension, but the same basic principle applies to
arrest records on the police national computer. If I was arrested 25
years ago for shoplifting but it was never proceeded against, come on,
that should not still be on the police national computer 25 years
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000108">&#160;</a>

want to keep for an extra two years. What is your understanding of the

reoffending tailing off quite quickly after an initial arrest, at least
for most areas of crime. Although the period for the previous

the point where the balance was right, at three years. You have gone
for three years, with an extension to two years, which seems to us to
be about right and to fit in with the evidence. I emphasis, however,
that the evidence continues to be developed, so let this be reviewable

wanted to be certain on what you require to have happened from a data
protection point of view. Under data protection, if someone asks for
something to be deleted, you want it to be deleted in its entirety. Or
do you? The process starts with a sample, which may involve more than
one person’s DNA. If, for instance, you do some sort of analysis
and arrive at one sample at the end, which is computerised and easy to
delete, and you can delete the reference on the police national
computer at the same time, how far back upstream do you want the
deletion to go, in terms of getting rid of anything that is
held?<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000121">&#160;</a>

a better fix on the mechanics of the thing. We want to be clear that it
is a question of having a proportionate response. A wholly
disproportionate response would be to have an Orwellian nightmare of
everyone’s DNA being on the computer. Through that, you would
always be able to identify who has done the crime, if you have any DNA
from the crime scene, because, hey, we would all be on the computer. No

about the safeguards in the Bill, relating to the need for both parents
to give written consent to the use of biometric data? I am particularly
interested in the child’s ability to
override parental consent. I wonder about the practicalities,
especially when you are dealing with very young children—a
five-year-old, for example. Obviously, the definition of child in the
Bill goes up to the age of 18, so there is a wide age range. How would
that work?<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000133">&#160;</a>

the Bill offers. We got a lot of stick in our
interpretation—although it was a pretty obvious
interpretation—of the Data Protection Act, in relation to how
things stood before. People wanted the law to say something different
to what it actually did. Now, Parliament is catching up, and it is
passing a specific law on this issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is not
easy. There may be circumstances where both parents are not together or
are not available. With an older child, you may get a situation where
an older child is perfectly happy to be fingerprinted but the parent
does not agree, or vice versa. It is tricky, but it will be better than
the current situation. What would be even better would be absolute
clarity about the school’s policy, because very often, the
withholding of consent is based on misunderstanding, upset and
suspicion. We want schools to be absolutely clear and to make it clear,
we would say, in their privacy statements what their policy is. That
would be a freedom of information requirement in the school’s
privacy statement, saying what they are doing about fingerprinting as a
security measure in school.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000135">&#160;</a>

it would be very welcome if the Bill would also mandate public
authorities to put their privacy statements online. That would get
around the point that was raised in an earlier sitting of the

should notify the Information Commissioner—I could do without
that. Let us have it as the privacy statement on the website, and then
everybody will be clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000136">&#160;</a>

schools first came out, it was a difficult issue for us. There was very
much the feeling that using fingerprints in schools stigmatises
children, that it is a police system, and that children would get used
to giving their fingerprints away in schools. Does that somehow make
children more willing to give their fingerprints away all over the
place, as well as making them susceptible to surveillance and less
questioning of policing and society? When you come down to a hard data
protection analysis of rights under the Act, it is very hard to build
that in. I think that is one of the reasons why our approach has come
in

reasoned decision. But there are wider
considerations. We can see that they come into
play. There is a balance between bringing parents into the decision
making and remembering that it is still primarily the child’s

open about what this is all about, they would have the willing
co-operation of parents and children. It would just be understood that

                           </em> Yes, although we are worried that unless the
Bill is strengthened, the employer will find an alternative route for
getting what it might not get through Criminal Records Bureau checks,
which is what we call enforced subject access requests, by saying,
“Do you want this job? I can’t get the information that I
want. Tell you what—you exercise your subject access request and
then show me what you’ve got or you don’t get the
job.” There are provisions under part 5 of the Police Act 1997
that remain to be commenced. If the Bill goes through as currently
drafted, it is absolutely essential that the opportunity is taken to
commence those provisions to make it a criminal offence for an employer
to force a prospective employee to collect their own information and
share it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000148">&#160;</a>

I draw the Committee’s attention very briefly to one other

here. We are very strongly in favour of the police

those offences that would not be illegal today. It is a matter of great
concern that individuals’ lives had been blighted for something
that they did pre-1967, or subsequently, that then dogs their future
employment prospects and so on. We are not suggesting that the deletion
of those records and the Criminal Records Bureau check not showing that
up means that you somehow rewrite history. This is not the Ministry of

people’s lives from being wrecked many years after for actions

for CRB checks, which happen quite a lot when certain areas are brought
into the system, such as airports. In the case of airports, there was a
big rush and there were lots of complaints in the press about it. The
airport authorities were paying for these checks. Where does it lie
with what you were saying about the individual not needing to disclose

to take place, as is the case for people who work with children and in
certain areas such as airports, where there is security, there is not a
problem. Employers should have access, and employers should pay for it.
The problem is with employers who do not have a legal right simply
saying to the individual who comes to them for a job, “I want
you to go and use your subject access right under the Data Protection
Act to get a copy of your criminal record, and then show it to me

sets—to require that they be released in a reusable form and not
subject to copyright restrictions—should be
extended more widely. Because of the way in which this policy has come
forward—it is from the Government concentrating on measures to
encourage the release and reuse of data sets—the problem that
they have identified is not specific to data sets. It is that
authorities release information and then assert that their copyright in
it remains, and that the user must apply to them for written permission
to publish the information they have received. That means, for example,
that if I apply for information in order to incorporate it in my
evidence to you, before I am allowed to do so, I must go back to the
authority, having got the information out of it, and ask for its
permission to circulate the information to Members of
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000167">&#160;</a>

you look at the releases, there are quite extraordinary cases of
innocuous information that the authority will not allow to be released
into the public domain. The authority instead insists that the

they get copyright permission. I am talking about an NHS trust that
released information about the number of cases of chemotherapy in a
year, but attached a copyright statement and warned of the risk of
legal action against anyone who did not follow it. Child abuse policy
is being disclosed in that way. We get information about the number of
staff employed exclusively to enforce the smoking ban. The answer is
zero, but then there is a copyright

change should be made to the preference that the requester is allowed

The previous witnesses gave evidence about the Manchester airport

companies that are wholly owned by one or more public authorities

Chris Graham and David Smith said before: five years then becomes a
short period of time. You may have a period of up to a year before a
new commissioner is reasonably on top of the subject matter. If the
commissioner goes at the end of five years, you probably have at least
six months at the end of the tenure when he or she is seen to be

                           </em> The commissioner has a dual role—two
important roles—at the moment, which is freedom of information
and data protection. It is helpful for him to combine those roles,
because the area of freedom of information that has been very
problematic is its overlap with the Data Protection Act and requests to
see people’s names. For example, the issue of officials’
names is hotly contested. It has been helpful to have a commissioner
responsible for both sides.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000197">&#160;</a>

would not necessarily improve my area of work—freedom of
information. There is a danger. What we have seen with data protection
over the past two years is that as Government Departments have been
found to have lost a lot of data, the commissioner’s office has
devoted more and more attention to those issues. That is perfectly
fair, but, possibly, sometimes those resources come from freedom of
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000201">&#160;</a>

We have been opposed to it from the outset. If there is a complaint to
the Information Commissioner, and the Government do not like the
commissioner’s decision, they can go to the tribunal.
Thereafter, they can go to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. I
wonder what the role of a ministerial veto is in those circumstances,
particularly as it appears that not only

but it is an open question as to whether Ministers might be able veto a
decision of the Court, which would be constitutionally extraordinary.
Given how the Bill is written, a decision on public interest grounds
can be vetoed by Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032471000203">&#160;</a>
