<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000144"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> I beg to
move amendment No. 19, in
clause 23,  page 11, line 31, leave
out subsection
(2).</div><a name="08101651000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
morning, Dr. McCrea. Subsection (2) was inserted into the clause in the
other place contrary to our wishes. It would require Parliament to
agree by affirmative resolution to the directions issued to the Big
Lottery Fund by the Secretary of State on operational matters, such as
the BLF&#146;s financial management and staffing accounts, and by the
Secretary of State to the devolved Administrations on the distribution
of dormant account funds. By removing subsection (2), the Government
consider that the scope of the Bill, as previously drafted, will be
appropriate. Although I appreciate the arguments made in the other
place for greater transparency and accountability, I hope that the
Committee will accept that we have taken them into consideration
elsewhere in the Bill and that subsection (2) is not
necessary.</div>
<a name="08101651000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101651000145"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): In the context of the national
lottery Acts, will the Minister have similar powers to give direction
and will there be parliamentary scrutiny of those powers? It is
important to have comparability between the operation of the fund under
the Bill and the Big Lottery Fund&#146;s usual
funds.</div>
<a name="08101651000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000146"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand that the amendment tabled in the
other place goes beyond existing national lottery practice, which is
why we want to remove subsection (2). It could result in unintended
consequences, and its removal would delete the requirement for
Parliament to scrutinise the spending directions issued to the Big
Lottery Fund by the devolved Administrations. In the spirit of
devolution, the Government do not hold that Parliament should be
required to discuss matters that should be more properly debated in the
devolved Parliaments and Assemblies. When their lordships voted for the
amendment, I am not sure whether they realised that they would require
Parliament to scrutinise what are clearly devolved matters for Scotland
and
Wales.</div><a name="08101651000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government hold that the parliamentary scrutiny and financial spending
directions also covered by the provision are inappropriate. The powers
in the Bill will enable the Secretary of State for Children, Schools
and Families to make financial directions governing matters such as the
Big Lottery Fund&#146;s accounts. They are standard powers necessary
for the oversight of a non-departmental public body. It is not
seriously intended 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>that the exercise of those powers be subject to an affirmative
resolution. Even if it were accepted that subsection (2) was
targeted at English spending directions&#151;although the provision
goes beyond that&#151;we would hold that the
affirmative procedure was
inappropriate.</div><a name="08101651000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the other place, to be open and transparent about the
Government&#146;s intentions, we set out our approach to the issuing
of English spending directions. The directions to the Big Lottery Fund
regarding spending in England will be considered by an
inter-ministerial working group&#151;a matter that we have discussed.
It will involve the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the
Office of the Third Sector, the Department for Communities and Local
Government, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Her
Majesty&#146;s Treasury. In addition, the Bill requires the BLF to be
consulted during the process of developing the
directions.</div><a name="08101651000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inter-ministerial working group will make recommendations to the
Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, who will issue
directions to the BLF. Paragraph 9(2) of schedule 3 will require the
BLF to set out in its annual report the directions given to it under
clause 23 that had effect during the financial year to which the report
relates. The Government understand need for transparency and have
listened carefully to the points made in the other place about the
possible time delay between the directions being issued and the
BLF&#146;s reporting of them.</div>
<a name="08101651000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are happy
to confirm that the BLF will publish the directions on its website as
they are issued, which further underscores our commitment to
transparency. As with the national lottery, the Government&#146;s
position is that this mechanism for developing and issuing directions
to the BLF is the appropriate one and that creating a role for
Parliament in the process, which has not happened before, would be
disproportionate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000149"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I welcome you to what I hope is the
Committee&#146;s final sitting, Dr. McCrea. These amendments are
straightforward. They would make it clear that, in respect of the
fund&#146;s operation, the Secretary of State concerned would be the
Secretary of State with responsibility for lottery matters. Given the
current machinery of Government, that would be the Secretary of State
for Culture, Media and Sport. The reason for choosing the Secretary of
State in charge of lottery matters is that the BLF makes its report to
that Secretary of State, although it is a non-departmental public body.
That is the method of accountability, so it would seem obvious to
maintain a consistency of approach in that respect.</div>
<a name="08101651000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second,
more substantive issue is that the Government have made it clear that,
as far as they are concerned, the Secretary of State referred to in the
Bill is the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families.
Given that Secretary of State&#146;s role in setting out the spending
priorities, we believe it would be in the interests of fairness and
objectivity for an alternative Minister to give those
directions.</div>
<a name="08101651000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process
would be much more transparent if people felt that the person who gave
spending directions was not one of the Ministers responsible for a
policy area affected by one, if not two, of the three causes mentioned
in the Bill. It would be a better set-up if the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport led the process on behalf of the Government.
That would not preclude the inter-departmental working parties and all
the machinery that goes into sorting out the priorities, but people
would have more confidence in the objectivity of the spending
allocations and the directions given to the BLF if they were made by a
Minister who was independent of the three spending priorities. That is
why we propose the insertion
of</div><a name="08101651000121"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
charge of lottery matters&#148;</div>
<a name="08101651000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">in about 10 places
throughout the Bill.</div>
<a name="08101651000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000150"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As the hon. Gentleman suggests, these amendments
prescribe that the lead Secretary of State in respect of the unclaimed
assets scheme should be the same one who is responsible for overseeing
the national lottery. I will explain why the Government are taking a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>different approach. As was debated previously, the main priority for
distribution in England will be youth services, so it is right for the
Department of Children, Schools and Families to take the
lead in issuing directions to the BLF, as the relevant lead policy
Department.</div>
<a name="08101651000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must have
a lead and the hon. Gentleman rightly asks why it should not be DCMS,
and it is apparent that it could be. However, given that the main
priority for distribution is the provision of youth services, we hold
to the fact that it is better if the lead Department is the Department
for Children, Schools and Families. The BLF will therefore be
accountable to the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families for the spending of unclaimed assets,
but spending priorities for unclaimed assets in
England&#151;I freely admit this&#151;cut across other
Departments&#146; policy areas, because of the other things that we
are interested in. That is one reason why we have set up the
inter-departmental ministerial working group to produce the directions
in the first
place.</div><a name="08101651000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not as though DCMS does not have a role; it will continue to have
responsibility for ensuring that the BLF is fit for purpose in
distributing lottery money, with appropriate systems in place. It will
be up to the Departments to satisfy themselves that the BLF is
distributing the funds for which they are responsible in accordance
with their directions and, in so doing, meeting their objectives. As
was said earlier, there will also be transparent disclosure of the
distribution of assets within the BLF&#146;s annual report, which
will also publish details of the spending
directions.</div><a name="08101651000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that that is the appropriate approach. We have said that youth
services are the priority, and we have to give a responsibility to a
Department to lead on the matter&#151;it is a co-ordinated lead. We
remain of the view that it is appropriate that that Department is the
DCSF, and I invite hon. Members to reject the amendment if it is
pressed to a
Division.</div><a name="08101651000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000151"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not wildly comfortable with the idea of the
Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families taking the lead
in this matter; it would be better if another Minister in another
Department did so, to ensure some fairness and equity in the
distribution of funds between the three causes. I am also slightly
concerned that we will end up with duplication: the DCMS has existing
links with the BLF, and we are in danger of creating a parallel chain
of engagement through the DCSF. Obviously, those costs, as is made
clear elsewhere in the Bill, will be met from dormant accounts, and
that will be another deduction from the amount of money that is
available to good causes.</div>
<a name="08101651000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
press the amendment to a Division. I suspect that there are enough hon.
Members on the Government Benches to outweigh the meagre numbers on the
Opposition Benches this morning. I cannot quite see that the power of
my oratory this morning will persuade Government Back Benchers to rebel
on such a matter, so I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

is pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Dr. McCrea. It
is interesting to be sitting on this side of the Committee after so
many years sitting in the
Chair.</div><a name="08101651000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
moving the new clause, I am addressing what can best be described as
the elephant in the room. Throughout the life of the Bill and long
before its existence, the use of a voluntary rather than mandatory
scheme has been a controversial issue in the debate on dormant
accounts. The new clause tackles that issue head-on. To some extent, I
feel that it reaches a compromise and that there is something in it for
people in both camps.</div>
<a name="08101651000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I start by
underlining what the new clause is not. It does not suggest the
introduction of a mandatory scheme. It seeks to enhance the nature of
the voluntary scheme, and although it could be used to create a
mandatory scheme, that is not its core purpose. It is, however, a
crucial bargaining tool that would ensure compliance from the banking
industry in handing over money voluntarily to the reclaim
fund.</div>
<a name="08101651000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Banks and
building societies will be more likely to co-operate if the alternative
to non-co-operation is enforced co-operation. In that sense, the new
clause would function much like a veto at the Council of the European
Union. Its most useful legislative quality would not be its use, but
rather the threat or shadow of it looming in the background, which
would ensure compliance and debate.</div>
<a name="08101651000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause has been mentioned in Committee, and I should like to address
some of the issues raised thus far. The hon. Member for Fareham does
not share my cynicism about the banks&#146; co-operation with the
reclaim fund, but I suspect that he will not deny that the definition
of dormancy in the Bill leaves leeway for interpretation. Such leeway
can be interpreted either advantageously or disadvantageously from the
banks&#146; point of view. That is entailed in the voluntary scheme.
The hon. Gentleman will also acknowledge the risk of partial
co-operation and agree that there should be no occasion when the
banking industry realises that it can simply fob off the reclaim fund
with a pittance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000153"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises various points. The
triennial review, which was removed from the Bill during
yesterday&#146;s sitting, would have created the power to ensure that
banks comply with best practice and do not accept the minimum
definition. Some light has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>shone on the matter, and that is why a statutory requirement for a
triennial review is a good idea, to ensure that the banks keep up to
the mark.</div>
<a name="08101651000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000154"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I certainly agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
idea about regular reviews. I hoped that the Minister&#146;s promise
was sufficient in that regard. If one of my amendments, which was not
selected, had been accepted, it would have given teeth to the triennial
review, including the idea of a mandatory fall-back position if the
voluntary nature of the scheme did not to deliver the goods.</div>
<a name="08101651000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to echo the supportive words of my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak
when he spoke about creating a purpose to the review that we were all
so strenuously in favour of yesterday, when dealing with the triennial
report in what was formerly clause 12. We all believe that the project
should be scrutinised, especially as the Bill is a novel concept to the
British banking system, and even more so as it is the first voluntary
regulatory system in the world. My hon. Friend rightly stated that the
scrutiny required teeth. Such teeth would be undoubtedly present if the
Government had a fall-back option in a mandatory scheme.</div>
<a name="08101651000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">If such a report was to
condemn the voluntary nature of the scheme in three years&#146; time,
the Government would have an easy recourse. In that sense, the new
clause is less of a major shift than a work of minor dentistry in
restoring the Government&#146;s teeth. Installing a mandatory scheme
is the ultimate deterrent to the banks&#146; non-compliance with the
voluntary scheme.</div>
<a name="08101651000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not alone in the
view that we require some sort of mandatory threat to underline the
voluntary scheme. In that view, I am joined by the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations and the cross-party Treasury Committee, which
stated</div><a name="08101651000122"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
are unconvinced that the Government is correct to pursue a voluntary
approach. A compulsory scheme has the overwhelming advantage of
guaranteeing fairness and consistency between institutions. We urge the
Government to reconsider the voluntary basis of its proposals. If the
Government is still minded to continue with a voluntary scheme, we
recommend that the forthcoming legislation be prepared so as to include
reserve powers for Ministers to establish a compulsory scheme at a
later date without recourse to further primary legislation, should a
voluntary scheme prove unsuccessful&#148;.</div>
<a name="08101651000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that new clause 2
seeks to do is to give powers to the Government in the
future.</div>
<a name="08101651000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
address the issue of fairness. Why should some banks contribute and
others not? In about 2001, I wrote to all banking institutions and sent
over 100 letters. Not that many banks have closed in that
time. However, the British Bankers Association says that only 11 banks
have pledged to take part, and some of those have disappeared in the
past few weeks. There is a disparity, and that sentiment is echoed in
my early-day motion, which had the support of nearly 100 hon. Members,
including the current Treasury spokesman for the Liberal
Democrats.</div>
<a name="08101651000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday,
the Minister seemed to suggest that too much bureaucracy was entailed
in inserting such a proposal into the Bill and that such a clause was
too wide ranging. In an attempt to pre-empt the Minister from taking
such a line of logic, I ask him to name  any of the
bureaucratic challenges that such a clause would pose.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="08101651000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill has
already more than ably created a reclaim fund, a distribution network
and a report system. A body already exists in the Financial Services
Authority capable of market regulation. In the unlikely event that the
clause should ever need to be activated, little else seems to be
required. The banks would be legally compelled to do that which is
already perfectly consistent for them to do voluntarily.</div>
<a name="08101651000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
Minister that concerns about the potential technicalities of the new
clause when activated are not worthy of consideration, for the nature
and existence of the new clause in the Bill as a threat should mean
that it would never need to be activated. The shadow of a mandatory
scheme, rather than a mandatory scheme itself, would ensure total
compliance with the voluntary
scheme.</div><a name="08101651000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout
these debates, the Minister has assured us of the banks&#146;
co-operation with the Bill and the future voluntary scheme. Such a view
should not create any opposition to the new clause&#146;s insertion.
If the banks co-operate fully, the voluntary scheme will work&#151;a
report will say so&#151;and there will be no need to activate the new
clause. Following the Minister&#146;s line of logic, the worst that
the new clause can ever be is slightly
redundant.</div><a name="08101651000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of us have been sceptical from the outset about the voluntary scheme
and the banks&#146; co-operation with it. However, the Minister has
largely brought us round to the idea of banking co-operation. I confess
that I still am sceptical about the numbers adding up and about how
&#163;400 million can change into &#163;50 million overnight in
response to the loss of just 10 years&#146; worth of dormant funds.
However, I am willing to accept the flexibility and the less regulatory
benefits of a voluntary scheme. I have come half way; I ask the
Minister to come the other half of the distance, by agreeing to the new
clause, so that we can meet in the middle.</div>
<a name="08101651000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The apposite
words of my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak seem to echo
throughout these debates. One should not try to smash a nut with a
sledgehammer&#151;I have no desire to do so&#151;but inserting some
shadow of enforcement to the regulatory scheme will ensure that we are
not smashing a nut with a feather either. The new clause is fit for
purpose if it ever needs to be enacted. However, most importantly, its
dormant presence in the Bill would provide a perfect deterrent to
ensure compliance with the voluntary scheme. The worst that it could
ever be is an unused power. I do not see that as something to fear, and
I hope that the Minister will support this change to the
legislation.</div><a name="08101651000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101651000155"></a><b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend on
his robustly moderate proposal, which is highly appropriate, and I echo
every word of his speech, not least because he quoted me at length. I
simply want to add that we have, at the moment, taken the stand that we
are the only country in the world that will proceed with a voluntary
scheme. All the other schemes are mandatory. I am saying not that that
is wrong, but simply that if the voluntary scheme does not work, we do
not have a fall-back position in the
Bill.</div><a name="08101651000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
that my hon. Friend&#146;s new clause would do is provide that
fall-back position so that we could put things right if they did not
work as they should, without resorting once again to primary
legislation. I hope that the new clause receives a
welcome.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div><a name="08101651000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101651000156"></a><b class="B">Matthew
Taylor</b> (Truro and St. Austell) (LD): These dormant
accounts have been enormously valuable to the banks and the truth is
that they were an unwritten, unannounced, highly profitable source of
effectively free money for them over a huge period. The growing
awareness of that has led other countries and this Government to take
action. Bluntly, it is hard to understand why such a practice should
have continued. It seems better to put the money into good causes.
There are arguments about how that should take place and about the good
causes process. Those arguments have been had during consideration of
the Bill, and the Government have a settled position on them.</div>
<a name="08101651000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">All I would
say in support of the new clause is that we have experienced a period
of weeks in which we have seen just how wrong the banks can get things.
Not just in this country but internationally, a tighter hand is needed
on the tiller to ensure that banks act properly and that they take into
account their countries&#146; and the economy&#146;s long-term
interests, rather than just the short-term payouts to those on bonuses.
There has never been a better moment to introduce measures that say to
the banks, &#147;We are serious about you doing this. We believe
it&#146;s right for the country and the right use of those funds, and
if you don&#146;t take that course of action as seriously as you
should, we will take action.&#148; That is what the new clause would
do.</div><a name="08101651000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
large banks are likely to act on these measures. If they do not, there
will be queries at the margin. Some people may think that the matter is
just not important enough for primary legislation&#151;there may be
complaints or criticisms&#151;but it is unlikely that the Government
would wish to initiate primary legislation to crack a nut with a
sledgehammer, to use the words of the hon. Member for Clwyd, South and
others.</div><a name="08101651000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would let the nuts know that the Government do not need to
take a sledgehammer to them, but that they have that power if they need
it. That is why I support new clause
2.</div><a name="08101651000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000157"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will try to reply to the arguments put by my
hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South, who is a long-standing
champion of using dormant accounts for good purposes. I appreciate the
genuine difference between our views on the matter. I shall set out why
we propose a voluntary approach before turning to the specific question
of using empowering legislation to change our approach in future, as
new clause 2 would
allow.</div><a name="08101651000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Participation
in a scheme will be voluntary for individual banks and building
societies. I am pleased that support for that approach was voiced on
Second Reading and that it is being voiced in the Committee. It is
clearly right to introduce a voluntary scheme where we believe that one
will
work.</div><a name="08101651000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that our proposals are innovative. The unclaimed assets scheme
will not be like mandatory schemes elsewhere, such as in Ireland or the
United States, but it would be wrong to assume that because we are
doing it differently we are mistaken. From the start, our approach has
been based on the sector&#146;s clear and full commitments to
participating in a voluntary scheme and making it a success. We welcome
those commitments, which distinguish our scheme from the Irish and US
examples. That is one reason why we can take forward a voluntary scheme
with confidence.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div><a name="08101651000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw
attention to the public commitments set out in the joint foreword to
last year&#146;s Treasury consultation document, which was signed by
the BBA and the Building Societies Association. Again, in press notices
released by the industry in November last year, and as recently as 2
October this year, the industry confirmed its commitment to the scheme.
That commitment is further illustrated by the commitments made by the
major UK banking groups that have participated in discussions with the
Government. Those banking groups represent an estimated 90 per cent. of
all retail and savings balances held by such institutions in the
UK.</div>
<a name="08101651000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend suggested that a significant number of banks and building
societies might not participate. The fact that institutions
representing about 90 per cent. of all retail and savings balances have
committed to participation is to be welcomed, and I hope that that
reassures
him.</div><a name="08101651000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000158"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> Therefore, 10 per cent. of balances are not
represented. Only 11 organisations have said in the BBA document that
they will take part. There are a great many other banks. They might be
small, but they have been going for a long time. Coutts, for example,
is not on the bankers&#146; list. What worries me is that significant
funds will not be included. The element of fairness is also an issue.
How will the banks that take part in the scheme feel about banks that
do not&#151;in other words, that are using this money as a float, as
the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell said earlier? The banks like
having this money. Some of them are happy to give it up; others are
not. To ensure fairness and that everybody complies, we should include
the new clause in the
Bill.</div><a name="08101651000125"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000159"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I said that an estimated 90 per cent. of retail
and savings balances are held by institutions that have agreed to
participate in the scheme, but I want to emphasise that that is, so
far. As we move forward with consideration of the Bill and as the
reclaim fund becomes established, I expect that banks and building
societies that are not participating at the moment&#151;the smaller
ones that my hon. Friend refers to&#151;will come on board. It is a
healthy sign that, even before day one, we have 90 per cent. of savings
and retail balances committed to the scheme. Let us also ensure that we
up that
figure.</div><a name="08101651000082"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000160"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Coutts is part of RBS, which is one of the banks
participating in the scheme. A large number of banks will not be
participating because they do not do any retail business. Some of the
big US banks here do predominantly wholesale business and do not have
the retail deposits. We need to be careful when saying that only 11
groups have signed up, as it is 11 out of a much smaller population
that does just retail
transactions.</div><a name="08101651000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000161"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I also
want to respond to the points about whether the banks have a
disincentive to participate in the scheme. I do not believe that that
is the case. The high levels of participation already achieved should
reassure the Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div><a name="08101651000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
banking industry estimates that only seven hundredths of 1 per cent. of
the total in retail banking and savings balances are dormant accounts,
I do not think that there is a strong disincentive to participate in
the scheme. The industry itself clearly rejects any arguments that
retaining money on its balance sheets is a disincentive to
participation, even in these turbulent times. We must ask whether seven
hundredths of 1 per cent. is a real incentive. I do not think it is. I
do not believe it is a significant motivation for the banks, but it is
a significant amount for us as we consider its potential to be used for
good
causes.</div><a name="08101651000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000162"></a>Matthew
Taylor:</b> I certainly echo the Minister on that last point.
One has to be aware that the banks have effectively treated this money
as capital, not as a normal deposit fund with the associated costs.
Over time, those dormant accounts are transferred and in effect treated
as part of the capital base of the bank. That money is of more
significant value to them than this.</div>
<a name="08101651000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">If only 10
per cent. of banks have not agreed&#151;presumably, some of those
will participate later&#151;and a few per cent. of what are
effectively freeloaders are not participating, is it realistic that the
Minister will return to the House asking for new primary legislation?
Presumably, he is saying that he is willing to accept up to 10 per
cent. of this cash not being paid over and the banks sitting on
it.</div><a name="08101651000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000163"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not think that hon. Gentleman makes a very
good argument. So far, 90 per cent. of all retail and savings balances
will be taken into account, given the commitments already made by the
banks. I expect that figure to increase as more want to
participate.</div>
<a name="08101651000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Clwyd, South also asked about the bureaucracy of
a mandatory scheme. The voluntary approach in the Bill brings
flexibility and clear advantages. There are downsides to a compulsory
approach. Our legislation provides a clear, minimum definition of
dormancy, but allows institutions to refer to a range of indicators to
determine whether an account is genuinely dormant. We discussed that in
the early stages of consideration of the Bill. As a result, the scheme
will be less rigid than other international examples. Therefore, it can
be based on existing industry systems, helping to reduce unnecessary
administrative costs, and it can be kept up to date, in line with the
latest
technology.</div><a name="08101651000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not requiring an additional system to be imposed on all the banks,
which would create bureaucracy if we followed a mandatory approach. The
voluntary approach also enables us to use private sector expertise in
the reclaim fund so as to manage the liabilities to account holders. It
is right to ask the private sector, which has the expertise, to manage
the reclaim risk and to take on that
function.</div><a name="08101651000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000164"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I remind my hon. Friend that I am not suggesting in
the new clause that there should be a mandatory scheme. I want merely
to give him the power to have that mandatory option should the
voluntary scheme fail or not work to its fullest extent. I find it
astonishing that a Government should reject having powers given to
them.</div><a name="08101651000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000165"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I shall come on specifically to the reserve power
that my hon. Friend proposes, but I thought it right to dwell on why we
believe that a voluntary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>scheme will work&#151;because it is widely supported&#151;and why it
has advantages over a mandatory scheme. Generally, my view is that if I
do not think something is the right thing to do, I do not want a power
to do
it.</div><a name="08101651000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
voluntary scheme has to be highly transparent to demonstrate that banks
and building societies are delivering on their commitments, maintain
public confidence in the scheme and strengthen further the incentives
for institutions to reunite customers with their money and genuinely to
transfer dormant accounts. We all want to see that. We have already
discussed the disclosure requirements, but we believe that the
voluntary scheme will work, be transparent and
succeed.</div><a name="08101651000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn to the question of having a power to convert the scheme to a
compulsory one. In light of the sector&#146;s clear and demonstrable
support for a voluntary scheme, we see no reason to take a reserve
power to establish a compulsory one. Furthermore, we have fundamental
concerns about the appropriateness of such a
power.</div><a name="08101651000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
compulsory scheme would look completely different from a voluntary one.
It could not rely on the industry&#146;s willingness to establish the
reclaim fund. The Bill would have to establish a reclaim fund as, in
effect, a public body. It would have to set out the criminal sanctions
that would apply to institutions that failed to comply with the scheme,
and that would have to be monitored and regulated. Such an enforcement
framework would not be compatible with a private sector-run reclaim
fund. I could go on, but the implications are
clear.</div><a name="08101651000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000166"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> I understand a lot of what my hon. Friend is
saying, although I think he is overstating his case a little. He would
win me round if he answered my question in the affirmative. Yesterday,
we were grateful for his undertaking to come back with an amendment on
the review in three years&#146; time. Will he assure us that that
review will be capable of making significant, radical and robust
changes to the scheme to make it work better, if, in the opinion of the
review, improvements need to be
made?</div><a name="08101651000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000167"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I want the review three years after the fund has
been established to be a proper one. It will be a review of the
operational effectiveness of the fund. If there are clear deficiencies,
I would expect action to be taken. The review will certainly look at
the effectiveness of a voluntary approach. I have difficulties with
taking a reserve power whereby the Government could, by order, take
significant action that is really appropriate to primary
legislation.</div><a name="08101651000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
compulsory scheme would require extensive
legislation&#151;significantly more than is proposed. I suspect that
it would involve double the number of clauses. It would not be
appropriate to deal with the issue through secondary legislation. If
the review in three years&#146; time said that there was a major
failing in the voluntary approach and that a mandatory one was
required, we would have to look to primary legislation, because we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>would be talking about compulsory participation and criminal sanctions
for not participating, and quite extensive monitoring and regulation
regimes would have to be put in place. It would not be appropriate to
deal with such extensive legislation through the secondary legislation
route.</div><a name="08101651000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that, on reflection, hon. Members will agree with what I have
said. It is not our intention to take substantial reserve powers that
we do not believe are currently necessary. We might want to come back
to the issue, but at the moment we believe strongly that the voluntary
approach will work. It is widely supported by the banking and building
society sector. Therefore, new clause 2 is unnecessary and I invite
hon. Members to oppose it if it is pressed to a
vote.</div><a name="08101651000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101651000168"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> Having listened to the Minister and looked at my
troops, I shall not press the new clause, but in the hope that the
