<H4><center>Clause 45</center></H4>
<H4><center>Commencement</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 76, in page 16, line 17, after `may'', insert `after consulting the Governor of the Bank of England.'.-- [Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson): The amendment is not necessary. The Opposition are making such a silly point about whether a date will be set. The Treasury will obviously consult the Governor informally on the most suitable date for bringing the Act into force. It is a matter of common sense. Filling the last few minutes before lunch, as the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) did, was a waste of time. I propose that we waste no more.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I have heard some inadequate replies, but never one quite like that. The hon. Gentleman could not remember a thing about the clause or the amendment, nor what I had said. I spoke about the relationship between the Bank of England and the Treasury, and the need for consultation and preparation before the Bill is brought into force. I rather hoped that the Paymaster General would respond. Perhaps the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) will do it instead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Can the right hon. Gentleman tell us of another Act where there had to be consultation before it came into force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, such consultation occurs frequently, but the Bill is a rather good example. We referred to the consultation exercise in a previous debate, so the hon. Gentleman's observation was, as usual, extremely helpful.
<P>
I am not asking for a radical departure from the way in which the House normally legislates, I simply wish the consultation to be made explicit by amending clause 45. It is particularly important in this case because of the radical changes being made to the Bank's responsibilities as against those of the Treasury. Indeed, as I mentioned, it is something of a swap. I hesitate to repeat myself, but if the Paymaster General was not listening I shall say again that the monetary policy responsibilities of the Treasury go to the Bank, and the banking supervision responsibilities of the Bank go to the Treasury. It is important that everyone is ready, that all the expertise has been redeployed and that systems are in place, and the Bank has an enormous responsibility to ensure that.
<P>
We know that tensions existed at an earlier stage about the arrangements. We therefore believe that it is appropriate that the Governor should be formally consulted as to whether he is ready. Otherwise, if something goes wrong, the Treasury will doubtless blame the Bank and the Bank will blame the Treasury--and the House of Commons will blame both. Explicit consultation before the Bill comes into effect would be highly beneficial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): the real concern is that a similar problem arose in the United States over the thrift situation. That savings and loans catastrophe, which cost the American taxpayer $500 billion, arose from the transfer of supervision from one part of the United States to another part--from Arkansas to Texas. It was that change, where the authorities took their eye off the ball of regulation, which caused the problem. If the Bill comes into force before the various institutions are ready, we could suffer the same catastrophe here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend has helpfully given us an example of precisely when something went wrong--something very serious in that case--and we do not want it to happen here.
<P>
I made some of these points before lunch. I realise that the Paymaster General has other things on his mind and his attention may been been wandering to other matters, but if I can bring him back to the Bill, which is important to us, he might care to address some of the points that my hon. Friends and I have made, rather than saying dismissively that they are a load of rubbish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is speaking a load of rubbish because he knows that he and his hon. Friends do not have it in their hearts to oppose the Bill. We have had to sit here and listen to a load of twaddle. The amendment is totally redundant, otiose and useless in the extreme. If the Opposition are minded to push it to a vote, we shall of course resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We have obviously stunned the hon. Gentleman. We have raised him from his torpor--perhaps he did have a very good lunch--and have reminded him that his period of inattention before lunch--for personal reasons, no doubt--has caused him to get up.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is an awful lot of chatter and sedentary interventions. I think people are a becoming little demob happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We must not allow that to happen because we have not finished yet. It will not be over until the fat lady has sung, as they say in opera. Until we have completed all our deliberations, we must not allow our concentration to lapse.
<P>
As the Paymaster General has not answered any of our points and was completely deaf to what we were saying before lunch--again, he seems to be reading some other notes, which I hope are more relevant than they were before lunch--we shall express our dismay be pressing for a Division.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
To borrow the analogy of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), but with suitable modifications, I think the fat lady is now about to sing because we have now come to the end of this process with only one clause on the amendment paper for consideration. I suspect that the reason why other new clauses were tabled but not called, although it is a matter for you, Mr. McWilliam, rather than me, is the strange nature of the legal proceedings.
<P>
We are effectively legislating for the Bank of England's regulatory powers over the banking system in a vacuum, which will be filled by the Financial Services Authority. That authority exists only in shadow form. I hasten to say again that that is not a criticism of those who have been selected for the important job of putting the authority together, either individually or collectively. I am sure that they will wish to do a good job. Indeed, the intention of the new clause is to strengthen their resolve and to foster and encourage their credibility with the financial services sector.
<P>
We are saying goodbye to the Bank of England's responsibilities in this area; they will go to a new authority, but the legislation setting up that authority does not yet exist. We are in both a valedictory and pre-legislative mode for the new FSA and some of our debates, which, in his more generous moments the Paymaster General might have acknowledged, have been about necessary safeguards that we need in the new FSA in the interests of building up a new relationship of confidence in the financial services sector, which we all agree is important.
<P>
Some of the points--minor and major--that we have raised have been about that, and we have had useful dialogues not only with Ministers but with the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), who is an expert in banking finance. If we are wise--Ministers and Opposition Members alike--we should treat it as a voyage of exploration on which we shall not reach the final answers, although we shall try to approximate to the ideal. It is in that spirit that we move the new clause. As the summation of what we have been saying about the whole process, I hope that whatever response--preferably friendly--the Government give to it they will ensure that the new shadow authority adopts those practices in shadow, as it begins to regulate the banking sector, and that those points are in due course reflected in the legislation setting up the FSA. One could say that it is a kind of first reading of a Second Reading debate that will no doubt take place in due course. The clause should be seen alongside a number of new clauses that were not selected for debate, I suspect because they were not tied to the Bill, including the one on matters to be covered on Report about the FSA, which makes a number of important points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Earlier today, I was very sympathetic to one of the hon. Gentleman's proposed amendments on publication of the memorandums of understanding, as I have had difficulty getting access to those in the past. Is there any precedent for that? Ombudsmen deal with the public's complaints about institutions: the banking ombudsman takes the public's complaints about banks; and the investment ombudsman deals with complaints about investors. But the mechanism that we are discussing is extraordinary. It purports to deal with the relationship between the Bank and the regulator and there is no precedent for that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I should have thought that coming from the supposedly radical party--although these days some of us have our doubts about that--the hon. Gentleman would not have felt that the argument that there was no precedent was in itself a sufficient reason for not taking action. In constructing the argument--which the hon. Gentleman will appreciate I have not yet done--I wish to say that there is a need for at least some procedure to run by those issues. I have no definite blueprint in mind, which is why the new clause is drafted rather generally, but, given the need, the point remains that Ministers should think about it. One or two of my hon. Friends may wish to make speeches; I am sure they would also wish to weigh their remarks and come out with what I called an approximation to the right solution.
<P>
I was saying that the contacts that I have had over recent months and during the passage of the Bill with representative institutions--they are responsible people and not ones who let their consciences out on the street--have shown that the financial services industry is concerned that the setting up of the new authority should be done with maximum consultation and not lip service, that its constitution of the new authority in its operation should be as transparent as possible--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</B> indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I note the Paymaster General nodding at the principle, if not the detail. We heard in earlier debates about the importance of minimising charges and compliance costs and we also debated the importance of maintaining the international competitiveness of the financial services sector. I would be sorry not to refer to my hon. Friends' interest in the accelerated transfer of regulatory functions. We had the banking functions that are now going; one or two of the self-regulators may wish to move that on. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), who knows a lot about that, may want to make a contribution on the matter. It is important that when they are ready, they should be prepared to move over; if they are going to move over, they need to do so to something worth having.
<P>
The Paymaster General, perceptively as ever, drew a distinction--one that I made in a different context--between the customer end and the institutional end of banking. The distinction that I made, in Committee, was a slightly wider one: the difference between wholesale and retail. If one takes the whole piece, from international bankers or investment bankers in London at one end, there solely to lend to other institutions, through retail, clearing or even merchant bankers dealing with smaller institutions in the United Kingdom or venture capitalists in the middle, all the way down to people whose work is largely with the retail sector, that involves a huge range of people.
<P>
The purpose of the new clause, well-headed after its entertaining misprint in its first, blue paper print, is the resolution of disputes. We want a sensible way of saying that there is a result. Whether that is done by an ombudsman, it is important that the Government should show a commitment to thinking about the right system. I would immediately concede to the Paymaster General that one does not need exactly the same system for different types of case: Mrs. Snooks, for example, or Aunt Agatha, with a small deposit account for which the pass-book somehow got lost in 1937, or a dormant account, which might be even more contentious, are not quite the same as an international name who happens to have a spat with the Governor about some aspect of what he has been asked to do. That may indeed qualify the Government's response. We need to set down guidelines for a procedure for resolving such issues at the appropriate level and a commitment by the Government to do that.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to touch on another point briefly, about the final phrase of the new clause, which I added myself to my no doubt imperfect drafting. Although it would be unworthy to suggest that the hon. Member for Dudley, North had an interest in the matter as a lawyer, he may wish to comment. I said that it should be without prejudice to any rights of law because the institutions, particulary at the professional end of the job, whose staff will read what will doubless become the bank of England Act, will have the staff, time and means of redress to deal with that.
<P>
I have muttered the words ``judicial review'' in Committee. There may well be cases where people will take the Government to law. I am not fishing for trouble and I hope that that does not happen, but if they did, institutions would no doubt have the means to deal with it. We are not anxious to take that away. However, there may be a run of relatively unsophisticated modestly-sized institutions, such as some of the smaller, local mutual building societies, which are still around, which may wish to get themselves into a dispute. There may be cases where the full might of the law could be invoked against the Bank for the conduct of its activities or for example, administrative procedures where, there has been unreasonable delay and they might not know where to turn.
<P>
A further extension to that is the retail end of it, where different customers are concerned, and here there may be a different perspective because some of the institutions involved will also want clarity in the way that the FSA will handle its new disputes procedure, whatever that is, so that it does not feel disadvantaged by having some opaque or anomalous system that applies to one fund, but not another.
<P>
The new clause is put in at the tail end of the Bill to give us an opportunity to discuss an important matter. The matter is already substantive, because the Bill will transfer banking supervision, and it will become even more important as the complexity of the FSA rolls out and is eventually embodied in new legislation.
<P>
The new clause was not tabled in a spirit of contumely or dissent. Despite the Paymaster General's slightly dismissive remarks to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, Conservative members of the Committee have sought to engage in the issues and to ensure, as is our job, that Ministers engage in them too.
<P>
As the fat lady quits the stage, the new clause is the final marker, enabling us to say that the Bill is extremely complex and, as yet, incomplete. It will inevitably involve some disputes and disagreements, although I hope that, through our efforts, there will be as few as possible. It will create a new structure, which will need a means of resolving disputes as effectively as possible. In that spirit, I commend the new clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn: </B>(Guildford): My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) does himself a disservice. I have become attuned to the lilting tones of the Economic Secretary, and was looking forward to hearing the stats lady sing before the end of our proceedings. Sadly, she is not with us, but I am delighted that the Paymaster General is holding court this afternoon. I give him fair warning that we may touch on some of the issues that we raised this morning; he will be the best equipped of his team to respond to them, and I hope that he will stay the entire course.
<P>
At the end of our consideration of the Bill, it is helpful to be able to discuss such a wide-ranging new clause. It refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an institution subject to regulation by the Authority'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so would apply not only to the self-regulatory organisations, which will be subsumed into the authority, but to the banks that will be supervised by the authority.
<P>
I begin by explaining how the new clause would benefit the self-regulatory organisations. By doing so, I hope that I may overcome the obstacle of the fact that you, Mr. McWilliam, in your wisdom, did not choose to call new clause 3 for debate, no doubt for the best of reasons.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. The new clause is not wide-ranging. It deals only with the institutions under part III of the Bill--namely, the banks.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> But surely, Mr. McWilliam, we have to consider the self-regulatory organisations that will be brought into the authority's ambit under part III. As has been said, their future may well be in limbo.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let me help the hon. Gentleman. The new clause deals only with part III, which relates only to those organisations--the banks--that are currently under the Bank's supervisory authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful for that advice, Mr. McWilliam, as it may hasten the end of my speech, which I am sure you will find helpful.
<P>
There is an important point, however. How will the authority cope with the fact that it has to absorb the SROs? The problems that arise may affect its ability to regulate the institutions that it governs under part III. If its time is taken up in sorting out problems relating to the SROs, there may be even more need for an ombudsman to intervene, especially as many of the institutions are not merely banks; their investment and stock and share trading activities are currently regulated by the SROs.
<P>
It is entirely relevant to the debate to consider the impact on the authority of this period of limbo and, therefore, on its ability to reach into every corner, nook and cranny of the banks that it has been asked to regulate under part III. I am concerned that the Government did not allow sufficient consultation with either self-regulatory organisations or banks. Having an ombudsman is like having a consulter-in-chief.
<P>
I am also concerned that the process is far too protected. From the Financial Services Authority's outline booklet, we know that it expects the Bill to come into force next April, when the FSA will become the contractor for the staff of the SROs. However, under the current timetable, the SROs will not be finally absorbed until autumn 1999. During that 18-month period, the intention is to experiment with different forms of regulation. The FSA's booklet states that, during phase 2,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Pilot schemes for alternative Phase 3 organisational models for supervision''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``undertaken''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, today, banks understand the regulatory environment in which they work. If any part of their activities is to be subject to regulation under pilot schemes, an unnecessary burden might be placed on them. If an office of ombudsman had sufficient expertise in financial services, it would be welcomed; it would reassure the financial service industry in London that its concerns would be met.
<P>
I hope that we succeed in our aim of persuading the Government to appoint an office of ombudsman. If we do not succeed, I hope that we return to that matter on Report. Some of the SROs; leading members have made it clear that they, too, are concerned about the length of the period that the old organisations will be left in limbo.
<P>
I should be grateful to hear the Government's comments, especially on the matter of regulators taking their eye off the ball. Do the Governement accept that they will bear the responsibility if the protracted implementation period, and the hiatus caused by the pilot schemes, produce weaknesses in the regulatory system that will remain for 18-months? In 12 monthes' time, it will be unacceptable for the Government to blame a regulatory failure on the 1986 Act, passed by the previous Government, and to say, ``We are doing something about it, folks.'' They are responsible now, and they must accept that responsibility. They have built in a hiatus; they have built in an added danger. I am concerned that they have done so when there are many changes in the banking industry.
<P>
Some Labour Members realise that time scales have changed. We live in a world where a business that started from virtually nothing can be worth more than &#163;100 million in a few years, but we also live in a world where a bank worth &#163;800 million or more can be reduced to next to nothing in a few weeks. That is the scale of change that has taken place in the banking industry.
<P>
Although we have grown used to fluctuations in the markets, and the markets have prepared themselves for various trading conditions, there will always be freak circumstances and abnormal trading conditions. In today's world, banks are involved in trading shares, futures and other derivatives, and in dealing with foreign exchange, and are increasingly reliant for income on their success in that trading environment, rather than from old-fashioned credit analysis and lending on the strength of their capital. It is conceivable--I hope that it will not happen--that the wheels might start to come off.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is 10 years since we last saw truly abnormal conditions in the stock market, and it is more than five years since we saw abnormal conditions in the foreign exchange market. There has been a remarkable period of stability. The Opposition do not presume that those conditions will continue. Indeed, our deep concern is that, in their handling of the transitional period, the Government will not have equipped the regulator with the means required to cope with such conditions.
<P>
The role of an ombudsman in such a situation might be to find a means of accelerating the merger of the old regulatory organisations into the new authority. Those who run the old SROs may welcome an acceleration of their integration into the FSA. Indeed, under the 1986 Act, and without any new legislation, it will be possible for the SROs voluntarily to give up that function if they deemed themselves incompetent. It is a tough test to ask SROs, who regard themselves as doing a pretty good job in the London market, to stand up and say, ``Because we want to accelerate the process, we have to tell you that we are incompetent''. There is a way round the problem, which the Government should consider. Before the 18 months is up, the realisation will grow in the FSA that an opportunity has been missed to provide for an accelerated procedure.
<P>
The other point that I wish to raise relates to aspects of information. We have spent much time, during our discussion of the Bill, saying that the authority should be as well informed as possible. That is balanced by our desires that the rights of private individuals in their personal affairs is not jeopardised.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the purpose of the new clause is to accelerate the process of regulatory integration rather than to resolve disputes between parties? If so, it seems odd that it is not mentioned in the new clause. As well as the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North, it seems odd that an ombudsman should be required to accelerate the rate of regulatory integration.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman was listening carefully to my initial remarks and will understand that we were in some difficulty, because new clause 3 had not been selected. I did not wish to abuse my position on the Committee by stretching your patience, Mr. McWilliam. However, I am grateful to have had the chance to make those points on new clause 5.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will answer those important points. As I said, they were spurred by comments received from senior members of the self-regulatory organisations during the last month or so. On the question of information, the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) will agree that there is a conflict between the need to find out what is going on in the banks and the right of individuals to protect their private affairs. Regulatory failures have occured in the past because of the failure of banks to acquire sufficient information in a timely fashion.
<P>
The conflict that the ombudsman should be equipped to resolve could occur in respect of those institutions that have operations not only in the United Kingdom, but overseas. I am not talking about substantial financial centres such as New York or Japan, but about those in less substantial financial areas and the legitimate banks that are located in what are usually described as tax havens. We welcome the business that they bring to London. A clear conflict may arise between the demands for information from the authority and the need to protect the true interests of customers who have acounts with the institutions, either personally or through other legal mechanisms in the foreign domicile and in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> This morning, Mr. McWilliam, I got into trouble with your predecessor in the Chair by straying too far from the amendment that was being debated, but I must ask the hon Gentleman how information gathering relates to the new clause? As you said, Mr. McWilliam, his previous remarks were not especially apposite, because part III of the Bill deals with the transfer of functions in respect of the regulation of banks, not with the SROs which are still dealt with under the Financial Services Act 1986. I thought that he was straying away from the Bill then, but we are now under your guidance, Mr. McWilliam. What on earth has information gathering to do with new clause 5?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon. Member for Guildford, I must inform the Committee that there might shortly be a Division in the Chamber. If there is one vote, I shall suspend the Committee for 15 minutes but, if there are two votes, I shall suspend our proceedings for half an hour.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I am sure that you do not want--no more than I do--the hon. Member for Dudley, North to usurp your position in deciding what is relevant for debate under new clause 5.
<P>
We have debated at some length the issue of information. There is a conflict. It will cause friction if the interests of individuals, the customers of such institutions, find that their activities are questioned in this country. Concern will be felt if the head of the Treasury--the chief tax-gatherer in the land and the peak of authority--gives powers to the authority that could be used to elicit information about the activities of such individuals. Although we do not wish to defend or protect anyone who is evading taxation, we want the system to be operated properly through the taxation legislation and the powers and authority of the Inland Revenue, not through powers given for the purposes of supervision. The interposition of the ombudsman would add a level of reassurance in that case.

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>5.26 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The hon. Member for Daventry, in his usual reasonable way, made some good points, and we see the merits in considering much of what he said. That does not mean that the hiatus, which so preoccupies the hon. Member for Guildford, is so great a problem.
<P>
There will be a period of consultation, and we agree that the fact that the regulatory system will be much wider than before needs to be borne in mind. The hon. Member for Daventry will understand if we resist the new clause, as it was a probing amendment to find out which way the thinking was going. I cannot give him a firm commitment before consultation. If an ombudsman were to provide the solution, which I know he does not mean in a technical way, it would be foolish to make commitments while the ombudsman arrangements were being reviewed. We shall consider the matter and bear in mind all that he and others say during the consultation, which we intend to make very real.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford mentioned SROs. As he knows, they will all be in place during the interim period; they know that their obligations, duties and responsibilities will remain. That is their job, just as it is the Government's job to be ultimately responsible in that period for the long-term arrangements to be put in place--the Government will be accountable to Parliament for what they do.
<P>
We all feel strongly that the grouping and plethora of separate regulating arrangements was not a good system. I remember the chairman of the Personal Investment Authority saying that the Barings case arose partly because the bank fell between two regulatory arrangements. I would not say that that was the whole reason but, by any standards, BCCI proves that existing arrangements were not perfect.
<P>
Nobody--least of all Howard Davies, who has ultimate responsibility--underestimates just what a big job it is to knit together the new system and make it effective. I note that there is no objection to it in principle, which is encouraging.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> At the heart of our concern is the question of morale, so perhaps the Paymaster General can tell us what the attrition rate has been among staff on the self-regulatory organisations and whether there has been any change since the announcement in May. He said that there may be weaknesses in the old system, and none of us denies it when he says that no system is perfect. Does he accept that, if weaknesses were to show up, they would be fairly and squarely the Government's responsibility because of how they have chosen to deal with the system?
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's second point is silly. His first sounded like an unusual planted question--[Interruption.] I thought it was a helpful plant--evidently, the hon. Gentleman is just misinformed instead of trying to be helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. On my second point, my hon. Friend was right to emphasise the importance of the interim period itself. The Paymaster General acknowledged--I am not necessarily agreeing with him on the particular case that he mentioned--that difficulties may have arisen because of the join between two different responsibilities. That is always a danger. One of the attractions of the FSA is that it would bring them together into a unified structure. I understand that, but the dangers are, first, getting there--a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford made so eloquently a number of times--and, secondly, given that the structures within the FSA will be somewhat different, involving wholesale banking, retail and other more mixed kinds of regime, it may be difficult to avoid some joins within. We cannot say simply that we have put it all together and that our problems are at an end. Nor, indeed, am I suggesting that the Paymaster General said that.
<P>
The third point that I put rather strongly to the Minister was that I recognise how well conceived such matters are in Whitehall. He knows, and I readily acknowledge, that officials are excellent at their jobs and that there is an atmosphere of seamless rationality about the place. However, by the time such matters get out into the sticks, a regulators' decision on a particular case may be made in a hurry when he is under pressure. Things do not always work out as planned. I say that, not to threaten the hon. Gentleman, but to emphasise the importance of gaining maximum consent and bringing people together.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have said several times in our proceedings that they wish to carry people with them but, however hard they set out to obtain consent, they must go the other mile and look again. They must not be afraid of listening to even the most trenchant and occasionally hostile of their critics, such as Michael Taylor and others, who all have points to make in the debate. There is a common wish to get the Bill right.
<P>
To use a classical phrase, the purpose of the new clause was to answer the question posed by a Roman historian, who asked, ``Who will guard the guardians?'' We have debated the new clause sensibly and I am sure that the hon. Member for Dudley, North--I almost called him my hon. Friend, given his helpful legal interventions--will accept that there are roles for the law and for parliamentary accountability, and that Ministers have a role to play in making the right major decisions.
<P>
The new clause is concerned about there being an element of administration--the micro side of matters. Ministers are not well advised to trespass day by day, but it is extremely important that those who may be trespassed against or trampled on, or who feel that they are being treated unfairly, unequally or inappropriately, have some means of redress. As the Paymaster General said, he needs to consult on that means of redress and get it right. It may not be the same for each category and we shoud be prepared to rest on those assurances.
<P>
To be frank, at times we haved been less than charitable--in my view, rightly--towards the Paymaster General on certain matters but, bearing in mind the festive season and that we are concluding our proceedings, which I hope have been helpful, I shall not press the motion to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>The Chairman:</B> It would have been in order to use the phrase, ``Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?''
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Before we agree to report the Bill, I wish on behalf of my hon. Friends to thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for chairing our proceedings with admirable good humour and tact, and for combining that with a degree of fairness to keep us in order. Will you kindly transmit our thanks to your co-Chairman, Mr. Butterfill, who discharged his duties with great skill. We had a guest appearance from Mrs. Dunwoody who also showed great professionalism.
<P>
I wish to thank others who have served our Committee--the Clerks and the Official Reporters who have had the difficult job of punctuating and applying the rules of grammar to our verbal outpourings.
<P>
Constructive criticism of the Bill has been made almost entirely by my hon. Friends rather than the Liberal Democrats. We always form a happy coalition when observing that they have not attended our sittings more than tangentially. Indeed, they have committed a discourtesy by not being present at the conclusion of our proceedings.
<P>
I thank especially my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry for his work in Committee. On previous occasions, he has had to have the benefit of advice from his mother. However, she has been less prominent in these proceedings; perhaps she is less interested in the Bank of England than in general finance matters. Despite that, all the contributions of my hon. Friend have been acute and to the point. In the spirit of Christmas, I thank the Government for answering at least some of our questions. In the cases when they did not do so, we shall ask them again on Report and on Third Reading.
<P>
<B>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mr. Alistair Darling): I join the shadow Chief Secretary, the right hon. Member for Wells, in thanking you, Mr. McWilliam, and your co-Chairmen, Mr. Butterfill and Mrs. Dunwoody, for chairing the proceedings. I also thank Hansard, who sometimes have a difficult task in following what hon. Members say. Hon. Members, especially new hon. Members, will find that what is written in Hansard often reads much better than the speech sounded when it was delivered.
<P>
For my own part, I thank the Economic Secretary and the Paymaster General for taking the Bill through its Committee stage. After the first week, pressing duties detained me elsewhere, but I followed the proceedings and know that my ministerial colleagues guided the Bill very well.
<P>
I also thank my hon. Friends who have sat on the Committee. Sitting on the Government Benches can sometimes be less exciting than sitting on the Opposition Benches, but, as all my hon. Friends assured me that they completely supported every line and word of the Bill, they obviously felt that silence was justified. They have put up with the long, sometimes interesting--sometimes not so interesting --contributions from Opposition members of the Committee.
<P>
I thank the Clerks, particularly parliamentary counsel. As far as the Treasury is concerned, the Bill was conceived on 2 May; to bring it to the end of the Committee stage in such a short period is no mean feat, as I know the shadow Chief Secretary, the right hon. Member for Wells, will appreciate, given that he was a Minister in the Conservative Government. The fact that the Bill is largely intact--although the Government have tabled a few minor amendments--is a great tribute to parliamentary counsel and the Treasury officials who worked long and hard on it.
<P>
The Opposition have acknowledged the Bill's importance. It is the first major reform of the Bank of England since 1946--that reform was introduced by the then Labour Government, of course. Not only does it give operational independence to the Bank to achieve the Government's inflation target, it paves the way for the first stage of what will be a major regulatory reform. As the Committee knows, the consultative Bill--the new financial services Bill--will be available next summer, and I dare say that many of my hon. Friends will even now be signing up to sit on the Committee that considers that Bill.
<P>
My only regret is that we have sat through Second Reading and the Committee's proceedings but still do not know whether the Opposition are for or against the Bill--perhaps we shall find out on Report or on Third Reading. The Committee's proceedings have been completed with great patience by you, Mr. McWilliam, and your co-Chairmen, and we are all grateful for that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On behalf of my colleagues, the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), I thank the right hon. Member for Wells and my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) for their kind remarks. Let me take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Serjeant at Arms, the police, my Clerk in particular, the Hansard Committee Sub-Editors and also the Hansard transcribers, whom none of us see but who are beavering away translating our gibberish into plain English or sometimes plain Latin--or even French.
<P>
I also thank all members of the Committee for being amazingly helpful and co-operative. There are many new Members of Parliament on the Committee and Committee procedure is not easy for those coming in from outside the House, as it is in some respects arcane. Our consideration of the Bill has been unique in that I have not been accused of anything particularly horrid, except by the Economic Secretary, who almost accused me of having a mid-life crisis. As she and I have been friends for more years than a gentleman would mention, I forgive her for that--she may well have been right. Thank you all very much indeed.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
