Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): Sometimes,
unnecessary or wrong documents are sent to the registrar. As things
stand, it can be virtually impossible to have the register amended, and
companies are often told that a court order is necessary. Often in such
cases, a document&#151;say, a form&#151;has been filled in wrongly.
All that the person who filled it in wants to do is get it back, put it
right and file it again. That must happen dozens of times every day,
but the process is much too
inflexible.</div><a name="06070518000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note
that the clause heading includes the words &#147;unnecessary
material&#148;. Will that be interpreted as including documents that
a filing company feels are
unnecessary?</div><a name="06070518000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070518000833"></a><b class="B">Paul
Farrelly</b> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab): Will the hon.
Gentleman confirm my arithmetic? In Committee this afternoon, we have
eight Labour Members while he is the sole representative of the
Conservative
Opposition.</div><a name="06070518000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000834"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think that we need to go down
that line, given that at 4.30 pm the Committee was not even
quorate.</div><a name="06070518000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000835"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Mr. Illsley. As I was saying, will
the words &#147;unnecessary material&#148; be interpreted as
including documents that the filing company, rather than just the
registrar, believes are
unnecessary?</div><a name="06070518000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000836"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):</b> The clause provides for cases in which a delivered
document contains unnecessary material for which there is no legal
requirement. It is clearly sensible that the registrar should not be
obliged to put such information on the register, so she can exclude it
and treat it as having been delivered defectively under clause 725. She
may then use the various procedures provided in the Bill for remedying
the situation, for example&#151;this is the key one&#151;the
informal correction procedure. She can also issue a notice to remedy
the defective delivery.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 418</div><a name="06070518000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision is intended to be
broad enough to cover all the matters that the hon. Gentleman raised.
It is a great advance and will be in everybody&#146;s
interests.</div><a name="06070518000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000837"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply, but will
she clarify whether the provision is to be used broadly and whether it
will work both ways so that the documents covered are what not just the
registrar, but a company, consider
unnecessary?</div><a name="06070518000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000838"></a>Vera
Baird:</b><b class="B"> </b>I think it will be for the registrar to
decide whether material is unnecessary, using the criteria set out in
subsection (2), which defines unnecessary material as that
which</div><a name="06070518000730"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is not needed to
comply with an obligation under any enactment, and...not
specifically authorised to be delivered to the
registrar.&#148;</div><a name="06070518000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is within
the ambit of the registrar to decide whether material comes within that
definition.</div><a name="06070518000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000839"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point that it is
ultimately down to the registrar to decide, but the point that I am
trying to make is that, in practice, a lot of companies will complete
and send in wrong forms, and all they will want to do is get their
forms back, fill them in properly and send them back. Will the
registrar be broad minded in her use of the clause to facilitate
companies changing their
forms?</div><a name="06070518000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000840"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The informal correction procedure will cover that.
If there has been a mistake, the company and the registrar can
telephone each other and put it right, whatever it is, but it more
appropriately falls under clause 726. Informal contact is a great
improvement.</div><a name="06070518000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000841"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> Will my hon. and learned Friend the Minister
join me in welcoming a second Conservative Member to the Committee to
join the nine Labour

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000842"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> A second Tory is welcome. It is nice to see
him.</div><a name="06070518000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070518000843"></a><b class="B">Mr.

grateful for that welcome. Forgive me,Mr. Illsley, but may I
say to Labour Members that with their record in this Committee, they
should enjoy the moment while they

730</h4><a name="06070518000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Public
notice of receipt of certain
documents</div><a name="06070518000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000845"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 380, in
clauseÂ 730,Â pageÂ 361,Â leave out line
23.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 419</div><a name="06070518000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000846"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be
convenient to discuss amendment No. 389, in
clauseÂ 751,Â pageÂ 372,Â leave out line
41.</div><a name="06070518000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000847"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause, which deals with the public notice
of receipt of certain documents, replaces section 711 of the Companies
Act 1985. I appreciate that some issues require publication, which is
also provided for in subsection (1)(b), but may I probe the Minister
and ask, further to the discussion that we had on this earlier today,
why in the electronic age people should still have to publish in the
<i class="I">Gazette</i>?</div><a name="06070518000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a cost to Companies House and to the company in placing an
advertisement, but it is unnecessary red tape, particularly as there
could be a central website on which all such notices were published at
what I expect would be a much lower
cost.</div><a name="06070518000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
know who reads the <i class="I">Gazette</i>. Not many people, I imagine. In
reality, it puts the public on notice only technically. Publishing an
advertisement in the <i class="I">Gazette </i>is not like publishing one in the
Sundays.</div><a name="06070518000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 389, the Bill again requires in clause 751 that notice be given in
the <i class="I">Gazette</i>. Is that not expensive and does it not go unnoticed?
Can we not move on to cheaper, more practical notice provisions? It
would help to have an idea of the costs involved. The amendments are
probing and aim to discover from the Minister how much Companies House
and companies spend per year on advertising in the
<i class="I">Gazette</i>.</div><a name="06070518000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000848"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Just so that I do not appear the slightest bit
churlish, let me welcome the third and fourth Opposition Members to the
Committee. We have nine Members on our side, but perhaps this running
commentary ought to cease
soon.</div><a name="06070518000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
cost of the <i class="I">Gazette </i>is some &#163;80,000 per annum. It lists
well over 1 million transactions, or entries, and is a permanent record
that libraries keep. I know that the hon. Gentleman in fact likes the
<i class="I">Gazette</i>. As was said earlier, there is no reason to do away with
it. The registrar must give appropriate publicity on incorporation, and
it is published in the <i class="I">London Gazette, Edinburgh Gazette </i>or
<i class="I">Belfast Gazette</i>, depending on where the company is. The
<i class="I">Gazette </i>is well known and of long standing, and users are
accustomed to referring to it for news of incorporations. Even I know
that one can look in
it.</div><a name="06070518000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
intention that the registrar will cease to publish in that way in the
near future. It is possible that developments in electronic publishing
over time will mean that alternative mechanisms become equally or more
appropriate. As the hon. Gentleman knows, clause 769 makes such
alternatives
available.</div><a name="06070518000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does anyone
use the <i class="I">Gazette</i>? I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman what the
readership is and I do not know how we can pin it down. We would have
to find out how many copies are purchased and then how many people, on
average, read each issue. That is the sort of thing that one gets only
from Bradshaw, so I do not know whether we can help
further.</div><a name="06070518000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
that a lot of the existing obligations to give notice in the
<i class="I">Gazette</i> come from European Community law, and the facility to
provide alternative means has been made available only recently. It is
not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 420</div>clear to what extent our partners in other member states would be aware
if we ceased to publish in that tried and tested way, so in due course
we will look at alternatives. However, there is currently no intention
of discontinuing publication in that
way.</div><a name="06070518000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070518000849"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): May I briefly indicate some
sympathy with the Opposition on this point? In this day and age, it
seems appropriate to move to electronic publication for easier access
and reduced cost. I would not go as far as to vote for the amendment,
and I do not think that the Opposition will press it anyway, but I want
to flag that point
up.</div><a name="06070518000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000850"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It seems that the <i class="I">Gazette </i>is going to get
a reprieve this
afternoon.</div><a name="06070518000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this day
and age, there must be a better alternative to what is in most
practitioners&#146; minds a bore, to be frank. I shall leave my
comments there, but I hope that the Government will perhaps put their
mind to how that could be changed. I appreciate that the Bill provides
for changes to be made in the use of the <i class="I">Gazette, </i>if necessary.
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070518000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000851"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause deals with documents subject to the
directive disclosure requirements and replaces section 711 of the 1985
Act. It continues to implement the first company law directive as
amended by directive 2003/58/EC and lists the documents of which notice
must be published in the <i class="I">Gazette</i>. Will the Minister confirm that
that list is identical to the current
one?</div><a name="06070518000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000852"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Sometimes, I could swear that the hon. Gentleman is
reading my notes. The clause, which partly replaces section 711, lists
the documents to which the directive disclosure requirements apply. It
derives from Community legislation&#151;principally, the first
company law directive as amended by directive 2003/58/EC. So, there is
little or no discretion about the content of the
clause.</div><a name="06070518000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is important for how it links in with other clauses, such as
clause 730, which provides that the registrar must publish notice when
issuing listed documents, and clause 721, which ensures that the listed
document be capable of being sent in electronic form. From what I said
in the first paragraph of my remarks, that seems to be continuity
rather than change. I think that that answers the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
question.</div><a name="06070518000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000853"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My question is indeed answered, and I can assure

to give public notice and replaces section 42 of the 1985 Act. It sets

(2)&#151;unless notice of the event has duly appeared in the

setting out how a company in its dealings with third parties may not
rely on the consequences of certain events, unless notice of the events
has duly appeared in the <i class="I">Gazette</i> or been published in some other
way, as provided for in clause 769. Subsection (1) says:</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000858"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b><b class="B"> </b>I beg to move amendment No. 381, in
clauseÂ 733,Â pageÂ 364,Â lineÂ 11,Â leave
out from &#145;from&#146; to &#145;that&#146; in line 12 and
insert &#145;all
documents&#146;.</div><a name="06070518000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
talking about the register in the abstract, we need to keep it in mind
that we are talking about a record of every filed document, which
normally appears on a plastic fiche. Under subsection (3), after 1
January 2007, only
the</div><a name="06070518000733"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;documents subject to
the Directive disclosure
requirements&#148;</div><a name="06070518000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">in clause
731 will need to be kept in electronic form. Surely it is not the
intention to have half the company&#146;s documents on the register
in electronic form and the other half&#151;or whatever the proportion
might be&#151;still on fiche. The amendment therefore states that all
documents should be in electronic
form.</div><a name="06070518000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">While on the
subject, will the Minister please advise the Committee how the
preparations for the switch to electronic form are going? Are they
being made within 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 422</div>the budget and will they be made on time? Will searches of the records
cost less as a result and will they be
faster?</div><a name="06070518000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000859"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks whether
searches will be cheaper and faster, and whether preparations are on
the way. The documents set out in clause 731 are those that are subject
to various requirements under European Community law, one of which is
that information derived from those documents should be kept in
electronic form by the registrar. They are, on the whole, the more
significant company documents. The obligation to keep the information
electronically therefore ensures that the majority of key documents
have to be kept in that way.</div>
<a name="06070518000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would extend the obligation to keep
information electronically to all documents, not just the key ones.
Electronic communications are an enormous benefit to users of Companies
House services and Companies House itself. The registrar shares the
Government&#146;s desire to see the growth of that and is taking
steps to ensure that electronic services are available wherever
appropriate. The question is whether it should be obligatory to keep
the information electronically or whether, where European law includes
a discretion, we should maintain that discretion.</div>
<a name="06070518000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is probable that over time
the registrar will choose to keep all information
electronically&#151;I am told that we are not far from that position
already&#151;but there can be operational issues at the margin.
Altogether, it is better to leave the registrar with some flexibility,
just as we agree that companies should have flexibility in how they
communicate with the registrar in the first place, which is almost
bound to be faster and cheaper, but I do not know whether I can give
the hon. Gentleman a more specific response to that point at
present.</div><a name="06070518000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies
House is in the middle of a significant programme to upgrade its
facilities for receiving and storing information electronically. To the
best of our understanding, the programme is going well. If the hon.
Gentleman wants any more specifics on progress, we shall write to him
about that, although the point on the process being cheaper and faster
is bound to be correct. However, the flexibility is important, so I
invite him to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070518000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000860"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for her
comprehensive response, although I would appreciate a note, so that we
will know how the process is going. My understanding is that by 1
January 2007 people who want copies of a document might still have to
get some of it on fiche and some of it electronically. The intention is
that that should not happen, but it might. We hope that it does not, in
so far as it would be terribly inconvenient. However, on the basis of
what I have heard, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070518000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000861"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause deals with the allocation of unique
identifiers, which is a new concept. The use of unique identifiers will
be a great help in enhancing the security of the register and avoiding
confusion, particularly where people have the same name. Will the
Minister please take this opportunity to explain how the system is
likely to work? In mechanical terms, what needs to be done to put it in
place? When is that likely to happen? In debates on other amendments, I
have asked her to explain the Government&#146;s approach to dealing
with fraud, so perhaps she will elaborate on how this system will be of
benefit.</div>
<a name="06070518000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000862"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I cannot, as the hon. Gentleman requests, set out
in detail the mechanical processes that will bring the system to
fruition. The clause obviously supports the provisions to allow
directors&#146; home addresses to be kept off the public record. The
unique identifier will also be useful in enabling searches to
distinguish between different persons of the same name and in clearly
identifying people whose addresses will not go forward. However, I
shall have to write to the hon. Gentleman about the mechanics and the
stage we are
at.</div><a name="06070518000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000863"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 382, in
clauseÂ 736,Â pageÂ 365,Â lineÂ 42,Â at
end insert</div><a name="06070518000734"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;provided that
if the registrar has received a written request from the company for
possession of such documents, then the registrar shall send such
documents in hard copy form to the
company.&#146;.</div><a name="06070518000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with the preservation of original documents. There might
be situations in which companies wish to retain original resolutions
and other documents that have been signed. They might not want the
registrar to destroy those documents after three years, and the
amendment would give them the opportunity to get the documents
back.</div> <a name="06070518000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
company&#146;s reasons might be unofficial&#151;perhaps it keeps
its papers for historical record purposes&#151;but has the Minister
considered that there might be other reasons? For instance, if a
company issues shares other than on a cash basis, Companies House will
want to have the contract under which the shares were issued, with
stamp duty on it, filed. The company may be required by law to keep
that contract for more than three years. Has she considered that? Would
Companies House not destroy such a contract?</div>
<a name="06070518000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is aimed at not
making document release an onerous process for Companies House, in so
far as it would be for the company to action the
request.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 424</div><a name="06070518000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000864"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The amendment would be likely to
impose a very onerous burden on Companies House, and its goal would be
attainable only at significant cost. It is clearly sensible that
Companies House should at some point be able to destroy the originals
of documents that it receives. The information on the hard copy is
translated into electronic form and made publicly accessible so that
the importance of the hard-copy original disappears. One imagines that
that basic proposition is accepted.</div>
<a name="06070518000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies
House gets millions of documents a year, and an indefinite obligation
to keep the originals would be unworkable. The amendment would enable
companies, prior to the destruction of the originals, to request their
return, but I do not know how many companies would want to make use of
it. However, any well run company would surely have retained its own
records as necessary, and the information in the documents would
generally continue to be publicly
accessible.</div><a name="06070518000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where a
company or an individual sends information to a public body, the onus
is on the person supplying the information to keep a record if they
think that they will need it&#151;all the more so if they are under
an obligation to keep it.</div>
<a name="06070518000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The costs and
the burden imposed by the amendment would be significant. Although
Companies House can, and generally does, organise and hold electronic
information according to company, hard-copy documents are generally
stored according to the nature of the document, which makes perfect
sense from an archive point of view when the documents are translated
into electronic information. However, it would make complying with
request for the return of all original hard-copy documents relating to
a specific company hugely labour
intensive.</div><a name="06070518000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
Companies House would need to operate on a cost-recovery basis if it
performed the service, and the charges would necessarily be high, so
the amendment would be, if not completely impossible, not practical,
very expensive and unnecessary, as the onus should surely remain on the
company to keep all the records it needs to
keep.</div><a name="06070518000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000865"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hear what the Minister says.
I think that, in practice, the service would be used relatively rarely
and that companies that wanted it would not have a problem meeting its
cost. I agree that it makes sense to destroy originals that have passed
the three-year mark. I just thought that the company should have the
choice, if it so wished, to have access to the originals, but I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000866"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000867"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The clause makes it clear that anyone is entitled
to a copy of material on the register, so it is similar in purpose to
the preceding clause, which we have just agreed to and which provides
that any person can inspect the
register.</div><a name="06070518000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">A general
principle of how Companies House is established is that it operates on

relevant
service.</div><a name="06070518000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
this instance, an explicit provision of European law governs the costs
of providing copies, so the clause sets it out, for the avoidance of
doubt, that the fee for a copy may not exceed the administrative cost
of providing the service. If Companies House is to be able to recoup
the administrative costs of providing the service, it is likely to have
to recoup the costs of setting up the system, but in the longer term
one might expect electronic communications to reduce transaction costs
in any

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000870"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We debated at some length the question of access
to the register of members and I highlighted the fact that clause 115
might be ineffectual in protecting shareholders if the company sent
details of its shareholders&#146; names and addresses to Companies
House with its annual return. I make the point now that whatever we say
about access to members&#146; personal details, that should be a
debate on the register of members in which we accept the need for a
balance between access for valid reasons and security concerns, which
will restrict access to some
extent.</div><a name="06070518000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We see no need
for such a debate in relation to the annual return or details held on
file at Companies House, not least because the details of members do
not reflect who is or is not a member of the company except on the date
of the return, hence the reason for tabling our amendment, which simply
says that any name or address of any member shall not be made
available. That should be historical, and not just for future filings,
to stop the problem that we have with directors&#146; old filings,
which might mean that a person has to move home to make redundant the
historical filed
details.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 426</div><a name="06070518000788"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="06070518000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are unwilling to accept amendment No. 383, we need to move
on to making the less practical approach that they propose as
watertight as possible. Two issues require amendment. The first relates
to the fact that this provision applies only to addresses, not the
names of shareholders. Do the Government intend to retain the provision
that companies must include lists of their members with their annual
returns? We think it will not offer enough protection. I also note that
the clause seems towork only on a one-off basis: each
shareholder will have to apply individually to have his or her address
removed.</div><a name="06070518000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I agree
that there should be a provision for individual application to the
registrar, in the example of GlaxoSmithKline, which would involve
thousands of shareholders being approached, surely we need to provide
for the company to have the means to ask for all shareholders
collectively to be removed. We note that clause 741(2)(a) does not
spell out who may make an application. We assume that both the company
and an individual will be able to apply at the very least, and our
amendment aims to clarify that.</div>
<a name="06070518000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">On further reflection, we find
the Government&#146;s application here somewhat inconsistent. The
basis of the system in clause 741 is to have an application made in
relation to a single address, yet the system used in clause 115 for
access to the members&#146; register is the opposite, with only the
company, and not individuals as we wanted, being given the right to
block access to all shareholders&#146;
details.</div><a name="06070518000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister please explain that difference of approach? To me, it smacks
of rushed legislation and not putting things into context. The gaps and
hoops that I have identified in relation to the clause somewhat
undermine the Government&#146;s announcements during consideration in
the Lords that they would deal with this problem comprehensively. They
are dealing with it, but not as effectively as we believe they
should.</div><a name="06070518000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000871"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I hope that I can give the hon. Gentleman a
comprehensive answer. AmendmentNo. 383 would deprive the
public of information about who owns any company. Members themselves
and third parties often have a legitimate interest in being able to
find out who a company&#146;s members are. The advantage of that
being held by the registrar is that it is not only available with
minimal inconvenience and expense, either to searches or to the company
itself, but readily available if the company itself is being
obstructive.</div><a name="06070518000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the information can be checked without the company&#146;s
knowledge. That is very important when relations between company
members and the directors are strained and company members need to be
able to be in touch with each other, or if there is a concern about
whether directors have been acting properly.</div>
<a name="06070518000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, it seems
imperative that that information should remain where it is for all
those purposes. Although I am conscious of the fact that everyone has
rehearsed and not accepted each other&#146;s arguments on this issue
already, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will none the
less 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 427</div>withdraw the amendment. It seems important that members&#146; names
should be there for ordinary commercial purposes in the ordinary,
proper democracy of companies, which he has on other occasions espoused
and indeed
championed.</div><a name="06070518000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 741
provides for circumstances in which addresses held by Companies House
might be made unavailable. That is in addition to the provision in
clause 225 whereby directors&#146; home addresses will no longer be
on the record and the provision in clause 260, which does not require
public company secretaries to provide a home address in future.
Amendment No. 385 would extend clause 741 so that the provisions for
addresses held by Companies House being made unavailable for public
inspection might be extended to names. That would take privacy too
far.</div> <a name="06070518000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The company law
review argued that information on who controls or who can influence
limited companies should be readily available, and we agree. It would
not be right to provide for secrecy and anonymity in any such matter,
whether it be the names of members or directors, or anyone else whose
name is required. I well understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern
and know that it has particular relevance to his
constituency.</div><a name="06070518000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000872"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister was here when
I made extensive remarks on similar amendments that advocated this
approach. I would like to repeat them now for the record. Such an
approach would drive a coach and horses through effective corporate
governance. It would be dangerous and tantamount, in determined hands,
to a rogues&#146;, crooks&#146; and fraudsters&#146;
charter.</div><a name="06070518000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000873"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point. Although it
is impossible not to understand the force behind the amendments, the
matter has already been debated extensively and people have taken
fairly rigid positions. I was not present for the whole debate on the
topic, but my view is that a large number of the points that the hon.
Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) raised as problems that have
befallen shareholders are those against which they could not be
protected by secrecy. They were largely due to inadequacies in policing
and therefore not related to the Bill. It is important to ensure that
the democratic accountability of companies is
retained.</div><a name="06070518000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
No. 386 and 384 are more technical. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the
matter of who can make an application, which clause 741 leaves open.
That is deliberate&#151;not all addresses should be treated in the
same way. Take the address of a mortgagee. It may be useful to have a
means to allow creditors to contact each other, but if amendment No.
384 were accepted companies could take their mortgagees&#146;
addresses off the register without their consent. That would be utterly
unsatisfactory and a real impediment to the smooth functioning of
company
commerce.</div><a name="06070518000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 386 is about drafting rather than policy. There is nothing to
prevent the regulations from providing for a single application to
cover multiple addresses. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that
comprehensive enough and withdraws the amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 428</div><a name="06070518000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000874"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Minister therefore saying that either an
individual or a company may make an application? That is one of my
concerns.</div><a name="06070518000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000875"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Yes. Clause 341 leaves open who may make an
application, which means it is wide enough to permit a company or an
individual to do so. I should add that we intend to use the power to
make regulations regarding the annual return, which the hon. Gentleman
raised, to ensure that addresses are not required for private company
members or the vast majority of plc
members.</div><a name="06070518000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that is sufficient to persuade the hon. Gentleman that he shot his bolt
in our earlier discussion and that there is nothing new in the clause.
It is overwhelmingly the case that information should be publicly
available for the good company governance for which we all wish. I
therefore hope that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070518000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070518000876"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): This is an
important matter, not a technical one at all. There are many
circumstances in which it is necessary for people to be able to
communicate with the shareholders of a company. One obvious situation
is that of somebody preparing a bid for a company who wishes to make an
offer to its shareholders&#151;perhaps an unfriendly one that would
not be recommended by its
directors.</div><a name="06070518000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example, which is very important in corporate governance, is that a
shareholder might want to get together with other shareholders to form
a minority, or even majority, shareholders&#146; group with a view to
changing policy or the directors, or challenging resolutions that the
directors put forward at an annual or extraordinary general
meeting.</div><a name="06070518000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
mechanisms are essential in any good system of corporate governance,
and it would be a great mistake if the new company law that we are
putting together precluded their use or placed undue obstacles in their
way.</div><a name="06070518000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon is right to bring up a new issue.
Since the House last debated company law, there has been the menace of
animal rights activists threatening the shareholders of pharmaceutical
or other biological industry companies. One can envisage circumstances
in which not just those sectors would be targeted by some lunatic or
terrorist
organisation.</div><a name="06070518000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
provide protections for citizens who happen to be shareholders of
companies. I want to ensure that we get the balance and trade-off
right, because I do not suppose that the House will have an opportunity
to return to company law in general for another 20 or25 years.
Some of us might not even be here when it does.</div>
<a name="06070518000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
context, I want to ask the Government for an explanation. Subsection
(5) states that the regulations &#147;may provide&#148; that if an
address is not to be made available, a service address must be made
available. It seems desirable that the regulations should make such
provision so that if, for any reason, the addresses were not
provided&#151;I agree totally with my hon. Friend
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 429</div>there are circumstances in which the addresses should not be provided
and in which we should allow individuals to apply not to have their
addresses revealed or disclosed&#151;a service address would be
substituted so that people could receive communications such as those I
have suggested or others of a fairly legitimate
character.</div><a name="06070518000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister assure us that when she writes that the regulations
&#147;may&#148; provide, she intends that they will so provide? An
alternative&#151;I rather regret not having thought of it before as I
am now unable to table an amendment&#151;is providing that the
company is obliged to communicate with or to pass on communications to
shareholders, which is not ideal because it involves incurring some
cost.</div><a name="06070518000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">One way or
another, we must resolve the contradiction between the need to
establish rules to provide for good corporate governance and the
needto provide physical protection for people who happen to be
shareholders of controversial companies.</div>
<a name="06070518000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000877"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> Again, for the record, I do
not think that the hon. Gentleman was here when I made an extensive
contribution on other amendments tabled by Conservative Front Benchers.
His remark, as a response to animal rights extremists, that any change
in company law must be balanced and proportionate, not harmful to
corporate governance and no encouragement to fraud or such behaviour is
absolutely right.</div><a name="06070518000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the hon. Gentleman aware of the effect that some amendments tabled by
Conservative Members would have had? For instance, he talks about bids.
Making shareholding registers not available at Companies House would
deter bids. In certain circumstances, some of the amendments would not
have allowed minority shareholders to establish whether secret concert
parties were running companies against their interests. Is he aware of
that?</div><a name="06070518000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000878"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> That is quite a long intervention to respond to.
My hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon has been incredibly
conscientious and thorough in considering the Bill. I have been
immensely impressed by his hard work in producing so many amendments,
which have allowed some educated discussions on these subjects. He
deserves the approbation and gratitude of the whole Committee for his
work, which has inspired us to many thoughts and insights on company
law that we would not otherwise have had, including in this
example.</div><a name="06070518000204"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000880"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> In answer to the question whether I have read
every amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon, I
hope that I have the reputation of being an honest man and I have some
difficulty in saying an unambiguous yes.</div>
<a name="06070518000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to my

he wishes to press it to a vote, as it is clearly necessary to provide
some protection, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 430</div>hope that he has in mind, or as part of his plan to amend the Bill, the
need to provide, first, that shareholders can be communicated with and,
secondly, that any company may not possibly ask, for quite the wrong
reasons, for the addresses of all its shareholders to be removed from
disclosure, as it might well be trying to block a bid, prevent other
shareholders from communicating with each other or prevent the
dissemination of views on the governance of the company that run
counter to the policy of the board. That would be an appalling attack
on shareholder
democracy.</div><a name="06070518000789"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000881"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> May I take the opportunity to satisfy the hon.
Gentleman about the provisions of subsection (5)(b)? I am sure he will
accept that the proposal that the company should have a duty is much
less satisfactory than ensuring that service addresses are available.
Putting a duty on the company is very much a second best. I understand
that the regulations will provide for current addresses and not
historic ones. I hope that that is satisfactory. I am grateful to him
for his examples of when communication between members is
important.</div>
<a name="06070518000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000882"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I think that I am happy with what the Minister
said, but is it definitely the intention, in so far as individuals have
asked for their addresses not to be disclosed and in so far as the
company has asked for addresses not to be disclosed, that the company
will be obliged to pass on communications to the shareholder? Is my
understanding
right?</div><a name="06070518000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000883"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> No, I do not think so. The hon. Gentleman was keen
that the regulations should provide that if an address was not to be
made available, it had to be replaced by a service address. He
commented on the fact that the regulations &#147;may&#148; provide,
and asked me whether it was our intention that they would provide. The
intention is that they would; it is not that an address cannot be made
unavailable unless there is a service address. That principle is right
for current addresses, but I am not sure what he means about the
company having a further duty. If he sets that out more extensively,
and if it still troubles him after my second attempt to reply, I am
sure that I can get some
assistance.</div><a name="06070518000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000884"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I am grateful to the Minister.
She satisfies me entirely about current shareholders with current
addresses. She assures the Committee&#151;an assurance that the
Committee accepts&#151;that we can read the word &#147;may&#148;
as &#147;shall&#148; for current shareholders with current
addresses. However, the provision is not intended to govern a
company&#146;s activities and obligations only for the next month or
two; it is doubtless intended to govern them for the next 25 years. It
is important that the same mechanism should be applied to future
shareholders, with future addresses. The Minister leaves me confused by
saying that the regulations will not apply to future shareholders with
future addresses, so how can we ensure that when, in future, addresses
are not themselves directed as closed, there will nevertheless be a
mechanism for communicating with the shareholders of the
company?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 431</div><a name="06070518000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000885"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I did not say that the regulations would not
provide for future addresses; I said that they would not apply for
historic addresses. We start with addresses that are current when the
legislation comes into force, and all current addresses thereafter will
come under the provisions of clause
741(5)(b).</div><a name="06070518000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000886"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. Perhaps I did not hear her correctly before. We are
changing the law and going forward, and the provisions for withholding
addresses will apply only to new addresses once the law comes into
effect.</div> <a name="06070518000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a
useful discussion. I hope that there is
consensus.</div><a name="06070518000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000887"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I can confirm to my hon. Friend that there is
consensus, and I shall explain why. First, however, I shall deal with
other points raised by the
Minister.</div><a name="06070518000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification of who can apply for
privacy, and that such removal could be done by groups rather than
individually&#151;I think that she said that the provision could be
used either way. I did not raise the subject, but I was interested to
hear the Minister say that she was concerned that my amendments could
be used so that mortgagees could apply not to share their addresses.
That is a concern of mine, too, but I understand from my correspondence
with Lord Sainsbury that the Government propose to allow mortgagees to
use agency addresses. The Minister might like to confirm
that.</div><a name="06070518000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
383, it is important to say that we accept&#151;my hon. Friend will
be pleased to hear this&#151;that members and others have a
legitimate interest in accessing members&#146; details. We accept and
applaud that. However, there are two ways in which to access those
details: from the register of members or the details filed at Companies
House.</div><a name="06070518000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members&#146;
details at Companies House are filed only once a year and so at any
particular point could be wildly inaccurate and not relate in any way
to who is a member of the company. It is simply a statement given at a
point in time&#151;when the annual return is filed&#151;and is not
a reflection of who is a member of the company. For instance, nine
months after filing, the list of actual members would probably be
wildly different from that in the Companies House
details.</div><a name="06070518000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
my hon. Friend that if a company is preparing for a bid or wants to set
up a shareholder group&#151;I think that he mentioned that&#151;it
is important that details can be accessed, other than in the most
extreme circumstances such as a terrorist campaign. We debated that
earlier, and I agree that in this case access to those details is
important. It would be done by people asking for copies of the
register. We are not saying that that should not happen.</div>
<a name="06070518000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking, however, about
details filed once a year at Companies House. We remain of the view
that those serve no proper purpose. To the extent that they do, they
are probably out of date and will mislead people more than tell them
the state of play.</div>

Government have decided to get rid of company secretaries for all
private companies and thoroughly marginalise the role that remains,
including an attack on their status as officers, paragraph (b) does not
work, because it refers to officers. In practice, the secretary is
responsible for filing, but if the secretary is no longer regarded as
an officer, the provisions can be used only to punish directors, most

have no idea that they were criminally responsible for not filing

we have a problem with the words &#147;who is in default&#148;, and

directors be in default for not filing a form or, if the company passes
a board resolution that a director should be responsible&#151;say, in
the absence of a secretary&#151;would it be possible for only that
director to be liable for the non-filing of documents? Presumably the
wording also means that the board cannot delegate the role to a
non-officer&#151;say, the old private company secretary, who is no
longer an officer of the company in law. The clause needs careful
review.</div><a name="06070518000790"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Vera
Baird:</b> Where a document submitted to the registrar contains
inconsistencies, the registrar can issue a notice to the company
concerned requiring it to rectify the position. If it does not respond,
an offence is committed. That is surely right, and I do not believe
that the hon. Gentleman doubts that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 434</div><a name="06070518000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liability for the offence in
such a case, which is what the hon. Gentleman is concerned about, can
attach to the company and/or to any officer of the company who is in
default. We will discuss offences and liability more generally when we
come to part 30, but I stress that the formulation in this clause is
not in any sense unusual. Of course a private company secretary, if one
is appointed, would be an officer of the company and that ought to be
clear.</div><a name="06070518000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The majority of
the offence provisions in the Bill attach liability to the company and
to any officer. Clearly, one cannot attach liability to an officer if
there is no such officer, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment
would remove liability from the officer and leave it solely with the
company. I am not sure why that ought to be the case, if there is an
appointed officer. In many instances, dealing with correspondence from
Companies House will be the responsibility of a specific officer of the
company. If they fail to deal with the correspondence such that an
offence is committed, and if they are clearly at fault, why should they
escape punishment, leaving the company as a whole to be
penalised?</div><a name="06070518000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000914"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Minister saying that if an individual
officer of a private company were given responsibility for filing
documents in the absence of, for example, a company secretary, the
other directors could rest
easy?</div><a name="06070518000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000915"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman repeat the last part of his
question?</div><a name="06070518000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000916"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Our concern, particularly if company secretaries
will not be part of private companies, is that directors of large
private companies will have no experience of filing company forms. Does
the clause mean that they will collectively be criminally liable for
overlooking the filing of a company form? That would be going
overboard.</div><a name="06070518000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000917"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The clause is about filing a document that contains
inconsistencies, rather than not filing. The registrar will issue a
notice to the company concerned and ask it to rectify the position, so
it is not the case that somebody who does not know can commit an
offence. A notice will be
sent.</div><a name="06070518000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an officer is
responsible for the function, they may be liable. If they do not have
the responsibility, they will not be in default under clause 774.
Clearly, if an officer is responsible, there is no reason at all why
they should not be liable for their default or, indeed, why the
mechanism of making them liable should not encourage them to do the job
properly in the first place, which is surely the point of the
measure.</div><a name="06070518000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is not making much of a case. The question has little to do
with company secretaries in private companies. It is about whether an
officer should be
liable.</div><a name="06070518000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000918"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I was making a legalistic but practical point
about the situation that many private companies will find themselves in
after the passing of the Bill, which is that they had better ensure
that someone is responsible for filing documents. I am grateful for the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 435</div>Minister&#146;s confirmation that that person would be responsible
rather than the directors as a whole if a document is not
filed.</div><a name="06070518000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that filing documents is important. However, in the great
course of events, the average director does not think that he should be
criminally convicted for failure to file a single
form.</div><a name="06070518000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000919"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> We will consider the definition of &#147;in
default&#148; when we debate clause 774. That discussion will be
important to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s fully appreciating what I am
saying about this clause. So I invite him to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06070518000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000920"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Having heard that conversation, I am not
entirely sure that my concerns have been dissipated. However, I heard

suffers any loss or damage or incurs any expense as a result, direct or
indirect, of a failure by the registrar to perform the
registrar&#146;s functions, the registrar shall indemnify and keep
indemnified that person against all such loss, damage and
expense.&#146;.</div><a name="06070518000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment was tabled in the other place by Lord Sharman for the Liberal
Democrats. I thought that it was important to bring it back because it
deals with a matter of principle.</div>
<a name="06070518000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
contains clause after clause telling directors and companies how they
must file documents and the penalties for not doing so, but what about
problems that arise from Companies House getting it wrong? In 2005, the
Law Commission report on company security interests referred to
consultees&#146; views that in principle the registrar should be
liable for losses caused by any failures resulting from negligence by
Companies House.</div> <a name="06070518000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission thought that that should be the subject of a comprehensive
review or left to the courts. To my mind, Lord McKenzie, in his
response in the Lords, significantly underplayed the possible harm from
Companies House getting it wrong. He
said:</div><a name="06070518000739"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Generally,
therefore, where a company suffers damage as a result of an error or
omission on the public register, it will be because the original
information was wrong or was wrongly delivered&#151;not because of
anything Companies House does or does not
do.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 28 March
2006; Vol. 680, c.
GC343.]</div><a name="06070518000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
to say that I agree with Lord Sharman when he replied that he had
listened with &#147;increasing incredulity&#148; to the
Minister&#146;s response.</div>
<a name="06070518000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies
House might handle 7 million documents a year, but it gets paid for
many of those. When it makes a mistake that leads to a loss to the
company, we believe that it should be answerable. There should not be a
one-way process of liability against companies and directors. It is a
fact that mistakes are made.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 436</div><a name="06070518000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 24 April, an article in
<i class="I">The Daily Telegraph
</i>read:</div><a name="06070518000740"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Companies
House has admitted that it has been losing companies' reports and
accounts at a rate of nearly 10 a month.
</div><a name="06070518000741"></a><div class="hs_brev">The official registry
of UK companies admitted in a Freedom of Information Act request
submitted by The Daily Telegraph that it lost 190 accounts between
March 2004 and October 2005.
</div><a name="06070518000742"></a><div class="hs_brev">The figure applied to
cases identified through the &#145;late filing penalty regime&#146;
- meaning companies were mistakenly pursued for not having filed their
accounts within the correct time frame.
</div><a name="06070518000743"></a><div class="hs_brev">The real figure
could, however, be much higher. Judith Chainey, Freedom of Information
officer at Companies House, said: &#145;Although we have a number of
areas within Companies House that deal with cases of potential lost
documents not all of them are as clear cut as the late filing penalties
figure.&#146;</div> <a name="06070518000744"></a><div class="hs_brev">In a
litany of excuses, Companies House said missing documents were
mis-filed, lost by Royal Mail, or never sent.Mrs Chainey
added: &#145;We receive a fair number of empty envelopes each
week.&#146;</div> <a name="06070518000745"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
customer services department logs all cases where customers claim they
have filed accounts, she said.</div>
<a name="06070518000746"></a><div class="hs_brev">There were 5,514 cases logged
for the four and a half years between June 2001 and January 2006,
including the 190 cases identified through late filing
penalties.&#148;</div><a name="06070518000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the bottom
it reads:</div><a name="06070518000747"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Body

accounts.</div> <a name="06070518000748"></a><div class="hs_brev">The company
had received a receipt when it sent in its annual accounts last June.
However, there was no record of the figures being
lodged.&#148;</div><a name="06070518000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not have accurate statistical information, but I think that the article
makes the point that mistakes are made. Clearly, as a result, companies
will suffer to a greater or less extent. The Minister might be able to
elaborate on that and provide the Committee with more accurate details
of lost documents. If she has that information, I am sure that we would
be pleased to hear it. We think that that is an important issue and
look forward to hearing her
views.</div><a name="06070518000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070518000922"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for bringing back this amendment, which was proposed by my
noble Friends in the House of Lords. We are trying to stick to a
principle of not reintroducing amendments with which we were not
successful elsewhere, but this one makes an important
point.</div><a name="06070518000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
additional point that I wish to make is that the matter is complex, and
if it were left to the common law or the courts to decide whether there
should be a civil claim, the chances are that no liability would be
possible. Any loss would strike most judges as purely economic, and in
such cases there is liability only if the defendant is found to have
assumed responsibility for the loss to the claimant. That is not a
simple matter for the courts to decide, and the frequent experience of
claimants in such circumstances is that they lose. Without an explicit
statutory statement, it is unlikely that there would be any
compensation in the circumstances to which the hon. Gentleman
referred.</div><a name="06070518000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000923"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> There is of course an ex gratia scheme. I cannot
help the hon. Member for Huntingdon by giving numbers of documents, but
the ex gratia scheme has paid out about &#163;130,000 in the past
five years, no doubt in significant sums. He made the point that
companies can lose money because of mistakes, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 437</div>those sums were doubtless significant to the companies concerned, but
they are not evidence of a big problem given the volume of transactions
that the registrar has dealt with over that
period.</div><a name="06070518000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have looked
for comparisons to see what other organisations do, which is not easy
because they are set up on their own statutory bases. However, the
Patent Office has a statutory exclusion from liability in much of its
statutory work, while in contrast the Land Registry is obliged by
statute to provide an indemnity. There does not appear to be any simple
answer to the question of what analogies can be drawn. I understand
entirely what the hon. Gentleman says, but in debating the amendment we
are considering not situations in which the registrar has been given
the wrong information, but those in which the error is on her
side.</div><a name="06070518000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return, as did the hon. Gentleman, to some of the points made in the
other place, which are important in understanding the context of the
amendment. I stress that Companies House has an effective complaints
procedure, and my understanding is that in the vast majority of cases
the use of that system ensures that errors are corrected quickly and
efficiently before any material loss is suffered. There will now be an
additional, informal way to alter mistaken documentation that has been
submitted, providing another barrel to the gun. If there is loss to a
company, there is the ex gratia payment scheme, which pays reasonable
expenses if there has been an error on the registrar&#146;s
part.</div><a name="06070518000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000924"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Minister explain how that scheme works
and how much is
involved?</div><a name="06070518000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000925"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I have already told the hon. Gentleman how much is
being paid
out.</div><a name="06070518000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000926"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> For instance, how much is involved if a
company&#146;s statutory accounts are
lost?</div><a name="06070518000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000927"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The standard appears to be that reasonable expenses
are paid if an error on the registrar&#146;s point causes someone to
incur costs. I do not know whether it can be quantified precisely; I do
not suppose that there is a going rate for a particular kind of
failure. The courts might be able to intervene as a last resort, but I
am not sure about the principle that the hon. Gentleman
enunciated.</div> <a name="06070518000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
deny that mistakes can be made. The figures for payments in the past
five years suggest that they are not frequent, and when they occur
there are processes for dealing with them and providing compensation
when necessary. The hon. Gentleman might think that those processes
will be strengthened by the ability informally to correct documents,
which we have discussed. We would have to think long and hard before
introducing any new formal process for indemnifying or compensating
customers, because one comes back to the inevitable argument that it
would impose costs on the system. Those would have to be borne
ultimately by all the users of Companies House because there is no
magic pot of money from which the compensation scheme could be
funded.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 438</div><a name="06070518000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">A formal
indemnification arrangement of the sort proposed in the amendment would
create an unquantifiable contingent liability within Companies House.
Some arrangement would have to be made to cover that, such as insurance
or a contingency fund built up over time. Either way, setting up the
arrangements would impose costs on Companies House and on the companies
themselves over and above the costs of any payments made under the
indemnification arrangements. There could well be further costs on top
of those as it would be surprising if, in order to minimise its
exposure, Companies House did not feel the need to introduce a new
double checking process to ensure that it got everything
correct.</div><a name="06070518000791"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000928"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am sure that the Minister is going through
considerations that are plainly relevant to the problem, but may I put
to her another aspect of the problem, which is the question of how many
mistakes will be made? If such a scheme were in place, might there not
be an incentive for officials to make fewer mistakes? Although there
might be costs, they might not be as high as she
says.</div><a name="06070518000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000929"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. Of course, if
there are penalties to be paid for making mistakes, perhaps one makes
fewer, but that is an unquantifiable contingent liability. Precisely
for the reason that the hon. Gentleman has just enunciated, it is
highly likely that Companies House will introduce a new checking
process to ensure that it does not fall foul of the new penal regime or
indemnification
regime.</div><a name="06070518000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
it is not right to suggest that employees of Companies House are at all
careless about their tasks. The evidence is that they are not. If there
were an error-prone organisation out there, we might need to go down
this road, but there does not seem to be any groundswell in favour of a
scheme of this kind. Users appear generally to be very satisfied with
the service that they receive.</div>
<a name="06070518000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real difficulty is that if
we loaded up a system of compulsory indemnification, inevitably we
would load up on top another extra checking facility, and we would load
up all the costs of that on the customers of Companies House. We would
be doing that for no particular reason, as nobody is suggesting that
Companies House is making a mess in the first place, and at a cost of
&#163;130,000 over the last five years, it is quite impossible to
suggest that it is doing so. I ask for the amendment to be
withdrawn.</div><a name="06070518000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000930"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)
made an important point on the practicality of claiming under the
existing law. To cut a long story short, he said that it is very
difficult.Ex gratia payments are one thing, and the Minister
mentioned the figure of &#163;130,000 having been paid out, but in
itself that figure does not mean much. It does not tell us how many
claims have been made or how large awards have been for particular
needs for
redress.</div><a name="06070518000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000931"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Obviously, at &#163;26,000 a year, mistakes that
are causing huge costs to companies are not
occurring.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 439</div><a name="06070518000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000932"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister said that the ex gratia payments
are not related to damage. They are an administrative penalty, so I do
not follow her on that point. If accounts were not filed on the
register and a third party refused to contract, there could be a loss
to the company. The ex gratia payment may deal with costs, but I do not
think that we are talking about damages here. My problem with the
clause is that we are talking about a one-way street. In the same way
that companies may be liable, they should expect a certain service from
Companies House and redress if they lose out because they do not
receive it.</div> <a name="06070518000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Saying
that companies should not be put back into the position that they would
otherwise be in because of possible cost to the public, which was the
Minister&#146;s main point, is not enough reason to say that there
should not be some indemnification. However, such a scheme should
perhaps have capped indemnification, whereby, in practice, the
possibility of the unfathomed amounts that she mentioned would not come
into play.
</div><a name="06070518000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000933"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The other point that the hon. Gentleman should
perhaps take into account is that if only about &#163;120,000 of
damage has been caused in a year by such an
error&#151;</div><a name="06070518000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000934"></a>Vera

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000935"></a>David
Howarth:</b> In those cases, it would not be worth the
organisation&#146;s while to take steps that cost more than that to
prevent further losses. One suspects that the Government are saying
that more would have to be spent precisely because the real losses
being suffered by companies are rather greater than the amounts being
paid out by the ex gratia
scheme.</div><a name="06070518000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000936"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but as we
have said before, the figure of
&#163;135,00&#151;</div><a name="06070518000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000937"></a>Vera

&#163;130,000.</div><a name="06070518000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000938"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That figure is not related to the loss. We do
not know what losses companies have suffered, because the ex gratia
payments relate to their
costs.</div><a name="06070518000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000939"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Is not the hon. Gentleman putting himself in a
ludicrous position by advocating compensation when he does not have the
first idea whether anybody has suffered any loss of any kind and when
all the users of Companies House seem to be reasonably content? There
is no groundswell and I have received no submissions on the issue from
outside bodies. Compensation is being paid out, so where is the
evidence of a need for anything
else?</div><a name="06070518000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000940"></a>Mr.

mentioned that Companies House might have to review its procedures if

effects of litigation or the threat of it can be to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000959"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Institute of Chartered Accountants has
raised this issue. When Companies House is informed of identity
theft&#151;an issue to which I referred several times in earlier
debates&#151;it does not, under the Companies Act 1985, have the
power to amend the public record to remove the fraudulent entries
unless the applicant has made a successful application to court and
received a court order. That process is cumbersome, expensive and time
consuming.</div><a name="06070518000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to Lord Hodgson, Lord McKenzie claimed that he had some sympathy with
the point in circumstances in which manifestly false information had
been published. That Minister said that he would take the question away
and review it, and we now have clause
748.</div><a name="06070518000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will this
Minister explain the thoughts behind the clause and advise us on what
objections period under subsection (2) is likely and when we will hear
of the process to be used? Presumably, the intention is that the
provisions will be carefully thought through so that they will not, in
themselves, be used to allow
fraud.</div><a name="06070518000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000960"></a>Vera

through a colleague of the hon. Gentleman in the other place, and we
are grateful for this helpful provision. I shall have to write to him
on the detail of the length of the period for objections, but I assume
that he welcomes the clause, as it was proposed by the Opposition in
the other place. We think it is a very good

into their names, partly out of fashion, but partly because there are
now so many companies that it is often hard to find a name without
making a new word up or using symbols&#151;for instance, by sticking
.com at the end of the name, using the @ symbol or using the number 4
to indicate &#147;for&#148;. The notes refer to the use of Urdu and
Japanese symbols, but I am thinking about more everyday symbols that
people tend to use in this day and age. In fact, anyone who texts their

of section 704 of the 1985 Act. The Deregulation and Contracting Out
Act 1994 envisaged that some of the registrar&#146;s functions might
be contracted out. The clause provides for that possibility by saying
that where a contractor is processing documents, the registrar may
provide for them to be sent directly to the contractor. The 1994 Act
does not permit the function of making subordinate legislation to be
delegated, and subsection (3) of the clause provides that
registrar&#146;s rules are not regarded as subordinate legislation
for that purpose, permitting the contractor to make rules about the
form and manner of delivery, for example.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000970"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 390, in

 page  380,  line  13,  leave out
&#145;authorises or
permits&#146;.</div><a name="06070518000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000972"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to part 30,
entitled &#147;Offences under the Companies Acts&#148;. The
amendments were tabled by Lord Sharman on behalf of the Liberal
Democrats in the Lords Grand Committee on the basis of advice from the
Law Society. We believe that an important issue of principle is
involved.</div><a name="06070518000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 130
of the Companies Act 1985, which is replaced by this clause, provides
that for an offence to be committed by an officer, the officer has to
authorise or permit the relevant offence knowingly and willingly. There
is no such test in the Bill. In practice, an officer may not know that
he has committed an offence yet still be liable for prosecution. I
thought that Lord Sainsbury&#146;s justification for the change was
fairly weak.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 443</div><a name="06070518000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the offences are related
to non-filing of documents. Many directors simply assume that such
things will be carried out by someone else such as the company
secretary. This punitive change, combined with the fact that private
company secretaries will no longer be officers, will surely increase
the likelihood of a director causing an offence about which they no
idea.</div><a name="06070518000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, we
thought that the spirit of the age was to move away from the blunt hand
of criminal offences to more subtle and normally appropriate civil
penalty provisions. The clause runs in the face of that principle. We
think that the Government should reconsider it, and the amendments
reflect
that.</div><a name="06070518000378"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000973"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
bringing amendments back, although I have had some second thoughts
about what is now amendment No. 391. However, the case for amendment
No. 390 is still strong. As a matter of principle, we should not create
crimes of negligence unless there is an overwhelming case for doing so.
Amendment No. 390 would ensure that the crimes created by the Bill were
crimes involving an act done knowingly and wilfully. That would prevent
a situation in which an offence is committed without the offender
knowing what they are
doing.</div><a name="06070518000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I
have a problem with amendmentNo. 391. The offensive word is
&#147;permits&#148; rather than &#147;authorises&#148;. It
seems right in principle that a person who authorises someone else to
commit a wrongful act should be held liable for it. The word
&#147;permits&#148; is somewhat broader, so there is a problem with
its scope. </div><a name="06070518000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is the question of the interaction between the two amendments.
Accepting amendment No. 390 so that an offence could only be committed
&#147;knowingly and wilfully&#148; would obviate the need for
amendment No. 391. I do not think that both amendments are necessary.
If one were to be chosen, it should be amendment No. 390, which is the
crucial
one.</div><a name="06070518000381"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000974"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Amendment No. 390 should not be agreed to. I shall
return to it in a
moment.</div><a name="06070518000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government believe that a reformed Companies Act must be underpinned by
effective and proportionate sanctions and enforcement. The Bill sets
out clearly the basis on which criminal liability for a breach of the
requirements is allocated and makes several changes to update and
clarify the law.</div><a name="06070518000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon talked about the tide turning against
criminal offences. I suppose that he is thinking about the Hampton
reforms, which focus on increased use of administrative penalties, but
the company law regime already makes use of such penalties if we
believe that they are appropriate; for instance, as a sanction against
late filing of
accounts.</div><a name="06070518000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000975"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> There is a need to underpin the reformed Companies
Act with effective and proportionate sanctions, and enforcement. I have
dealt with the ways in which the administrative penalty regimen is not
at all being ignored. Nor are we flowing against the tide in this case.
The company law review examined the issue of criminal penalties as
opposed to administrative ones and concluded that as long as they were
enforced sensibly, the efficiency of the criminal sanctions regime
historically had been sufficient to overcome any misgivings about the
proportionality of applying sanctions of that kind to breaches of
procedural requirements.</div>
<a name="06070518000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the specific amendments, the
relevant clause in the 1985 Act, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon has
said, includes the words &#147;knowingly&#148; and
&#147;wilfully&#148;. The point is that &#147;knowingly&#148;
should not be in this clause, because it would exclude liability for
somebody who does not know because they have deliberately not looked,
and liability would be excluded for reckless officers&#151;those who
deliberately close their eyes to their responsibilities.</div>
<a name="06070518000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also not impossible that
such a form of words would be interpreted to mean that officers would
not be liable if they successfully claimed that they did not know that
their act constituted an offence.</div>
<a name="06070518000390"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000976"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I believe that the Minister is describing the
position that exists under the Companies Act. Is that the
case?</div><a name="06070518000391"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000977"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Yes. We have concerns that the definition of
&#147;officer in default&#148; as exists under the 1985 Act could
in a small number of cases cause difficulties in practice. It is
precisely for that reason that we sought to improve the definition so
that it is clear, for instance, that an officer cannot escape liability
by deliberately turning a blind eye to what he is responsible for
doing.
</div><a name="06070518000392"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000978"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I put to the Minister the obvious point that
turning a blind eye implies that someone knows something about the
facts in the first place, because otherwise they could not turn a blind
eye to them.</div> <a name="06070518000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other
question was whether I heard the Minister say that there were cases
that implied that ignorance of the law was an argument that a defendant
might run with? If so, that would be surprising, as I am not aware of
that being the case.</div>
<a name="06070518000394"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000979"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Turning a blind eye does not mean that someone
turns a blind eye to what they know; it means that they turn a blind
eye to their need to find something out. I am talking about where they
do not know whether A or B is the case and they have turned their blind
eye to A just as much as they have turned it against B. I would have
thought that that was a fairly straightforward proposition. It is a
powerful one. One does not want to open up a loophole, as this
amendment would, that would allow people who deliberately did that to
escape their liability.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 445</div><a name="06070518000395"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000980"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister is speaking quite forcefully to
make the point that the removal of the words mentioned in amendment No.
390 is important because it would make things more just. Can she give
an instance or some examples of why she feels the law needs to be
changed so that those words are taken out? Has something happened that
makes her feel that the existing law does not
work?</div><a name="06070518000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000981"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> As I have said, it is not about the existing law
not working on a wholesale basis. Certain elements could, in the cases
I have mentioned, cause difficulties. The law moves on, case law
emerges and an appreciation of how particular words and phrases can be
interpreted emerges as time passes. It is entirely appropriate that
when such things emerge we move to stop wrongdoers from getting away
with wrongdoing. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can readily
appreciate the argument, now that it is being set out, that
recklessness could be excluded if we require somebody
&#147;knowingly&#148; and &#147;wilfully&#148; to do something.
It is exactly the reckless person who will not be caught. We believe
that anyone who is recklessly or deliberately ignorant of their
responsibilities cannot be described as innocent, and it is right that
such a person should be liable under the
clause.</div><a name="06070518000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
words &#147;authorises&#148; or &#147;permits&#148;. They are
also an important part of the clause. It is important to make it clear
that directors might be liable for an offence committed by the company
if he</div> <a name="06070518000749"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;authorises or
permits, participates in, or fails to take all reasonable steps to
prevent&#148;</div><a name="06070518000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">the offence.
There might be some overlap, but I do not think that there is much
complaint about that. However, if there was ever a need to prosecute
somebody in court for that kind of offence, setting out the words, the
ordinary meanings of which are clearly understood, would make it easier
for the facts to be put firmly, or fail to go into one of those
categories. So the extra words that the second amendment seeks to
remove are important and should not be removed. I invite the hon.
Gentleman to think his amendment ill-conceived and not to press
it.</div><a name="06070518000399"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518000982"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> First, I shall deal with amendment No. 391. I
agree with what the hon. Member for Cambridge said: in the context of
amendment No. 390, it is probably unnecessary. So I shall not disagree
with what the Minister had to say to that
amendment.</div><a name="06070518000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
afraid, however, that we are in disagreement on amendment No. 390.
Actually, having heard the Minister&#146;s explanation, I feel
slightly stronger about the matter than I did previously. She spoke
about the need to be just and proportionate. I do not feel that the
removal of the words &#147;knowingly and wilfully&#148; from the
provisions is necessary. I say &#147;removal&#148; because that is
what the law says at the moment. From what she has said, I cannot
understand why we need to change the current position. If she had given
a clear example of why the existing provisions are plainly unfair, do
not work or have led to unwelcome and indirect issues, I might have had
more sympathy, but as it is, a clear case has not been made for what
ultimately will put directors in a tougher position than is currently
the case.</div>

Clearly, their liability has increased because they cannot rely on, for

result of that increased liability, I imagine that directors and

company is charged with the exercise of managerial functions which
include the function in relation to which there has been a default or

the advice of the City law firm, Travers Smith Braithwaite, worry was

the definition for offences applying under the Companies Acts, it seems
worth while to define &#147;manager&#148;. Lord Sainsbury
identified the need to weigh possible advantages of defining it against
the risk that, in doing so, new uncertainties were introduced. We ask
the Minister to review the position, and not least to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 447</div>consider the new much tougher liability provisions under clause 774,
when a manager could be criminally liable without knowing that he or
she was a manager, let alone also not knowing that they were committing
an offence in the first place. The provision should be tightened up so
that managers know that they are indeed managers for the purposes of
company
law.</div><a name="06070518000430"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001005"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The amendment is not about
managers of companies, but managers of bodies other than companies, so
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s references to company law do not have a
huge amount to do with it. The amendment is quite out of place. It is
not on all fours with the way in which matters were moved in another
place. It is generally puzzling and I find it difficult to respond to
something that is not what he represented it to be. He talked about the
difficulty of a manager in a company knowing whether or not he was a
manager, but the clause has no application to
companies.</div><a name="06070518000431"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001006"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Perhaps the Minister misunderstood me. Clause
776(2)(b) states:</div><a name="06070518000750"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
reference to a manager or secretary of the company shall be read as
referring to any manager, secretary or similar officer of the
body.&#148;</div><a name="06070518000432"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001007"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The clause relates to the application to bodies
other than companies and not to
companies.</div><a name="06070518000433"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001008"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The amendment is asking for a definition of
&#147;manager&#148;. If I said &#147;company&#148; instead of
&#147;bodies other than companies&#148;, I apologise. However, the
amendment still stands because it relates to defining a manger for the
purposes of the
clause.</div><a name="06070518000434"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001009"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> But the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
arguments do not make any sense because all his references are to
companies, and the provision is not about companies. Indeed, under the
amendment, a manager means a person other than a director or secretary,
whether or not employed by the company. Yet the clause does not refer
to companies. It is a bad idea to define &#147;manager&#148;,
particularly in a way that is vague and likely to confuse, as it is set
out in the amendment. The position is as simple as
that.</div><a name="06070518000435"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001010"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It is clearly as simple as that if the Minister
says so. How could it be
otherwise?</div><a name="06070518000436"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001011"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Will my hon. Friend give me
guidance on &#147;manager&#148; for the purposes of clause 774(2),
which seems to relate to companies? It may be the way in which it is
co-ordinated. I have sympathy with his desire to define
&#147;manager&#148; under Bill and to give it some
context.</div><a name="06070518000437"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001012"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a point that I was going to
make in conclusion. The clause refers to a manager, and while I
appreciate the Minister&#146;s point that the drafting of the
amendment may not be as fine as it could have been, she has many
excellent advisers who could have improved it. I return to my basic
point that we maintain that the word &#147;manager&#148; should be
defined for the purpose of the clause. However, we heard clearly the
Minister&#146;s views, and on the basis of them, I beg to ask leave

etc&#148; and section 449 on the wrongful disclosure of information,
carry 12-month penalties in England but, I note, only six-month
penalties in Scotland. Will the Minister explain that disparity in
sentencing, which relates to so many offences that if one were a crook
it would be much wiser&#151;100 per cent. wiser&#151;to set up a
company in Scotland and take one&#146;s criminal chances there

ensure that the address for any director or secretary that is on the
public record is effective for the service of documents on that person.
The provision also applies to the address on the public record of
various other persons for whom the Bill requires an address on the
public record. However, the clause treats secretaries as officers, as
though other proposed changes had not happened. Although I should like
company secretary roles to be recognised, do other Government proposals
not mean that their description should not be amended in this
provision?</div><a name="06070518000481"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001027"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001037"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001038"></a>Mr.

the significance of the matter will increase, given that many
international companies are attracted to the capital markets in the
United Kingdom. They have been seeking to list their shares most
recently on the alternative investment market, moving up to the
official list in due course. There is likely to be an increasing number
of international shareholders, and the proposal might be helpful for
companies in terms of obtaining certainty regarding the delivery of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001040"></a>Mr.

now move on to part 32 of the Bill, which is entitled
&#147;Companies: Interpretation&#148;. The general purpose of the
clause is to define &#147;class of shares&#148; and &#147;class
rights&#148;. Both terms are not defined in the Companies Act 1985,
but are used at common law where rights&#151;voting rights, rights to
a dividend or rights to a return of capital&#151;attach to a
particular share and those rights are not attached to shares in another
class.</div> <a name="06070518000521"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a

purpose of subsection (2). From where does it derive? If shares have

of the same

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001044"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The clause deals with a more complex issue, on
which I am happy to share our thinking with the hon. Gentleman. The
definition it contains is important because it contains various
relaxations for private companies that have only one class of shares.
For example, under clause 541, the directors of a private company that
has only one class of shares could allot further shares in the company
to the same class without having to obtain prior authorisation for the
proposed allotment.</div>
<a name="06070518000523"></a><div class="hs_Para">The qualification in subsection
(2) carries forward an exemption contained in section 128(2) of the
1985 Act to what amounts to a separate class of shares. That is
required because it is quite common practice for a company that
proposes to allot new shares in the same class as an existing class to
state in the terms of the allotment that the new shares will not rank
for a dividend with existing shares of the same class before a certain
date in the future, or in respect of the financial year. Subsection (2)
makes it clear that that fact alone will not mean that the shares are
of a separate class to that of existing shares if in all other respects
the rights attached to them are the same. In short, we think that the
provision is useful. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06070518000524"></a>

Baird:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for succinctly
and clearly setting out the purpose of the amendment. The harm and
mischief that he intends to avoid is an unduly wide interpretation of
the phrase &#147;public authority&#148;. In the Human Rights Act
1998, for instance, that phrase is intended to have a functional
definition. Where a private company carries out public functions, the
straightforward interpretation would seem to be that the company would
be a public authority while it was carrying out those functions, but
not a public authority while it was not carrying them out. That has
been fairly narrowly interpreted in the case of Heather <i class="I">v.</i>
Leonard Cheshire Homes. It was found that a Leonard Cheshire home, even
though it was exercising functions that would otherwise have been
exercised by a local authority&#151;namely, giving care to disabled
people&#151;was not a public authority.</div>
<a name="06070518000545"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is therefore possible that
there is no need to worry. However, it is certainly not the intention
that the Secretary of State&#146;s embrace would catch the kind of
refuse company that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The point is to
prevent the public from being misled into thinking that a company has
an official status, when, in fact, it does not. Approval is required if
the name suggests a connection with the Government or with any local or
public authority. We would not be avoiding the same mischief if the
provision was made wide enough, or if it was intended to be made wide
enough by regulation, to cover a bin collecting firm.</div>
<a name="06070518000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">The mischief is that if the
amendment were passed&#151;the hon. Gentleman said that it is a
probing amendment, in any event&#151;it would exclude any body that
was not owned or controlled by the Government. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 456</div>That would include public bodies such as the Mayor of London and the
London Assembly and regulators such as Ofcom and Ofgem. There clearly
is an unacceptable risk that such names might be adopted for nefarious
purposes. I am told that there have been several scams involving such
trickery&#151;data protection notification agencies, for example. We
intend to use the power to prohibit names that convey a connection with
such public authorities.</div>

to protect the public from businesses using names that wrongly
suggested a connection to such a body if it was independent of the
Government. I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that the power
is not intended to be used in the way he suggested, and that the
amendment would overly narrow it and prevent the impact of the mischief
prevention that it is intended to provide.</div>

Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the
Minister for that clear explanation of the logic and rationale behind
the clause. As I said, my concern was that the clause might be used to
give a commercial advantage to a company that carried out a public
function. The Minister was right to highlight the human rights case
law, which gives some grounds for potential confusion, albeit that the
Leonard Cheshire Homes case significantly narrowed the definition of
the interpretation of a public authority. The Minister&#146;s point
about other public authorities or bodies that are not encapsulated
within the amendment is a valid one, but I tabled it to gain
clarification on the way in which the Secretary of State&#146;s
order-making power would be used. What the Minister has said about not
causing mischief or a misleading impression in relation to the
connection with the Government is
helpful.</div><a name="06070518000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given what
the Minister said about how the order-making power will work, and that
the definition of public authority will bite only in the context of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001055"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause allows the Secretary of State to
withdraw his or her approval of a business name when the name suggests
a connection with the Government or a public authority, or uses some
other form of sensitive word or expression. As drafted, the Secretary
of State has a wide power to withdraw the permission if it appears to
him or her that there are overriding considerations of public policy.
There should be certain protections for the businesses concerned in
such circumstances in the interests of natural justice. In particular,
the business concerned should understand why approval to use the name
has been withdrawn, and that notice should be in writing. I believe
that that is common ground.</div>
<a name="06070518000558"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the debate that we had
on the general concept of &#147;in writing&#148;, and that might
well be dealt with in the round as with all such issues in the Bill.
Reasonable notice should be given to enable the business to make the
transition to a new name. That can be seen in the drafting. The
Secretary of State is able to use</div>
<a name="06070518000762"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;overriding considerations of
public policy&#148;.</div><a name="06070518000559"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would insert the
phrase:</div><a name="06070518000763"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where harm may
be caused to the
public&#148;</div><a name="06070518000560"></a><div class="hs_Para">to give that some
context. Some contextual position would be helpful so that we can
understand how the Secretary of State intends to use the power. At the
moment, subsection (3) simply says that the notice must state the date
from which the approval is withdrawn, hence the reason why the
amendment seeks to add the
words</div><a name="06070518000764"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and the reason or
reasons why the approval is being withdrawn.&#148;</div>
<a name="06070518000561"></a><div class="hs_Para">The business would therefore know that
the power was not being used in a capricious or inappropriate way, and
if there had been some irrationality or unreasonableness on the part of
the Secretary of State, a legal challenge could be
undertaken.</div> <a name="06070518000562"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
should not be used purely for ease of administration for the
Government. That may be considered as an overriding consideration of
public policy, but it may pose no harm to the public. Amendment No. 402
therefore tries to offer a context by ensuring that the power would be
used only where harm may be caused to the public. The amendments are
generally probing in nature, but they also seek some greater
understanding of the ambit of the clause and to ensure that the sorts
of basic protections that are not unreasonable to businesses are
provided within
it.</div><a name="06070518000563"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001056"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> We would agree to consider amendment No. 404, which
requires the notice to be in writing, if the hon. Gentleman is happy
not to press it to a Division. We are pretty sympathetic to the idea
that these notices should be in writing. It is quite odd that under
subsection (3) the notice must state the date from which the approval
is withdrawn. I do not quite know how a notice can state the date
unless it is in writing. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 458</div>The individual who was notifying would have to state the date, so it is
probably implicit that it should be in writing anyway. We will take
that away and tidy it
up.</div><a name="06070518000564"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
raised a specific point about whether overriding considerations of
public policy would include ease of administration. It would not.
Amendment No. 402 restricts the public policy reasons for withdrawing
approval for the use of a business name to a situation where harm would
be caused to the public. Our difficulty with that is slightly oblique.
As the risk of harm to the public is the reason underlying the
requirement for prior approval for the name, it is not strictly
necessary to specify that mischief as the reason for withdrawing
approval. We therefore wonder whether amendment No. 402 would add
anything, bearing in mind that there are always dangers in adding on to
a clause that is quite similar to another clause.</div>
<a name="06070518000565"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman and I have
looked at clause 65. There is a danger that if we add something on to
another clause that otherwise resembles clause 65, it would be easy for
them to be interpreted differently. If he is content that the mischief
that we seek to avoid is harm being caused to the public&#151;that is
really the only basis on which the power would be used&#151;it is
better not to accept amendment No.
402.</div><a name="06070518000566"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 403
would require reasonable notice to be given. The argument is pretty
similar. If the Secretary of State developed a policy of giving
unreasonable notice and required companies to change their names on
demand, no doubt it would be challenged. We suggest that common law is
probably sufficient protection. It is implicit that notice would need
to be reasonable for the exercise of the power itself to be reasonable
at all. Although this is a slight extension of what I would say is
implicit in common law, we would none the less say that making
arbitrary decisions about withdrawing consent without giving reasons
would probably be so open to challenge that it would not
occur.</div> <a name="06070518000567"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, there
is no reason to specify without giving reasons what we fear about all
three amendments if the hon. Gentleman is satisfied that the common law
acts in the way that I suggest it does. By adding bits, the amendments
will cast doubt on whether the drafting elsewhere in the Bill requires
the Secretary of State to give reasonable notice of and reasons for the
directions that he makes. I am thinking particularly about clause 65,
in which the nature of the mischief is different but the structure of
the clause is
similar.</div><a name="06070518000568"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman is satisfied that the common law will act to put pretty well
all the words he wants into the Bill, I invite him to withdraw the
amendment. However, we are happy to consider amendmentNo.
404.</div><a name="06070518000569"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001057"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
response. She drew parallels with clause 65, which has a similar
structure to this clause. I may come back to her on that, but I will
leave it for the next set of amendments, when I will argue the point in
reverse.</div> <a name="06070518000570"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s most relevant point was in relation to the
phrase</div><a name="06070518000765"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where harm may be
caused to the public&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 459</div><a name="06070518000571"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noted especially what she said in terms
of how the power would be used in the first place. In clauses 822 and
823, the power would only be used in the first place, and therefore
permission would be granted only if it was felt that harm was not being
caused to the public. Although it would be entirely possible to use
clause 825 without that context and without having regard to the
initial reason from a technical, legal drafting point of view, I hear
what the Minister says about the practical application. If reasons were
not given, it would heighten the chances of a challenge being
made.</div> <a name="06070518000572"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this age of
trying to avoid unnecessary litigation, I can follow what the Minister
said about how the provision would be operated in practice, even though
I would argue that it would be more helpful to state it explicitly in
the Bill. I note that the provisions relating to notification in
writing will be addressed separately, and I take careful note of the
Minister&#146;s clarification and assurances. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001058"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 406, in
clause 827, page 401, line 2, leave
out sections (1) and (2) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) If in the
opinion of the Secretary of State a person is carrying on business in
The United Kingdom under a name that gives so misleading an indication
of the nature of its activities as to be likely to cause harm to the
public, the Secretary of State may direct the person carrying on such
activites to change the name used by such a person in connection with
such activities.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2) The
direction must be complied with within a period of six weeks from the
date of the direction or such longer period as the Secretary of State
may think fit to allow, unless an application is duly made to the court
under the following
provisions.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(3) The person in
receipt of the direction may within the period of three weeks from the
date of the direction, apply to the court to set the direction
aside.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(4) The court may set
the direction aside or confirm
it.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(5) If the direction is

direction is to be complied
with.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(6) If a person fails to
comply with a direction under this section an offence is
committed.&#146;.</div>
<a name="06070518000577"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come to the point when I
argue back to the Minister what she has argued back to me. Clause 827
covers similar ground to that of clause 76, in so far as it covers
names likely to give a misleading impression of the activities of the
company or, in this case, the business. However, clause 827 is not
structured in the same way as clause 76 in that it simply makes it an
offence for a business to carry on activities with a name that is so
misleading that it is likely to cause harm to the
public.</div><a name="06070518000578"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a very different approach from the company name equivalent, as the
sanction must be triggered by a notice from the Secretary of State
within a six-week period to enable the company to change its name. An
offence is committed in that case only if the company 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 460</div>does not change its name within the specified period. The company is
also afforded a right of challenge to the court, which may set the
direction aside or confirm it.</div>
<a name="06070518000579"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the point of view of
consistency, it seems odd that the regime under clause 827 is much more
draconian, given that it appears to cover a very similar situation. I
should be interested to hear why the Government believe that a business
in that case is so fundamentally different from a
company.</div>
<a name="06070518000799"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45
pm</div><a name="06070518000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
406 would delete subsections (1) and (2) and replace them with
provisions that are substantially the same as those in clause 76. That
might mean that the power under clause 827 was used more effectively,
as complaint would lie with the Secretary of State, who could make an
order if he or she was of the opinion that a misleading impression had
been created. However, in clause 827, complaint appears to lie with the
police and the prosecuting authorities, which means that it would need
to be shown beyond all reasonable doubt that the name was so misleading
that it was likely to cause harm to the
public.</div><a name="06070518000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">My fear is
that it may be much more difficult to demonstrate that that evidential
burden had been met. The amendment would therefore adopt a more
workable and consistent regime, reflecting that in clause 76 in part
5.</div><a name="06070518000582"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001059"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I take the point about the burden
of proof&#151;or the standard of proof, as I suppose it is,
really&#151;which is sensible, but the hon. Gentleman is really
probing why there is a difference between the regimes in clauses 76 and
827.</div><a name="06070518000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
clause 76, we considered a company registered under a name that gives
so misleading an indication of the activities of the business as to be
likely to cause harm to the public, but of course there is greater risk
of harm to the public from such a name being used in the course of
business&#151;that is what this clause deals with&#151;than from it
being a company&#146;s registered name. That is why we have
introduced what is perhaps, on the face of it, a more draconian
provision.</div><a name="06070518000584"></a><div class="hs_Para">A person
trading under a name that is likely to cause harm to the public should
be stopped as soon as practicable. That trading should be an offence in
itself, but under the amendment the offence would be failure to comply
with a direction to change the
name.</div><a name="06070518000585"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070518001060"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001061"></a>Vera

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001062"></a>Mr.

must not carry on business in the United Kingdom under a name that
gives&#148;</div><a name="06070518000588"></a><div class="hs_Para">a misleading
impression. My view is that a rather large chunk of trade unionists
might think that the Labour party is not carrying on as it should,
these days. I merely use that as a light-hearted illustration of the
point that a political party might be named in a way that is wholly
misleading.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 461</div><a name="06070518000589"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001063"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The answer is that if the party were trading, the
clause might apply to it, but political parties are basically not
businesses, are they? We are talking about risk of harm to the public
from a name being used in the course of business. That is not going to
happen with a political
party.</div><a name="06070518000590"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001064"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Just one further point on that: as I
understand it, the regime that we debated under clause 76 provides the
mechanism that I have sought to reflect in the amendment. I note that
the Minister has, in essence, acknowledged that the regime in clause
827 is somewhat more draconian in effect. As she says, if the name is
being used as a trading name, the matter needs to be dealt with more
quickly.</div><a name="06070518000591"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
interrelationship between clauses 76 and 827, it seems that a limited
liability company trading under its own name might be caught under both
provisions and might find that it is caught on one side but not on the
other. That seems slightly
strange.</div><a name="06070518000592"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001065"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I do not follow that. I think the hon. Gentleman
said that a company might be caught under both provisions, which is
probably right, in which case it would have to endure, as it were, the
two different regimes to rectify its
position.</div><a name="06070518000593"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
real point is to be quick, which is perhaps a better way to describe
the proposal than more draconian, although I concede that it is more
draconian, because cases will go straight to prosecution. Under the
regime that the hon. Gentleman described, the direction would have to
be challenged within three weeks. The direction has to be complied with
within six weeks, but if it is challenged that has to happen within
three weeks. So, the direction is issued and three weeks may pass, on
the last day of which the perpetrator of a scam can put in a
notice.</div><a name="06070518000594"></a><div class="hs_Para">Theoretically,
if the court dealt with the matter straight away and confirmed the
direction, there would be a further six weeks, which means a total of
nine weeks, during which the scam could subsist. However, that is not
what happens, because the three weeks&#146; notice is notice only to
the court&#151;heaven knows when the case would get to court to be
either confirmed or rejected&#151;so the time for which the company
may subsist, using a name for a scam, is sizeable. That is the
problem.</div>
<a name="06070518000595"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001066"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The point is that the test under clauses 76
and 827 must be whether harm is being caused to the public. Even under
clause 76, therefore, harm will be caused to the public in both
situations. That is the basis on which I question the need for a
different regime under both. The test might be harder to prove under
clause 827, but if the case is more urgent, which the Minister seems to
be suggesting, there might be a need for greater flexibility and an
ability to move more quickly, which might lie more with the Secretary
of
State.</div><a name="06070518000596"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001067"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Self-evidently it would not,
because there would be so much time in the process under the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s proposal. Bringing a prosecution of course increases
the standard of proof from, one imagines, the balance of probability in
the situation to beyond reasonable doubt. I do not know, however,
because if, under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s regime, the court was
determining the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 462</div>question, &#147;Is this, in effect, unlawful trading?&#148;, it
might feel that it had to adopt the higher standard of proof
anyway.</div><a name="06070518000597"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s experience in the law will tell him that where proof
of a crime is required to satisfy a civil claim, the civil court will
adopt the higher standard of
proof.</div><a name="06070518000598"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to digress too much, but that is a terrible mischief in
domestic violence cases. One applies for an injunction that should be
taken on the civil burden, but because, if there is violence, the case
will be taken as a crime, there is a risk of the judge taking it upon
himself to impose the higher standard of proof, making the case harder
to prove. I wonder whether the same is true for the cases that we are
discussing.</div><a name="06070518000599"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
judge would find as he is required to find under our clause 827, as it
were, such a finding would be likely to have to be proved to the same
standard, as it would involve a criminal offence. The hon. Gentleman
would not make such cases easier by having the lower standard of proof,
but he would substantially extend the period over which a scam could
subsist, in the way that I have
described.</div><a name="06070518000600"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, the
greater, or more pernicious and immediate, mischief to the public that
is represented by breaches of the clause, rather than that represented
by breaches of clause 76, requires our approach, not that suggested by
the hon. Gentleman. On that basis, I hope he is persuaded to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="06070518000601"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001068"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
response, although I am not entirely persuaded. I hear what she says
about the burden of proof in the context of clause 76, but the
structure and framing of that clause are clear, inasmuch as the
criminal liability applies only if the order is not complied with
within the given period. Therefore, carrying on the business name up to
that point is not a criminal issue; only the failure to comply with the
notice is
criminal.</div><a name="06070518000602"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation is arguable. Under clause 76, it
is</div><a name="06070518000767"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the opinion of the
Secretary of State&#148;</div><a name="06070518000603"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
harm is caused to the public. Although I hear what the Minister says, I
do not accept that there is the same criminal
standard.</div><a name="06070518000604"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also hear
what the Minister says about whether my amendment might make it harder
to use the relevant power quickly in this context because of the
specific periods involved and the court challenge, but clauses 76 and
827 address the same evils of harm being caused to the public. There
should be
consistency.</div><a name="06070518000605"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fear
that the involvement of the police and the prosecuting authorities, as
well as the burden of proof needed in terms of harm caused to the
public&#151;not a reasoned opinion, but actual harm&#151;might make
it more difficult to enforce clause 827. I would not like to see the
Secretary of State issuing an order requiring a company to change its
name and being successful in that, but not succeeding in stopping it
continuing to trade under its trading name, even though it had changed
its company name, if those names were one and the same. In other words,
if X Ltd. were trading as X, the provision should be able to bite in
both circumstances. I seek to address that structural issue with my
amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001069"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> That is an interesting point for an anorak, which
the hon. Gentleman and both I are. The question is not whether the
provision sets out a criminal offence of using a name that is so
misleading an indication of the nature of the activities that it is
likely to cause harm; it does not matter that the clause does not make
that a crime. The question for the court in considering what standard
of proof to adopt is whether such activity is criminal behaviour. It
almost certainly will be, because it will clearly have been done
deliberately.</div><a name="06070518000607"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
criminal behaviour is involved, irrespective of whether it is not
expressed as an offence in the Bill, I am afraid that the court will
adopt the higher standard of proof. Similarly, domestic violence does
not need to be expressed to be an offence in the application for an
injunction&#151;it just happens to be
criminal.</div><a name="06070518000608"></a><div class="hs_Para">By pushing
the amendment forward, we would achieve only a lot of delay when we
ought to have a quick, summary way to get rid of people who are
deliberately causing harm to the public. I apologise for the long
intervention.</div><a name="06070518000609"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001070"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the
Minister&#146;s helpful remarks. We probably differ in our
interpretation of clause 76 and how it will apply in contrast with
clause 827. I want to ensure that the power under clause 827 is used
efficiently and effectively. I am concerned that, because of the
different structure and the agencies that will be engaged in the
process, it might be much more difficult to enforce clause 827,
compared with clause 76. My view is still that the most appropriate
means of addressing this problem is to adopt the same approach to
similar
clauses.</div><a name="06070518000610"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Minister is not minded to accept the amendment at the moment, I ask her
to consider it carefully. Given the nature of the amendments we are
discussing, it would not be useful to press them to a vote, but there
is something to be considered in terms of the
structure.</div><a name="06070518000611"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause
stand part, I shall raise another issue in relation to criminal
liability that might provide even more context. However, in response to
the Minister&#146;s comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070518000612"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001071"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> There are a few more aspects of clause 827
that I want to mention and which touch on wider points that do not lend
themselves directly to straightforward amendment. I am grateful for the
input of David Rose, an intellectual property partner at the law firm,
SJ
Berwin.</div><a name="06070518000800"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9
pm</div><a name="06070518000615"></a><div class="hs_Para">As debated on
the previous amendment, the primary purpose of the clause is to protect
the public from a business that misleads them, by its trading name, as
to the services or goods it provides. For example, the clause would
appear to prohibit an entity from carrying on business under the name
&#147;All Organic&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 464</div><a name="06070518000616"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001072"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Given the origin of the support for this particular
amendment, I wondered whether it could be considered a party political
contribution under the terms of the
Bill.</div><a name="06070518000617"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001073"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> When the Minister hears the point, I think
she will realise that that is not the case. We are trying to address a
fairly serious issue of law and to gain some understanding of the ambit
of the clause. As drafted, the clause would appear to prohibit an
entity from carrying on business under the name &#147;All
Organic&#148; in relation to food products that are not
organic.</div> <a name="06070518000618"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is,
however, a question as to whether the clause provides protection
between businesses inter se. It is arguable that the clause may be
understood as providing a statutory basis for the rule that companies
may not use a name so similar to the name used by an existing business
if that is likely to mislead the public into confusing the two
concerns. If that argument is correct and if a court could ascribe such
a meaning to the clause, the provision if enacted would effectively
mean that passing off became a criminal offence. That would amount to a
major reshaping of a third party&#146;s liability for passing off, a
tort that has traditionally required the putative claimant to prove
that it owns goodwill in and to a distinctive trade name, logo, get-up
or similar, and that a third party&#146;s use of the same or a
similar name would cause confusion between the two businesses among
members of the
public.</div><a name="06070518000619"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also creates a strict liability offence, because it is irrelevant
whether the business owner uses the name with the intention of giving a
misleading indication as to the nature of the activities or not. Its
application may therefore have unjust consequences, especially when a
third party passes itself off as a competitor without knowledge of that
competitor&#146;s rights. In passing off, there is no requirement
that the alleged wrongdoer knew of the earlier, common law
rights.</div> <a name="06070518000620"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
also troubling on the question of how the test of misleading will be
applied. In a passing off case, it is necessary to consider all the
circumstances to assess whether there is liability. Classically,
disclaimers that are sufficiently prominent can successfully deflect an
allegation that a third party&#146;s use causes confusion. The
clause, however, speaks of a name
that</div><a name="06070518000768"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;gives so misleading
an indication&#148;.</div><a name="06070518000621"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is an
offence therefore committed if the name itself is misleading even if,
in all the circumstances, the context of its use means that the public
would never be misled? Moreover, criminal liability already exists
under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 in relation to goods or services
that are provided under a business name that misleads the public as to
the nature of those goods or services. I should be grateful for any
clarification that the Minister can
provide.</div><a name="06070518000622"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001074"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I want to pursue the point about political parties.
I thought that there was an element of doubt in the Minister&#146;s
mind in the last debate as to whether the clause applies to political
parties. I think that political parties are a business, though they are
obviously not companies. There are senses in which they raise money and
carry on activities, though their objective is to win 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 465</div>votes. I have looked for a definition of business in the Bill and I
cannot find one, so will the Minister make it clear on the record that
the clause definitively cannot apply to political parties? I want a
sense of how confident she is that the clause might not catch any of
us.</div><a name="06070518000623"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001075"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I do not know whether the Conservative party is a
business, but I doubt whether the Labour party is. The clause requires
there to be a business, so the answer is that if the hon. Gentleman
thinks that his party is covered by it and that the cap fits, fine. He
can worry himself to death if he thinks that
&#147;Conservative&#148; is a misleading
name.</div><a name="06070518000624"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Hornchurch talked about a business with the name &#147;All
Organic&#148; and the fact that food sold might not be organic. The
question is whether that criminality applies to passing off. I think
that that was the essence of the question. The answer is no, because
the offence in clause 827 relates
to</div><a name="06070518000769"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the nature of the
activities of the
business&#148;.</div><a name="06070518000625"></a><div class="hs_Para">Passing off is
pretending to be somebody else. So there is a distinction
there.</div> <a name="06070518000626"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that make
me as clever as the chap fromSJ Berwin, or possibly someone
else as clever as an individual from SJ Berwin? That is what we say to
those arguments, although on the face of it they were impressive ones.
Frankly, the purpose of the clause is just to stop the use of a
business name</div> <a name="06070518000770"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
gives so misleading an indication of the nature of the activities of
the business as to be likely to cause harm to the
public.&#148;</div><a name="06070518000627"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is perfectly
evident from the argument that the hon. Member for Hornchurch agrees
that that should be
stopped.</div><a name="06070518000628"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001076"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman asked a question and it might
be helpful if the Minister could answer it. Is the clause intended to
create a strict liability crime? I do not read it that way. I read the
words &#147;must not carry on&#148; as importing some sort of
mental element into the offence. That was a serious
point.</div><a name="06070518000629"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001077"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I might be corrected, but I suspect that we go back
full circle to the person in default and the liability of the officer
concerned. I think that that would be somebody
who</div><a name="06070518000771"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;authorises or
permits, participates in, or fails to take all reasonable steps to
prevent&#148;</div><a name="06070518000630"></a><div class="hs_Para">the offence.
However one might determine criminal intent, those elements would have
to be present. That is how clause 827(3) works. So I invite the
Committee to think that the clause should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06070518000631"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001078"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the legal guidance and
clarification that the Minister has given about why it is felt that
passing off is not caught by the wording in the clause. I think that
the interpretation and clarification given has been helpful. Clearly
there was some thought among legal circles that passing off could have
been captured.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 466</div><a name="06070518000632"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that strict liability is
a separate issue. The Minister said that officers would need to satisfy
the relevant tests that she set out succinctly. However, the clause is
wide enough to cover not just companies. Clause 827(3) refers to
offences</div><a name="06070518000772"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;committed by a
body
corporate&#148;.</div><a name="06070518000633"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, a
sole trader, partnership or some other organisation could be caught
within the ambit of the clause, but fall outside the test applied to
officers in default, which is explained clearly and set out in the
Bill.</div><a name="06070518000634"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
push the Minister unduly, but it might be helpful for the outside world
and for when we come to rely on and interpret the clause, if she could
give further clarification on the concept of strict liability, and the
meaning of the clause in that regard. Further guidance would be
extremely
helpful.</div><a name="06070518000635"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001081"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have a further point about interpretation
and clarification. Clause 831 provides for certain disclosure
requirements for a business conducted in the UK. Clause 829 states that
chapter 2 of part
34</div><a name="06070518000773"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;applies to an
individual or partnership carrying on business in the United
Kingdom&#148;,</div> <a name="06070518000646"></a><div class="hs_Para">yet clause 831
discusses</div> <a name="06070518000774"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person
carrying on business in the United
Kingdom&#148;,</div><a name="06070518000647"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that
language is reflected in subsequent clauses in the chapter. That risks
confusion, as a legal person could encompass more than an individual.
Indeed, it is arguable whether a partnership is a person at all.
Amendment No. 408 therefore seeks clarity about precisely what clause
831 will cover in applying to an individual or partnership, given that
that is what is stated in clause 829(1).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 467</div><a name="06070518000648"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 833 gives the Secretary
of State powerto require by regulation that notices providing
information under the clause be provided in a specified form. Given
that clause 833 states that the notice must be displayed in a prominent
position so as to be easily read, that appears to be over-regulation,
unless the Minister feels that there are other evils or issues that are
not addressed by the clause and need to be addressed by regulation. I
look forward to her comments to see whether I can be persuaded to the
contrary.</div><a name="06070518000649"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 412 and 414 reflect the same logic. Amendment No. 413 will make a
small drafting point by replacing &#147;who&#148; with
&#147;which&#148; in clause 834(2). That seems more correct to me,
but I again look forward to the Minister&#146;s
reply.</div><a name="06070518000650"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001084"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I rise to make a small technical point on
clause 837, which deals with the interpretation used in part 34 of the
Bill. Clause 837 states that a partnership
means</div><a name="06070518000775"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) a partnership
within the Partnership Act 1890 (c. 39),
or</div><a name="06070518000776"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(b) a limited
partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 1907 (c.
24),</div><a name="06070518000777"></a><div class="hs_brev">or a firm or entity of a
similar character formed under the law of a country or territory
outside the United
Kingdom&#148;.</div><a name="06070518000657"></a><div class="hs_Para">I confess that
I am no legal expert in that area, but why is there no reference to
partnership legislation relating to Northern Ireland, as in clause
911(2)? The legislation appears to be relevant, given that clause 821
states that part 34 will apply to the United Kingdom as a whole.
Northern Ireland is not outside the UK and therefore would not be
captured by the saving words after the definition of
&#147;partnership&#148;.</div><a name="06070518000658"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister clarify whether it is intended that the references in
clause 911(2) to various partnership statutes should be reflected in
the clause? Is there some other reason why that legislation is not
addressed in the definition of &#147;partnership&#148; in clause
837?</div><a name="06070518000659"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001085"></a>Vera

Acts predate Northern
Ireland.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001086"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for that
clarification. However, clause 911(2) refers to certain statutes that
appear to allow a partnership to be formed in certain circumstances. It
lists the Limited Liability Partnerships Act (Northern Ireland) 2002,
the Limited Partnerships Act 1907 as it formerly had effect in Northern
Ireland, the Open-Ended Investment Companies Act (Northern Ireland)
2002 and the European Economic Interest Groupings Regulations (Northern
Ireland) 1989. I seek clarity that, given that those statutes appear to
cover bodies of a partnership nature, if bodies were incorporated or
established under the legislation that is due to be repealed, the
appropriate cross-reference would be captured in clause
837.</div><a name="06070518000661"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001087"></a>Vera

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001089"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 267, in
clause 857, page 416, line 1, leave
out subsection
(3).</div><a name="06070518000671"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001090"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendment No.
268.</div><a name="06070518000672"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001091"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The Professional Oversight Board is an operating
body of the Financial Reporting Council, and is currently responsible
for exercising the Secretary of State&#146;s functions delegated to
it under the Companies Act 1989 on the regulation of auditors. The
Government expects that the role of independent supervisor of the
Comptroller and Auditor General will be carried out by the Professional
Oversight Board. The board is accountable, and will report annually, to
the Secretary of State and through him to Parliament on the exercise of
all functions delegated to it under this part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="06070518000673"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government recognise that
the accountability and transparency of all bodies that perform a public
function is important, and the issue was debated at length in another
place. However, it is also important that designation of a body under
the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is made only after careful
consideration and consultation. Section 5 of that Act imposes an
explicit statutory obligation to consult a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 469</div>body to which an order under the section applies. Designating the
Professional Oversight Board in the way proposed in the clause bypasses
that important obligation and therefore makes the subsection
technically
ineffective.</div><a name="06070518000674"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are building up evidence on the impact that freedom of
information has had on the bodies that meet the existing criteria,
particularly whether the costs and burdens of its application under
section 5 of the 2000 Act to private bodies performing public functions
are
appropriate.</div><a name="06070518000675"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Constitutional Affairs is proposing to review which
bodies might be suitable for section 5 designations under the FOI Act.
The Financial Reporting Council, of which the Professional Oversight
Board is a part, will be included in that review.</div>
<a name="06070518000676"></a><div class="hs_Para">I feel strongly that the review
is the appropriate context within which to consider the position of the
Professional Oversight Board, with respect to inclusion within the
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. We would expect any
designation order to be made after proper consultation with that body.
It is for those reasons that we are seeking to reverse the amendments
made in the other
place.</div><a name="06070518000677"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001092"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I have to say that we were surprised to see the
Government bringing forth those proposed amendments. As the Minister
said, the matter was debated at some length in the House of Lords. I
must have heard at least half a dozen times today alone both Ministers
saying that matters have been debated in the House of Lords and that we
do not need to debate them further and yet the Government are doing
exactly what they are saying that we should not be doing ourselves.
That is an ironic state of affairs, to say the least.</div>
<a name="06070518000678"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on to the clauses, it
seems as if we are debating two clauses here. Amendment No.267 deals
with clause 857, but amendment No.268 deals with clause 881. On clause
857, the explanatory notes say that &#147;<i class="I">Subsections (1)
and</i>&#148;&#151;I think that the notes should say
(2)&#151;</div><a name="06070518000778"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide that
the Secretary of State has to appoint a body to be the Independent
Supervisor of Auditors General in respect of the exercise of statutory
audit functions. <i class="I">Subsection
(2)</i>&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06070518000679"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that that should be subsection
(3)&#151;</div><a name="06070518000779"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provides for
the appointment of the Independent Supervisor to have the effect of
making it subject to the obligations of the Freedom of Information Act
2000.&#148;</div><a name="06070518000680"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the
notes are wrong.</div>
<a name="06070518000780"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;<i class="I">Subsections (4), (5)
and (6) </i>provide that a body may be appointed as Independent
supervisor of an Auditor-General if it is a corporate body or
unincorporated association that is willing to carry out the function,
that has arrangements in place that will ensure that the supervision is
carried out effectively, and if that will exercise such functions and
requirements that may be laid down in the Secretary of State&#146;s
order appointing it. The appointed Independent Supervisor must perform
its function on a UK-wide basis for all four Auditors General in
accordance with <i class="I">clause 857</i>&#148;</div>
<a name="06070518000681"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we look at clause
857(1):</div><a name="06070518000781"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State must appoint a body (&#147;the Independent
Supervisor&#148;) to discharge the function mentioned in section
858(1) (&#147;the supervision function&#148;).&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 470</div><a name="06070518000682"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then in clause 858(1), it
says:</div><a name="06070518000782"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Independent Supervisor must supervise the performance by each Auditor
General of his functions as a statutory
auditor.&#148;</div><a name="06070518000683"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister
said, that was debated at some length in the Lords. However, Baroness
Noakes, who is herself an experienced auditor, spoke extremely well on
that. I am going to put to the Committee a small proportion of the key
points that she made. She
said:</div><a name="06070518000783"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that when a Minister delegates his functions to a body, whether
a public sector body or not, it is right that the Freedom of
Information Act, rights and responsibilities also follow. Put another
way, it would be wrong if a Government Department could avoid the
operation of the Act by choosing to delegate functions in a particular
way, rather than carry them out directly. So as a matter of principle
we think that the Act should apply to the cases such as the delegation
of functions to the independent supervisor and the Public Oversight
Board.</div><a name="06070518000784"></a><div class="hs_brev">More
substantively, we have a very real belief that the performance of audit
firms, which will be a function of the Public Oversight Board, ought to
be in the public domain. If we are to have confidence in the role of
auditors underpinning the strength of our capital markets, it makes no
sense at all to keep auditor performance behind the closed doors of the
Public Oversight Board. As the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and I
explained&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06070518000684"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
amendments were also supported by the Liberal Democrat
peers&#151;</div><a name="06070518000785"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in Grand
Committee and at Report, audit committees of listed companies bear a
big responsibility to oversee the appointment of auditors and their
work. How can audit committees discharge that responsibility if
important information is kept from them? How can they rationally carry
out a tender for an audit if they cannot compare the relative
performance of auditors as judged by a knowledgeable external body?
These two amendments are in the public
interest.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23
May 2006; Vol. 682, c.
768-69.]</div><a name="06070518000685"></a><div class="hs_Para">Baroness Noakes was
making some important points, which go to the heart of what delegation
to a public sector body should mean.</div>
<a name="06070518000686"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government said that they
would be building a body of evidence for section 5 designations.
However, the matter has been comprehensively debated in the Lords. The
Government have had plenty of notice about the provisions, and they
have had plenty of time to consult the appropriate people&#151;all
the bodies that the Minister mentioned earlier. There has been plenty
of time for a review, quite apart from the fact that the matter has
been consulted on for eight years. If we take only the Lords stages, it
has been going on since January. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] If the Minister
for Industry and the Regions wants to intervene and talk about Eccles
cakes, she may do so, but I think that we should stick to the
substantive points.</div>
<a name="06070518000687"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government wanted to
change the Bill in the right way, they would have left the Lords
amendments in place&#151;they contain the principles of the matter,
which we believe are important and should be maintained&#151;and
undertake their consultations, going to all the people whom the
Minister mentioned in her opening remarks. They would then come back on
Report with a thought-through series of amendments, putting in place a
regime that would be acceptable to all parties.</div>
<a name="06070518000688"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the right hon.
Lady can tell from the way I am talking that we do not have a closed
mind. However, we are not willing to roll over and
accept 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 471</div>Government amendments to delete the clauses in their totality, so that
we just start from nothing again. If we do that, all the work done in
the Lords will have been for nothing and the pressure will have come
off the Government to table amendments that would add to the Bill
rather than detract from it.</div>
<a name="06070518000689"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, perhaps we
should now move to the other
clause.</div><a name="06070518000690"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001093"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Don&#146;t read it out word for
word.</div><a name="06070518000691"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001094"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister spoke to it,
although she did say that there was a second
clause.</div>
<a name="06070518000692"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001095"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I note that the hon. Gentleman is attempting to
delay the due process of the Committee&#146;s business. That is his
right, but we should all bear that in mind if there is any discussion
about an extension of time. We need to use our time effectively and to
serve the interests of the public
properly.</div><a name="06070518000693"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001096"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for
Reigate (Mr.
Blunt).</div><a name="06070518000802"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001097"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> Is my hon. Friend as astonished
as I am by that unbelievable outburst from the Minister? I do not know
how many clauses we have been through today, because I have not counted
them, but he, like the Minister and I have served on a number of other
Committees, and to suggest that we are not making very good progress
with the Bill, given that by the time the consolidation clauses come
out, this will be the largest piece of legislation ever to come before
Parliament, is unworthy of her&#151;particularly given the
filibustering that has occurred because the Government have on two
occasions so far been unable to produce a majority on the
Committee.</div>
<a name="06070518000695"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001098"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for putting the record
straight. He is quite right. We have done a huge amount of business
today, and the Government have no right to say that we are delaying
matters, particularly in relation to two amendments that are Government
wrecking amendments. That is the whole point. The Government are
proposing wrecking amendments, so to say that we are somehow delaying
the proceedings is out of the question.</div>
<a name="06070518000696"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001099"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that for a Government who
sought to argue that trade unions were not political organisations, and
wasted an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 472</div>enormous amount of time trying to do so, it is indeed rich that they
should now blame the Opposition for wasting
time?</div>
<a name="06070518000697"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001100"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. What has this
got to do with the clause that we are
discussing?</div>
<a name="06070518000698"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001101"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Very good point. Let us get back to the
amendments.</div>
<a name="06070518000699"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001102"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I agree. The interventions, which the Government
prompted, have lowered the tone of a constructive day on which we have
made a huge amount of progress.</div>
<a name="06070518000700"></a><div class="hs_Para">By now, the Minister will
appreciate my point, and on that note, I rest my
case.</div>
<a name="06070518000701"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001103"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070518001104"></a>The
