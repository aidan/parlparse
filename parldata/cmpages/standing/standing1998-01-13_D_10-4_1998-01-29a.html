<P>
On resuming--
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Our brief interlude has refreshed the Committee. We are now considering, appropriately, a clause on conciliation. I hope that, when readers of our deliberations compare the speech that the Minister made before the break with the speech that I am about to make, they will realise which party has been more conciliatory.
<P>
I do not object to the principle of the clause. I welcome conciliation when appropriate. I look forward to further briefings from ACAS and to gaining some experience of its work.
<P>
I want to make two points, which do not derogate from my previous statements. The clause is the key to tribunal action; and does not provide for conciliation without tribunal action. Conciliation is a formal procedure that is invoked in cases that would otherwise go to industrial tribunals, to facilitate the resolution of the dispute, if possible, by agreement, without going through the full process. I support that principle. However, an hour or two ago, we had interesting debates about the composition of industrial tribunal panels and whether the chairman sat alone. The clause appears to reverse the Government's earlier arguments.
<P>
We were told that industrial tribunals would work on assertions, allegations or claims that the national minimum wage was not paid, or as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymeade and Weybridge would say, circumstances in which the wage was paid, but the complexity of the remunerations package led to doubts about the level of payment, and, therefore, about whether the employment complied with national minimum wage legislation. Those are technical matters. Earlier, the Government said that a legal chairman sitting alone might appropriately deal with legalistic arguments. At least the Government had a case, although it did not convince us. However, in clause 27, ACAS is invited to intervene in tribunal proceedings. Perhaps it is an incomplete view of ACAS, but we tend to see it as a body that tries to stop strikes at the marco level, and to conciliate between low-level disputes at the micro level. That may be within the competence of experienced industrial negotiators, and they are certainly that.
<P>
In the case of the national minimum wage, as the Government themselves argued in relation to clause 25, these are highly technical and legalistic matters. We need to ask not whether ACAS officials can do the job, which I am sure in principle they ought to be able to do--I give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I do not mean to diminish the contribution that ACAS officials make, but is it my hon. Friend's experience that the ACAS officials who will be called upon to do this work are in any great numbers legally trained or see a legal basis to the professional expertise that they bring to bear on this?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My understanding is that they are rarely, if ever, legally trained. If one went through the whole personnel register one would find one or two who read law at university, but it is not part of the normal job specification for an ACAS official. They are trained conciliators or mediators and their job is largely to seek agreement. In this case, they have the important task of hacking to the facts of the situation and interpreting those facts and complex remuneration packages; they will need some of those elements of a legal approach.
<P>
What provision is the Minister of State making for the training of ACAS officers in paralegal studies? A complementary approach would be to have a cadre within ACAS of special legally trained officers to whom, if I may put it this way, the field staff could refer. It may be necessary to do a bit of one and some of the other. There needs to be a base knowledge of the law and specialist officers to whom hard cases can be referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I can well understand the source of my hon. Friend's concern. Is not the problem here that ACAS officers are often experienced in dealing with statutory rights but not perhaps with disputes about contractual law? It is in relation to that discipline that knowledge and experience are required, and it might well be lacking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend will know that I have perused Harvey on employment and industrial relations law, and very valuable it is. My legal studies will need to extend a little further before I shall feel entirely confident on the law of contract. I would have to get past the first tiree of the book that I have before me, which is not Harvey I hasten to say, to inform myself. Clearly there is an interaction and it is important that ACAS can offer a full profile of skills to deal with delicate matters.
<P>
A related issue is the resourcing of ACAS to gear itself up to this new and demanding task. There are some references in the financial memorandum to the overall cost of compliance, but that point is touched on rather hastily by reference to ACAS involvement without further details.
<P>
The other point that I would like to raise relates to the stage before tribunal action is initiated or contemplated.
<P>
Conciliation is a clear legal concept related to tribunal action, which in loose terms--the Minister will forgive me if I am not quite correct--I shall call mediation, or trying to resolve the dispute. That can, and I hope would, precede the point at which tribunal action was undertaken or an enforcement notice was served.
<P>
Can the Minister also say a little bit about the earlier stages? There is a slight tension here that is rather analogous to the relationship between ACAS and the enforcement officer. So within the ACAS structure itself there will be persons conciliating in connection with tribunal actions and there may also be persons who will be available to give advice and encouragement and offer suggestions or solutions in cases of action or discussions which might take place before a case went to a tribunal. Those are not quite the same jobs. They are both important. The concept of conciliation in the round including this mediation and pre-tribunal action matters greatly.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> Will my hon. Friend join me in seeking reassurance from the Minister that the Government accept that arbitration, conciliation and mediation rather than confrontation and litigation are very much the mood of the time? By and large, they are what the people want. Should we not side with the movement and ask the Government to do so too?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a valuable suggestion. My hon. Friend will be aware that in a few hours a Bill will be considered on the Floor of the House which has all-party support and in which the hon. Member for Wentworth will play a leading role. It enshrines a much smoother disputes procedures and is designed to cut out a lot of problems. It would be out of order to trespass into the details of that, but I am sure that the principle is a good one.
<P>
I may yet return to the idea, but I was minded to try to put in the Bill a suggestion that no tribunal actions should have been contemplated, or no enforcement notice should have been served, unless and until efforts had been made mediation by ACAS or others. I do not know whether that would be viable, but it is certainly worth considering.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> It would not only be viable, it would be very progressive and perhaps my hon. Friend would once again suggest it to the Minister. It is something that this party could return to on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is helpful. No doubt we will ponder on what the Minister says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The line of thought that my hon. Friend is developing would be greatly assisted if there were a period provided within the Bill between the issue of a notice and the taking of any further steps, such as the issue of a penalty notice. As the Bill stands, it would be possible for a notice to be issued and a penalty notice to be issued immediately thereafter. Would it not be helpful to have a four-week period in which conciliation could take place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We are, if not drafting amendments in Comnmittee, making valuable and constructive suggestions around the concept that I am developing.
<P>
To summarise my remarks, our attitude, which is probably shared by Government Members, is that we prefer disputes resolution to take place in the simplest, most effective and least painful way possible. That is not in dispute. We would be pleased to involve the experts and not only ACAS. ACAS is certainly a valued player at all stages of the process. We are happy for ACAS to be involved at the pre-tribunal stage. I should like Ministers to consider my idea of a qualifying process, together with a period of reflection before matters escalated to the next stage.
<P>
Finally, after the initiation of tribunal or court action, there is the issue of providing ACAS with the necessary staffing and training to enable it to discharge its role of promoting formal conciliation. That is important. Even at this late hour, we would welcome a response from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wishes to contribute, I shall be happy to sit down.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I shall be brief, so that I do not delay him. I shall put my points in the form of questions to assist him in his response.
<P>
I may be betraying my ignorance, but I am not clear at precisely what point in time conciliation will take place. Who will perform that task? I understand that conciliation is the first element of a claim made to an industrial tribunal. If conciliation is the formal first stage, who are the parties to conciliation when an officer has served an enforcement notice? Are the parties persons on whose behalf the officer is presenting the enforcement notice, or is the officer himself party to conciliation? Let us suppose that a party to conciliation is the person on whose behalf the enforcement notice has been served and that the notice deals with his or her employer. Is it reasonable to assume that, if that person and the employer reach agreement after conciliation, the enforcement notice will be rescinded or withdrawn pursuant to such an agreement?
<P>
We might lose the benefits of conciliation if the enforcement officer thinks that a bureaucratic process has begun and that it will have to pursue its course regardless of the results of conciliation. Perhaps, I venture that thought more out of ignorance than anything else.
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> May I suggest a further point? Once a notice has been issued and arrears are specified in it, I understand that the employer will be required to pay them forthwith. If, after conciliation, a compromise is reached, there is no mechanism by which money paid out can be recovered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend is right. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point. If conciliation does not involve the officer serving the enforcement notice, it might result in any number of different conclusions. If conciliation concluded that there had been overpayment, it would be nice to know that the employer could recover that money. Such payment would not be recoverable in civil proceedings, and it would not be desirable if it could not be recovered after conciliation.
<P>
I have another question about ACAS. The Committee and those reading our proceedings would like to learn a little more about the intended increase in ACAS's manpower. Ministers have referred to the legal character of proceedings brought before a tribunal. Therefore, will there be an increment in the number of legally trained staff used by ACAS, or is the training used in ACAS deemed sufficient to meet such needs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have a question of fact for my hon. Friend. I apologise to him for not warning him of my intention to ask it, but I know that he is an expert on this subject. Does he know what proportion of ACAS staff have some form of legal training? It would help the Committee to assess how much, or how little, additional training might be required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend asks a good question, to which I cannot give a precise answer. In his experience, relatively few ACAS staff have such training, and that is my experience, too. That is not to say that they do not have the necessary qualifications and experience for the job that they are currently asked to do. ACAS has expertise in other areas. It has expertise in human resources and industrial relations rather than in legal matters or contract law in particular.
<P>
I tabled an amendment this morning, but it does not appear in the consolidated list of amendments. It was designed to be helpful in a technical sense, and I hope that the Minister will respond positively to my points. I hope that I am wrong, but I think that there is a mistake in the Bill.
<P>
Line 15 of subsection (2) will do for Northern Ireland what subsection (1) does for England. It will bring under the scope of article 20 of the Industrial Tribunals (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, those parts of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, as this Bill will become, that give rise to proceedings and claims before tribunals. That will be done
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by virtue of sections 11, 16, 18(1)(a) or 22 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 18(1)(a) relates to an officer presenting a complaint under the Employment Rights Act 1996, but clause 18(1)(b) gives an officer in Northern Ireland a similar power under the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland Order) 1996. Therefore, on the face of it, line 15 of clause 27(2) should not read 18(1)(a), but 18(1)(b) so that it gives effect to the provision relating to Northern Ireland and not that relating to Great Britain.
<P>
That is not a criticism of the Bill's drafting. We have made some criticisms of that, but the draftman's work has been admirable and comprehensive in many cases. The number of Government amendments that had to be tabled after the Bill was published was a problem, but the one that I have mentioned is the only apparent mistake that I have found.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman's final point was correct. The mistake will be corrected when the Bill is reprinted. I can only say, ``Well spotted.'' I shall want to know why I was not told before. The answer may be pressure of work. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire is right about the Bill's drafting. It is complex, and great efforts were made by officials who put in much work outside normal working hours. To find just one error in such a Bill is like finding a needle in a haystack. However, having had the error pointed out, I own up to it. It will be corrected.
<P>
The Government are enthusiastic about the role, concept and principle of ACAS and about the continued involvement of the social partners. Since taking office, we have taken great pains to work with ACAS and the social partners. We have promoted the activities of ACAS and we shall shortly embark on its quinquennial review.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I am glad to hear his claim that the Government are working well with ACAS. Will he be gracious enough to accept that this is a point of commonality becuase the previous Government tried hard to work with ACAS and recognised its many virtues.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I accept that. At one stage the previous Government were close to calling ACAS in to mediate in Cabinet meetings. I was not implying that ACAS was less supportive when the hon. Member for Solihull was doing my job.
<P>
Of course, the promotion of mediation and conciliation is a critical factor in employment relations and ACAS has developed its role, particularly in partnership development and improving workplace practices. It is not an issue on which we differ.
<P>
The clause will allow conciliation to be provided by conciliation officers apointed by ACAS for national minimum wage-related matters coming before tribunals. I earlier gave the hon. Member for Daventry an idea of what those might be, but I can provide more information now for the record. They include employees' complaints about access to records under clause 11; individuals' enforcement of the right to a national minimum wage under clauses 15 and 16; proceedings taken on behalf of a worker by an enforcement officer in clause 18(1)(a); and an enforcement of the right not to suffer detriment under clause 22. That fits in with our overall common sense strategy of building on mechanisms that are already in place.
<P>
ACAS is already involved as a matter of course in tribunal cases, its aim being to secure an acceptable outcome for both parties without the need for a hearing--in other words, diverting potential work loads from the employment tribunal system into common agreements between the two parties, employer and employee.
<P>
ACAS conciliation is effective. Two thirds of cases--some 60,000 a year--are withdrawn or settled following ACAS intervention. We hope that it will be as successful in dealing with the minimum wage. Cases that can be resolved by this means will not have to go into the adversarial tribunal system which results in success either for employer or employee alone. ACAS thus has an effective role to play.
<P>
Conciliation officers already conciliate most industrial tribunal complaints--on unfair dismissal and unlawful deductions. As well as its skills and knowledge base on arbitration, ACAS has knowledge and skills for dealing with employment legislation. Its most important role is its capacity to conciliate, to bring partners together and find a way to resolve problems. If ACAS ever lost that it would be to the detriment of its effectiveness.
<P>
ACAS is so successful because it is trusted by industry in general. It is viewed, largely because of its skills and knowledge, as the appropriate vehicle for assistance in resolving disputes in a private and conciliatory way. It does not attempt to apportion blame, but find ways and means to resolve conflict in the workplace. The continuing role of ACAS in relation to the minimum wage will be invaluable.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked about an enforcement officer's role in commencing proceedings on behalf of a worker. There is a relationship between clauses 18 and 27. When proceedings have started through an enforcement order under clause 18, the parties to the event will be the worker and the employer. The conciliation officer must seek to conciliate those two parties, not a third party. There is therefore no conflict in the enforcement officer's role.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire also asked a pertinent question about the withdrawal of an enforcement notice. He is right about the principle. If a common agreement has been reached and it does not breach the primary rights of the employee, it would seem reasonable to withdraw the enforcement order. I am not a lawyer: this is a common-sense approach. However, although agreement has been reached, an enforcement order can still be a guarantee for the employee if the employer subsequently fails to meet the obligation. However, the hon. Gentleman's point was serious enough for further consideration. I will consider it further but I will assess whether his proposals have common-sense as well as legalistic validity.
<P>
<H5>3.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his generous willingness to consider the proposal further. Another point may be relevant, and it is that an enforcement notice could cover a number of workers for a particular employer. When several workers enter the ACAS conciliation process, different conclusions may be reached. Some workers may reach agreement and some may not. In such circumstances, is there scope to split the enforcement notice?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall look further into those matters. In the circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman, a new enforcement order might need to be applied because different proposals are involved. A lawyer is smiling benignly. A common-sense approach would have to recognise that the content of an enforcement notice can change. As I have said, I shall consider these matters further.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire also asked about resources. At this stage, it is difficult to assess whether conciliation will lead to a reduction or an increase in tribunal cases. However, there is a quinquennial review and the Government intend to monitor carefully the resourcing of organisations such as ACAS. We want to ensure that resources are commensurate with the capacity of the job. I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the light of the Minister's remarks, perhaps there is no need for ACAS to be called in to help the Committee. His response was helpful and to show the broadmindedness of Conservative Members I advise my hon. Friends not to oppose the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Can the Bill be amended other than by amendments in Committee or on Report? The Minister seemed to imply that a change could be made other than by amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I cannot answer that question because it is a matter for the House authorities. If an amendment is deemed to be trivial it can be changed on the reprinting of the Bill. If not, it has to be changed as a consequence of amendment on Report. That can be decided only in the fullness of time.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 27, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 28</center></H4>
<H4><center>Offences</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 195, in page 19, line 34, leave out `delays or'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 196, in page 19, line 36, after `or', insert `wilfully'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Atkinson, for calling these amendments on one of the most momentous clauses in the Bill. It is especially significant that we Conservative Members should have such deep anxieties about the clause, which follows one about which we are relatively open minded. We may be persuaded of the merits of clause 27, as our abstention testified. Sadly, the same cannot be said of clause 28, which causes us great anxiety because it commits a greater offence against the principles of natural justice than any other clause in the Bill. That is why we fundamentally and incontrovertibly oppose it.
<P>
I shall take a few moments to explain some of our anxieties, upon which my hon. Friends will, no doubt, wish to elaborate. It is important to be clear about the precise content and wording of a clause that deals with offences. I was saddened by some parts of the clause which is no doubt well-intentioned. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the employer of a worker who qualifies for the national minimum wage refuses or wilfully neglects to remunerate the worker for any pay reference period... at least equal to the national minimum wage, that employer is guilty of an offence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The consequences of that wording will cause problems: it is not clear how ``refuses or wilfully neglects'' is to be established. The circumstance that worries me is that of an employer who does not wilfully neglect or deliberately refuse to pay the national minimum wage, but who is unable to pay it.
<P>
I challenge any Government Back Bencher or, indeed, any Minister to intervene if he or she is able to claim authoritatively that there is no employer in the country who cannot afford to pay the national minimum wage. Manifestly, that is not true. The Minister has of late taken to citing businesses organisations in support of his arguments. He has done so selectively and often has not attended to the full facts. He cited the CBI in support of his position; and the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry has often referred to the Federation of Small Businesses and implied that it supported the Government's position. We would dispute that.
<P>
The hon. Lady has an interest in, and knowledge of, the small business sector. If she were to argue that there is no small business in the country that could not afford to pay the national minimum wage she would make herself a laughing stock at any small businesses conference, as the reality is that some employers simply cannot afford it.
<P>
I accept that in may cases when an employer cannot afford to pay the national minimum wage, it may be for only a particular period--a month, three months, six months, nine months, a year or for the peirod during which there is a recession or a downturn in that company's economic activity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that his illustration goes straight to the question as to whether it should be reasonable in those circumstances to talk of intentional delay on the part of an employer? A delay may occur for precisely the reasons that my hon. Friend gives. Obstruction is a different matter, and that is why the amendment was tabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is right. There is a fundamental difference between delay and obstruction. The idea that one is to be equated with the other, as though they are of equal seriousness, is wrong. An employer may delay the payment of the full national minimum wage for precisely the reason that I gave: that for a period he is unable to pay it because he does not have the resources. That is delay, which is quite different from obstruction.
<P>
I regret that under the clause as drafted, delay and obstruction will be treated equally, as in each case an offence is adjudged to have been committed. That is wrong. Delay is probably the result of inability; obstruction may be considered to be the result of a worse and perhaps more sinister action. That is the distinction that Conservative Members draw, and it is reflected in the amendment. I regret that the Government do not seem to accept that distinction, still less to apply it in the context of the clause.
<P>
I am not aware of a precedent for such a clause, and that is why the amendment was tabled. I cannot think of an example of English law in which such a measure applies. Ministers have argued that it has been done before; that there is a precedent; that there is nothing new about it; and that similar measures have been enacted by Conservative Governments. That is not the case. The clause is particularly worrying because, to the best of my knowledge, apart from health and safety legislation, in which it might be argued that there is some justification for such a provision, the only employment legislation that brings employers into the realms of criminal law is health and safety. There is no other applicable precedent. It is extremely disturbing that it will apply in the application of the national minimum wage legislation. That is a serious development.
<P>
The amendment would mitigate the serious detrimental impact of the clause. My hon. Friends will develop further arguments in support of the amendment, which I commend to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I point out that we are now more than half way through this very important measure.
<P>
I shall confine my remarks to the amendment. I add a hint of criticism of the hon. Member for Buckingham, who is now conversing with his hon. Friends, as his remarks strayed from the amendment, which is narrowly drawn. It relates to a specific part of the clause--subsection (5). The hon. Gentleman addressed earlier bits of the clause about remuneration, but his proposal amends subsection (5)(a) which applies if a person intentionally delays or obstructs an officer.
<P>
I am delighted to explain the amendment to the Committee--it is always a pleasure to help Opposition Members in any way that I can. The effect of the amendment would be to change the offence to one in which a person intentionally or wilfully obstructs an officer. It is difficult to see why that should be necessary. An individual would have been asked by the enforcement officer to do something, or to comply with a notice. If he failed to do what had been asked, it is difficult to see how such a failure could be both intentional and wilful.
<P>
<H5>4 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham threw me down a challenge that I cannot refuse. Earlier this evening, I had the impression that I was irritating Opposition Members--and that caused me some distress--by referring to previous legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sure that the hon. Lady would never irritate us. Perish the thought. She said that the amendments would change the wording of subsection 5(a) to read ``intentionally, or wilfully, obstructs''. She will find that the second amendment relates not to line 34, but to line 36, so the wording in 5(a) would be ``intentionally obstructs''. In line 36 the wording would be ``refuses or wilfully neglects'', bringing it into line with subsection (1), line 19, which also says ``wilfully neglects''.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is helpful that the hon. Gentleman has clarified that point, although it was not explained in that way by the hon. Member of Buckingham. Certainly, I construe the amendment in the way that I outlined. I thank the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire for his reassurance; it is good to know that my references to earlier pieces of legislation did not irritate Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> No, absolutely not.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Buckinghamshire for his reassurance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckinghamshire told the Committee that Opposition Members were worried about clause 28 and that that was why they had tabled the amendments. He said that the clause had no precedent in English law. I remind him that the wording of the clause reflects section 111 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. He will know that that was enacted by the previous Conservative Administration.
<P>
The amendments are unnecessary. The provisions in the clause are based on existing legislation and I hope that I have persuaded Opposition Members of that. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I endorse the amendments and the arguments that have been made by my hon. Friends. I share their concerns. I am also worried about some other aspects of the clause, which it may be more appropriate to raise under clause stand part, so as not to delay the Committee at this time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is no guarantee that the Chair will permit a clause stand part debate. It depends on what hon. Members say and whether they stray from the amendments and raise clause stand part points.
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to make some remarks in this clause stand part debate. Opposition Members have considerable anxiety about clause 28. We are sorry that we were unable to amend it, but even if we had done so, that would not have changed our perception of the clause as a whole.
<P>
The Minister referred to the precedent of social security legislation as an example of how legislation has brought criminal sanctions to bear upon what would otherwise be a civil matter of employment contract. We do not dispute such examples; there are others, such as health and safety legislation--for reasons that hon. Members will well understand--in which, in like fashion, criminal sanctions would apply if an employer transgressed the provisions of an employment contract.
<P>
The situation is rather different under the Bill. Its provisions are designed to deal with a mischief, which is civil in character but to which a criminal sanction is to be applied. whereas some of the other examples relate to matters that are criminal in character. The health and safety legislation, and possibly the social security legislation, to which the Minister referred--I remain to be corrected, as she is always, without being remotely irritating, wont to correct us--deals with questions of fraud or the prevention of fraud. It is criminal in character, therefore, as it is in the nature of criminal sanctions that they bear on matters affecting life and limb, or on fraud.
<P>
The measures that we are discussing deal with a civil matter: the payment of remuneration by an employer to an employee, which would not normally be regarded as a criminal issue. Yet the clause would bring criminal legislation, with criminal sanctions, into the heart of the relationship between an employer and an employee. That is to be regretted and I hope that Opposition Members will be able to explain why the Committee should resist it. Furthermore, I would remind the Committee that the clause would bring to bear some substantial penalties through the introduction of criminal sanctions.
<P>
I do not remotely intend to return to discussion of the clause 19 provisions on penalty notices, but I remind hon. Members that we agreed on the modesty of the penalty it set out--twice the national minimum wage hourly rate, per day. There is a big difference between that and clause 28(6), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps others should do the relevant calculations; I shall not attempt a calculation in my head, education-Minister-style. However, a fine of the order of &#163;5,000 relating to an enforcement notice affecting tens or even hundreds of employees would amount to a very substantial sum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is pursuing a valuable argument that will shorten my own remarks. Does he agree that the length of the pay reference period is critical? A large number of employees and the existence of short pay reference periods--such as an hour at a time, or periods relating to casual employment--will result in fines escalating disproportionately and alarmingly? The employer could well be put out of business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am indebted to my hon. Friend. I had not understood clause 28 quite in that light, but my hon. Friend's remarks have had that immediate effect. An offence might arise under subsection (1) for each worker for each pay reference period. Each offence gives rise to a fine not exceeding level 5--&#163;5,000 or whatever might be the appropriate multiple. Insufficient remuneration affecting a number of workers over a considerable time, together with many pay reference periods, could mean that many offences had been committed. An employer could be brought before a court in relation to weekly pay reference periods for 100 employees, attracting a level 5 fine of &#163;5,000. So one could be dealing with figures of &#163;500,000 or &#163;26 million. I might be accused of employing a reductio ad absurdum, but extreme cases are good illustrations.
<P>
The example that I gave highlights the question of what constitutes an offence under clause 28(1) and shows how severe the criminal sanctions could be under certain interpretations. The Bill and the notes on clauses do not make it clear how individual offences will be treated in circumstances such as I have described. The enormous bill that appears possible under the clause contrasts strongly with the penalties to be applied under other clauses--notwithstanding that a further test of wilful neglect would be applied in the case that we are considering, whereas a penalty notice might relate to a less wilful or obstructive action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Would not it be a cruel irony if an employer, who for a period could not afford to pay the national minimum wage and therefore did not, continued in business but as a result of swingeing fines had to cease to trade? That would be an extraordinary, bizarre and no doubt unwelcome outcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Well, it would indeed, because, whatever the differences between the Opposition and the Government, the object of the Bill should be to protect employment and the interests of people in work. The opposite would result from what my hon. Friend has described. Employment would be imperilled. A decision not to amend the Bill will exacerbate the problem.
<P>
<H5>4.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am concerned about the issue of intentional delay. It is not only cases of wilful obstruction or neglect that are relevant--and I see considerable difference between obstruction and neglect. Often, with the best will in the world, some businesses are unable or unwilling to comply with bureaucratic requirements as they should. Perhaps many people's difficulties with the timetable for self-assessment of tax provide a good reminder of that. An automatic &#163;100 in that context, or the modest penalties imposed in other clauses, are one matter. However, criminal sanctions and fines measured in thousands or tens of thousands of pounds for what might be neglect or delay are quite different. The clause is deficient in not distinguishing neglect or delay from obstruction. If it were narrowly constructed to relate to wilful obstruction the matter might be different.
<P>
I am encouraged by the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry does not wish to intervene, as I for a moment thought, when he sat on the edge of his seat, that he wanted to lead me though an argument on which I had not made enough progress, but perhaps I have.
<P>
I consider the clause deficient also in point of principle. It intervenes in civil relationships between employer and employee and interposes criminal sanctions for different reasons from those underlying other legislation--the protection of life and limb or the raising of revenue. Practically, it is worrying, because it presents the prospect of heavy sanctions for what employers might regard as by no means a criminal act--being neglectful in providing information or undertaking the Bill's requirements. That is a matter of subjective judgment.
<P>
Eventually employers will be presented with details of the sanctions as part of information about the national minimum wage--it is too early to send them such information now, because we do not know the thoughts of the Government or the Low Pay Commission. When it happens, penalty notices may not trouble employers too much, but news of criminal offences and large fines may lead them to view matters differently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is not it a fundamental principle of English and all good law that the punishment should fit the crime?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Proportionality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Yes, there should be proportionality, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry says from a sedentary position. In the instance that we are discussing, is it not true that the punishment does not fit the crime? It threatens to be wholly disproportionate to the severeity of the offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am doubly grateful to my hon. Friend who makes a good point well and prompts me to conclude by summing up more elegantly than I should have done otherwise--my hon. Friend speaks more elegantly than I do in any case. The argument that the punishment should fit the crime is the right one to put. It raises the question of the extent to which the proposed offence should be considered a crime. Even if it should be, we need to consider whether the punishment proposed would be disproportionate and excessive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Despite his characteristic modesty, my hon. Friend the Minister for South Cambridgeshire has anticipated the substance of my argument. However, I shall make one or two further points.
<P>
The notes on clauses state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This enforcement route is normally intended to be used only if other routes have been exhausted.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the clause is intended be invoked only in the circumstances that the notes on clauses outline, but that is not stated explicitly in the provision. Different officers could have different views on the reprehensibility of the employer's alleged conduct. That bears on the general point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, who questioned necessisty for criminal sanctions to supplement civil santions. It might be sensible to concede a higher level of civil sanction, perhaps on an escalating basis and to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate criminal sanctions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> At the risk of flattering my hon. Friend, I point out that if Ministers had taken his advice and considered including an escalator provision in the penalty notice, they might have been able to implement his suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. My second suggestion is that a criminal sanction might take the form of a surcharge on earlier penalty payments. The surcharge could be calculated by an appropriate multiplier. We do not need to resolve that tonight. How will the clause work in strategic terms? Will Ministers agree at least to reconsider the interaction of civil and criminal sanctions?
<P>
I have only two other points, which cover safeguards. I am worried about record-keeping. Clearly, employers' records should be available. However, I would like some reassurance about an employer whose records are destroyed inadvertently or by accident.
<P>
In an earlier debate, I referred to the millennium bug. Computer records can be wiped. While playing on my home computer, my children could wipe work that I intended to keep. I do not keep payroll on computer, and, if I did, I would need to save it. However, things go wrong. Machines can blow up or burn. That does not have to be a national catastrophe; it can be an individual case. It is important that a person who has acted reasonably and in good faith does not get caught by provisions for a criminal offence.
<P>
Clause 28(5)(b) covers a person who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``refuses or neglects to answer any questions, furnish any information or produce any document''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire proposed using the term, ``wilfully neglects''. I am worried about the proportionality of the requests. I tabled an amendment, which would have added some words to the three requirements. The amendment will not be considered, and I do not have the text in front of me, but perhaps the provision could include the word ``relevant'', so that the clause would cover a person who refused to answer a ``relevant question'', furnish ``relevant information'' or produce ``relevant documents''. I suspect that the Minister will claim that the words in subsection (5)(b):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``when required to do so under section 14(1) above''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are sufficient to meet my anxieties. That might be the case if the officer made it clear when he issued such a requirement to the employer that the request was made under the clause. The employer could then contest the requirement by saying, ``You have asked me for my 1996 diary, but I haven't kept it because it has nothing to so with my pay records.'' We must ensure that the request is appropriate and confined to investigating a potential offence. It should not be used for fishing or to penalise employers for not providing irrelevant documents or information, or for refusing to answer questions, the relevance of which they contest.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall be brief because my hon. Friends have covered most of the points that I wanted to make. However, I want to discuss wilfulness. Why are the subsections asymmetrical? Subsection (1) refers to an employer who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``wilfully neglects to remunerate the worker''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any entry which he knows to be false''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) covers a person who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``furnishes, or knowingly causes . . . to be produced . . . any record . . . which he knows to be false''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
yet subsection (2) does not mention wilful behaviour. why does not subsection (2) read, ``wilfully fails'' instead of simply ``fails to do so''?
<P>
Subsection (5)(b) has already been covered. It refers to refusal and neglect but not wilful refusal or neglect. The subsections that refer to wiful neglect and knowing misconduct have it right, but subsections (2) and (5)(b) are out of line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I, too, shall be brief. There is an interesting contrast between clauses 27 and 28. Clause 27 showed us--appropriately for a provision on conciliation--the smiling face of the Minister. Sadly, clause 28 reveals the snarling face of the Bill. However, I am sure that the Minister will reply in her usual charming manner, which, I assure her, is never irritating.
<P>
Is it appropriate to introduce criminal law into the aspects of employment that we are considering? Criminal law is invoked for health and safety matters. Clearly, it is an appropriate weapon in cases of danger to life and limb. However, given the many civil powers and various tribunals in civil courts for which the Bill already provides, it is not clear that the clause is necessary. The Minister should tackle that point of principle.
<P>
I predict that the Minister will claim that very bad employers who push the system to the limit should be punished through the criminal law. I wish to present a counter-argument. Ministers do not accept our contention that innocent, good employers will be accused of breaching the measure and will become unfairly and unnecessarily embroiled in legal action. If the Government include the sledgehamer sanction of criminalising bad employers and potentially criminalising good employers, the damage will outweigh the benefit. In much of this one has to weigh the balance of advantage in what they have done. Even if she disagrees with me, I would like the Minister to address that point head on. We constantly hear that we are defending bad employers. We are not. Our point is that good employers will be accused of things of which they are not guilty and the way that the clause and others are constructed will do them harm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I agree with the thrust of my hon. Friend's argument. Does he agree that some employers who are good in terms of health and safety conditions and the treatment of their employers may, for a period, be simply unable to pay the national minimum wage? Under the clause they would be found guilty. That seems most unjust.
<P>
<H5>4.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. His point is a subset of the general point that I would make. He phrased it characteristically well. Under the terms of the Bill some employers will drift in and out of being good or bad employers. They will not be habitual criminals. They will not wish to be criminals but there will be periods when they run their business badly in economic terms and perhaps cut down on side benefits or non-cash remuneration in ways that would lead them to fall foul of the legislation. They probably do not deserve to be the nuts crushed by this sledgehammer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> May I give my hon. Friend an example that has just occurred to me? An employer might pay a bonus based on profitability which, for purposes of this Bill, might be consolidated in and calculated as part of the national minimum wage. He might go through a period of paying a wage in cash lower than the national minimum wage, confidently anticipating that at the end of the period the annual bonus based on profitability would be paid. He might then find that he had got it wrong and that because of his economic misfortune, there might be no profit and thus no bonus. He might find, retrospectively, that an offence had been committed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an even more positive example of an employer who, under the terms of the clause, will drift in an out of criminality. To do so because of a combination of a desire to be relatively generous to the employees and bad economic forecasting--bad forecasting over which the employer has little control--show the possible disproportionate nature of the offences created by the clause.
<P>
Is it sensible to find new classes of people to criminalise? Do we want to extend the range of activities which are criminalised in this country? That is obviously a much wider debate into which I do not want to go into. Is it worthwhile criminalising people for economic crimes? An economic crime sounds slightly Soviet and sinister but in effect that is what is being created by the clause. There is something in the British character that rebels against the idea of economic crimes. I hope that the Minister will consider that.
<P>
I imagine that she will say that this measure will be used only against the worst employers and that they have to go through many stages and that enforcement officers will be flexible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Just let me finish this point. I agree that some of the clause bears that interpretation; it would only be used in extremis against seriously bad employers. But other parts do not. People could commit offences under the clause almost accidentally or just through run of the mill sloppiness. It is not clear to me that such people should be criminalised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On the basis of what my hon. Friend has argued so far does he agree that the employers who drift in and out of criminality in this way are likely to be marginal employers and precisely the kind who may find themselves, by force of circumstances, out of business and in the labour market looking for a job? In those circumstances, would not having a criminal conviction put them at a considerable disadvantage and enhance the cycle of misery that a business failure entails?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extremely good point; they might not just have difficulty finding future employment but finding future financial backing to set up their own business again. Banks would be much less likely to lend money to someone with a criminal conviction, particularly someone with a criminal conviction under employment law.
<P>
If one accepts that thesis, even in relatively few cases at the margins, people will be unfairly criminalised, particularly by subsection (2) which is particularly pernicious. Many businesses, I imagine, do not keep and preserve all their records efficiently, particularly small businesses. To say that one simple failure to do that, not wilful or persistent failure, can render a person liable to a criminal conviction, is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will take those points on board as well as the points made by my hon. Friends about the disproportionate cost and the huge gap between the civil penalties, which are equivalent to just a yellow card or a slap on the wrist, and the potential criminal penalties which seem unbelievably draconian if they are imposed on businesses as they stand now. I hope that we will get a good response to the many serious points that we have raised during the debate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The clause makes it a criminal offence to refuse or wilfully neglect to pay a worker at a rate not less than the minimum wage; to fail to keep records as required in accordance with regulations under clause 9; knowingly to keep false records; knowingly to produce or furnish false records or other information; intentionally to delay or obstruct an enforcement officer; and to refuse to answer a question, furnish information or produce a document when required to do so by an enforcement officer.
<P>
As has been ponted out, there is a penalty but the penalty that has been described is a maximum penalty. The maximum penalty for each offence is at level 5 on the standard scale, which currently stands at &#163;5,000. When Opposition Members got a little excited about it, they failed to point out that it was a maximum. That maximum will not need to be applied in each and every case.
<P>
Opposition Members do small firms a great disservice. As I have said repeatedly, as has the Minister of State, the overwhelming majority of firms in this country, of whatever size, want to ensure that they comply with existing legislation. We have also made it clear that in some cases the employee is right and in others the employer is right. We have continued to say that.
<P>
A number of questions were asked about the operation of the clause. When passing a piece of legislation of this kind it is vital to have effective enforcement. I know that I keep repeating this but we mean what we say when we state that we want to give workers the right to be paid a national minimum wage and we are prepared to back that up. We need effective enforcement to combat employers who flout the law of the land. Quite clearly Opposition Members would agree. Of course we do not expect there to be a large number of cases. As I have said, the overwhelming majority of companies and small companies, most definitely, will want to comply. We are talking about a few companies for which we need the provisions.
<P>
I was asked about the test for the failure to pay the national minimum wage. The hon. Member for Buckingham suggested that the failure could be almost accidental. The test is high: it is refusing or wilfully neglecting to pay. Therefore, failure to pay must be wilful, not just accidental.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am listening carefully. To be fair to the Minister, I notice that she used the word ``almost''. I was talking not about accidental failure. She may think I am wrong, but my question related to a case in which an employer simply could not afford to pay. The non-payment might be deliberate, but that would be because the employer could not afford to pay and not because he had a desire to deny an employee a right. What does she say about that?

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> All circumstances have to be taken into account: wilful is an extremely high test. The penalties mean that it should be. I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire developed the thesis that to have provisions for civil and criminal penalties and liabilities was unusual. He said that that might apply in social security legislation, but that it was odd in employment legislation. There is nothing new in the range of offences. It is similar to that under the Wages Act 1986, which was introduced under the previous Conservative Administration. Sections of that Act have some of the same language that appears in the Bill. I believe that Lord Tebbit was Secretary of State for Employment at that time.

<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I may be wrong. I wait with much anticipation to hear what the hon. Member for Buckingham has to say. I am sure that he knows more about Lord Tebbit than I do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Although it is 18 minutes to 5 o'clock, we should be accurate. I fear that the Minister is wrong. My noble Friend Lord Tebbit was chairman of the Conservative and Unionist party at that time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I bow to hon. Gentleman's superior knowledge. However, he cannot deny that the Secretary of State at the time of the introduction of the Wages Act 1986 was a Conservative Member of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I claim prior knowledge of my noble Friend Lord Tebbit. At that time I was his principle private secretary. He was chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and not Secretary of State for Employment. He ceased to be Secretary of State for Employment in October 1983. [Hon. Members: ``What date?''] I think about 15 October.
<P>
The provisions of the 1986 Act may have been introduced by a Conservative Government, but were they not also repealed by a Conservative Government?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> They were consolidated in part, I think, in subsequent legislation, including that on employment rights. The provisions in the Bill reproduce language in the 1986 Act. I had forgotten that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire was a member of the civil service at that time. There is a wonderful phrase: name the guilty man. Perhaps one of the men toiling in the Department at that time gave us some of our ideas about how the Bill should be enacted.
<P>
<H5>4.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill needs proper methods of enforcement and the clause is essential in achieving them. There is nothing untoward in its provisions, which will be used only in rare and extreme cases. I think it is fair to say that the hon. Member for Daventry agreed with that. There is precedent--or in the case of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire previous form--for the clause. I ask the Committee to approve it.

<H4><center>Offences by bodies corporate etc.</center></H4>
<P>
</FONT>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have two points to make on the clause, which takes us back on to lawyers' territory.
<P>
The first relates to the read-across with the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which has a certain resonance on the provisions for corporate activities. One of the difficulties, under that Act, is pinning down the identity of the officers involved. The clause seeks to define them as best it can, but people with considerable experience of these issues tell me that there are considerable evidential problems, especially in larger companies, in identifying those who make decisions on pay levels. If one is trying to strike at a company--I do not argue that one should not--it is important to identify the person responsible. The answer for larger and more sophisticated companies may be to restructure the system. Just as companies have an audit committee or a board remuneration committee, which under Greenbury and now Hampel will have other specific responsibilities, they may have to create a structure that makes clear which officer is responsible for handling the matters covered by the clause. I have not given it great thought, but it might be a good idea to allow companies to nominate an officer who would be responsible for seeing that that duty was discharged. I leave that thought for the Minister's consideration.
<P>
We share Ministers' concern not to discredit the Bill and we therefore want to ensure that lawyers and enforcement officers do not have to crawl all over companies looking for the person who created the state of affairs in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that the difficulties involved in finding the relevent officer, as he is described, are characteristic of what happens in respect of health and safety legislation. As that evidence shows, what my hon. Friend says will be true if the clause is accepted as drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I endorse my hon. Friend's comments. It is important for Ministers to consider carefully whether they can produce a more workable proposal or give some guidance to members of the corporate sector--not all of them are large and sophisticated FTSE-100 companies--on how to conduct their affairs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It is worth emphasising that we are discussing not only employees of a firm but those who might be construed as working for them: people such as agency workers, for example, who have an employment contract. For many companies, determining who is responsible within the company for procuring work through agencies would add a further layer of complexity to the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend prompts me to recollect that on one or two occasions when I was directly responsible for my own farming operations, an agricultural contractor brought equipment on to the land to carry out an operation. I saw something with which I was not happy, and said so. It is important that we take into account that such difficult situations can arise. I entirely endorse my hon. Friend's comment.
<P>
My second point also applies to a similar provision in the next clause, so I will not need to return to it. Subsections (5) and (6) also apply to Scotland. Scottish partnerships, unlike English partnerships, have a separate legal identity over and above the characteristic of the partners themselves, hence the separate provisions. Far be it from me to comment on whether they are appropriate--I have no reason to believe that the Under-Secretary has received representations to the contrary. I confess that my point is, to some extent, made, but not motivated, by my ignorance.
<P>
Every hon. Member has certain strengths, and if one is thinking about this Bill one is not thinking about the Scotland Bill. However, the proposals relate to corporate bodies--that is not a precise definition--in Scotland. I take it that if the Scotland Bill is enacted, a Scottish parliament will be responsible for its own company law and related matters. If so, it might want to legislate for a change in legal provision. If such a situation were to arise, how will amendments to this Bill, which will then have been enacted, be made? presumably, the Government want a community of treatment between England and Scotland in that respect, but it is important to see how the mechanism would work. The same point applies to subsequent proposals.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> We need effective enforcement. We need to be sure that, where necessary, the legislation can be effectively enforced against the people who are in charge of a Company. They should not be able to hide behind the protection of a corporate entity. The clause provides that the main officers--for example, a director, a manager, a secretary or a similar officer--of a company or other corporate body will also be held responsible for those offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I draw the Minister's attention to the proper reading of the clause, beginning with subsection (2) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If an offence committed by a body corporate is proved . . . the officer as well as the body corporate is guilty''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) includes as a definition of ``officer'', a person purporting to act in any such capacity. That gives rise to the possibility that a person masquerading as someone who has authority within the corporation can make the corporation liable. That cannot be right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roche:</B> I admire the hon. Gentleman's ingenuity at such an hour--it is difficult to say whether it is late or early. However, I do not think that the courts will have any difficulty in that regard. A director, a manager, a secretary or similar officer are examples of officers referred to in connection with offences that have been proved to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``committed with the consent or connivance of an officer''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``attributable to any neglect on the part of such an officer''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are exact parallels in the Wages Act 1986. I was asked earlier about that Act, which, as I have said, was repealed in 1993. The Committee will be interested to know that parts of it were consolidated in employment rights legislation. I have had that checked and I am glad to tell the Committee that I was correct. Part II of that Act was consolidated into the Employment Rights Act 1996. The pleasure for the Committee is that the great work undertaken by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire continues to this day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Would the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. The hon. Lady has twice referred to my having been in some sense responsible for a piece of legislation, but I was not in the relevant Department at that time and had no involvement with it. The hon. Lady might have given me an opportunity to set the record straight.

<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair. It is up to the Minister to decide whether to give the hon. Gentleman an opportunity to speak.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am hurt because I was trying to enhance the hon. Gentleman's career. I was trying to let the Opposition spokesman and the Opposition Whip know that the hon. Gentleman made a considerable contribution to legislation in that area. However, I happily bow to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire's correction.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked a question about Scotland. I am not aware of and do not think that there could be any difficulty in the context of the devolution legislation that is going through the House. However, I assure him that I and my officials will look at that matter and if there is any difficulty, I will come back to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am not seeking to create a tactical advantage or make a political point about the devolution legislation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says. I do not think that there is a difficulty, but I undertake to consider the matter.
<P>
Clause 29 is important. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>5 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Broadly speaking, I support the clause. However, I draw the Minister's attention to something that I once had the misfortune to experience directly.
<P>
Companies formed by the tenants of buildings solely for the purpose of the management of those buildings may not have access to outside legal advice. The officers of those companies may have no particular expertise and certainly would not expect to find themselves in legal jeopardy as a result of undertaking such management. It is quite common for a small block of a dozen or two dozen flats to be managed by such a company. It is also quite common for such companies to employ someone part-time to do some maintenance or gardening. I fear that criminalising offences and rendering individual officers liable would make it difficult--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the situation that the hon. Gentleman describes. Clause 45(4) provides a defence. The hon. Gentleman might find that helpful, especially as the criminal penalties are the end of the road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Minister for drawing that to my attention. I only wish that she had done so at the end of the previous debate. It was the possibility of an offence being committed under clause 28(2)--failure to keep or preserve records without there being any suggestion of wilfulness--that made me worried about management companies. I raised that point with the hon. Lady in the previous debate, but had she drawn my attention to clause 45(4) then, my concerns would have been somewhat soothed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> It is not my intention to bid for a reply from the Minister. In fact, I should be content if she wrote me a letter. When I intervened on her a moment ago, I realised that I had given inadequate notice of a point that requires a little unravelling. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or a person purporting to act in any such capacity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those words merit another look, because they suggest that someone masquerading as an office holder of a corporation could result in the corporation itself being liable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The instance described by my hon. Friend may be true, but it also describes persons known as shadow directors. They are not formally officers of the company, but might be held to be officers by virtue of the control that they exercise over the company's decisions. That widens the potential application of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing that to my attention. My hon. Friend and I have given quite different examples, but perhaps his is more sinister than mine, because those people have no overt rank yet have covert control. I am talking about someone who has overt rank, but no control over the corporation, causing the corporation to encounter a liability over which it has no control.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I pay my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull a genteel compliment for his perceptive, lucid, articulate and pertinent intervention in the previous debate. His intervention is directly relevant to this debate, although we are debating a different clause.
<P>
Under subsection (1)(a), the Secretary of State can authorise someone to represent him or her.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``even if that person is not a barrister or solicitor.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would not want to enshrine, sustain or, in this case, create a barristers' or solicitors' cartel. That is not the point. Some hon. Members have worked in Government Departments and others have experienced the ways of Whitehall for other reasons, but we all know that Ministers are briefed to argue in one way and that, when appropriate, they can also do so in another. When a strong argument was put for the sit-alone principal in the debate on clause 25, it was said that those matters would be largely legal. However, under clause 30--a few pages on in the Bill--we find that those empowered to conduct proceedings on the Secretary of State's behalf will be not only lawyers but any person authorised by her. That is worthy of comment. Those people should have at least some legal training. Therefore, it is important to have an assurance on those who might represent the Secretary of State if they are not legally qualified.
<P>
The amendment that I drafted on the clause has been overtaken--for the time being, at least--by our splendid progress on the Bill. I drafted that amendment some hours ago, but it probably has not yet reached the blues. The amendment would introduce provisions to ensure, first, that the person was reasonably experienced in employment matters and, secondly, that the person was capable of properly conducting the proceedings in the court.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will know that barristers and those solicitors who have rights of appearance, as in a magistrates court, have professional standards and codes. They have an obligation to the court as well as to their clients, and they will conduct themselves professionally. I do not say for a moment that I expect that persons nominated by the Secretary of State would act otherwise, but it is important they should have an understanding of professional competence and some experience in the matters with which they are dealing.
<P>
I am sure that, like everyone else, the Under-Secretary would not want trainees to make decisions on their first outing on their own. Even in my modest tribunal work, we were very sensibly invited to attend one or two hearings by way of induction, and there was a three-person panel when we sat for the first time. I shall not dilate on that now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Would my hon. Friend care to elicit from the Under-Secretary an assurance that there will be an objective test of suitability and qualification in appointments, to avoid any suggestion that people were appointed for reasons other than their qualities and fitness for the job?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I suspect that my hon. Friend has a slightly suspicious mind and a slightly narrow view of the test that will be required. If the Under-Secretary can tell me that those persons will be qualified officers who have had experience of industrial relations, through ACAS or a similar body, that they have undergone a suitable period of training and that they will have access to specialist help if they require it, I will be prepared to accept her assurances. It is right to raise the question, however.
<P>
I have some concerns about subsection (2). The first relates to periods. I am a little anxious that provision is made for a six-month period from the date on which evidence comes to the Secretary of State's attention, and for a maximum limit of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``12 months from the commission of the offence''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
before proceedings may be undertaken.
<P>
In Committee, one can endlessly discuss time limites. I would be inclined to reduce those periods to three months and six months respectively--indeed, I tabled an amendment to that affect. The three months answers to the reference period to the industrial or employment tribunal. I kept the same multiplier as the Government in providing for a six-month period, which would prevent employers from being kept in suspense indefinitely. I do not have a final view--it is stupid to have a final view on precise periods--but I invite the Under-Secretary to comment.
<P>
I have more substantial concerns about the words in subsection (2)(a), which relate to the date on which evidence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``sufficient in the opinion of the Secretary of State to justify a prosecution for the offence, comes to the knowledge of the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When evidence arrives may itself be a question of evidence--it is certainly a question of fact. There could be wranglings about when the evidence was received, when sufficient evidence was received and whether further evidence that was tabled could be taken into account. I worry that--if the Under-Secretary will allow me to use the phrase--clever lawyers might be able to make hay with those points.
<P>
A wise person who is herself legally qualified has told us that stipulating a six-month time limit from when ``sufficient evidence'' is gathered constitutes a lawyer's dream. She even asks us whether she should start recruiting more lawyers now to deal with the matter. As she says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There are reams of case law about when time limits start in employment cases'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
particularly where there are continuing offences--a point that was raised earlier.
<P>
<H5>5.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Paragraph (a) of subsection (2) rests on the concept of evidence coming
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the knowledge of the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think--the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry may confirm this--that that is a term of art to mean that evidence has reached any officer in the Department. After all, the Secretary of State is hardly going to receive a submission about every case that goes to an industrial tribunal. However, the paragraph mentions the Secretary of State, so he or she is in this up to the neck. If we are to have lawyerly arguments about when evidence was received, when it was sufficient, who saw it and who acted on it, the provision has the words ``judicial review'' all over it.
<P>
I am sure that the ever-patient and assiduous, if silent, lawyers from the Department who are assisting the Minister, and indirectly our consideration of the Bill, will be listening and sharpening their pencils.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if we consider subsection (3), the phrase ``shall be conclusive evidence'' is no doubt intended to deter a litigious complainant from trying to demonstrate that the Secretary of State acted unreasonably. However, even though something is stated to be conclusive in the Bill, if it is not reasonable, judicial review will be initiated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes the point perceptively. All that that phrase does is shift back the incident that is likely to be considered under judicial review--from whether the Secretary of State acted reasonably to whether he acted before he reasonably could have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Further to the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, does my hon. Friend agree that the draftsmen, having realised the problem over the date at which evidence becomes available, sought to resolve it neatly and simply by declaring that any certificate purporting to have been signed by the Secretary of State shall be conclusive? In fact, that did not solve the problem, but simply changed it to one in which there would be judicial review of the Secretary of State's purported signing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am obliged to my hon. Friend, although I am a little disconcerted by his intervention and by that from my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. I have a horrible feeling that time has wound back and that they are under the misconception that I am the Minister who is to reply.
<P>
The clause has the sniff of judicial review about it. I advise lawyers present--those from the Treasury Solicitor's Department and elsewhere--to sharpen their pencils and prepare for a lot of work if the clause is not clarified and improved.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The clause follows a standard pattern as part of the enforcement regime. It is common sense, because it allows the Secretary of State to authorise enforcement officers to prosecute offences. Of course, it makes sense and is good practice for experts to take cases.
<P>
The clause enables the Secretary of State to authorise any person to conduct criminal proceedings for an offence under the Bill in a magistrate's court in England and Wales, or a court of summary jurisdiction in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry referred to the enforcement officers. Parallels can be drawn with other legislation. Various officers in local government, for example, have an enforcement role and frequently appear before the courts. From my experience of attending courts as a pupil barrister, I met officers with considerably more experience than me who were doing a professional job. The functions under the Bill are much in line with what takes place already. I hope that I can reassure the Committee by saying that I expect an enforcement officer to be appointed, to be trained properly and to be an expert in such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am sorry; I had to leave the Room briefly. It is at this hour that I usually ring my constituents and reply to their letters. There is a likelihood under subsection (1)(a) of additional work for the magistrates court. When I left the Lord Chancellor's Department to go to the Department of Trade and Industry, I reckoned that I had gone from a minesweeper to an aircraft carrier. I just hope that the purse of the lesser will be supplemented by the purse of the larger.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I shall not comment on what the effect will be on his majority if he continues to telephone his constituents at this time in the morning. I must say in all friendliness that we shall do all that we can to encourage his presence in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My practice is to telephone at this hour of the morning only those constituents whose letters require me, on receipt of their letter, to telephone them immediately.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I thank the hon Gentleman, but I do not think that I shall be adopting the practice of dealing with constituents in such a way.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry talked about the six-month period. Putting periods on limits is always difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Limits on periods.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Limits on periods or periods on limits, indeed. There is no end to it. But, as the hon. Member for Solihull will appreciate, there needs to be.
<P>
The limit is reasonable; it provides certainty and we can look to parallels in other legislation. Under the Wages Act 1986, wages inspectors had similar powers to institute proceedings in a court on behalf of a worker for the recovery of underpayment. It is always a pleasure to refer to that Act, and it is a great disappointment to know that I cannot pay more tributes to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire for his part in it, which I now understand was not as large a role as I had anticipated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> For historical record, I think that I am right in saying that when the Wages Act 1986 was put on the statute book, my noble Friend Lord Young of Graffham was the Secretary of State for Employment. The hon. Lady has an advantage over me in that she has a copy of the Act in front of her and it may refer to the precise time when it was enacted.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that helpful point. Fears have been expressed that the clause may be difficult to interpret. I believe that the clause is simple, and clearly drafted, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Further to the Minister's interesting delve into history, I shall complete the circle. If the Minister is looking for an Opposition Member on whom to pin what happened in 1993, when large parts of the 1986 Act was repealed, that person should be me. I was at the time working in the policy unit at No. 10 Downing Street. I am extremely proud to say that some of the more bureaucratic aspects of the 1986 Act were repealed when I worked there. No legislation is perfect; all legislation can be improved. Even if it had been drafted by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, it would have been capable of improvement. I can claim a very small part of the credit for its improvement.
<P>
I have several worries about the clause, one of which is probably profoundly unfashionable, but I put it to the Minister anyway. It seems that some conventional wisdom has gone into the clause. Subsection (1)(b) explicitly states that the person authorised by the Secretary of State need not be a barrister or a solicitor. I remind the Committee--and inform you, Mr. Atkinson, for possibly the first time--that I should declare an interest at this point, as my wife is a barrister. I do not want to deceive anyone that I plead the cause of barristers with no connection to the law, although I have no connection myself.
<P>
However, it seems peculiar that the clause says that legally unqualified people can do such professional legal work at a time when, in all other professions, things are moving firmly in the other direction. The idea that in the realm of, for example, food safety, we wanted not trained experts but gifted amateurs to do work would be greeted with derision. The same would be true in the case of the medical profession--or indeed, any other profession that I can think of. Things are moving in precisely the opposite direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> In commenting on this, does my hon. Friend remember that we are dealing with some thing that, according to the notes on clauses on a preceding clause, the Government regard as being about not the presentation of fact but the presentation of legal argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend neatly anticipates my next point. The clause is inconsistent with clause 25, to which my hon. Friend referred. Opposition Members attempted to persuade the Government that it was not a purely legal matter, and that legal expertise would not be the be-all and end-all. However, we lost that vote; the Government have had their way, and have argued that tribunals may consist of a chairman only precisely because, according to the notes on clauses, the legal aspect of that job is, as I said, the be-all and end-all.
<P>
It seems slightly perverse to say that the chairman of the tribunal, as a lawyer, may sit alone, but that the professional representatives before him need not be legally qualified. If what is important in those tribunals is legal argument, in this instance more than any, the de-professionalisation that subsection (1)(b) recommends is perverse. I am interested to know why the Minister thinks it necessary or desirable to go down that route; she did not mention it in her first speech. It has already been rightly observed that subsection (2) is a lawyers' charter. Existing employment law contains a vast number of time limits on employment cases. The subsection merrily creates a couple more. No rationale for the periods of six months or 12 months has been advanced in the notes on clauses or by the Minister. They do not exactly coincide with time limits in similar parts of employment law.
<P>
<H5>5.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The clause is inconsistent with other parts of the Bill and terminally incoherent. It states that anyone collected from the great and the good by the Secretary of State can represent people at a tribunal, but it will also make the system so complex that lawyers will be called in and will be extremely expensive. If one side has a barrister and the other does not, experience tells me that, regardless of the merits of the case, the barrister who is paid to do his job will tend to do it better than one who is not, and the outcome may be an unfair result.
<P>
The direct involvement of the Secretary of State seems unnecessary. I can see no rationale for it. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has already said that one side effect is likely to be that actions that go wrong may make the Secretary of State liable to judical review. I cannot believe that the Government intend that.
<P>
Finally, the clause makes separate provisions for Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has said that it would be interesting to know how that will interact with devolution legislation. The independent Scottish legal system will become more independent over time. Setting down conditions for Scotland in UK legislation may become more difficult and controversial.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I confess that I should have considered this matter more vigilantly, but I am not entirely clear as to whether, in the context of subsections (4) and (5), the Secretary of State has the same freedom to authorise persons to act on his behalf in Scotland. My hon. Friend's point about England, Wales and Northern Ireland seems less clear where Scotland is concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am not sure whether the clause was drafted by the Scottish Office rather than by the Minister's officials. Perhaps the ever-canny Scots do not fancy judicial review and have carefully distanced their Secretary of State from direct involvement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> On the ground of expense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I will not go down that route. Some of my best friends are Scotsmen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I may not be following my hon. Friend's argument as attentively as I should, but does the clause define the persons who will conduct proceedings in the Scottish courts? Clause 30(1)(a) and (b) deal with the situation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Where is the reference to Scotland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point, to which I can add almost nothing because of my invincible ignorance of the details of the Scottish legal system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I venture a thought that may help. If enforcement and prosecution in Scotland will be undertaken by the procurator fiscal or his officers, the situation is clear. However, our earlier discussion did not clarify whether the procurator fiscal would undertake those duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> By investigating the clause carefully we have opened up a Scottish Pandora's box, which I leave firmly in the Minister's lap. I hope that my questions will be answered at a later date.

Clause 30 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 31</center></H4>
<H4><center>Agency workers who are not otherwise ``workers''</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The law relating to agency is complex. If we had more time, we should be able to reflect on the relevant relationships. I am troubled by a couple of matters and should appreciate a response to them.
<P>
I understand the Minister's intentions in this regard. There is a person, ``the agent'', who does work for another person, ``the principal'', under a contract. Different motives will operate in such arrangements. My hon. Friends and I referred to some perfectly sensible, reasonable situations in which an agency arrangement might apply, including a one-off situation, in which a contractor might go to a property to carry out work for the property owner. Other examples include the use of an agency to top up labour or to provide relief for those who are normally employed by the principal.
<P>
Reasonably enough, the clause goes on to state that people in that situation are not workers because the individual and the principal do not have a contract together; nor do the individual and the agent have a contract because the agent is in a relationship with the individual worker. It is not a clear and simple relationship.
<P>
The intention of subsection (2) is to capture the worker at the end of the road notwithstanding the fact that there is an agency arrangement. It deems effectively, employing a concept with which we have become familiar, that it was a worker's contract for the doing of the work by the agency worker. In this case it is rather more constructive because it goes on to deal with responsibility for paying the agency worker. In most cases, it would be either the agent or the principal. If it is clear that it is one rather than the other it is easy to work out who should be treated as the payer for the purpose of the national minimum wage. That is not an inherently difficult situation.
<P>
The clause seems to have a feeling--not necessarily an appropriate feeling--for circumstances in which the agent or the principal have contrived to hide the nature of the relationship. If it is not defined it may be suggested that the one who actually pays the agency worker should be caught. That may be a common-sense point. What will happen if an agency is sub-contracting its workers to another agency and they are subsequently supplied to work for a particular business? What will happen if a person stays in a workplace with a series of agency employers over a certain period? Relationships can change: it may not necessarily be an improper set of relationships, but a perfectly sensible state of affairs. We do not know.
<P>
There is a wider point but at this hour I do not intend to flag it up at length in Committee. One of the main concerns throughout the Bill has been to avoid a situation in which industrial change--in the sense of the structures that subsist in the commercial world--is being driven by the requirements of the national minimum wage.
<P>
I am making a different point from the Minister's anxiously eloquent point that he wants to benefit a specific class of workers. My concern is to ensure that arrangements for dealing with the agency problem do not by a side road create circumstances that will subvert the principle underpinning agency arrangements and make it more difficult to work properly. If the purpose is to put the heat on agencies that are contriving arrangements to evade responsibility, I have some sympathy with the Minister's point. But if, beyond that, the provisions will alter the industrial and commercial structure of this country, I am far less sympathetic.
<P>
As part of the flexible labour market to which hon. Members have referred extensively, there is a growing tendency for firms to use various agency arrangements, for perfectly legitimate reasons. It is often called out-sourcing and Ministers will be familiar with the concept. Under that arrangement one takes someone on through an agency rather than employing him or her directly. I hope that the Minister of State will not consider that an evasive or abusive measure. I know that it is not; it is often a sensible commercial way of operating.
<P>
Perfectly legitimate operations may encounter a problem because of what we have explained. Of course, we want the Minister to find the lady--metaphorically, I mean--and sort out who will pay. Perhaps the job should be given to the tribunal, which could decide what seemed fair and right. However, I am not sure that we have quite got things right. I am not sure that I could write an essay on the subject of agency, but we must worry the issue out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have one brief point about agency workers--or perhaps a special class of such workers, though not an unusual class. I mean people who work in the United Kingdom, for an ultimate employer in the United Kingdom, but via the offices of an agent who is not resident in the United Kingdom. That arrangement is becoming increasingly common in some industries, though perhaps not yet very much in evidence in the United Kingdom because it is not one of the higher-wage economies in the European Union. Many building workers are employed in Germany under a direct relationship with an agent in the Netherlands. Do not ask me why it should be the Netherlands; it just happens to be that way.
<P>
How will those people be protected by the provision? An agent not within the jurisdiction could not be subject to the rigours of the enforcment procedure.

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> We what to make sure that everyone who is not genuinely self employed has the right to the national minimum wage. Agency workers are in a tricky position, because sometimes it is unclear who is their employer, as the hon. Member for Daventry said. I shall return to that.
<P>
Workers may not have a contract with anyone in particular; but they will still be in some form of relationship involving working for remuneration. Some employers have used unclear status in the past to get round employment legislation--and other legislation such as that concerning tax. The previous Government, with the support of the then Opposition, changed the law to try to establish a more reasonable approach to subcontracting and agency working in the construction industry. Within weeks of the change, agencies were finding ways around it, by making subcontract workers their own agents instead of subcontract labour to an agency. That move led to further fracturing of relationships in the industry and caused significant difficulties, including difficulties over national insurance and Inland Revenue payments.
<P>
I recognise the capacity of some in the labour market to find ways to control their status in relation to the people with whom they contract, and to try to get round obligations that any normal person would think reasonable. That applies to the present instance. We do not want such unscrupulous employers to be able to find loopholes that will enable them to get round the minimum wage requirements. It is vital that agency workers, as defined in the clause, should have an opportunity to participate in obtaining their rights. However, we do not intend that the genuinely self-employed should be caught by the measure. The Government want to encourage genuine self-employment and to ensure that it is enhanced. It would not be enhanced by people using bogus self-employment to undermine the capacity of other individuals in the labour market to gain access to minimum standards, including a mininum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the Minister agree that it is up to the employee or self-employed person to seek that outcome? Self-employed status cannot be imposed unilaterally.

<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The important factor in defining whether an individual is a worker rather than an employee is the wider scope that is given to an individual to seek a minimum wage, or to gain access to other rights that he has in theory, but is denied because he cannot prove his status or obtain a proper definition of his status. Having recognised that difficulty, the Government have attempted to draft legislation that gives agency workers the capacity to claim the minimum wage.
<P>
The clause helps agency workers who do not have a contract either with the agency or with the person or business that hires them. The clause enables the provisions of the Bill--for example, enforcement--to be applied as if such a worker had a contract either with the person responsible for paying him or her, or with the person who does pay him or her. We want to ensure that those workers--who, apart from some technicalities, are genuine workers--are properly entitled to the minimum wage.
<P>
Why should such workers lose out because of the perception of a technicality or because an unscrupulous employer uses a legal technicality to avoid paying workers the minimum wage? In future, employers will find it more difficult to hide behind such legal technicalities. As we regret reversing the burden of proof, employers who defend themselves against agency workers who claim a minimum wage will have to show that those agency workers are genuinely self-employed. The clause therefore provides, alongside the burden of proof, a capacity to ensure that agency workers have the opportunity to claim the minimum wage.
<P>
It is also true that there is a growing realisation in the industry that some agencies operating in certain parts of the market place give the industry a bad name. A great deal of work is currently being done by the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services, Manpower and others to ensure that agency labour is seen as legitimate in the labour market. Some 15 years ago, I fell out with some colleagues of mine in the Labour movement who were deriding agency working. I think that agency working provides legitimate access to the Labour market. Agency working can provide flexibility for the employer and the potential employee in the arrangements that they make with each other. I therefore oppose neither agency working nor its growth in the labour market, as long as it is not used to undermine employees' access to basic minimum standards.
<P>
That is why some agencies now employ people directly on contract of employment, which provides access to trade union and recognition rights, access to pensions and holiday entitlements and access to training on and off the job. That kind of change and investment in employees will ensure, over a period of time, that agencies will want, and will increasingly insist on good quality employment practices for those whom they employe through the agency. The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about the wide range of potential employers--I do not for a moment underestimate that complex difficulty. All I can say is that the Government hope that the clause will be able to fulfil its principle of ensuring that agency workers, who are not generally self-employed, have the capacity to gain access to the national minimum wage. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a Division and will accept the Government's good intentions in this matter.
<P>
Finally, the attempt to ensure the status of the agency worker assists not only that worker but the industry as a whole. It also enhances the competitiveness of good employers in that section of the Labour market who at present consistently undercut, in terms not of the quality of the employees they provide, but of employment practice because they do not want to meet their obligations. The clause assists agencies as well as agency workers and I commend it to the Committee.
