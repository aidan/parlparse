<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000188"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0807045000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welcome
back to the Chair for the last leg of this Committee, Mr.
Pope. So far it has been conducted in an exceedingly amenable, friendly
and constructive manner. I am sure that today will be no exception.
However, as we are likely to be interrupted this afternoon by a number
of votes and a number of new clauses have been tabled by hon. Members
across the Committee, I will try to get through those in my name as
quickly as possible this
morning.</div><a name="0807045000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 proposes the creation of the post of chief social worker. It
resulted from the Conservative party commission on social workers that
I chaired and which reported last October. That commission has been
mentioned in the Committee several times. As everybody knows, we have a
chief medical officer, who is currently Sir Liam Donaldson. He appears
frequently on the media as the face of the health service who advises
the Secretary of State. We also have a chief veterinary officer. Many
people will remember Debby Reynolds, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>the former holder of that post, who is a little more familiar than Nigel
Gibbons who took over from her. We do not have a post of chief social
worker.</div><a name="0807045000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
this Committee, on Second Reading and in other debates, we have touched
on the problem that we all acknowledge faces social workers of their
perception in the press, the constant torrent of negative stories about
them and the lack of reports on their many positive achievements. I
have described social workers as potentially the fourth emergency
service. They should be viewed as no less important than teachers,
police, nurses and doctors. Their work is integral to sustaining
vulnerable families, keeping them together and providing crucial
support. However, for some reason they do not get the same recognition
and respect among the general
public.</div><a name="0807045000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Too
many people view social workers as part of the problem rather than part
of the solution. The first contact many people have with social workers
is when there is a knock on the door, which may be the beginning of
proceedings that lead to a child being taken into care. Many social
workers would like to intervene much earlier and work on a preventive
basis to keep vulnerable families together. It would be good if they
had the opportunity to do that, but this problem exists because of the
pressures on the system and the high vacancy rates which are at 20 per
cent. in some parts of the
country.</div><a name="0807045000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
commission recommended that the Government create the post of chief
social worker. To quote from our report, a family barrister, Jessica
Lee, who was one of our witnesses, wrote of social
workers:</div><a name="0807045000150"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Due
to resource pressures, they are now seen as &#145;bad guys&#146;
who only appear to intervene and remove children rather than be able to
offer the supportive role that they feel they used to be able to
provide to
families.&#148;</div><a name="0807045000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
representative of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering
said:</div><a name="0807045000151"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Their
work demands the deepest understanding into the nature of the human
condition and the personal cost to them of doing so can be high. In the
public eye, social workers have become too easily identified with the
problems of their
clients.&#148;</div><a name="0807045000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
General Social Care Council stated
that</div><a name="0807045000152"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;social
work is often seen as the poor relation in a professional world;
&#145;only 40 per cent. of the population see the contribution of
social workers to society as very
important&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="0807045000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was plenty of evidence to suggest that there is a problem with the way
that social workers are perceived. That will be all too familiar to
Committee members who have followed that profession. That inevitably
has an impact on their ability to do their
job.</div><a name="0807045000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0807045000189"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I am listening
with interest and it is not that I am unsympathetic. Will the hon.
Gentleman give me an idea of the scale of the office that might be set
up around the chief social
worker?</div><a name="0807045000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000190"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I shall come to that in a minute. The hon. Lady
makes a good point. Obviously, some of the roles are set out in the new
clause.</div><a name="0807045000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
other point is that the commission found that of some 76,000 social
workers registered with the GSCC, only 11,000 belonged to the British
Association of Social Workers. There is a problem, therefore, regarding
a strong voice for the profession, and the head of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>BASW in giving evidence admitted some of the shortcomings of the current
situation. In contrast, the British Medical Association represents the
interests of 70 per cent. of doctors and the Royal College of Nursing
represents 60 per cent. of nurses. There is not a big body that speaks
up for social
workers.</div><a name="0807045000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
post of chief social worker may be occupied by somebody who is already
in the Department of Health. There will be a slight anomaly and a split
between adult social workers and children social workers. Whether the
chief social worker would be equally responsible to the Department for
Children, Schools and Families and the Department of Health is to be
determined. For example, in the Department of Health we have David
Behan, who is well known to many of us as director general for social
care&#151;he was previously chief inspector of the Commission for
Social Care Inspection. He is exceedingly well respected and highly
qualified. The proposal may mean re-badging somebody like David Behan,
if not David Behan
himself.</div><a name="0807045000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not talking about an enormous upheaval in structures, creating a
whole new department within the Department of Health or the Department
for Children, Schools and Families, but about having a higher profile
for a lead person who is recognised as the chief social worker. I shall
summarise their roles, as set out in the new clause. They would be the
face of social workers in the media, in particular when there was a big
case. They would also carry the can in the public eye when there seemed
to be something wrong with the system, and they would oversee the
promotion of the social worker profession and better recruitment
campaigns, and would advise the Secretary of State or the Secretaries
of State on technical matters to do with social workers. If we give
that sort of status to a chief social worker, hopefully there will be a
trickle-down effect on the status, standing and recognition of all
social
workers.</div><a name="0807045000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not pretend that this is a universal panacea, that overnight people
will say, &#147;Oh, now that we have a chief social worker, I am
going to let my social worker over the threshold more often.&#148; It
is a question of building up those images and perceptions. I shall give
the example of New Zealand, where as part of our study I had a long
conversation with Marie Connolly, who is the chief social worker in
that country. The post was created some years ago because they had the
same problem there with the perception of social workers. They thought
that it would be helpful to create the post of chief social worker.
Marie appears frequently in the media. She told me that she had been
offered her own regular newspaper column, to report on the life of
social workers and on things going on in the profession. The innovation
was generally judged to be successful, and we can learn many lessons
from
it.</div><a name="0807045000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
thing that came up in our study&#151;it seems a flippant suggestion
but it is not&#151;was that there should be a soap opera or a popular
television programme centred on social workers. We have such programmes
on doctors, nurses and teachers, and even forensic pathologists have
become part of the culture of popular TV. Yet when social workers
appear in soaps, in &#147;EastEnders&#148; for example, they are
terribly stereotyped and portrayed in a pretty derogatory way as
interfering, which only reinforces some of the misperceptions that many
members of the public have. If we saw social workers in a different
light, as human beings trying to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>do a difficult job&#151;in many cases a very
difficult job&#151;in difficult circumstances with restraints on
resources, people might come to appreciate their role more.</div>
<a name="0807045000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is an
important point of principle. If the Government were to adopt the idea,
we could work on how to create the position. I do not intend it to be
another bureaucratic structure within Government. It is largely a
question of how we focus on one of the most important sets of people
working with vulnerable families. Creating the post of chief social
worker would send out some very positive messages to the profession,
but perhaps more importantly to the public, who might come to
appreciate social workers better. Social workers may then be able to do
their difficult jobs more easily than they can at the moment. I commend
new clause 2 to the
Committee.</div><a name="0807045000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000191"></a>The
Minister for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley
Hughes):</b> Let me start by saying that I understand
completely the sentiment behind the new clause. I shall declare an
interest as having trained as a probation officer on a post-graduate
social work course. For some years I taught others to become
post-graduate social workers at Manchester University, so I share the
sentiments that social workers have a vital role promoting the best
outcomes, particularly for vulnerable children. Social workers are
often misunderstood and get an unfair press. They deserve our support
and gratitude. While their mistakes make headline news, and rightly so,
their many successes go largely unreported and unappreciated. I am with
the spirit of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause. It is good to see
the Conservative Party sharing those sentiments about social workers
now. I recall that it was not always the case.</div>
<a name="0807045000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some time ago
we started to recognise social workers&#146; valuable contribution,
and the need to support the work and improve its quality, with a
&#163;73 million programme for social work improvement over the next
three years, which the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools
and Families, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West is leading.
That will increase the capacity, skills and numbers of social workers.
Specifically to support newly qualified social workers, we are piloting
a newly qualified social worker status and strengthening initial social
work training. We are developing a professional development framework
for social workers, so that there are better career pathways, and
supporting experienced staff to remain in practice and act as mentors.
That will build on the existing post-qualifying framework for social
workers.</div><a name="0807045000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham says, is it equally
important to promote a positive public image, which we are trying to do
through a major national targeted marketing and communications
campaign.</div><a name="0807045000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulties with the new clause at this time, and I stress &#147;at
this time&#148;, are threefold. The hon. Gentleman alluded to some of
it. We already have an arguably overcrowded infrastructure for the
support and development of social workers. As he mentioned, we have the
General Social Care Council, which publishes codes of practice to set
the standards of conduct and promotes social work. We have also
established the Children&#146;s Workforce Development Council, which
embraces social work as part of its work across the whole
children&#146;s workforce, including social care. The current chair
of the board is Michael Leadbetter, a former director of social
services in Essex, and he has wide experience in the social work
sector. The Association for Directors of Children&#146;s Services 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>and the Association for Directors of Adult Services
are also playing a role in driving improvements in quality and
practice. The National Children&#146;s Bureau is hosting a new
centre, working with key partners including the Social Care Institute
for
Excellence.</div><a name="0807045000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within
the Department, the Chief Inspector for Education, Children&#146;s
Services and Skills has a duty to inform the Secretary of State of the
quality of children&#146;s services generally. As the hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham has said, David Behan, the director-general
for social care, is in the Department of Health, but has a
cross-government role none the less. The director for social care
leadership and performance reports to him. That post-holder must be a
qualified social worker and in that capacity provides professional
leadership and advice to Ministers about the profession. My hon.
Friend, and I before him, worked closely with the relevant Minister in
the Department of Health on all these matters relating to social work
practice and social care. There is quite a crowded field
already.</div><a name="0807045000164"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="0807045000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
to pick up a couple of points that the hon. Gentleman made, to compare
this post with other chief officer posts is not necessarily a valid
exercise without considerable discussion. Take the example of the chief
medical officer. That post is rather different from that which I would
envisage here. That is because the structure of those organisations and
the way in which the professionals are employed within them is very
different. The NHS is a central body, directly managed by the
Department of Health. The chief medical officer post and the chief
nursing post, among others, provide input directly to assist that
management. Here, of course, social workers are employed by local
authorities, without that central management
structure.</div><a name="0807045000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also mentioned a comparison with New Zealand. We are not
necessarily talking about the same kind of structure and would a chief
social worker post offer the same as it may seem to do in New Zealand?
Social care there is like the NHS and the Department of Health here; it
is the province of a central Department which discharges all the social
work functions. Here social workers are employed by local authorities,
which are responsible in law for those social care functions. The post
of a chief social worker does not translate that
easily.</div><a name="0807045000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the most important reason for me is that we set out in our
children&#146;s plan our ambition to have a world-class
children&#146;s work force. To help us implement both the changes we
have already made and those we want to make, we have established an
expert group to support us in developing a long-term strategy for the
work force, including social work. We will publish that in the autumn.
The expert group, and the strategy team that is supporting it, are
looking at six themes: work force capacity, excellence in practice,
purpose and roles, improving joint working, what interventions work and
developing and managing work force reforms.</div>
<a name="0807045000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">One the of the
key things the group is looking at is whether the delivery
infrastructure for different parts of the work force, which I sketchily
outlined and suggested was already very crowded, makes sense now. The
expert group is deep into considering that evidence at the
moment. I would not want to pre-empt its
considerations 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>by adding in another post now. A chief social worker
post may be an interesting idea as we reform that infrastructure. I am
happy to ask the expert groups specifically to examine that proposal,
but I do not feel able to accept the amendment now, because we are in
this process with experts from the profession advising us how we might
make some long-term and more radical changes. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will accept that assurance, recognise that we will ask our
expert group to give his proposal consideration and therefore not press
his new
clause.</div><a name="0807045000042"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000192"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful for the Minister for her comments,
although she spent almost as much time knocking down the idea of a
chief social worker, as I spent trying to set it up. That was slightly
churlish, considering the positive way in which it was put forward. I
have been attending Association of Directors of Social Services
conferences for many years, making many positive and constructive
speeches about the role of social worker, often in contrast to
Secretaries of State, who have gone to ADSS and similar conference
pointing a finger of blame at social workers, which they have found
extremely demoralising.</div>
<a name="0807045000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">This work on
the commission set up by the Conservative party was the culmination of
many years of wanting to do something more constructive and help the
whole role of social worker. We were able to attract a heavyweight
panel of experts, professionals and academics, some of them members of
the Labour party, who were prepared to come along and contribute
positively to what they saw as a very good cause. They have all engaged
in the process and our report has been greatly welcomed. I would be
delighted to make that report available, either in the hard copies that
remain in my office or by downloading it from the Conservative party
website, to the expert group to which the Minister referred.</div>
<a name="0807045000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the three reasons the Minister gave for why it is not suitable to take
on the post at this time, although I think that the long list of
various different structures that she trooped out indicates that that
is part of the problem. It is a crowded system and the line management
is confused, and I think that it causes confusion within the industry,
let alone the public. I would rather see a reorganisation and overhaul
of all the different bodies and posts to streamline them into a more
recognisable, appreciated and acknowledged group of posts, and the
chief social worker would make a major contribution to that
streamlining.</div>
<a name="0807045000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will feed the discussion into the expert group she has set
up, which is due to report in the autumn, and that the outside world
will see that as a constructive suggestion. On the basis that she was
not overly churlish, has acknowledged the positive parts of the
proposal and said that the Government would not be prepared to take it
on &#147;at this time&#148;, which suggests that there might be
opportunities for it later, I am perfectly happy not to press the new
clause. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

Before making any decision with respect to a child whom they are

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000195"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> New clause 5 deals with family conferencing and
overlaps to some degree with new clause 29, which has been tabled by
the hon. Member for Stafford and other hon. Members. Both new clauses
contain references to a family conference, and that relates to our
previous debate on the importance of early intervention and of being
able to keep vulnerable families together rather than having children
taken into the care system. The importance relates to both the value to
the families and the cost savings to society as a whole. The new clause
also refers back to the welfare checklist that I proposed as part of
new clause 1, which the Minister responded to positively. She did not
adopt it, but she is certainly prepared to consider it within
regulations.</div>
<a name="0807045000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not go
into great detail on family conferencing, as I am sure that many
members of the Committee, if not all, are familiar with it. Family
conferences are family-led, decision-making meetings at which parents,
relatives and friends, following significant preparation by an
independent co-ordinator, develop a plan for the child&#146;s care
that addresses child welfare or protection concerns identified by the
local authority. The Family Rights Group&#146;s briefing sets that
out well and gives evidence of how it is a proven mechanism. It claims
that family conferencing is:</div>
<a name="0807045000153"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a means of
engaging the family to identify and support care arrangements for
vulnerable children and their
parents&#148;;</div><a name="0807045000154"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
way of identifying alternative care arrangements within the family when
the parent cannot continue to look after the child, including
identifying necessary support packages to avoid the child being
received into state
care&#148;;</div><a name="0807045000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
means of planning for the child to see members of their family and
return home to their family network from state care wherever
possible&#148;;</div>
<a name="0807045000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">It claims that such
conferencing should be used
prior</div><a name="0807045000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
&#145;pathway&#146; planning for children leaving local authority
care.&#148;</div><a name="0807045000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned some of the examples of best practice on the model of family
conferencing and family support run by certain children&#146;s
organisations, not least of which is NCH, which has a good track record
of some impressive projects. I recently visited its Phoenix service in
Merton, which works intensively with families that are reaching crisis
point. It can take them on board quickly and provide them with
intensive, 24-hour support, seven days a week, whatever the crisis
might be. At the end of the period the family is linked into existing
local services. The intervention involves defusing the immediate,
precipitate crisis that led to the service referral, with support
workers engaging the family, children and/or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>young people, liaising with other agencies, assessing the problems,
developing specific, measurable goals and helping everyone in the
family to acquire the skills to achieve them. That gets all gets all
the family members together around a table&#151;literally or
metaphorically&#151;to sort out what outside, holistic support will
be required to get the family back on its feet. Based on an average
placement time of three years for a child who is taken into the care
system, NCH estimates that such a family intervention service could
offer cost saving of &#163;127,140 per intervention, which is
significant. That really is investing to save&#151;there are
financial savings and it makes financial sense, but the family could
also be saved and kept together.</div>
<a name="0807045000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
are positive about such organisations and they are keen to disseminate
best practice, but not enough kinship placements are initiated by local
authority social workers. One good way of promoting that, other than
the through the measures that are already in the Bill, is to ensure
that family conferences take place as standard rather than as an
exception. There is a bit of postcode lottery regarding the
availability of family conferencing. If we were to put a measure in the
Bill that stresses the preventive attraction of family conferences so
that there would have to be good reasons why a family conference was
not attempted or viable, there might be many more kinship placements;
better still, many more families could be kept together, and fewer
children would have to be taken into care, with all the expense, angst
and trauma that that can bring about. New clause 5 is straightforward
and I am happy to recommend it to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="0807045000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0807045000196"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): It is a pleasure to see you
in the Chair again, Mr. Pope. I rise to speak to new clause
29, but it is similar to new clause 5, which is why they are grouped
together.</div><a name="0807045000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the unrelenting positive mode that I have been in during our
proceedings, we should first acknowledge that the law will be
strengthened by clause 9, which we have dealt with, because it requires
local authorities to have regard to family placements with relatives
and friends and kinship care. We should recognise that part of the
battle has been won before we deal with the new clauses on family group
conferences.</div><a name="0807045000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 29 is slightly more elegantly drafted than new clause 5, but I
would say that. I do not personally claim the credit for it; it is
entirely thanks to the work of the Family Rights Group. The hon. Member
for East Worthing and Shoreham referred to its briefing when discussing
new clause 5 and he stole the rest of my thunder by referring to the
National Children&#146;s Home briefing, so there are no briefings
left that I can refer the Committee
to.</div><a name="0807045000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 29 would amend section 22 of the Children Act 1989, which is the
section that clause 9 will amend to make references to kinship care in
a more prominent place. I am seeking in new clause 29 to complete a
movement that the Government have already begun in clause 9 by
requiring family group conferences to take place. To reiterate what the
hon. Gentleman said about the benefits of family group conferences,
they apply all through the journey that
leads&#151;potentially&#151;into and out of care. A family group
conference at the right time when a family crisis is building up could
help to identify the problems and solutions without care ever becoming 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>necessary, and the child involved could stay with its parents or close
family. If that is not possible&#151;we still want to avoid care if
possible&#151;we could look at whether the wider family could cope
with a package of support. A family group conference would be valuable
even if a child temporarily goes into care, because the problems that
caused that could be solved to enable a child to return home. When a
child comes to the end of period in care, when, for example, they
become an adult, there could be situations in which the wider family is
absolutely the right place to support a person who returns as a new
adult. A family group conference could still bring together family
members who could contribute to that successful transition from being
in care to becoming an independent
adult.</div>
<a name="0807045000165"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="0807045000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
every stage of the process, family group conferences are useful. The
hon. Gentleman did not mention today something from the Family Rights
Group briefing that he mentioned on the first day of our proceedings,
which is that recent research has found that only 4 per cent. of family
and friends placements are initiated by social workers. That is modern
research from 2008 so that is up-to-date information. It demonstrates
that a lot of social workers are not used to convening family group
conferences and are perhaps not convinced of their benefit. A little
tilt in the right direction in the Bill would help to make that more of
a routine
consideration.</div><a name="0807045000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman said, the NCH briefing paper that hon. Members have
received is not about family group conferences, but about the success
of the NCH intensive family support service. As he says, it
demonstrates not just an effective outcome, but a cost-effective way of
dealing with problem cases. The quotation that he gave about cost
savings was related specifically to a study in Glamorgan, where there
were 15 cases of intensive support with NCH. Each of those
interventions produced a potential saving of &#163;127,000.
Multiplied by 15, that is a saving of about &#163;2 million for one
local authority in Wales. If that were scaled up to the rest of the UK,
we could be talking about a third of a billion pounds. That is how
exciting and important it is for us to give serious attention to this
proposal.</div><a name="0807045000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the outcomes side of the NCH briefing, it reports success not just in
Merton, but in Plymouth, where 94 per cent. of young people referred
did not enter the care system and in Tower Hamlets, where 88 per cent.
of the young people remained with their families. There is potential
that alternative approaches, if used at the right time with the right
consideration and the right package of support, can avoid children
being taken into care unnecessarily or children being detained in care
for longer than is necessary for their
welfare.</div><a name="0807045000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased to support both new clauses. They push Ministers to finish
the job that was well started in clause 9. However, the end will not be
achieved unless we ensure that social workers routinely consider in
every case whether a family group conference would be of
assistance.</div><a name="0807045000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0807045000197"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): I rise to speak briefly in
support of new clause 5. When I was an Essex county councillor, I did
some research into family group 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>conferencing. It originated in the Maori community in New Zealand, where
it has been greatly beneficial in keeping children out of care. That
has also been seen in this country and elsewhere. It combines the good
will and effort, not just of the nuclear family and the extended
family, but of others who form part of the child&#146;s social
network. I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to
supporting adding the new clause to the
Bill.</div><a name="0807045000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000198"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I have signed up to elegance. Both new clauses are
important. Rather than repeat what has been in the numerous briefings
on this matter, I would just like to emphasise that early intervention
is all-important. I was reading about the &#147;Public Law
Outline&#148; the other day and consideration of family conferencing
is a requisite. However, I was concerned whether that was happening at
the point of crisis. It is not stated in the new clauses, but to my
mind, if possible, family conferencing should kick in at a much earlier
stage than I understood it would under the procedures of the
&#147;Public Law Outline&#148;. Intervening early to bring the
family together helps to deal with all of the points that we have made
about kinship care. It also highlights at that early stage whether
there is enough support for the family, financially or otherwise. We
have discussed that issue and the Minister has committed to a
consultation on appropriate
guidance.</div><a name="0807045000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
quoted various figures on Second Reading. It is clear just from looking
at the figures that the amount spent on family support has some
relation to the number of children being taken into care. There might
not be a direct one-to-one relationship, but the statistics are quite
clear. It is staggering that we spend three times as much on looking
after children in care as we do on family support as a whole. We are
talking about a whole package, but the family conferencing aspect is a
really important part of it. There clearly is that aspect of invest to
save.</div><a name="0807045000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, was struck by the 4 per cent. figure that came in one of our
briefings: family and friends placements were initiated by social
workers in only 4 per cent. of cases. That is quite staggering and
shows what a long way we have to go along this route. These amendments
are important to break this pattern. To reiterate, the important point
for me is that family conferencing should ideally come much sooner than
a crisis point in the
family.</div><a name="0807045000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000199"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford for recognising that one of the major thrusts of this
legislation and the wider package in the White Paper is to increase
substantially the number of children who can be cared for somewhere
within their birth families or with friends who are known to them. That
is an objective that we share. I certainly understand the reasons
behind this amendment, with its hope that an automatic consideration of
family group conferencing might be another catalyst for increasing the
number of children who can go into some form of kinship
care.</div><a name="0807045000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members will also recognise that in addition to this
Bill, we are trying to move forward with a whole range of options that
are specifically focused on supporting parents at an early stage when
they are getting into difficulties. That is not necessarily at the
stage at which family group conferencing would be considered now when
there is a question whether a child 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>can be accommodated within their own family or might need some
alternative accommodation. There is a wide range of parenting
interventions, including the piloting of new, intensive parenting
programmes, increased support for relative carers and some very
specific models, such as multi-systemic therapy for adolescents at high
risk of entering care or custody and intensive fostering. We are
promoting a whole range of options, which includes family group
conferences.</div><a name="0807045000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with family group conferencing from the point of view of these
amendments is twofold. First, it is a complex service to administer. It
requires a high level of skill and confidence from the practitioners
who are organising it. That is why we have already started to promote
the development of expertise, knowledge and skills in family group
conferencing, commissioning a programme of regional training events,
for example, to equip managers and practitioners with the necessary
skills to develop the use of this model. That is very different from
putting a requirement in primary legislation for a family group
conference for every family. It goes completely against the spirit, the
letter and the culture that we have tried to inculcate and develop
since the Children Act 1989, which imposes a general duty on local
authorities to provide a range and level of support services that are
appropriate for children in need, including to promote their upbringing
in their family.</div>
<a name="0807045000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally
family group conferences are seen as a very valuable element in the
range of local services. We want to see them used more widely. We are
putting in the resources to promote the expertise that will enable that
to happen. To put a single method in the Bill above all others,
including some that are being developed, would be contrary to the
spirit of section 17 of the 1989 Act. It would limit the flexibility of
local authorities and would be quite prohibitive for them in their
attempts to meet children&#146;s needs on an individual basis. That
is not to say that I do not think family group conferences are
important or that they should be used more often. I do. We have
highlighted that in &#147;Care Matters&#148; and have included
references to family group conferences in &#147;Working Together to
Safeguard Children&#148;, which we published in 2006. We have also
included references in the revised volume I of the Children Act
guidance that was published this
year.</div><a name="0807045000071"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000200"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> The right hon. Lady&#146;s comments have led
me to take a closer look at the new clause. The wording says
&#147;where appropriate&#148; and &#147;any other reasonable
intervention&#148;, so it is not suggesting that family group
conferencing should be an exclusive
strategy.</div><a name="0807045000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000201"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> Putting that method in the Bill gives it
pre-eminence and means that the local authority should consider it
above any other methods that they would use. That is the point I am
trying to make in relation to the 1989 Act. I understand that
stakeholders have concerns and I would like to join in the references
made to NCH because it has done a great deal to take forward improved
methods of working with children and families. We have adopted many of
those methods&#151;not only family group conferencing, but family
intervention projects, which I will mention in a moment.</div>
<a name="0807045000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
that stakeholders feel there is a way to go in developing the skills
and knowledge in the field to deliver effective family group
conferencing services. In 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>November 2006, with help from stakeholders, we funded the publication of
a tool kit, which aimed to support the use of family group conference
projects and assist new agencies in setting up those kinds of services
where none exist. In December last year, we published a family group
conference reader, which contains a wide-range of essays from
experienced practitioners on research, policy and practice
perspectives. We have also launched guidance to local authorities,
which emphasises that support should be available to families at the
earliest point it is
needed.</div><a name="0807045000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000202"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I would like to probe the matter further because
I want the Minister to give examples of what other methods, as she
described it, would be de-prioritised by the insertion of the new
clause.</div><a name="0807045000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000203"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I was just coming to that point. For three
specific reasons, the right way to promote the use of family group
conferencing is to do what we do already: suffuse our documents with
references to family group conferences; continue to develop the
knowledge, training and expertise required; and put the method in the
context of a focus on early intervention and prevention. However, we
should also recognise that it is not the only method. In relation to
the point at which family group conferencing is used at the
moment&#151;in the context of a child possibly being
accommodated&#151;we are developing other options that bring families
together at a much earlier stage, for example, when children show
difficulties that are identified in primary school. We also have the
family pathfinders project, the family intervention projects that NCH
has helped us to develop, and the family nurse partnerships, which for
the first time identify the need to support disadvantaged mothers at
the point of birth. That support continues to be provided by a
specially trained health visitor over two years to try to prevent the
need further down the line for a family group conference to discuss
whether the child needs to be accommodated.</div>
<a name="0807045000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, I do not want to fetter local authorities with one particular
method. I support the method when it is necessary and think that it can
achieve some excellent results, but in relation to the panoply of
intervening much earlier in families and the wide range of alternatives
that are now being developed, we should stick with the spirit of the
1989 Act.</div>
<a name="0807045000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
hon. Member for Upminster that the amendment to new clause 5, which
requires family group conferencing to be considered where appropriate,
adds nothing to the existing requirement in section 17 of the 1989 Act
for local authorities to consider whatever is necessary, as
appropriate.</div><a name="0807045000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000204"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am looking for a way forward that does not
involve primary legislation. My right hon. Friend mentioned the
publication &#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148; and
the tool kit, which is welcome. Clearly, when the Act is passed, it
will include new guidance incorporating what we have said about clause
9 and the new consideration of kinship care. Am I right in saying that
when social workers consider taking care proceedings, they have a kind
of handbook so they can check everything they need to before and so
they have evidence they have done so? Would my right hon. Friend
undertake to consider those different documents in the round, to see 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>whether together we could apply that focus that she
mentioned suffusing all the documents, with consideration of how the
family group conference might be a helpful tool in kinship care cases,
for
example?</div><a name="0807045000166"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="0807045000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000205"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I am certainly happy to reiterate that, as my hon.
Friend said, I will undertake to continue to suffuse all the relevant
documents with a reference to family group conferencing and a range of
other methods, to ensure the early intervention that members of the
Committee rightly want to see. I share that objective, but I hope that
the Committee will accept that it would not be right to specify one
particular method in the Bill. We can, however, use the other available
mechanisms to inform and shape social work practice&#151;the guidance
that my hon. Friends referred to&#151;and I undertake to do that. I
hope, therefore, that my hon. Friends will feel able to withdraw the
new clause.</div>
<a name="0807045000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000206"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am slightly disappointed, to start with, about
the reference to the more elegant of the proposed new clauses&#151;I
did not come into politics to be elegant. I came into politics to get
something done, to create meaningful legislation and I am perfectly
prepared to cast aside elegance in the pursuit of brevity and
succinctness, of which our new clause is the epitome. It goes to the
heart of the matter slightly less elegantly, but more practically, than
the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Stafford, but I did not
seek to undermine it in any way and I shall not do so now. Both new
clauses would add something to the Bill.</div>
<a name="0807045000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
disappointed by the Minister because I do not think that the new clause
would fetter, as she put it, the ability or flexibility of social
workers and local authorities and I was not convinced by her response
to my request regarding what other matters would be deprioritised by
inserting the new clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster made
some pertinent points about the origins of family conferencing and how
important and effective it has been, in the second reference of the day
to New Zealand, from which we can clearly learn quite a lot.</div>
<a name="0807045000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
press the new clause, but if we were to come back to this issue on
Report&#151;the hon. Member for Stafford has mentioned possible uses
within the tool kit or with guidance elsewhere. Given that the Bill may
not Report for some months, it might be useful for the Minister to
report back on the use of family group conferencing and how it is
growing. It is currently happening according to a postcode lottery and
too few placements are kinship placements, which would have a far
greater likelihood of success if they resulted from family group
conferencing&#151;if it was still necessary for the child to go into
the care system. On that basis, the Minister&#146;s comments on that
would help. The Minister may have sympathised with what we are trying
to achieve, but many of us think that the proposal needs to have more
force and a bit more bite.</div>
<a name="0807045000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0807045000207"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): I am concerned. Does
the Minister read the new clause as recommending something that one
does sometime during the process, or is it to happen at the end, almost
as the last chance that a child has to remain in their
home?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div><a name="0807045000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000208"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Our new clause would not fetter the chronology
of that process at all, it just
states:</div><a name="0807045000157"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
a child is committed into care, the local authority must, where
appropriate, offer a family group conference
and&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0807045000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">perhaps
it should read &#147;or&#148;&#151;</div>
<a name="0807045000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other
reasonable intervention which may alleviate the need for a child to be
put into
care.&#148;</div><a name="0807045000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
family group conference could be the first thing to take place, it
could be the very last thing to take place and if it was not successful
then care proceedings might be triggered, or it could happen partway
through the journey of dealing with a vulnerable child. I do not agree
that the new clause would fetter the process. I will rephrase the new
clause for Report. I will be grateful if in a few months&#146; time,
perhaps at Report, the Minister could detail how the use of family
group conferencing is growing. If it is not growing or if the figures
are stalling, still low or unrepresentative of cases up and down the

helpful. A long time ago when the hon. Gentleman moved new clause 1,
which, with its looked-after children welfare checklist, also referred
to the desirability of keeping children with their families with the
correct package of support, the then Minister offered to brigade the
different laws and guidance to show us that those points were covered.
This dovetails into that, because when we want to know about family
group conferences, we want to know about how they relate to the points
in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s welfare checklist, do we not? It is
reasonable to ask the Minister be ready by Report to be able to tell us
about family group conferencing practice on the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000213"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> New clauses 6 and 10 deal with children with
disabilities in long-term placements. The issue has been raised in the
Lords and it is a campaign by the Every Disabled Child Matters group.
All of us in Committee sympathise with what that group has achieved; it
has been very effective. I do not understand why the Government were
not more sympathetic to adopting the proposal in another place, so I
will be grateful for more clarification from the Minister in this
place.</div><a name="0807045000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Every Disabled Child Matters campaign welcomes the progress that the
House of Lords made to improve the Bill for disabled children and young
people, as do we. Part of that was the short breaks from caring
provision, which we debated earlier and is greatly welcomed.</div>
<a name="0807045000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses would require local authorities to consider whether disabled
children in long-term residential placements should have the protection
and support of looked-after children status. They retain the
flexibility to ensure that the right solution is found for each child
and family, but make sure that every child placed away from home will
have their safeguarding needs properly
considered.</div><a name="0807045000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looked-after
status should include disabled children in long-term residential
placements in education or health settings, some of whom are away from
home for 52 weeks of the year with little or no parental contact.
Looked-after status would provide a package of support for those
children, including a contact plan to support parents to maintain
contact with their children while they are away from home. We are
talking about severely disabled children who require specialist
placements. Those placements are few and far between and for many
children will inevitably mean being a long distance from home, with
implications and practical problems for keeping contact with their
parents and other people looking out for
them.</div><a name="0807045000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
few homes that offer those specialist services do a fantastic job. I
have visited many of them and have seen the services and the dedication
of the staff. Those long-term placements are for children who are not
in the care system on account of having been taken away 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>from their birth parents because of abuse or other problems, but who are
living away from their parents because they are severely disabled and
require the intensive and specialist support that many of the homes and
education or health settings
offer.</div><a name="0807045000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Every Disabled Child Matters campaign thinks that there is a gap in the
system. The 2005 review of disabled children in residential placements
recommended a more consistent application of looked-after status for
disabled children spending long periods in residential placements,
particularly those are far from home. That recommendation recognises
that disabled children are three times more likely to be subject to
abuse than their non-disabled peers, and therefore require much more
robust child protection measures and support from the placing
authority. There is widespread confusion on the part of residential
settings, local authorities and parents about that, and Government
research shows that guidance is too often disregarded. We are not
talking about an enormous body of children. Recent statistics show that
338 children are placed in residential accommodation for 52 weeks of
the year without the protection of looked-after status. The new clauses
would send a clear message to local authorities that they should
consider looked-after status for disabled children in long-term
placements, to determine whether or not that is the best way to keep
them
safe.</div><a name="0807045000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current system for allocating looked-after status is inconsistent and
confusing for families, and it is not optimal for safeguarding
vulnerable children. We are not trying to undermine the voice of the
parents; the proposed approach would support the creation of
partnerships between parents and local authorities, and those
partnerships would maintain parental rights and responsibilities as set
out in section 20 of the Children Act 1989. That section was designed
as an opportunity to create such partnerships, and placements made
under it are based on a voluntary arrangement between the local
authority and the child&#146;s parents. That does not affect parental
responsibility, which remains with the natural parents. We are not
stepping in to override the parents&#146; wishes and be unduly
nannying.</div><a name="0807045000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
conclude, I shall outline the benefits of looked-after status for this
small body of children. Disabled children living away from home without
looked-after status miss out on a range of measures to support and
protect their welfare. If looked-after status were given to those
children, they could receive an allocated social worker, and a care
plan that identified their needs and how those should be met, and which
included the views and wishes of the child and their family. There
would also be a health assessment and health plan, and a contact plan
to promote contact between the child and their family, along with
access to support for the costs associated with visits from the family.
There would be an allocated independent reviewing officer to monitor
implementation of the care plan and to ensure that the child&#146;s
views were being taken into account, and finally there would be regular
reviews of the placement, and access to after care advice and
assistance to support the young person&#146;s successful move on from
the
placement.</div><a name="0807045000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
solution proposed by the new clauses put forward by the Every Disabled
Child Matters group is a straightforward assessment process at the
point of placement, to decide whether looked-after status would best
promote a child&#146;s welfare. The status would not be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>compulsory. Parents and local authorities would decide together, with
input from the child, whether measures that come with looked-after
status, such as an allocated social worker and access to the support
and protection they provide, would benefit the child. That, after all,
is our primary consideration. The new clauses would be a positive
addition to the Bill, and I genuinely do not understand why the
Government did not respond more positively in another place. Perhaps
they have had a change of heart, which I will be delighted to hear now
from the
Minister.</div><a name="0807045000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0807045000214"></a><b class="B">Lynda
Waltho</b> (Stourbridge) (Lab): I rise to speak to new clauses
33 and 34 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol,
East.</div><a name="0807045000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am particularly keen to ensure that the Bill supports and protects
disabled children who live away from home, many&#151;as the hon.
Gentleman said&#151;of whom have profound communication difficulties.
Those children are the least able to tell anybody how they
feel&#151;whether they are happy, settled or frustrated, or possibly
scared or frightened. Those children are truly the most vulnerable of
the vulnerable and that means that the state has to play a far larger
role. The Bill provides us with a key opportunity to ensure that local
authorities actively consider the welfare needs of disabled children
when arranging long-term placements, some of which are for 52 weeks of
the year. To include such a duty would represent part of the joining up
of the &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; agenda, so that it would
really work and every disabled child would truly matter, alongside
their peers. There is no clear legislation that ensures that local
authorities consider whether looked-after status would best protect the
welfare of a child being placed away from home, in either a long-term
educational setting or a health setting. Interestingly, however, when a
child is placed away from home during a crisis, even if it is only for
one night, that child automatically has looked-after
status.</div>
<a name="0807045000167"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="0807045000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Children
who will be living away from home for a large part of the year should
have access to the benefits of looked-after status. It is really the
gold standard, and offers almost the shopping list of benefits that the
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham read out; that is so
important. All of those benefits are so vital to these vulnerable
children: the allocated social worker; the care plan; the health plan,
and the contact plan. Of course, if they do not get that looked-after
status, they will only get a once-a-year review of their statement, and
there is such a wide disparity
there.</div><a name="0807045000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0807045000215"></a><b class="B">Kerry

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000216"></a>Lynda
Waltho:</b> Indeed, there are schools and residential homes
that will not accept children unless they have looked-after status. The
work done at Sunfield school in the constituency of the hon. Member for
Bromsgrove&#151;it  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>actually has a Stourbridge address, so I feel that it is partly in my
constituency too&#151;is absolutely fantastic. It is run by Barry
Carpenter and his staff, and it will not accept children without
looked-after status. It is so vital that that status is conferred on
these children.</div>
<a name="0807045000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
conferring looked-after status will improve the transition of these
children to adult services; that is something that the hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham did not mention. It makes that transition
much smoother because, of course, the child is known to the authorities
and these children are most likely to have continuing needs.</div>
<a name="0807045000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recent
ministerial statements made in the other place are to be welcomed and
they show a movement towards this position of conferring looked-after
status, indicating, I hope, that the Government agree broadly that most
disabled children in long-term placements, where the local authority
has been involved, should really be looked after. However, there is a
great deal of confusion around this issue. Local authorities,
residential placements and the Government&#146;s own research in 2005
indicate that current guidance is sometimes disregarded.</div>
<a name="0807045000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Every
Disabled Child Matters campaign group and its partners are keen to see
the Bill amended to reflect the Government&#146;s move to this
position. Such an amendment would send the clearest signal possible to
local authorities that they should actively be considering conferring
looked-after status in these cases.</div>
<a name="0807045000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Minister is likely to tell me that guidance already exists and that
it is possible to strengthen the regulations. However, as we have
already heard, there is evidence that the guidance is confusing, so why
not take the opportunity now of amending the Bill effectively while we
have the chance to do so, which would send out a strong
signal?</div>
<a name="0807045000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the ministerial team has also been looking at providing additional
protection for these children by strengthening the visiting regime, but
why should we set up a parallel system when we could offer what is
really the gold standard of protection for our most vulnerable children
and do so now? To suggest an alternative way forward borders on
possibly relegating such children to second-class status, and that
would not give them the support that looked-after status would. If
there is a visiting regime, what status would it have? Would the people
in that regime be students, or people unused to, for example, the
profound problems and behaviours of a young person with severe
autism?</div>
<a name="0807045000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will briefly
mention two case studies. Both children attended Summerfield school,
which I have previously referred to. James did not have looked-after
status but he should have had it. He had a severe learning disability,
but his family was told by the local authority that it was not
necessary for him to be looked after. He had no care plan and no formal
arrangements to review his placement, except an annual education
review. That meeting reviews his statement and his educational needs
but not his overall well-being, and that is the important point. His
mother has full parental responsibility but does not benefit from any
support or assistance from the local authority. James did not have a
named social worker. His mother has three other children and is a
single parent. She has no car and can only afford to visit him, using
public transport, maybe three or four times a year. She is not legally
entitled to any assistance.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div><a name="0807045000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Adam, on the
other hand, has a severe learning disability but is being looked after
by his local authority. The local authority and his mother share
parental responsibility. Adam has a care plan through which his needs
are reviewed within school and on a wider basis. He has regular visits
from a named social worker and a review twice a year that is chaired by
an independent reviewing officer. Adam&#146;s care plan provides for
regular contact to see his mother and transport is paid for by the
local
authority.</div><a name="0807045000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
sum up, looked-after status is about safeguarding planning, target
setting and monitoring for our most vulnerable children. For too long,
there has been too much confusion from local authorities in this area.
This is the time to end the confusion and send the clearest message
possible. This is a crucial chance to put the situation right for the
first time and create a clear duty that gives disabled children living
away from home the same rights to support and protection as their
non-disabled peers. I urge the Minister to grasp this chance and
actively consider this
proposal.</div><a name="0807045000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000217"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Perhaps I should start by endorsing the comments
that have been made to avoid being repetitive. I, too, would like to
welcome the duty being put on local authorities for short breaks. That
is important and is something that the Every Disabled Child Matters
campaign fought for. It is important to identify areas where there is
no clear legal duty. The new clauses ask local authorities to consider
only whether disabled children should have looked-after status. We have
been through all the advantages of this
measure.</div><a name="0807045000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, have looked at the case studies, but have chosen two different
ones, which I would like to refer to briefly because they add further
points to those that have already been made about vulnerability. This
is the example of
Thomas:</div><a name="0807045000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Now
that social services have given Thomas looked after child status,
social services deal with all the difficulties and I can be a parent
rather than a social
worker.&#148;</div><a name="0807045000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thought that that was the most striking way of describing the
advantages of looked-after status. It goes
on:</div><a name="0807045000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
also have the energy to be more assertive and to make positive
decisions which are in Thomas&#146; interests, so when we have
meetings with the social worker and other people involved with
Thomas&#146; care, I am able to assert my parental
authority.&#148;</div><a name="0807045000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is so important. In its way, it is as important as the short breaks in
helping the parent to hold together and do the best for their
child.</div><a name="0807045000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I thought that the case study of Mark was rather telling. It states
that</div><a name="0807045000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;when
the government set targets for local authorities to reduce the number
of children in the looked after system, we were put under some pressure
to de-classify him as a looked after
child.&#148;</div><a name="0807045000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
parents had to fight to keep looked-after status. That shows how a
local authority can respond to something that the Government said for
particular reasons in a way that is not acceptable in this day and age
and in light of the current debate. It is important to have this legal
duty in the Bill to show that every disabled child
matters.</div><a name="0807045000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000218"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Kevin Brennan):</b> Welcome back to the Chair,
Mr. Pope.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div><a name="0807045000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a great
deal of sympathy with many of the remarks that have been made. There is
accord across the Committee about this group of children and the
problems that they face. I acknowledge the campaigning of hon. Members
across the House and of the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign. We
are all committed to ensuring that children placed away from home are
not forgotten and that they are provided with the support and services
they need to thrive. We are committed to the sort of change that all
Committee members are looking
for.</div><a name="0807045000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should be clear that there is no gap in the legislative framework. The
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said that there was no clear
legal duty. In fact, clear legal duties are outlined. She quoted
somebody from the case study talking about Government targets to reduce
the number of people in the looked-after system. The Government have
never had any such targets. Sometimes I think that we should have
targets to reduce the number of myths about targets that the Government
have never had. Of course we have never had such a target and we have
explicitly ruled one out for obvious
reasons.</div><a name="0807045000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, there is no gap in the legislative framework.
Unfortunately, the changes that the new clauses propose would not
address the problem that we are all seeking to address, not least
because they all have a serious defect. They purport to require the
local authority to consider whether a child&#146;s welfare would be
best safeguarded and promoted by he or she becoming a looked-after
child, but that drafting does not fit with the existing legislative
scheme of the Children Act 1989. Although the expression
&#147;looked-after child&#148; is a useful shorthand term to refer
to the bundle of responsibilities that local authorities owe to a
particular group of children under the 1989 Act, in strict legal terms
the defining issue is the provision of accommodation. The other
responsibilities flow from that, such as the duties to maintain the
child and make a plan for their short and long-term care and keep it
under regular review, and the new duty to arrange regular
visits.</div>
<a name="0807045000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
the objective that all the new clauses share. They seek to ensure that
social services are actively involved in a timely and appropriate
manner when a decision is taken to place a child in an institutional
setting so that consideration is given in every case to the
child&#146;s social care needs. However, not only is the drafting
flawed and therefore unacceptable, but the amendments that they would
make would have no practical effect. The effect of the amendments to
section 85, introduced by new clauses 6 and 33, would add nothing to
the existing requirements in the provision whereby local authorities
must consider the extent to which, if at all, they should exercise
their functions under the 1989 Act with regard to the child. It is not
possible for the local authority to perform that duty without
considering whether the child is a child in need for the purposes of
part 3 of the 1989 Act and therefore what services it should
provide.</div>
<a name="0807045000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, the
amendment to the education legislation proposed in new clauses 10 and
34 would have no practical effect. The legislation and the code of
practice on special educational needs provide a comprehensive framework
that clearly and explicitly requires education officers to seek input
from social services professionals before making placement decisions.
The legislation also requires education officers to ensure that social
services 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>are notified when assessments are carried out, before placement
decisions are made and again when the statement of special educations
needs is reviewed. Section 85 of the 1989 Act imposes explicit
statutory duties on local authorities exercising their education
functions and on health bodies to notify the responsible local
authorities at the time the placement in made. It also requires those
local authorities to consider the extent to which they need to exercise
their functions under the 1989 Act in relation to the child.</div>
<a name="0807045000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
wholeheartedly that more needs to be done to ensure that those
children&#146;s needs are met and that parents are properly supported
in maintaining their role. Local authorities must perform all of those
duties and obligations and develop with other public bodies a properly
integrated approach that is capable of assessing children&#146;s
needs in the round and providing a multi-agency service. In particular,
authorities must be discouraged from viewing children only through an
education or health lens.</div>
<a name="0807045000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
agree, however, that these new clauses represent a legislative magic
bullet. In our view, the key lies in improving social work practice and
local authorities&#146; strategic planning and delivery. As a
Government, we have obviously been striving consistently for more and
better multi-agency working. That is why we brought in the Children Act
2004 and developed the children&#146;s trust model of delivery. It is
the rationale behind &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;, and that is
why we will continue to work hard with local authorities to ensure that
current practice, when poor, is brought up to the standard of the
best.</div>
<a name="0807045000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
includes provisions that build on and strengthen the existing framework
under which local authorities are notified of, monitor and supervise
all children who are placed away from home, regardless of the reasons
for that placement. The improvements to the notification arrangements
set out in clause 18 and the new visiting requirement set out clause 19
will make a practical contribution to improving practice and developing
multi-agency working. We will supplement those new duties in the Bill
with regulations and statutory guidance that will set out the clear
requirements of the local authority visitor&#146;s and our
expectations of the services that local authorities should provide to
support the active involvement of parents in their children&#146;s
lives.</div><a name="0807045000168"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="0807045000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
part of our revision of the statutory&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I
will say that again because that was a rather loud ejaculation. As part
of our revision of the statutory Children Act guidance, we will also
set out our expectations of the actions that social services teams
should take when they are alerted by their education colleagues to the
likelihood of a child being educated at a residential school and they
are involved in the decision making. There should be a presumption in
every case that the child is likely to be a child in need, and an
initial assessment should be undertaken in line with the framework for
assessment of children in need and their families to assess the
parents&#146; capacity to meet the child&#146;s needs in the
context of wider family and environmental factors. That assessment will
identify whether a more in-depth, core assessment is
appropriate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div><a name="0807045000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
should be clear on one point, on which I think hon. Members will agree.
Although that group of children is vulnerable in general and should
therefore be considered for services, we must not forget that the
children are all individuals and that their needs and family
circumstances will vary depending on how much time they spend with
their family, how far the placements are from their homes and whether
they are intended to provide for the child in the long term. That is
why, in the other place, we cautioned against the previous version of
this approach&#151;automatic looked-after status, which would
constitute making an inappropriate assumption about family
life.</div>
<a name="0807045000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We take these
issues very seriously. We have been listening and I again point hon.
Members to clauses 18 and 19 as evidence of our commitment to that
group of children. Those provisions will be a lever by which to change
practice and will support the other changes that we are introducing
through work force reform. For example, with children who are placed by
health in the national framework for children and young people&#146;s
continuing care, which the Department of Health has been working on
closely with my Department and is publishing for consultation shortly,
there is an emphasis on multi-agency working. We want to ensure that,
wherever possible, there are multi-agency decisions involving education
and social services on the provision of services to meet
children&#146;s long-term health needs, including accommodation
provision. Ensuring that the social care needs of such a diverse group
of children are met, whilst respecting their wishes, where possible,
and their parents wishes, is particularly challenging, especially as
their needs and their family&#146;s needs will change as they grow
and develop. That is why our clauses provide a solution as part of the
wider &#147;Care Matters&#148; agenda, and will drive forward real
change.</div><a name="0807045000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said at the outset, there is accord across the Committee on what we
are trying to achieve. However, I understand and have listened closely
to what hon. Members have said, and I undertake to look at the issues
again. I will consider with my right hon. Friend how we might create
the sort of changes that we all envisage, and whether there is anything
that we can do, in addition to what I have outlined, to achieve that
shared goal. We will continue our dialogue with hon. Members and with
the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign, and we will come forward on
Report with any conclusions that might be drawn from those further
consultations once we have unpacked hon. Members&#146; practical
concerns.</div>
<a name="0807045000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, we are committed to taking this opportunity to explore and
establish best practice in this area, including how local authorities
can best support continued parental involvement with a child in a
long-term placement, and to capture it in our statutory guidance. On
that basis, I hope that hon. Members will not press their
amendments.</div><a name="0807045000139"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000219"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> We have had a helpful debate, but for the sake
of clarity and <i class="I">Hansard</i>, I shall refer to the inelegance of
terminology that the Minister just used. Let me make it clear that his
oratory was overcome not by an ejaculation but by a sneeze. We do not
want the readers of <i class="I">Hansard</i> to get any odd ideas about what goes
on in Committee, do we? I know that his Welsh, fluent oratory can be
terribly exciting, but it is not quite that exciting.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div><a name="0807045000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has said that the drafting of the new clauses is flawed&#151;I would
hate to dupe the Committee into passing a measure that was
flawed&#151;but he perfectly appreciates the aim of the proposals.
Perhaps we need to revisit the measures so that they would have
practical effects. However, I am still slightly confused. The Minister
referred to the 2004 Act and the 1989 Act. Section 85 of the latter
states that the accommodating local authority that has been notified
should</div><a name="0807045000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;take
such steps as are reasonably practicable to enable them to determine
whether the child&#146;s welfare is adequately safeguarded and
promoted while he is accommodated by the accommodating
authority&#148;.</div>
<a name="0807045000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">That measure is not
quite as definitive and rigorous as the measure proposed by the hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and that proposed by me and my
hon. Friends. It is not clear from what the Minister said whether the
terminology that is already in place, which is aided and abetted by
this legislation and the regulations that will come with it, would give
some of the additional safeguards that looked-after status would
convey, such as the appointment of an IRO, the allocation of a social
worker and contact plan, and so on.</div>
<a name="0807045000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased
and grateful that the Minister has, in a spirit of positivity, said
that he will look again at the issues to try to create change to
achieve what he has acknowledged is our shared goal, but, clearly, the
Every Disabled Child Matters campaign thinks that there is still a
serious gap. It needs further assurances that those extra safeguards
will be available to those children without formally offering them
looked-after status. If the Minister could come back on Report and give
rather more substantial guarantees to that effect, all sides might be
satisfied, on the basis that there is a defect in the new
clauses.</div>
<a name="0807045000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">To go back to
the proposal of the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, if some
establishments decline to accept and accommodate some of those 300 or
so children unless they have looked-after status, there is a problem in
the system. Perhaps that is because the authorities do not understand
the system or that they come up against practical shortfalls in
providing the level of support that they rightly deem the children will
need if they are accommodated. In any case, they need to know and we
need to send out a clearer message. We might have the opportunity on
Report for further debate on the proposals, and the Minister will get
the opportunity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>to send out that clearer message. There is clearly some confusion among
various parties at the moment. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the motion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0807045000220"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0807045000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Very
briefly, the issue dealt with in new clause 11 was debated and taken up
in another place by my noble Friend Baroness Morris of Bolton, who was
supported by the noble Lord Ramsbotham. It would ensure that the chief
inspector considers the suitability of the accommodation not only in
terms of door sizes and facilities and so on, but whether it is
conducive to supporting the welfare and safety of a child. The new
clause would broaden the scope of what is taken into account in an
inspection of children&#146;s homes. As my noble Friend said in the
House of Lords, essentially the measure would place a duty on an
inspector to make inspections about more than just the number of beds
that a children&#146;s home provides and the average costs of meals
for children per day. There is a fear that the inspections are a bit of
a tick-box exercise in some cases. In an earlier debate, I mentioned
some of my experiences of children&#146;s homes in my constituency at
which, clearly, the level of care and supervision of the children was
woefully inadequate. In one case, an Ofsted inspection had said that
everything was okay with the physicality of the accommodation, but
everything was clearly not okay with the children&#146;s
welfare.</div>
