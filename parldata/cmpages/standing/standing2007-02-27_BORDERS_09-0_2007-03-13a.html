						<a name="07031344000330"></a>
							<b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): One purpose of the Bill is to
reduce the amount of illegal immigration into this country. To help put
that in context, how big a problem do you see illegal immigration as
being? Is it getting
worse?</div>
					<a name="07031344000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Andrew Green:
							</b>
						</i> It is a very substantial problem and a
continuing one. One Government estimate of illegals contained a central
estimate of 470,000, which was three or four years out of date when
published. We adjusted it to take account of a substantial number of
failed asylum seekers in the interim and came up with the somewhat
larger figure of 670,000 as a central estimate.</div>
					<a name="07031344000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key point is that the
problem will continue.Even if you deal with the existing
illegal immigrantsin whatever way&#151;I will come back to
that if I may&#151;other people will come to this country ready and
willing to work for a fiver an hour and send home what are substantial
amounts of money by their own standards. On that point, I should like
to pick up on some evidence that was offered to the Committee in an
earlier evidence session by the TGWU, which argued for a phased system
of legalising undocumented workers. It did not like the word
&#147;amnesty&#148;, perhaps because it was a little too close to
the truth.</div>
					<a name="07031344000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
strongly opposed to any such idea, for three very strong reasons.
First, it is wrong in principle to reward illegal behaviour. The
illegal immigrants to whom Mr. Damian Green referred are not
innocents abroad. They knowingly enter or remain in Britain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>illegally; they have been undercutting British workers, and they have
helped unscrupulous employers to compete with honest
employers.</div>
					<a name="07031344000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Secondly, an
amnesty, by whatever name, is extremely expensive for the taxpayer. The
Institute for Public Policy Research, which I think also gave evidence,
claimed in a paper dated March 2006 that making illegal immigrants
regular would &#147;net&#148;&#151;note that word&#151;the
Treasury around &#163;1 billion a year. Apart from being a shaky
calculation, it was not honest, as it deliberately took no account of
the extra cost to the Treasury of admitting 500,000 people to the
welfare system. Our calculation, which corrects that, suggests that the
additional cost to the Treasury would be &#163;500 million or
possibly &#163;1,000 million, although I recognise that those
calculations are very
general.</div>
					<a name="07031344000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
important point never mentioned is that if we legalise illegal
immigrants they immediately become entitled to social housing. They
also become entitled to bring over their relatives, which will move
them up the housing list. This brilliant idea would therefore add
500,000 to the housing list at a time when we have already given asylum
or exceptional leave to remain to more people than we have built social
housing for. Itis an extremely serious issue and I hope that
the Committee will bear it well in
mind.</div>
					<a name="07031344000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third reason
is that they will be replaced. It is elementary that we should examine
the experience of other countries. The Italians have given five
amnesties in the past 20 years. The Spanish have given six.On
virtually every occasion, there have been more applicants than at the
previous amnesty, for the obvious reason that the word gets out:
&#147;Get there, stick around for a while and you will be
legalised.&#148; As a reward for his illegal entry and working in
Britain, you are giving someone a meal ticket for life, free education,
free health and free housing, so why would they not come to Britain?
Let us look at Spain and what has happened to the territories in north
Africa and the islands of the Atlantic. They are overwhelmed with
illegal immigrants. The point is so clear that there can be only one
policy.</div>
					<a name="07031344000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am delighted
that the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality
announced two or three days ago a clear and firm policy that the only
way to go is to tighten up on illegal immigrants until it is no longer
worth their while to stay. I suggest that the Minister considers a free
exit policy. At the moment, if a person is arrested leaving the
country, having been illegal, there is a risk that he will be put in
jail at our expense for a year or so. I see no reason why we should not
at the appropriate time say, &#147;Okay, you can go. We won&#146;t
arrest you on your way out.&#148; A time limit might have to be put
on that, but it seems an entirely sensible way to
proceed.</div>

Green:
						</b> Clauses 28 to 35 of the Bill come
under the general heading &#147;Automatic deportation&#148;, a
phrase over which I and others have cast doubt. What is your assessment
of that? Do you think that the deportation procedures under the clauses
would be adequate for the purpose of getting rid of people who should
not be in this
country?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Andrew Green:

						</i> There will be no adequate means of
deportation until we look again at the European convention on human
rights. An immigration system is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>only as good as your ability to remove. The ECHR is a major obstacle.
The refugee convention is not. As you know, it contains a let-out for
serious offenders.The ECHR, particularly article 3 on torture
and the well-known Chahal case that internationalises it, is a serious
obstacle.</div>
					<a name="07031344000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
like to suggest some new thinking. Everybody in Britain is opposed to
torture. It is out of the question. Everyone is deeply reluctant to
send someone to a country where they might be tortured. That is common
ground. But we must recognise that the present situation is actually a
focus of attraction for people who have either committed a serious
offence or intend to; I am thinking particularly of
terrorism.</div>

notice&#151;and make a public statement to the effect that as from
that date of withdrawal anyone convicted of a terrorist offence in
Britain will be sent home with only a non-suspensive appeal. To anyone
who says that that is terrible, the answer is, &#147;You have brought
it on yourselves. You were warned. If you come to Britain and conduct
terrorist offences, you will be sent

Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Mr.
Liam Byrne):
						</b> I was very interested,Sir Andrew, in
what you were saying about illegal working in particular. Some of the
evidence that we heard in the initial evidence sessions concerned a
number of perspectives that echoed that. People felt that illegal
working was one of the principal drivers of illegal immigration.
Front-line immigration officers have said to me that when they come
across people, they very rarely find them accessing benefits but often
find them working illegally. I am interested in your perspective on how
significant illegal working is as a pull factor for illegal
immigrants.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Andrew Green:
							</b>
						</i>
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B"> </b>
						</i>I think that it is a very
important pull factor and also an incentive for people to stay on
illegally, which is another form of the same thing. There is no
question about its importance. I would also add that the ease of
getting away with it is another pull factor. The Bill addresses many of
the issues. It is an excellent Bill and we are very supportive of
it.</div>

							<a name="07031344000335"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I was struck by some of the evidence that was given
by National Car Parks, which is a business that takes its corporate
reputation very seriously. The Home Office is indebted to it because of
its pioneering work in developing different ways of identifying whether
people are here illegally or not.</div>
					<a name="07031344000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his evidence, the director
of risk management from National Car Parks called ID cards a very
significant step forward. From National Car Parks&#146; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>point of view, it found that understanding the validity of 50 or 60
different bits of paper proffered by wayof evidence was
expensive and not very reliable. An important part of the Bill is the
introduction of compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals to help prove
entitlement to work and public benefits. Do you think that that would
make any difference to some of these
issues?</div>
					<a name="07031344000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Andrew Green:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, it certainly would. We support
that. As you probably know, the guidance to employers at the moment
runs to 17 pages. It is really not reasonable to expect an employer to
look at a document and go through 17 pages of guidance.So,
yes, we believe that those ID cards will help substantially. Added to
that, I think that the real penalty has to be on the employer. There is
no point in trying to fine an illegal immigrant; he has not got any
money. I have lost count of the number of magistrates who have
expressed their concern on that point. A lot of people come before the
courts for various offences and there is nothing that can be done about
them. There is no room in the jails and they have no money to pay a
fine. If what this leads to is a lot of impoverished people in front of
the magistrates there is no point. If it leads to companies being fined
&#163;20,000 and company directors going to jail, then you are
getting serious, and it is high time we did, in my
view.</div>

only apply

						to people who commit offences that result in a
sentence of 12 months imprisonment, which leaves the prospect of
somebody committing repeated offences and receiving shorter sentences

someone can only get a sentence of six months imprisonment. Is that

some earlier discussion of this. That point needs to be looked at
seriously. At the moment the position would be as you describe. There
could be a whole series of offences and the guy is still here. That is
not amusing for the public. If you want to rebuild public confidence in
the immigration system, which certainly needs to be done, then that is
one aspect that needs attention. It would be helpful if in some way the
offences could be added together, so that on a second
offence&#151;certainly a third&#151;they would be removed
anyway.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Iain Wright</b> (Hartlepool) (Lab): Sir Andrew, I was
interested in what you were saying earlier, particularly in response to
the Minister&#146;s question. Last week I was reading a report from
the International Monetary Fund about the state of the UK economy. I
was particularly struck by one
bit:</div>
					<a name="07031344000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
prevent &#145;welfare tourism&#146;, the UK has restricted access
to social benefits for new A8 immigrants during the first year of
employment. That probably accounts for the fact that practically all
immigrants hold jobs and the percentage on welfare is much smaller than
that of the native
population.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031344000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
IMF obviously has robust analysis and interpretation. Do you think that
the Bill will tighten up a process that has already been recognised
internationally as
tight?</div>
					<a name="07031344000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Andrew Green:
							</b>
						</i> No, I do not. What you are referring to
was of course only for the A8 nationals. It was brought in at the last
minute basically to try and deter welfare shopping by eastern
Europeans, and has had some success in that. On the whole, we have not
had people coming here just for the benefits, but as people come up to
their 12 months on the register, they become qualified. Numbers are
already increasing. I have no objection to that; that is part of being
in Europe. However, I do not think that that, of itself, is enough to
deal with the wider question of welfare
shopping.</div>
					<a name="07031344000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
there is an even wider point there too.In our negotiations
with the European Union over enlargement, we&#151;not just us, but
Governments&#151;completely failed to see, first, the potentially
massive impact on migration from much poorer countries to richer ones
and, secondly, the wide scope for eventual benefit shopping. Looking
into the detail, we find that it will become extraordinarily easy for
people from poorer countries in Europe to go benefit shopping in other
countries, because measures brought in on the basis of free movement of
labour have the effect that, once in the other country, people can
claim benefits on a much higher level than in their own country. One
quick example is child benefit, which eastern Europeans can already
claim. They claim at British rates, which is about five times what is
needed in Poland. That is just a small
example.</div>

							<a name="07031344000341"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> On a slightly broader point, the IMF and recent
PricewaterhouseCoopers reports seem to suggest that the UK economy has
grown because of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>migrants coming in&#151;relatively highly skilled young men, plugging
domestic skills shortages. As a result, there is a higher tax receipt
and the UK economy is growing more than it normally would. Does not the
Bill tighten the illegal aspects of working in a positive manner, so
that people who want to and are allowed to come here are much more
controlled, so to speak? The tighter control regime is to the benefit
of everybody&#151;indigenous and migrant&#151;because the migrants
have positive reassurance that they can be here. Do you accept
that?</div>
					<a name="07031344000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Andrew Green:
							</b>
						</i> There are two halves to that question,
and I accept the second half but not the first. You said that migration
is adding to economic growth, and that is undeniable. However, it is
also adding to population. The normal measure of wealth is GDP per
head. If you do the calculation that we have done, you will find that
the addition to population is prettywell the same as the
addition to production andthe resulting benefit to GDP per
head, as the Government&#146;s figures show, is less than a Mars bar
a month. As far as eastern Europeans are concerned, at least in part,
that is because they are low-paid and they go into low-paid
jobs.</div>
					<a name="07031344000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as a
general proposition, if you look back over the years you will see that
Government estimates of the addition to both production and growth,
both of which have been quoted in the House of Commons, show very
little per head. One gives 4p a week and the other 14p a week. Work in
the United States, Canada and Holland points to a slightly higher
figure&#151;about 0.1 per cent. of GDP, which is about 40p. We are
talking about very small sums, in so far as such things can be
measured. However, I accept that a lot of things cannot be measured in
terms of easing particular gaps or on matters such as diversity and new
ideas. I do not suggest that everything in this world can be measured,
or that money is everything, but I am saying thatthe
Government&#146;s case for large-scale immigration is absolute
nonsense. That case does not
exist.</div>
					<a name="07031344000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Your second
point concerned the value of tightening up on illegals. I certainly
agree with that; there are many positive aspects to it. One of them is
that if employers have to train more British indigenous workers, that
is a very good thing, and they should not be allowed to dip out of it
by employing illegals.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con):
						Sir Andrew,
first I should like to commend your organisation for adding to the
debate in an intelligent and rational way, although you would not take
that view if you had heard the TGWU last week. There has been debate in
this Committee over the past few weeks about the suggestion that this
measure is a legislative sledgehammer to crack an administrative nut.
Isnot the key issue the unreliability or
unavailabilityof accurate data about immigration under this
Government, and possibly under former Governments? Do you believe that
that can be corrected, for instance by a more robust collection of
statistics or even&#151;dare I invite you to comment on
this?&#151;by a border agency such as that which this Committee has
discussed? How can we rectify the situation so that we know what
numbers we are talking about and can make intelligent policy decisions
based on those data?</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>
					<a name="07031344000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir Andrew
Green:
							</b>
						</i> That is a good question. The first thing that
I would say is that I do not believe that you are dealing with an
administrative nut; you are dealing with a major issue about which
there is extremely widespread concern among the public. As you probably
know, 75 per cent. of the population would like an annual limit to
immigration. That is just one measure, but every poll will tell you
that and every poll will tell you that 80 per cent. have no confidence
in the present system, so it is not an administrative nut.</div>
					<a name="07031344000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, is this the right way
to get a better idea of what is going on? It might be the only way. Its
purpose is to provide a means of counting people in and counting people
out as individuals. I have justbeen to the United States, New
Zealand, Australia and Singapore. In all those countries, I was both
counted in and counted out as Sir A. Green. It is perfectly possible to
do that. That is what the measures are aiming at. Once we have that, we
will have a number of other things. We will have a much more accurate
idea of numbers, which is becoming important. Immigration is now so
high that it is very important to know what it is, how tight the labour
market is and what to do about interest rates, as the Governor of the
Bank of England has said
repeatedly.</div>
					<a name="07031344000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if we
go down that road, and I sincerely hope that we will, I should like to
draw your attention to a potential weakness that could blow the whole
system out of the water. I hope that the Government are conscious of
it. The pressure on visa-issuing posts is so great that they get their
brownie points for dealing with the queue. I noticed that when the
Minister gave evidence he referred to Pakistan and the speed at which
it had dealt with its queues. That may be brilliant or it may not. It
may be that they were just dishing out visas. As you know, on average
issuers have something like11 minutes to
decide.</div>
					<a name="07031344000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Related to
that is an important second point, which is that decisions whether to
issue bright new issues are not legal decisions. They are matters of
judgment by the entry clearance officer as to whether the person
standing in front of him will go home at the end of it. If that goes
wrong, the whole system is futile. People simply come in with visas
that they should never have had in the first place. We will be helped
by the fact that this system will tell us that they have overstayed. At
the moment there is absolutely no effective feedback. We will know that
they have overstayed, but how are you going to find them and remove
them? We have half a million whom we cannot remove now and we are
making no impression on that half a million.</div>
					<a name="07031344000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We issue 2 million visas a year
and refuse half a million. You do not have to be very far wrong with
those issues to build up a very large illegal community in Britain, so
what I come back to is the care with which those visas are issued in
the first place. In my view, it is going wrong. The balance is going
wrong. The pressures are too great and we are moving towards a kind of
computerised tick-the-box system that is extremely easy to fool. If
applicants stand in front of a visa officer he will know, for example,
if a person comes from a good family, if his father has a big business
or whatever. Any of you who have stood in a visa section&#151;I have
stood in a lot of them&#151;will know what the pressures are and how
you rely on the instincts of the entry clearance officer and the
support of his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>local staff. We are moving away from that. We have these systems whereby
you apply to some agency somewhere downtown. That is a serious weakness
and actually also extremely inconvenient to the applicant, because they
cannot get at the man who is taking the decision. I will not go on
about it, Mr. Illsley, but I want to underline the fact that
your entire effort will be wasted if the Government do not re-examine
the matter.</div>
					<a name="07031344000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
delicate issue that I wish to mention is that we should not send
immigration officers or ECOs of dual heritage to the country of their
other heritage. That leaves them much too vulnerable to pressures
offamily, friends and so on. I am not saying that they
would&#151;well, I am saying what I am saying. They are just too
vulnerable. By all means send them to a different country, but not to
their own other country. That is foolishness, and it is happening on a
significant
scale.</div>

clearly a serious administrative failure in even considering these
people for deportation, and that was obviously a Home Office problem,
but I think that the essential problem comes back to the state of the
law. That in turn comes back to the ECHR, which I mentioned, and
article 3. We must find a way around that. At the moment, the
Government are supporting a Dutch case before the ECHR that they hope
will ease it up. I think that it is to be considered in the summer.
Maybe that is the way forward. Of course, it would be the convenient
way forward, if there is enough progress on that case, but if there is
not, we have to think again. We cannot be in the situation that I

link between illegal entry and organised crime. I am sure that you are
aware that estimates suggest strongly that around75 per cent.
of illegal entrances are facilitated. Our approach to tackling that

measures. We think that they are useful. Secondly, the people doing
such things are highly sophisticated, as you well know. As soon as one
measure is taken, they will seek to find a way around it. One has to
stay on the case. The introduction of the Serious Organised Crime
Agency was a major and helpful step, as was the tightening of the law
that you described. I think that heavy penalties on employers will also
help as we tighten up the situation generally. I am sure you know 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>

of employers in the past five years. That is bound to encourage illegal

children. We do not say much about it, because we think that with net
foreign immigration at 300,000, that is where the focus of attention
should be, but in terms of justice, we should take firmer measures to
discourage the use of children for that purpose. The firmest measure
would be to send them home, but you could do that only if you could
make satisfactory arrangements in their home countries. At present, it
would almost be cheaper to send them all to Eton&#151;not quite, but
very nearly. They are costing &#163;20,000 a throw.</div>

						</b> May I return to the judgment of entry clearance
officers and the granting of visas? What you have told us today about
the granting of visas certainly fits in with what I have been told on
visits to posts overseas with the Home Affairs Committee about the
importance of the judgment of the person on the spot who is making the
decision about granting the visa&#151;their local knowledge, their
experience, all the things we rely on them for. Clause 19 appears to be
allowing evidence to be given to challenge the exercise of that
judgment in front of a tribunal in this country as opposed to at post.
That is my understanding of it&#151;it will allow evidence to be
given to an appeal tribunal against the exercise of the discretion at
the post overseas. How importantly do you think we should value the
exercise of that discretion, using as it does the judgment of
individual immigration officers, based upon their experience, their
knowledge and their

I think appeals against that judgment should not be allowed. It is

						foreigner applying to come to Britain does not have
any particular right to come here and if they get refused, they get
refused. I am sure that there is no other country that bends over quite
so far backwards in order to provide rights of appeal to those who are
refused. I think we should minimise the scale of appeals and not
provide any more access for it. The wretched Home Office is overwhelmed
by numbers as it is. The number of appeals for family visitors has
doubled every year since the costs were removed; it is now possible to
appeal for free. We now have a thousand appeals a week. It is costing
the taxpayer&#163;1 million a week. What is
more&#151;I&#146;m afraid you have got me started&#151;it is not
just mum and dad. For families of the size we are talking about, the
number who qualify is of the order of somewhere between60 and
100, and they can all appeal. What is more, they can appeal even if the
main purpose of their visit is not to visit their relatives. This whole
business of appeals against refusal of visas is getting out of hand and
I hope that when the Government have time, and courage, they will take
an axe to it.</div>

five years, for settlement. Ninety-five per cent. of thosewho
have applied for settlement have been granted it. So it has been a
major source of immigration and unfortunately it has coincided with the
weakening, not to say collapse, of our border controls. So, at the same

						</i> There is no question about that. In fact, at
present one in three new households is a result of immigration. That is
on the Government&#146;s forecast of immigration, of 145,000. The
actual rate is already much higher than that. So, yes, to the extent
that someone comes here on a work permit and benefits the employer,
that is one thing. But there is also a sense in which the taxpayer is
picking up the cost of everything else&#151;schools, roads, hospitals
and transport&#151;and to an extent the convenience of the indigenous
population is being affected in the years that it would take to put in
that extra infrastructure. So, it would be quite wrong to have an
immigration policy driven by employers, and that is what we have been
moving towards.</div>
					<a name="07031344000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until
1995, roughly, we issued 40,000 work permits a year. That was deemed to
be enough. Now, suddenly, there is this huge demand for more, and the
reason, of course, is that it is very convenient for the employers. You
take a skilled man off the shelf and you do not have to train a Brit.
Furthermore, a Brit might move to another company, whereas a foreigner
is less likely to. So, to the extent that you bring in skills from
overseas, you are reducing the incentive for employers to train their
own British employees and that is clearly what is happening.</div>
					<a name="07031344000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would say two things about
the points system. The first is that it does not change very much, if
you look at it in detail. The other is that, if you set out the number
of points required and how many points you get for x, y and z, it is
not terribly difficult to construct the application in order to get the
points that you need, if necessary by forging documents&#151;and in
most countries you can forge whatever document you like. Then, if you
add to that a whole right of appeal, which I think may be
envisaged&#151;it is not clear from the Bill, but the implication of
the Bill is that it is envisaged&#151;you are making another rod for
the Home Office&#146;s back. The bottom line is that if someone does
not get a work permit, they do not get a work permit. It seems to me
that to have a whole range of appeals is something that needs to be
closely examined.</div>

fewer than 30,000 a year. So, it is only one in 10 of net foreign
migration. That is, in part, why we are not talking about asylum at
present. We think that the real issues are about immigration. I also
think that the Government deserve some credit; they have got those
asylum numbers down. It would be nice if the numbers went even further
down&#151;in terms of false claims, that
is.</div>

There is a difference between local staff and entry control officers.
The local staff are invaluable. They often provide the interpretation,
the local knowledge and so on, but the decision is taken by the entry
control officer, who is UK-based. Actually, we always have some
problems with local staff in terms of corruption, and in both the posts
that I headed I hadto sack people. It is very hard to detect
corruption by local staff, but when you do you have to sack

because you have made the point already that, at the moment, the system

that you thought that the provisions in the Bill were excellent.
Indeed, Conservative Members do not oppose the extra powers. Given the
work that you have done internationally, looking at how other countries
control their borders more effectively, what extra powers would be
useful? As you know, we have proposed an integrated border force,
bringing together the various fragmented bodies currently responsible
for such matters. We have proposed that because it is what countries
with better control over their borders seem to have. From your

						</i>I will bring in a
slightly different aspect of my experience, which is that the
Administrations of different countries are very different from each
other. On the particular point that you raise, I would say two things.
The Home Office is now engaged in a massive and, I think, courageous
exercise to try to get a grip on our borders. The last thing that it
should do at this juncture is have a reorganisation of that kind.
Bureaucracies are not Meccano&#151;they are plants and you cannot
pick them up, cut them to pieces and put them together again. They
depend heavily on each person knowing what other people are responsible
for and, no less importantly, knowing who is any good. If you want to
get something done, you have to know the ground.</div>
					<a name="07031344000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">At some time in the future,
there might be some benefit from a reorganisation, but British
organisations are quite good at informally working with each other.
Personally, I would leave it at that at this administrative juncture,
without ruling out, at some future date, once we have got a hold on it,
some changes in the direction that you suggest. I certainly would not
do it
now.</div>

important. We need knowledge of who is still here&#151;and we might
get a nasty shock when this comes into play&#151;and the ability to
remove those who should not be here. Already we think that there are
500,000, but we could find far more. In terms of priorities, that is

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000374"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> The clause forms an important part of the legal
machinery of clauses that we have assembled under this heading. Its
purpose is to provide some disincentives for those foreign nationals
who might choose to try not to comply with the regulation that we put
in place requiring them to apply for a biometric immigration document.
We have sought to put a number of sanctions in place&#151;in
particular, toprovide the Secretary of State with three powers
to disincentivise non-compliance.</div>
					<a name="07031344000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, there is a civil penalty
regime, which subsequent clauses will set out. Secondly, there is the
power to curtail leave, and thirdly, there is the power to vary it. The
Secretary of State would, of course, have the discretion to decide
which sanction it was most appropriate to apply in any particular case.
The intention would be to set out the modus operandi for that judgment
to be exercised in a code of practice, but we do not want the Secretary
of State to be able to pile up these sanctions, one on top of the
other, but to choose between
them.</div>
					<a name="07031344000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">An argument that
was rehearsed during the debate on ID cards was about the
appropriateness of sanctions to disincentivise behaviour that we wanted
to discourage. There were questions about whether people from different
backgrounds or those who found themselves in different circumstances
might not be able to acquire a biometric immigration document, through
no fault of their own, and I want to make a couple of points on that
subject.</div>
					<a name="07031344000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, there
are substantial incentives for foreign nationals to
apply for biometric immigration documents; it is not something that
people would recoil from, because biometric documents will make the
lives of foreign nationals easier. During the latter part of last year,
when I was going round the country holding round tables with local
business and public services, I was struck by the fact that some
businesses said that they were not interested in employing foreign
students, for example, because they did not want to take the risk that
they were here illegally.</div>
					<a name="07031344000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an earlier evidence session,
National Car Parks mentioned that the transaction burden acted as a
disincentive for the company to hire foreign students. Biometric
immigration documents will put the minds of many people in the business
community at ease, as it will make it easier for foreign nationals to
prove their entitlement to be here and their right to
work.</div>
					<a name="07031344000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, people
who are asked to apply for biometric immigration documents will often
already have applied for leave to remain and have been through an
application process. Some foreign nationals, such as asylum seekers who
have come through the asylum process, will already have deposited their
biometric and biographical information with the immigration
service.
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>In doing so they will have acquired an application registration card,
which is used to manage and monitor the issuing of
benefits to those who apply for asylum. Clause 5(3)(d) provides for
biometric and biographical information to be rolled over into an
application for a biometric immigration
document.</div>
					<a name="07031344000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can give
the Committee several reassurances in respect of imposing too onerous a
burden on certain categories of foreign nationals. It will be a fairly
straightforward process and it is important that as part of the legal
machinery the Secretary of State has the ability to apply civil
penalties, to curtail or to vary leave, to disregard an application,
and to refuse an application for a biometric immigration
document.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000375"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> It is worth pausing for a second on the clause. As
I have argued in previous debates, the immigration system must be
robust, but it must also be fair, and seen to be fair, because public
confidence will be restored only if it is both robust and
fair.</div>
					<a name="07031344000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will be aware that people are worried that the clause might be used to
violate the protections offered by various international conventions to
which the Government remain signed up. As we heard in the evidence
session, some people believe that we should pull out of the European
convention on human rights. I am not conscious that that is yet
Government policy, although it is a fast-moving area, but there are
genuine concerns out there that the wide powers that the clause gives
to the Secretary of State might be used to violate people&#146;s

Rowen:
						</b> Having last week discussed biometric data, we move
on to the use to which they can be put and their retention. Amendment
No. 81 would alter subsection (2), which is broad and gives the
Secretary of State sweeping powers to use information for absolutely
anything. Specifically, it states clearly that information may be used
for a purpose that does not relate to immigration. Since this is the UK
Borders Bill and the Committee is principally concerned with securing
our borders, we feel that that notion is far too broad.</div>
					<a name="07031344000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is intended to
get the Minister to be a little more specific. We suggest that
information be used in connection with immigration and
nationality&#151;that is what the Bill is about&#151;and in
connection with any issue to do with terrorism, on which there is
clearly a need to share information. We do not want to do anything that
would tie the hands of the security services. In fact, we hope that one
of the consequences of the Bill will be greater co-operation. We also
include money laundering, because if there is drug or human trafficking
going on we want it to be possible for information to be shared. Later
amendments would also deal with that. We seek to be helpful and
specific by saying what information should be used for instead of
having the broad catch-all notion in the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07031344000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is a probing amendment so that we can hear from the Minister what his
intentions are. Having heard the concerns expressed in our evidence
sessions, we need to ensure that the information collected is used for
the right purposes. It is good practice for bureaucracies to be clear
about why they are collecting information and what it is used
for.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000379"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I shall speak to the amendments in my name,
amendments Nos. 23 and 62. Broadly speaking, they are intended to
achieve ends similar to those of amendment. No. 81, which the hon.
Member for Rochdale has just moved. We too have worries about the wide
powers that regulations could give to Ministers, permitting the use of
information for specified purposes that are not related to immigration.
The clause is extremely open-ended and will entitle the Government to
use information for any purpose they wish.</div>
					<a name="07031344000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of amendment No. 23
is to stop fishing expeditions. With the Government seeking to
introduce an era in which more and more pieces of personal data are
held on more and more databases, the dangers of such expeditions become
ever greater. We therefore seek to limit the use of the power to
circumstances that are already enshrined in legislation and have been
discussed, at least in some form, by Parliament. The amendment would
limit the scope of information to purposes that are set out in statute
by another enactment, so the open-ended fishing expedition would not be
a possibility.</div>
					<a name="07031344000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have not had any explanation from Ministers&#151;perhaps we will in a
few minutes&#151;of the purposes for which the Government would
collect and use the information. As the hon. Member for Rochdale said,
it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>is possible to envisage circumstances in which such information would be
useful to law enforcement agencies. I am not saying that it would not
be useful; clearly that would be wrong, but we believe that Parliament
should be told of the purposes for which the information may be used.
There is already adequate scope in existing legislation, under which
Parliament has considered what is reasonable in this area.</div>
					<a name="07031344000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 62 is similar to
amendment No. 81. It provides a list. The Government should have good
reason to use for any other purposes data that are gathered for
immigration purposes. The amendment lists activities that are dealt
with by SOCA, which the Government have already decided are
particularly serious and which would cause little controversy between
hon. Members on Opposition and Government Benches. The amendment would
help the Government to reassure the public that the Bill is not about
giving the Government a free ride in collecting data and using them as
they wish, but that they would use them in only the most serious
circumstances where there is a clear public benefit from doing
so.</div>
					<a name="07031344000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would help the
Minister&#146;s case to accept the amendments; he would have wide
support for the use of the powers created for the immigration system to
stop international, serious, organised crime. He will have much less
support if there is public suspicion that he or any of successors will
be able to use the powers for an as yet unspecified purpose, of which
many members of the public might not approve. The amendments would
strengthen the Bill by providing a degree of public reassurance that it
is not there at the moment, because the clause is so
open-ended.</div>
					
					<a name="07031344000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000380"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> These are helpful amendments, because they have
given me pause for thought and deliberation. I shall start by
clarifying the scope and orbit of the clause. It is not about the
transfer of the information concerned to other parts of Government or
other parts of public service. Parliament has already spoken on that
matter, specifically in section 21 of the Immigration and Asylum Act
1999, which quite properly put in place a rigorous gateway through
which the Home Office would have to go to share information with
others. That could be done only in line with obligations already on the
Secretary of State set out under the Human Rights Act 1998, the Data
Protection Act 1998 and other
legislation.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07031344000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07031344000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The subject of
the clause is how the Home Secretary can share the information with
other parts of his business, as it were. How can we ensure that that is
not being done inappropriately? Amendment No. 23 would curtail the
movement of information to the purposes set out in another enactment.
Amendments Nos. 62 and 81 would constrain the use of the information
for non-immigration purposes. A helpful starter for 10 has been
listed.</div>
					<a name="07031344000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said last
week that the purpose of the Bill was not to give unfettered power to
the Secretary of State. I know that there are some days when that seems
desirable, but in the round it is not. It is important to underline the
fact that, even if that were the ambition, it would be a forlorn
ambition, because the Secretary of State does not have unfettered power
to share 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>information even with other parts of his own operations. The Human
Rights Act and the Data Protection Act already provide for certain
constraints.</div>
					<a name="07031344000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
the fact that those constraints are in place, there is a case to be
explored for whether further constraint is merited. The amendment has
prompted me to begin that exploration. We have to think carefully
through a number of issues, the first of which is that amendment No. 23
suggests that the sharing and use of the information be curtailed to a
purpose set out in another enactment. That is a valuable place at which
to start, but a couple of issues warrant slightly further exploration.
Some of the Home Secretary&#146;s powers are exercised under royal
prerogative, not under &#147;another enactment&#148;. A good
example is the fact that the Secretary of State issues British
passports under prerogative to several different types of nationality,
including British overseas territories citizenship, British national
overseas, British subject and British protected persons. It is possible
to envisage a situation in the future when the Home Secretary would
want to check biometric information that had been filed as part of a
biometric immigration document application, as part of the process of
reviewing someone&#146;s application for one of those three or four
different categories of passport. That would not be possible under the
amendment, because it is a power exercised under royal prerogative, and
issuing a passport is not in the strict legal sense an immigration
function.</div>
					<a name="07031344000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
issue that needs teasing out is that the phrase &#147;another
enactment&#148; may exclude the use of the information under clauses
1 to 4. Given that the phrase used is &#147;another
enactment&#148;, it may be that under a strict legal definition, it
is not possible for the application to be rendered to the Bill. That
would need to be teased through with
lawyers.</div>
					<a name="07031344000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
issue that warrants a little exploration is particularly relevant to
amendment No. 62. The proposed list does not mention nationality, but
it is possible to envisage a situation in which we want to make use of
biometric immigration that has beenfiled as part of a
biometric immigration document application during the naturalisation
process. We might want to validate the individual who is applying for
naturalisation and use biometric information that has already been
filed and checked.</div>
					<a name="07031344000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fourth issue that needs a little more explanation&#151;I hope the
Committee will agree&#151;is in the list of applications, which has
been helpfully set out in the spirit of probing our ambitions. The list
does not refer to prevention of crime. Immigration
officershave a number of criminal investigation powers. They
might, for example, investigate crimes of forgery, bigamy, theft and
perjury. With such criminal investigation powers come associated powers
of arrest, search and investigation. It is quite possible that an
immigration officer would seek to use biometric information that has
been captured as part of the application process for the biometric
immigration document. One can particularly imagine that such a facility
might be useful where forgery offences were being
investigated.</div>
					<a name="07031344000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are therefore extremely helpful, as there is a real case for
us to explore how the Bill should be more specific about the limits on
the Secretary of State&#146;s power to deploy the information in
other parts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>of his business. With those words on the record, I hope that the hon.
Member for Rochdale will not seek to press the amendment. These have
been helpful probing amendments that have certainly started the process
of deliberation in my office. Where and if appropriate, I think that we
will need to table an amendment of our own to achieve the ambitions
that hon. Members rightly
have.</div>

					<a name="07031344000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 4
and my amendment No. 63 and consequential amendment No. 64 seek to do
similar things in proposing to alter the maximum level offine.
The Minister had kind words to say about the helpfulness of the
previous amendments on clause 8. Amendment No. 63 is also designed to
make the Bill more flexible. If the Government&#146;s current
proposal stood, the Secretary of State would constantly have to review
the appropriateness or otherwise of the &#163;1,000 fine in this area
and with regard to this legislation. Immigration Bills, like buses,
come along regularly under this Government, but we cannot always assume
that that will be the case. The inflexibility of a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>straightforward fine seems to us less sensible than simply putting the
maximum fine on level 3 of the standard scale, which would also have
the small but significant benefit of bringing the penalties in the Bill
into line with other offences and legislation where the standard scale
is used. As I said, amendment No. 63 is designed to help the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07031344000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 64 would remove reference to the Secretary of State&#146;s
decision in relation to appeals held in court. Since amendment No. 66
has not been selected, the amendment sits slightly oddly on its own,
but I am sure that we will be able to return to it, perhaps in a debate
on clause 10.</div>
					<a name="07031344000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the Minister will take amendment No. 63 in the intended spirit,
which is to make the Bill more flexible and possibly in some small way
reduce the burden of future legislation that the House has to
pass.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000388"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I support the comments of the hon. Member for
Ashford. I believe that it is important to future-proof with some
flexibility. The amendment standing in my name proposes quite a small
addition to that flexibility. It seeks merely to increase from 14 days
to 28 the period in which someone must pay a fine. If we are going to
increase the maximum fine to take account of the severity of the
offence, a small increase in the length of time in which people have to
pay the penalty is quite in order.</div>
					
					<a name="07031344000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000389"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I always look extremely sympathetically on
amendments that seek to unfetter the Secretary of State or lift the cap
on the powers that we are seeking. As a result, I look very
sympathetically on proposals that seek to increase the civil penalty
cap from &#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000, while the effect of subsequent
amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Ashford would be to
replace the &#163;1,000 cap with a level 3 fine. I was grateful for
his clarification of amendment No. 64. I agreed that the effect of that
amendment sat oddly here; as it is drafted, and in the context in which
it is put, the court would not have to hear an appeal against an
objection notice. It appears to seek to remove appeal rights if the
Secretary of State has changed his or her decision in the face of an
objection. That is one interpretation of how the amendment can be read,
but it is a bit unclear and now I understand why, thanks to his helpful
clarification. Amendment No. 83, however, would ensure that payment
could not be sought until after 28 days had passed. I was not quite
sure whether that was the purpose of the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07031344000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to reassure the
Committee on four points. We seek to designate biometric immigration
documents once the national identity system is up and running. We are
trying to align the civil penalty regime with the penalty regime that
was proposed and passed by Parliament under the Identity Cards Act
2006. We did not want a separate scheme in which there would be one
kind of civil penalty for non-compliance under the 2006 Act and another
that would kick in under the Bill&#146;s biometric immigration
document provisions. We therefore wanted to provide a civil penalty
regime that was aligned with that
approach.</div>
					<a name="07031344000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We set the
fine at &#163;1,000 because we thought that that was sufficient. We
looked quite closely at whether a greater level of fine was wise. The
reassurance that I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>
						would give is that that fine is not the only
sanction that is available to the Secretary of State. There are a
number of other sanctions, which for foreign nationals may be much more
significant. For example, the power to curtail leave, vary leave and
refuse an application are important sanctions that can be invoked if
the &#163;1,000 penalty is not thought
sufficient.</div>
					<a name="07031344000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reference to level 3 would introduce a degree of legal complexity into
the equation. Level 3 works on a points scale in the criminal offences
regime, but we are seeking to put in place a civil penalty regime. A
degree of legal confusion might therefore arise, and we do not think
that a criminal offences regime would necessarily include the right set
of sanctions. We think that the civil penalty regime is the right
approach.</div>

noon</div>
					<a name="07031344000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the
thrust of the remarks of the hon. Member for Ashford, I detected that
his ambition is that the Secretary of State should not have to come
back to the House constantly to update the civil penalty regime and the
level of fines in place. The important reassurance is that under clause
9(6), the Secretary of State is empowered to make
amendments</div>
					<a name="07031344000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to reflect a
change in the value of
money.&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000390"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I take the point about clause 6, although that
provision reflects only a change in the value of money and not other
circumstances such as the relative level of offences. However, I am
puzzled why the Minister says that civil penalties are more appropriate
than criminal ones. Anyone who falls under the provisions of the clause
will think that they have committed a crime&#151;it is a statute
enacted by Parliament and enforced by the authorities. That sounds much
more like a criminal offence than something for civil legal procedures.
I am puzzled why he thinks that the latter is more
appropriate.</div>
					
					<a name="07031344000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000391"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I would not rest my case on that point. It is just
a point to note that we are seeking to put in place a civil penalty
regime in which civil financial penalties, rather than fines, are
incurred. A reference to a fairly well established regime of sanctions
set out in criminal law might be a source of confusion. However, as I
said, I do not want to overstate the significance of that point. The
nub of my argument is that if we accepted the amendments, we would
introduce a degree of dissonance between the civil penalty regime under
the 2006 Act and that under this Bill, which would be unhelpful,
particularly once the cards are designated.</div>
					<a name="07031344000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second key point is that we
think that the sanctions provided for are sufficient because the Home
Secretary has recourse to others should people persist with
non-compliance. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Ashford
about changes in the scale of seriousness, but the key points are
whether we can adjust the level of the civil penalty in line with
changes in the value of money and whether other sanctions are available
if people persist with non-compliance&#151;yes, those are available.
That is what will be effective in driving
compliance.</div>
					<a name="07031344000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">

is the bottom line in the debate on the amendments before us. How do we

Green:
						</b> The Minister commented that there appears to have
been an outbreak of consensus. I am happy to report that it is now at
an end. We have serious objections to clause 10, which provides for the
Secretary of State to consider appeals against penalties for failing to
comply with the regulations that relate to biometric immigration
documents. We do not believe that it should stand part of the Bill
because we do not think that it is a sensible place in which to give
the Secretary of State such quasi-judicial powers.</div>
					<a name="07031344000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume that in a peculiar
way, which the Minister did not get round to explaining, the penalties
are decided on a civil rather than a criminal scale. However, even
after his explanation, I am still confused as to why the creation of
what, by any standards, is a criminal offence should be regarded in any
way as a civil matter. I can only assume that the provision in the
clause to allow someone to object to a penalty measure is in some way
based on the view that it is a civil matter between the Home Secretary
and the citizen. That does not seem to reflect the reality of the
situation. The person involved will assume that the authority of the
state is bearing down on him and that if he has committed an offence
that constitutes a crime by any normal standards, it is right and
proper that his appeal against the penalty for having committed that
crime should be considered by the courts. We can argue about the level
of the fine, but the matter will clearly be serious enough for people
to expect some kind of independent hearing in the courts, or a
quasi-judicial procedure, and not simply to be referred back to the
Executive, which would then be acting as judge and jury.</div>
					<a name="07031344000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">As was the case for one of the
previous groups of amendments, about which the Minister spoke
relatively kindly, we think that it would help if the Government were
to take the clause away and rethink it. One of the things that we have
discussed in the debates on this Bill has been the level of public
confidence. I am sure that public confidence would be improved if there
were provisions for proper judicial hearing and redress, rather than
decisions made by a single Government Department not only on the
introduction and workings 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>of the Bill but on offences committed, penalties imposed and appeals
against such penalties.</div>
					
					<a name="07031344000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause oversteps the
mark&#151;it creates the wrong balance between the Executive and
citizen. The Minister would do well not just to think about it again
and to promise to come back later, but to withdraw the clause because
it imposes unnecessary penalties on citizens and an unfair system of
redress in relation to them.</div>
					
					<a name="07031344000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000394"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> The Committee has just agreed that clause 9 should
stand part of the Bill. The effect of that decision is that if the Bill
completes its journey into statute, the Secretary of State will have
the power to issue civil penalty notices to individuals who do not
comply with it. As I said, the reason for proposing a civil penalty
regime rather than a criminal offence is to ensure a degree of
consistency between the Bill and the system of sanctions established in
the Identity Cards Act 2006 and approved by Parliament. We would run
into serious difficulties once the ID cards of foreign nationals had
been designated as ID cards if we had a civil regime for ID cards and a
criminal regime for biometric immigration documents. Given that clause
9 will now stand part of the Bill and that the Committee is suggesting
that the Secretary of State should be equipped with the power to issue
civil penalty notices, it would be problematic if the Committee did not
provide for individuals to be able to object to the Secretary of
State&#146;s handing out civil penalty
notices.</div>
					<a name="07031344000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
10&#146;s provisions are quite straightforward. They will ensure that
once the civil penalty regime is up and running, it runs fairly. We
want to ensure that disputes between foreign nationals and the
Secretary of State can be resolved at minimal cost. The clause will not
eliminate any right of appeal. It is designed to act in accordance with
existing schemes provided for under the Identity Cards Act. The point
that I want to underline is that the offence of non-compliance with the
provisions in the Bill will not be a criminal offence but a civil
offence.</div>
					<a name="07031344000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
suggesting a civil penalty regime because that is how we think
compliance can best be secured. A system of criminal offences would be
slower&#151;justice would be less swift&#151;and less effective.
Having provided for a civil penalty regime, it would be a bit strange
for the Committee, and indeed for the House, to remove protections that
have long been available in this country and abroad to citizens who
disagree with the penalties handed out by the Secretary of State. It is
absolutely essential that individuals should be able to object to
decisions made by the Secretary of State, backed by the right of appeal
if they choose to take the matter to that territory. I commend the
clause to the Committee, as it is an essential protection and a
consequence of clause
9.</div>

Green:
						</b> Amendment No. 65 would add to clause 13 the
requirement for the Government to publish the code of practice at least
six months before the commencement of the provisions. The amendment
relates to a recurrent debate about how much consultation is
appropriate for such legislation. There is one area of consensus. We
have established that we want the system to be robust and fair. We want
tostart the long, difficult process of restoring public
confidence in a system in which, as we have heard this morning, there
is little public confidence. Sir Andrew Green said that, broadly
speaking, 80 per cent. of people think that the system is not working.
I have heard the large amount of evidence given to this Committee and
it is clear that the lack of confidence in the system goes both ways
and comes from both sides of the argument: it comes from those who
think that there is, broadly speaking, too much immigration into this
country and from those who that think that the current system makes it
too difficult for certain groups of people. Neither party has
confidence in the current system, so it is in the Minister&#146;s
interest to try to engage them as much as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07031344000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
code that was properly discussed before the provisions came into
effect would offer not just guidance to those involved, but a degree of
reassurance and protection to those on the other side of the counter
who were going through the process. Apart from the advantage that that
would have in the outside world, laying the draft measures before
Parliament and, therefore, before the public would make the Government
more accountable for their actions. Although that may, in the short
term, be mildly uncomfortable for Ministers, I am sure that the
Minister would agree that it would be better to have a rocky
consultation period than for enacted legislation to
fall apart on the job. Governments of all parties have seen that happen
at various stages.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>
					<a name="07031344000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is good
practice, which sensible Ministers should get into especially in
difficult and publicly sensitive areas, to consult more and do more in
respect of publishing codes and guidelines before the operation of
specific pieces of legislation commences. Amendment No. 65 seeks to do
that and I commend it to the Minister in that spirit. However, if he
does not accept it, as I suspect that he will not, and something goes
wrong, he cannot say that he was not
warned.</div>

							<a name="07031344000412"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> We have just agreed that wholesale powers should be
given to the Home Secretary to impose penalties for non-compliance with
clauses in the Bill. I do not have a problem with that, because the
Bill has a particular purpose and job. However, it is important that a
code of practice is subject to consultation and also approved by the
House. My amendment seeks to pursue the affirmative process, so that
the penalties are subject to public consultation before they come into
operation and are approved by the House. Without that surety, as has
been said earlier, the immigration system comes into disrepute.
Concerns about the system have been raised. The Bill helps us on the
way to developing our immigration and nationality policies. However, as
we are introducing such wide-ranging penalties and
appeals&#151;powers that are solely limited to the Home
Secretary&#151;we should at least ensure that that code of practice
is approved by the affirmative process in this House. I hope that the
Minister appreciates the reasons given by both sides of the House as to
why that might be a desirable process if the Bill is to operate
efficiently and with the credibility that he wants it to have in the
wider
community.</div>
					
					<a name="07031344000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031344000413"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I looked at this amendment very sympathetically as
well. I understand the ambitions that lie behind it, and those
ambitions are entirely sensible. It might be helpful if I say a little
about what the clause does and why it is important. It effectively
makes provision for a code of practice to be issued, so that the civil
penalty regime can operate with a degree of logic, predictability and
integrity. In particular, the code will set out those matters that must
be considered when the Secretary of State is determining whether to
give a penalty notice and what the amount will be. It may also require
the Secretary of State to consider decisions that have already been
taken. For example,if it has been decided that the right
sanction for non-compliance is to vary leave, or curtail leave, or deny
an application, the code will set out how some of those matters might
be taken into account.</div>
					<a name="07031344000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause already provides
that the code must be published, that we must consult on it and that we
must lay a draft before Parliament. In addition, the clause also says
that the code will come into effect not by affirmative resolution but
by negative resolution. That is where I pause for thought. The reason
that we suggested in the Bill that a negative resolution rather than an
affirmative resolution would bring the code into force was that we drew
on a precedent that was set in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality
Act 2006. In that Act, we provided for a code to be issued that would
guide the way that the civil penalty regime would apply to those
employers who were caught employing somebody illegally. The Bill
contains a set of immigration procedures, so we looked back on
precedents in the field of immigration.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>
					<a name="07031344000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is, however, another
precedent that could perhaps have been a more useful guide, which is
the precedent set in the Identity Cards Act 2006. In that Act, along
with the requirements to publish, consult and so on, we provided that
the first time that the code was brought into force there would not be
a negative procedure, but an affirmative procedure. Of course,
revisions could then be processed by negative procedure, but in the
first instance it was felt that the degree of scrutiny offered by the
affirmative procedure meant that that would be a wiser route to take.
Therefore, having heard the ambitions that have been expressed by
Opposition Members, I will examine the clause again to see what space
there is to improve
it.</div>

						</b> We have had a good debate this morning, and we have
moved forward. I suspect that we will not have the same measure of
agreement with regard to clause 16. At first sight it seems inoffensive
and small, but its provisions are vital to people&#146;s confidence
in the operation of our immigration system. It is about the conditions
that the Secretary of State may place on a person who has been granted
leave to remain.</div>
					<a name="07031344000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are considering people&#146;s liberty. When a decision has been made
that someone has a legitimate right to remain in the country, we may
want to place conditions on that right. I am concerned about the
open-ended nature of the clause. Amendment No. 128 would insert an
important safeguard to ensure that any conditions that the Secretary of
State places on someone staying in the country, such as restricting
their movement or place of abode, should comply fully with the UK
Government&#146;s treaty obligations as set out in the Human Rights
Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights and with the
obligations that rest with us under the international covenant on civil
and political rights. That is important. If the Secretary of State has
cause to restrict someone&#146;s movement, there must be clear
parameters and it must be stated clearly that the person subject to
that curtailment can use those treaties and obligations to argue
against the restriction if they feel it unfair and

					<a name="07031344000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 129
relates to any restrictions placed on someone under the age of 18. I am
concerned about children being subject to stringent conditions. Will
the Under-Secretary explain why she feels that to be necessary? The
bulk of the young people concerned will be in full-time education. We
had debates earlier about who the right people are to deal with young
people, and I do not see the point of someone under the age of 18
having their education disrupted and having to travel long distances,
perhaps with their parents, to travel to a detention or immigration
centre. That would be disruptive and
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>could be quite unsettling to a young person. I therefore hope that we
can make a distinction for the reporting rights for young people, given
that they are highly unlikely to abscond if their parents are subject
to
reporting.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07031344000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
amendment actually tries to take the purpose of this clause further. I
am greatly concerned that as the law is currently framed, asylum
seekers are not allowed to work while their appeal is progressing. That
is expensive and unnecessary; given that many asylum seekers are in
this country for a considerable time, and at considerable cost to this
country, it would reduce the costs to the Exchequer if they were able
to gain employment. It is also good, from a human point of view, for
any individual to have self-worth and to demonstrate that by
employment.</div>
					<a name="07031344000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, the
purpose of amendment No. 130 is to grant permission to any person who
is granted limited right to remain,</div>
					<a name="07031344000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to seek employment from two
months after an appeal has been lodged&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031344000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to see that being used as
an excuse or reason for appeals to be delayed further. We need to
ensure that the appeal process is firm, fair and expedited. While this
is not an excuse to prolong the appeal, if that person is involved in
one then they ought to have the right to work&#151;with any income
that they receive being offset against any benefits received. I hope
that the Minister can give us the assurances that we seek on the first
part of clause 16, and that he will consider extending it to allow
asylum seekers to gain employment.</div>

							<a name="07031344000420"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> It was clear, both in reading the written evidence
that was submitted to the Committee and over several sessions of oral
evidence that we have taken, that clause 16 was one of the most
difficult and controversial in the Bill. In that spirit, I welcome the
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for
Enfield, North, who will respond to this debate. Clearly, she has been
landed with this particular hot potato. Plus ça change, she may
well feel. </div>
					<a name="07031344000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The three
amendments in my name, and that of my hon. Friend, all seek to tie down
whether this clause will be practical or unduly onerous on large groups
of people. The Committee will have heard what the hon. Member for
Rochdale has just said, particularly about its potential effect on
children. These amendments look more widely at anyone who would
suddenly find restrictions on them that were not there before, as a
result of the clause.</div>
					<a name="07031344000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the detail of the
amendments, amendmentNo. 25 simply seeks that</div>
					<a name="07031344000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any condition imposed upon
residence must be reasonable in all circumstances&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07031344000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">That reflects the worries, which I am
sure the Minister will have absorbed from the written and oral
evidence, that the clause&#146;s potential for putting onerous
restrictions on people is very great. We have seen not only those
fears, but vagueness in other areas around residency requirements. For
example, some sex offenders have got round that by putting down
patently ridiculous addresses such as &#147;the woods&#148;. No one

<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>would want that failure in the system to be replicated in residency
requirements imposed by this Bill.</div>
					<a name="07031344000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that if the Minister
accepts some or all of our amendments it will reassure those who think
that the conditions are onerous and too widespread, and encourage the
Government to ensure that the regulations are effective. Any
accommodation included under the residency requirements must be
inhabitable and conducive to the individual&#146;s safety, and I hope
that the Minister will address those practical
matters.</div>
					<a name="07031344000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
85 is a probing amendment of the serious consequences of the clause. At
the outer extreme of the fears expressed about the clause is that it
could be used for internal control by insisting that some people have
to live in certain places simply because of their immigrant status. I
dare say that Ministers would regard that as unacceptable; I am aware
that one may wish to have strict controls over where certain groups in
society can live, but I cannot believe they would wish to apply such
controls to anyone who has limited leave to remain in this country.
That will include many thousands of people who have lived here for a
long time and lead blameless and extremely useful lives. People fear
that the clause as drafted would have a serious effect on them, which
cannot be the intention of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07031344000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause would
allow a Government to use the Bill for internal immigration controls.
Although reporting to an immigration officer may in some cases be
sensible for some categories of people, this blanket approach smacks of
an attempt to control the whereabouts of people who lead blameless
lives and who are accepted by the authorities as being in this country
legally.</div>
					<a name="07031344000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
too difficult to imagine scenarios in which the clause would have a
very serious effect on people&#146;s lives. For example, a person who
has secured employment in a distant rural area and is required to
report to an immigration centre may find that the nearest one is 50 or
60 miles away. The proposal to set up centres for passport interviews
has already provoked resistance in rural areas because of the
travelling distance it will involve, the time it will take and the
inconvenience it will cause.</div>
					<a name="07031344000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment draws attention
to the fact that the clause may affect yet another group of people in
that respect. Anyone who takes employment in a rural area is
statistically unlikely to be highly paid, and therefore unlikely to
have access to a car. They will therefore have to rely on public
transport in areas where it is least available and reliable. People in
rural areas with low-paid jobs who are least able to afford it will
have to take days off just to report to immigration centres. The
Minister will argue that that is absurd and I agree that it is. During
the passage of this Bill we should think about whether we want to
impose such conditions.</div>
					<a name="07031344000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the point of the clause is
to give the Government the power to follow and track those who give
them particular concern, I would have a good deal of sympathy with that
policy. But the clause does not say that. It is so widely drawn that it
does not restrict itself to that laudable activity but goes well beyond
and will affect people whom no sensible Government will want to spend
time, resources and effort following round the country or keeping
address records for. I hope the Minister can consider those
points.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>
					<a name="07031344000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 86 reopens the
debate about commencement provisions from the other side. The Minister
made the point in a previous debate that he sympathised with the idea
of having a proper code of conduct before certain provisions of the
Bill are put in place. What we are saying about amendment No. 86 is
that the same thing should apply after the legislation is passed. We
are aware that there is considerable public concern surrounding these
measures&#151;in particular the sweeping powers within the measures
that are included in this particular clause. It seems sensible from all
points of view that Parliament should be informed how the system is
working once it is in operation, which parts of it are or are not
functioning and what the Government suggest should be changed. This is
good from Parliament&#146;s point of view&#151;it will demonstrate
that our scrutiny of legislation does not have to end just because the
legislation is on the statute book and that we are actually concerned
with the practical impact of this legislation on the daily lives of
many thousands of people. But it will also act as a useful corrective
for Ministers and their officials, becauseif they know that a
public report will have to be made 12 months after the enactment of a
particular piece of legislation, that would serve to sharpen up the act
of everyone involved in the passage of the legislation and its
implementation.</div>
					<a name="07031344000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I
may tread on delicate ground, I would suggest that this is particularly
appropriate for the Home Office at this stage in its evolution,
because&#151;I will not quote the Home Secretary on the IND again,
but Ministers will recognise what I am talking about&#151;there is a
degree of public doubt about the ability of the Home Office to operate
large-scale change effectively. It would be a gesture of
self-confidence by Ministers to say that they were quite happy for
Parliament to return tothe subject and to have a public report
put before it12 months after the enactment. There would be
practical consequences as well, because if my fears are realised and
certain people are unable to take up work because of the requirements
under the residency terms of this clause, Parliament and the British
people should know about that because it would be an important feature
in the wider debate about immigration.</div>
					<a name="07031344000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been some public
movement on the debate. A few years ago there was a feeling that people
were coming to this country to live off benefits; even those who are
most hostile to immigration have moved away from that and are now
worried about people coming here to work. If we find&#151;as I
suspect we may&#151;that we are passing legislation that makes it
more difficult for those who are in this country legally to work, it is
worth having that reported on as that would be a perverse effect which
I am sure the Minister does not want.</div>
					<a name="07031344000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number of other
human rights points, to which I hope we can return in the clause stand
part debate. These specific amendments seek to address some of the
fears of the groups that have scrutinised this clause. I hope the
Minister can look on them
sympathetically.</div>

						The clause
is very important and we hope thatthe measures in it will help
to improve contact management and enforce compliance with our
immigration laws. The measures are, therefore, important. However, I am
pleased to discuss the amendments because scrutiny of those measures is
very important. They place conditions and, to some extent, restrictions
on individuals and it is right that they should undergo close
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07031344000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I can reassure Opposition Members about the use of those powers. Clause
16 amendsan existing statutory provision&#151;section 3 of
the Immigration Act 1971&#151;by adding two new conditions regarding
reporting and residency. There is, therefore, no inconsistency in our
approach towards reporting and residency conditions and the other
conditions set out in section 3&#151;police registration, employment,
maintenance and accommodation&#151;all of which are very
important.</div>
					<a name="07031344000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
very clear that the clause will be used to improve contact management
with particular categories of people and have indicated the two
categories with which we will seek to use these conditions first.
However, we consider that there are advantages to a light-touch
approach in the legislation, which will allow us to apply the new
powers to other categories, should a need for more effective contact
management become
manifest.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): Just before the
Under-Secretary turns to the amendments, what answer or comfort can she
give to Professor Anderson and his colleagues at Cambridge? When giving
evidence, he talked about overseas students who might be facing a
requirement to go to Bury St. Edmunds as the nearest reporting centre.
If he and his colleagues are trying to market Cambridge university
overseas and that potential requirement is part of the pitch, it will
make their lives rather more difficult. What answer does she have for
him?</div>

reporting restrictions and the distance between places is an important
issue that I will come towhen discussing one of the
amendments. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that we have not named
students with limited leave as one of the categories that we will apply
the provisions to at this stage. However, the power is broad and we do
not deny that these measures could cover anybody with limited leave.
The reassurance that I will give in a moment on amendment No. 85 will
probably cover his and Professor Anderson&#146;s concerns should the
measures ever apply to students, although it is not envisaged that they
will.</div>

at the outset, the two identified categories of people to whom we will
seek to apply the conditions&#151;not necessarily including every
single person in each category&#151;are foreign national prisoners
whom we are unable to remove because of legal barriers and
unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. I shall say a little bit more

Given that she is seeking to apply the measures only to a limited
number of cases, why does the Bill not frame the provision in that way?

amendments and will, I hope, give the reassurance that the hon.

					<a name="07031344000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I opened my remarks by saying
that there is no inconsistency between our approach here and the
overall approach in section 3 of the ImmigrationAct 1971,
which we are amending. The 1971 Act provides three conditions that can
be applied to limited leave, with no restriction on what groups within
the limited leave category we can apply them to. Equally, I said that
we thought that a light touch was appropriate so that we can be
flexible. If circumstances change, we will be able to use the
conditions as and when they are appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07031344000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 25 would require
that</div>

circumstances&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07031344000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Human
Rights Act 1998 makes it unlawful for public authorities to act in a
way that is incompatible with convention rights. There is also a
general legal requirement on public authorities to exercise their
powers in a reasonable way. That will apply to the new powers in clause
16. It is perfectly reasonable to ask that we apply our powers in a
reasonable way, but the Bill is trying to do so and other legislation
already exists to ensure that we do
so.</div>

keeping in touch with foreign prisoners who have been released from
prison but cannot be deported for some reason. Can she say a little
about the other case that she mentioned? She referred to asylum-seeking

for some other reason?</div>

Ryan:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for probing a little more
closely on that important category. If he will bear with me, I shall
come to it. The protection issue that he raises is integral to our
desire to apply such conditions to unaccompanied asylum-seeking
children. We will apply reporting and residency conditions to children
only when strictly necessary, either for their own welfare or with a
view to closer contact management as they approach 18, particularly
because, all things being equal, we will seek to remove unaccompanied
asylum-seeking children when they reach the age of
18.</div>
					<a name="07031344000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will liaise
with local authorities when deciding on the application of the
conditions to children in care. Let me remind the Committee&#151;the
hon. Member for Rochdale has clearly taken much interest in the
matter&#151;that on 1 March we published a consultation paper on
unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, &#147;Planning Better Outcomes
and Support for Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children&#148;. That
includes proposals to reduce the disproportionate burden of caring for
such children that falls on local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>authorities in London and the south-east. It proposes concentrating care
provision for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in local authority
areas in which special infrastructure exists, and ensuring that care
planning takes into account a young person&#146;s immigration
status.</div>
					<a name="07031344000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
unaccompanied asylum-seeking children have many needs in common with
other children in care, they also have some very different needs and
reasons for being in care. Many are much older when they go into the
care system, and their problem is that they are separated from their
families. It could be that they are not being returned to their country
of origin not because they are at risk of harm or in danger because of
the circumstances in the country, but because the reception
arrangements do not exist, or we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>cannot establish them in order to return them safely. As the
consultation paper indicates, we are working very closely with social
workers and local authorities to ensure that specialist care is in
place and that communication with social workers is good. It is much
improved; there have been problems in the past in that regard and that
is why we are taking measures to address
them.</div>
