<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Custody after charge</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Crispin Blunt </B>(Reigate): I have been reflecting on the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), who will oppose the clause standing part. I imagine that the Minister will say that if it does not stand part, the Bill will be defective because the role of judicial officers in administration of military justice will not be compliant with the European convention on human rights.
<P>
I wondered whether to support the clause in the interests of allowing the Bill to remain a coherent whole, but the key argument against it standing part, alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury, is the original role of the commanding officer in administering justice. The responsibilities vested in commanding officers, particularly as they relate to the Bail Act 1976, include, under subsection (3)(b) of proposed section 75F of the Army Act include consideration of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the character, antecedents, associations and social ties of the accused.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That leads me to conclude that the present position is best, because the commanding officer is in the best position to make such decisions.
<P>
The debate is about summary justice in the armed forced and the administration of discipline. The Bill is standing on that territory, which is why I intend to vote against the clause. If we say that the commanding officer is not a suitable person to make simple decisions about custody after charge, we shall not be doing our duty, which is to protect the military justice system and the position of the commanding officer. If it is necessary to denounce the European convention on human rights in order to protect the commanding officer's powers in that respect, or to rejoin the convention with a derogation for the military, so be it. A large proportion of the nations who joined much later than we did have done that, including seven of our NATO partners. We shall at least have taken the trouble to protect the armed forces and the military system of justice.
<P>
Many of the Bill's provisions and the developments that will result from it are thoroughly unsatisfactory. We are desperately trying to protect the summary justice procedure and the military justice system--in the teeth of the European Court of Human Rights's interpretation of the convention. If necessary, we should denounce the convention. I believe that we should bite the bullet sooner rather than later. It will obviously be a difficult political and legal process, but we seek to defend the vital ground of the armed forces. I believe that is it necessary to go through those steps, which is why I shall oppose the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Viggers </B>(Gosport): My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) was kind enough not to denounce the Government for being inquorate at the beginning of the sitting.
<P>
The Minister said that the Bill is essential because it allows recognition of the European convention on human rights. That is why it is being introduced in advance of next year's quinquennial review under the Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill procedure. The Minister said that the Bill is essential, yet the Government were not able to find a quorum at 2 pm. The Bill was delayed for some moments; it is extraordinary that a Bill that the Government deem essential cannot progress.
<P>
The Bill started in another place, where it was severely criticised. An explanatory memorandum was published on 24 January, the House of Commons Library published a paper on 4 February and the Select Committee on Defence met on 15 February and published its own paper on the Bill. None of those papers said that clause 2 was necessary to deal with the Hood case. I understand that clause 2 is the result of the Hood case, yet in his reply this morning, the Minister gave a completely different explanation of the Hood case and how the Bill deals with it.
<P>
The Hood case is important. David Hood, a soldier in the British Army, was arrested for a fourth time for being absent without leave. His case was heard by the European Court of Human Rights. One of his complaints was that his commanding officer could not be considered impartial when authorising his pre-trial detention, which was said to be in violation of article 5 of the convention. This morning, the Minister read to us the legal advice that the Government had been given. He explained that, in the Hood case, the question of impartiality related to the trial.
<P>
It is important to distinguish between article 5 of the convention, which deals with the right to liberty and security--rights in custody--and the right under article 6 to a fair trial. The word "impartial" appears in article 6, but not in article 5, which deals with liberty and security. Article 5(3) says that any person arrested or detained
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officers authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I still do not understand the reason for clause 2. It deals with custody after charge, and the Minister suggested that it hinges on the Hood case. Despite the fact that the articles and explanations to which I have referred all said that the Hood case required a new clause relating to custody, the Minister seemed to say that the problem with the Hood case was impartiality at trial. In other words, if the person who required him to be detained in custody pending trial was also somehow involved in the trial, partiality might result; but that would be caught under article 6.
<P>
I am genuinely confused. It may be necessary to continue the debate in correspondence with the Minister. I do not understand why the Government have changed the custody rules following the Hood case; article 5 is cited, but the word "impartial" does not appear in it.
<P>
I have one other query. Subsection (2)(b) to proposed section 75E of the Army Act states that the judicial officer must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>satisfied that the accused should be kept in military custody for his own protection or, if he is under 17 years of age, for his own welfare.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In certain circumstances, individuals in my constituency are kept in custody for their own welfare, not because they are under 17, but because they are involved in heinous crimes and there might be a hue and cry--to use a medieval expression--if they are set loose. People who have been responsible for abominable acts of paedophilia or child abuse have been kept in care for their own protection, even though they are older than 17. Someone over the age of 17 might need to be kept in custody for his own protection because of the nature of his crime. The Bill does not tackle that problem.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr. Lewis Moonie):</B> On the interpretation of the Hood case, I shall try to put the matter in perspective by explaining when it applies directly and when inferences or contingent findings have been drawn from it. Confusion--I am not much clearer on this than the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers)--has been caused by the need to consider both the direct judgment and the consequences which we have decided, on the basis of legal advice, are related to it. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall respond in detail later in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> That is a trifle unsatisfactory. We have to decide now whether clause 2 should stand part of the Bill. The judgment in the Hood case is relevant to the clause, either directly or through inference. Can we adjourn to allow the Under-Secretary to take advice on how the Hood case relates to clause 2, so that we can reach a considered judgment on whether it should stand part of the Bill? I realise that that is partly a point of order.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a matter for the Under-Secretary how he chooses to respond and a matter for Committee how they vote.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Indeed it is, Mr. Malins. As my reasonable offer has been rejected, I shall not bother to enlighten the Committee at a later stage. The Bill is as it stands and I shall support it from start to finish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The hon. Gentleman will resume his seat or rise on a point of order. I am under no obligation to explain anything other than what I choose to explain. The Bill is as it stands. Everything else is a point of debate and argument. I made a reasonable offer, which has been rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I want it put on the record that I did not turn down the Under-Secretary's offer to provide information that would enable us to discuss the Bill. My point is that because what he plans to say relates to clause 2, he should take advice and let us the debate the arguments now. The last thing I would wish to do would be to discourage the Under-Secretary from making the Committee well informed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Under-Secretary will have heard the hon. Gentleman, whose point is not strictly a matter for the Chair. The friendly and happy atmosphere of the Committee will, I am sure, continue.
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Absolutely. As I have said, I do not believe that the information is relevant to the debate. The clause and the amendments have been adequately discussed. There is no reason to enlighten the Committee further but, out of politeness, I shall endeavour to do so in future.
<P>
As for specific points, I undertook to write to the hon. Member for Salisbury. Foreign nationals guarded by British soldiers in Kosovo will not be subject to the Armed Forces Discipline Bill, although the soldiers will be. The rules produced by the commander of KFOR for the detention of people held in prisons in Pristina follow the essential requirements of human rights. Presumably, an individual held in a prison who believes that his rights have been abused will have the right to sue, although the lack of a functioning judiciary in the province might make that difficult.
<P>
On costs, I could read out my long and complicated brief, but might do better to write to the hon. Gentleman, which seems to be acceptable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Key:</B> Actually, that is not what I want. It is important that the Committee hears the information. I am grateful for the generous offer to write to me, but if the Under-Secretary has the information--tedious though it may be--we should hear it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I have no problem with that.
<P>
Most additional costs arising from the Armed Forces Discipline Bill will fall to the Army as the largest service. It is estimated that in the first year, it will cost the Army £4.75 million. That includes approximately £1.2 million for start-up costs, which cover the procurement of information systems to support the implementation and monitoring of the new measures, the establishment of video conference facilities for custody hearings and new accommodation for additional personnel, principally at the adjutant-general's headquarters at Upavon.
<P>
The average annual costs in the following three years are estimated at about £4.6 million. Although there will be no start-up costs, staff costs will be higher because the new procedures will operate for a full 12 months, compared with only six months in the first year.
<P>
In subsequent years, 80 per cent. of the estimated additional costs will be for extra manpower. It is envisaged that the Army will need an extra 40 military and 32 civilian personnel. Of that total, 30 posts will be for the Army Legal Services, of whom 15 will be lawyers and 15 support staff. Some will meet the increased need to give legal advice to commanders that is expected to be generated by the introduction of the right to appeal. The Army's estimates also include £600,000 in a full year to meet the costs of additional judge advocate time to hear appeals and of judicial officers to deal with custody hearings.
<P>
The approach in other services is broadly similar to the Army's, but the number of appeals each year is estimated to be much smaller--200 in the Royal Navy and 80 in the RAF, which is, in each case, about 5 per cent. of the number of summary dealings. The estimated additional costs for the Royal Navy are £0.87 million, which include staff costs of the summary appeal court--judge, advocate and two lay members--five personnel to support the summary appeal court and four additional personnel for the naval prosecuting authority, including one naval barrister. That amounts to £0.4 million. Travel and subsistence costs associated with the summary appeal court will be about £0.07 million, and the costs of the service's legal aid scheme will be £0.4 million.
<P>
In the Royal Air Force, the estimated additional annual costs are about £0.64 million. That includes the cost of employing three more uniformed lawyers to support the prosecuting authority and to provide legal advice in respect of the new legislation. An additional three staff will provide administrative support. Travel, subsistence and other costs associated with the summary appeal court will be about £0.25 million a year and the costs to the RAF legal aid scheme will be £0.16 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I invite the Under-Secretary to elucidate. I thought he said that the bill to the RAF of £0.64 million would pay for three lawyers and that there would be other expenses of £0.25 million for additional staff. That seems like quite a lot of money for three lawyers. Has he been able to take any advice on why the sum is so large?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No he has not, but I am sure that some will be forthcoming and, if so, I shall be happy to share it with the hon. Gentleman. That sum is to pay for another three staff in addition to the three lawyers, as well as travel, subsistence and other costs, which comes to a total of £0.64 million. That is not quite as bad as the hon. Gentleman might think, given the generous fees that lawyers seem to command these days for almost anything they do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Too generous.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> As a doctor, I could not possibly comment on another profession.
<P>
The point was made that the additional costs are a charge on the MoD budget. I accept that and regret any additional charges to the budget, but it is a large one and we shall have to make it stretch a bit further. Having spoken to senior staff, I am confident that the costs can be accommodated without causing harm to any other area of expenditure. One good thing about large budgets is that spending is not immediate in all areas within them, so sufficient funds 11 be available, especially in the first year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Are the Government postponing expenditure on other areas to take account of the expenditure required by the Bill?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No, the Government are handling expenditure more effectively and efficiently in order to cover the additional costs, although the hon. Gentleman might not believe that. I think that I have covered all the points raised. The clause is a reasonable addition to the Bill, which the Committee should support.

Review of custody after charge

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 54, in page 21, line 7, at end insert--
<P>

No. 55, in page 21, line 35, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(1A) A review under subsection (1) above shall include a review of the health and safety conditions of the accused in custody.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am sure that the good nature of the Committee will not be disrupted but I must say that I thought it extraordinary that the Under-Secretary asserted that he was under no obligation to say anything during the Committee. That would certainly be outwith the traditions of the House and I hope that he will not retreat into his shell because we should miss his contributions. It is difficult to see how we could fulfil our obligations to the House without obtaining answers from the Under-Secretary. I am sure that, on reflection, that is not what he meant--I certainly hope not. However, as he is smiling and has regained his usual twinkle, I hope that we can proceed.
<P>
These straightforward amendments will improve the military and judicial process in a small, but significant way. In the extreme circumstances in which the Bill's provisions might have to be applied, the accused may be in poor health, either through physical injury or mental distress, which the Under-Secretary, from his professional viewpoint, will understand better than I do. That mental distress might be what the layman would call shellshock, but what is now more properly called post-traumatic stress disorder.
<P>
Mental stress can take many forms in a high-intensity conflict. It could manifest itself as suicidal urges, or the desire to harm one's comrades or superiors, or even civilians who happen to be in the way in a place of conflict. In many cases, a service man may have to be detained without charge for a considerable time before the miraculous and, hopefully, timely appearance of the judicial officer, whether in his physical or electronic form. Of course, it is not only in high-intensity warfare, but in peacekeeping operations that such traumas may, and do regularly, occur.
<P>
Many people live fairly sheltered lives. They are used to virtual and sanitised violence on television in American cowboy films and programmes such as "The A Team", but it is different when people first experience the real thing. Our young men and women who are trained as fighters are very tough, so if they are together when they discover some horrendous massacre, or even just a decomposing body, it is unlikely that they will crack. However, if they happen to be alone, the story can be very different. I wish that the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Martin Bell) were in Committee because I have no doubt that he would be able to tell us about such circumstances. Indeed, I regret that the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) is not in Committee for yet another sitting because, no doubt, some of his constituents could tell him a thing or two about what happens when one discovers violent and revolting scenes. That is not easy to imagine, but as many Committee members have been to Bosnia of Kosovo and seen the destruction that took place there, perhaps they can imagine it.
<P>
It is important that the commanding officer should be required to take measures to ensure, as far as practicable, that the accused is unable to harm himself or herself or put at risk the physical well-being of comrades who may be required to keep the accused under close guard. A review of the health and safety conditions of the accused in custody would ensure that a formal check was made at the outset as to the health and physical well-being of the accused. This is not a nanny's boy clause, but things have moved on. Young though he is, much has changed since my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate served in the armed forces, and I am sure that the general culture in which young people today grow up is a lot softer than it was in his day. We need to acknowledge that.
<P>
The issue is important because of the risk of death in custody. Consider, for example, the case of a service man who is assaulted by his comrades--because bullying can be a problem in the Army. Steps are being taken to deal with it, but it is human nature, so will occur from time to time. If that service man were to die as a result of injuries sustained in custody, there would, because there is currently no requirement to note his state of health, be wide doubt in a resultant murder case about who--if anyone--was guilty. The example to which I referred involved circumstances that are likely to occur only rarely. That is why the amendment is in the spirit of the Bill, which seeks to dot every i and cross every t on the United Kingdom's adherence to human rights standards. Surely the Government should not blush from going the extra mile that we propose.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the operational scenario, facilities for holding prisoners may be basic or makeshift, which is why the amendments have a safety aspect. If our forces were deployed in a country with extreme weather conditions, which happens often enough, the commanding officer would not be required to ensure that the accused was given comforts--that would be stressing the point a little too far--but that he was at least provided with minimum basic standards. The living conditions of our service men in many operational scenarios are pretty harsh, to say the least. We have only to consider conditions in Kosovo to understand that. Yesterday, I tabled a parliamentary question that appears on today's Order Paper, about the condition of our forces' accommodation in Kosovo. Lord Robertson informed me in a written answer published last July that winterised accommodation was scheduled to be in place by the end of October, but it was not. Then we were told that it would all be fine by February, but it was not. I hope that the winterisation procedure is now in place. If it is not under way, and upgraded tent accommodation is not available or the generator breaks down, the accommodation of all soldiers involved will be basic. Such matters could be overlooked for somebody in custody, and we want to ensure that they are not. In a hot climate, heat exhaustion or dehydration could have serious consequences for a detainee. The amendment would require the commanding officer to ensure that the accused was not housed in conditions obviously detrimental to his or her health.
<P>
The amendment highlights matters neglected by the Government. Its application would be simple, quick and straight forward. It would not require officers to write lengthy reports or to carry out detailed medical examinations. If the Minister says that the matter will be dealt with in the quinquennial Act next year, so be it. However, I hope that he will agree with this simple, important amendment, which would safeguard the human rights of the accused at the cost of adding only a small burden to the duties of commanding officers in onerous circumstances.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> When I first saw the amendment, I was somewhat concerned. It seemed to be another example of the military being subjected to the--
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Nanny state.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am obliged to the Minister; I was concerned about the nanny state. As somebody who has suggested to the Prime Minister that it was better to be the Queen's first Minister than the nation's first nanny in presenting himself to electorate, I am obviously concerned about such matters. I must confess that when I read the proposed health and safety conditions, I was slightly worried that my hon. Friend had--
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Gone soft.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Indeed, I thought that he had gone soft. My hon. Friend has a splendid reputation as a liberal and caring Member of Parliament, but I thought that might have gone overboard on this amendment. Having heard his explanation, I am slightly reassured. He said that the Bill did not place a duty on the reviewing officer to take account of the prisoner's health. Will the Under- Secretary comment on that point?
<P>
I object to the term "health and safety". The phrase "health and mental conditions" would perhaps be a more judicious expression of the amendment's objective. I do not know whether one is allowed these days to suggest that mental conditions are not part of health and that the term "mental" would therefore be superfluous in the amendment, but the record will show that my hon. Friend is talking about reviewing the health and mental condition of the prisoner when making a decision on further custody. That is an appropriate subject for consideration, and its inclusion should be considered. Indeed, the amendment is more worthy of support than I thought at first sight.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It is almost impossible to specify standards of conditions in the field. We have said that prisoners in custody will be returned to proper sites as soon as possible, so I shall concentrate my remarks on when a prisoner has returned to a place deemed proper rather than merely expedient for holding somebody in custody. In the exigencies of operations in the field, one must make do with what is available at the time. I shall be happy to impart further information on those issues.
<P>
The amendments make perfectly reasonable points and were tabled with worthy intentions. I shall, however, explain why I think that they are unnecessary and that existing procedures are sufficient. I am glad to see that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) is one of the members of the board of visitors at the military corrective training centre in the fine city of Colchester. Is Colchester a city? [Hon. Members: "Yes."] I am not sure that it is. People are touchy about whether their towns are referred to as cities, so I shall not pursue that line--[Interruption].
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Undoubtedly the Under- Secretary will receive advice on that point.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I do not think that the matter is critical to the proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> We can surely agree that Colchester was an important Roman military city.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Like Salisbury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): As somebody born in Essex, I can tell the Committee that Chelmsford is a city, but, to my knowledge, Colchester is not.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It just goes to show. As a Scot, I would have sworn that the opposite was true.
<P>
I accept that the amendments make serious points. It is proper to refer to health and safety, which carries a specific legal meaning. It covers mental and physical health, as well as general public health and other considerations. Health and safety cover matters specified in the Health and Safety Act 1974, although I must confess that it is a long time since I read the legislation. I should be interested to hear whether any other hon. Members have bothered to do so, although I suspect that there may not be too many of them.
<P>
The military corrective training centre at Colchester is used for individuals who have to be held for a long period. I believe that the hon. Member for Salisbury is familiar with that admirable institution. Perhaps I should explain that comment, in case any hon. Members think that he was once a guest at the establishment. He was in fact a visitor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The centre is an excellent and enlightened institution. The Colchester glasshouse is a remarkable institution and not what people expect. I recommend that members of the Committee go to see how offenders can be rehabilitated by military discipline.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That is high on my long list of priorities--which, I regret, is growing longer daily.
<P>
In the Army, pre-trial detention is in a licensed unit guardroom or at Colchester. Health and safety regimes in both cases are regulated by codes of practice that are wide ranging and not confined to health and safety matters. Inspections carried out under the codes cover both physical facilities and the way in which the custody facilities are run. They provide for medical examination, health and safety checks, risk assessment for persons under close arrest and the suitability of accommodation and furnishings.
<P>
Cells cannot be used unless licensed as fit for use. They undergo a licensing inspection by an officer outside the commanding officer's chain of command at least every two years at unit level, and annually at Colchester. Inspection also takes place after any major structural change. In addition, cells are formally inspected at least three times a year by the commanding officer, accompanied by a medical officer and a health and safety expert. At Colchester, a health and safety inspection is undertaken annually. The commandant is under a continuing duty to ensure that the establishment and procedures meet the relevant health and safety standards and that a health and safety representative is available to deal with day-to-day concerns.
<P>
Custody procedures require that an individual may be medically examined on request. There must be a medical examination if there is any doubt about the mental or physical condition of the person under arrest. The Royal Navy's regulations require all personnel to be medically examined before being confined, with supervisory checks at regular intervals. On arrival at the place of detention, all personnel are treated as high risk for the first 24 hours and must be observed every 15 minutes. A formal risk assessment is then made. After 24 hours they are reassessed to determine the appropriate level of observation. Frequency of checks may be increased if necessary to make the level of supervision commensurate with the individual's physical or mental state.
<P>
I could give further details about the board of visitors and external inspections. Although I am a medical practitioner, I am not an expert in the matter, but I think that they confirm that present standards of supervision are very high. They do not require any additions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am glad that we probed the issue and grateful for the Minister's answers and assurances. I am satisfied and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 20, line 43, leave out 'legally represented' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'represented legally or by an officer appointed by the Commanding Officer to assist with his defence'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was quite hopeful that the previous group of amendments that I tabled on the custodial officer would meet the Committee's approval, and I am sorry that they did not. I am quite hopeful about amendment No. 57 because it is so evidently sensible, although I am concerned, of course, having received such a frosty reaction from the Minister when I asked for help on clause 2 stand part.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The next time that I am trying to be ironic, I shall make it much more obvious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am delighted to learn that the Minister was being ironic. Perhaps having to make the Government's case is an unfair burden on him. That seemed so on Second Reading, when not one Labour Back Bencher other than the Chairman of the Select Committee on Defence could be found to speak for the merits of the Bill. I am sorry to have missed the irony when the Minister told the Committee that he thought he was under no duty to give us information. However, the lack of Labour party Back-Bench support for the Bill gave me a reason for concern and missing that irony. I stand corrected.
<P>
The amendment would reduce the burden of the administration of justice in the armed forces with respect to custody. It is a straightforward and commonsense measure to tackle a ludicrous situation that can arise.
<P>
I have been the assistant defending officer to a young man charged with rape. Indeed, after having been remanded in open arrest after the first accusation, it being thought that the offence would not be repeated, he was charged with a second rape. Clearly something had gone wrong and people misunderstood the character of that individual, who was subsequently convicted on both counts. He was remanded in custody for a long time before the trial for the first offence.
<P>
Under the Bill, such a person would know that he would be remanded in custody until the trial date, and might be content not to muck the system about, accepting remand for 28 days at a time. A judicial officer would have to make that decision. He would arrive and tell the prisoner, "I want to remand you for 28 days." The prisoner would reply, "I am happy to be remanded for 28 days." However, if he was in Germany and did not have a lawyer, he could not do that. Unless his brief were to be dragged from wherever he happened to be--usually somewhere in England, unless he were perhaps an Army lawyer, who might or might not be available--two lawyers would be retained. There would be two sets of legal costs to pay every time it was necessary to remand the soldier in custody for a further period.
<P>
In such a cut and dried case, surely it would make perfect sense to avoid the necessity for formal legal representation and instead provide for the commanding officer to appoint an officer to assist the man with his defence. The officer would be present to confirm that the accused man's wish was not to return every eight days for remand. I cannot believe that that would not be compliant with the convention.
<P>
The new section 75G(7) of the Army Act 1955 that clause 3 would create provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On a review at a hearing at which the accused is legally represented, the judicial officer may, if the accused consents<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
authorise the 28-day remand. How can it possibly be said that the consent of the accused on the simple matter of whether to be remanded for eight or 28 days could be challenged in the European Court of Human Rights? Surely the appointment by the commanding officer of an assistant defending officer to guide the soldier, sailor or airman as to his rights and give him counsel would be compliant with the convention under any test of reasonableness. Perhaps the matter turns on establishing what is meant by consent, or how it must be given--for example, in writing or in some other way that would meet tests under the convention. That could be dealt with by regulation or administration.
<P>
If the Bill is not amended, it will not be possible to remand someone for 28 days, particularly overseas, without two sets of two lawyers--one acting as judicial officer and the other as legal representative.
<P>
In Germany, for example, a soldier in regimental custody facing a serious charge is marched down to the guardroom to see the commanding officer, after which he is remanded. Under the new system, an expensive judicial officer will make the decision. An individual who faces a serious charge such as murder or rape will now that will not be released until his trial commences. He will know that there is no point in going through the charade every eight days, and will consent to being remanded for 28 days. Why do we need another lawyer present if we can have an officer who would be appointed as assistant defending officer?
<P>
I hope that, on this small point, the Government will consider accepting the amendment. It would make the administration of justice in armed forces units more straightforward.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I studied the amendment with interest and it seemed reasonable until I realised that the judicial officer will be involved in the review. The amendment would place only an additional duty on him to relieve the commanding officer of a burden. Currently, a member of the armed forces charged abroad and detained in custody is returned to this country within the eight-day period and remanded on base or at Colchester; he would not be left abroad. The 28-day provision would not apply to such a person.
<P>
Judicial officers will be allowed to authorise custody for up to 28 days, rather than the usual eight, provided the accused consents. If the accused does not consent, eight-day periods will be used. Consent will be acceptable only if given by the accused at a hearing where he is legally represented.
<P>
The provision is for the benefit of the commanding officer. It is designed to allow a reduction in the number of custody hearings required when an accused is being held in custody before trial. The judicial officer will use the same Bail Act criteria as is used in the civilian system. For the protection of the accused, consent for longer periods between reviews and the availability of legal advice is required.
<P>
The amendment would allow the judicial officer to grant an extended period of custody with the consent of the accused when someone in that person's chain of command represented him. It seems strange that the commanding officer seeking to detain the accused in custody would also be responsible for advising him through the services of a subordinate officer.
<P>
When the hon. Gentleman thinks about the matter, he will welcome any provision designed to relieve the commanding officer's work load. He will appreciate the value of the intended financial savings and efficiency. I hope that, having heard my explanation, he will agree that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary will help me with a further point. He said that legal representation of the accused when he consented to 28 days' further detention was a necessary safeguard. Will he explain why? If someone charged with rape does not seek to object to custody every eight days, the question in reasonable circumstances is whether the individual consents. If consent is established by administrative proceedings, why does the person need additional representation? A judicial officer would have decided whether he should be retained. With the "bomb proof ability" of the European convention, the judicial officer will be independent. He will have to satisfy himself about the individual's consent and that the accused has been properly informed of his rights. Why must he also be legally represented? A significant legal overhead will be created for the armed forces; anything that we can reasonably do to reduce it is to be welcomed. I want an explanation of why such a soldier will need legal representation in what is merely an extension of custody involving an issue of consent, already refereed by a judicial officer.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The matter of informed consent is difficult; it can mean different things. I am from the medical field, where it refers merely to the basic legal obligation of telling someone what will happen to them. Cases of mental illness are more difficult, involving the question of whether the person understands what is being said to him. Somebody on remand, not yet found guilty, will be asked to consent to being deprived of his liberty for 28 days, rather than eight days. It is incumbent on us to give such people the best advice, and they will be entitled to legal representation. We are merely proposing an additional duty to ensure that when people are asked to deprive themselves voluntarily of 28 days' liberty, they are sure that that is in their best interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> They would be entitled to legal representation, but someone might be charged with a serious crime such as murder, rape, manslaughter, attempted murder or attempted rape and remanded in custody. He will know that he is unlikely to be bailed--he will be remanded in custody. The soldier, sailor or airman might have accepted that and might not wish to be legally represented.
<P>
We are saying that a person cannot be remanded for 28 days unless a judicial officer decides about consent. We are adding to the overhead by requiring a lawyer neither desired by the individual nor necessary because a judicial officer will satisfy himself on the points of law. I hope that the Under-Secretary's advisers might say that the amendment can be accepted.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Given the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman has made his point, I am sorry to disappoint him, but I cannot accede to it. The matter hangs on whether, as we say, legal representation is required, or whether, as he said, something less stringent would be sufficient. I am afraid that I must stand by the advice that representation is essential in individuals' best interests.

<P>
</FONT><H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> According to the European convention on human rights, derogations can be justified under article 15, which deals with public emergencies that threaten the life of the nation. A derogation is already in place under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and the security situation in Northern Ireland is deemed to be just such an emergency.
<P>
As many gallant and noble Lords pointed out during the Bill's passage through the other place, such a system is unworkable in active service conditions. It will require that the accused be brought before ajudicial officer within 48 hours of arrest to approve continuing custody. In many operational scenarios to which reference has been made today, that may prove difficult. The Government responded by saying that the Bill can be made to work flexibly, providing for the accused, whom the commanding officer considers should be held in custody, to be brought before the judicial officer "as soon as practicable".
<P>
In a memorandum to the Defence Committee about the Bill's impact on operational effectiveness, the Ministry of Defence stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This would mean that it would be possible in appropriate circumstances to postpone the hearing until operational imperatives permit, for example, until after the end of a submarine's operational patrol.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a very interesting statement, which I should like to compare and contrast with comments made by the Minister for Defence Procurement, Baroness Symons, in the other place. On Report, she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If an assurance is being sought that in the most extreme operational circumstances the requirements of the Bill will somehow be set on one side, I cannot offer that. Indeed, that is to miss the point. [Official Report, House of Lords, 18 January 2000; vol. 608, c.1005.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are conflicting and confusing strands of policy, which present an interesting conundrum--on which, I hope, the Minister will shed some light. The European convention on human rights, with which we must comply, states that only in an emergency threatening the life of the nation can we suspend the Bill's provisions. The MoD says, in effect, "No, it's all right, it has to be done only when you can manage it." The Minister for Defence Procurement says, in effect, "Sorry, those provisions won't be set aside even in the most exacting operational circumstances."
<P>
Does the Minister accept that conclusive demonstration that the Bill is flawed? Is not the "as soon as practicable" provision a loophole which will enable the fairness of service discipline to be challenged in the European Court of Human Rights? The Government claim that service chiefs have signed up to the Bill to protect a summary justice system that is at the heart of armed forces discipline, but our summary justice system appears, sadly, to remain open to challenge. I should be grateful for the Minister's view on that.
<P>
Derogation also presents problems in respect of modern missions. It is generally accepted that there are unlikely to be conflicts threatening the life of the nation for some years, but that is arguable. We are told that it takes at least 10 years for a perceived threat to become a reality, but we were told that in 1939.
<P>
Unfortunately, the UK's armed forces are likely to be involved in high-intensity conflict. Ministers have so far been unable to give a qood recent example of the situation in which an article 15 derogation would apply. In the other place, Baroness Symons noted that the Gulf war probably would not have triggered a derogation--not even the Falklands war would have done. Kosovo is another example of a situation in which the derogation would not apply. We are all aware of how close British forces came to finding a serious conflict on the ground in the Balkans last year.
<P>
It is likely that British forces involved in a major war scenario, such as the Gulf and have to apply all provisions in disciplinary proceedings, which would involve dragging in civilian legal personnel to combat theatres or wiring up video cameras in the middle of a desert or a jungle, up a mountain or elsewhere. I have a problem with that approach--I simply cannot see how it will work.
<P>
That emphasises another flaw in the Bill: it complacently accepts that our forces will henceforth contentedly be sitting in bases in the UK or patrolling foreign streets in peacekeeping missions. It does not legislate for the realities of war. We have the best armed forces in the world. In high-intensity conflict and under the pressures of battle, where service men are killed and maimed, the maintenance of iron discipline is vital for combat effectiveness. Do we really believe that a frontline unit will have the time or inclination to heed the call to bring forth a judicial officer, or that a field officer who is defending a dug-in position under fire will say, "Quick lads, set up the video equipment"?
<P>
The Minister will doubtless say that we are providing extreme or unlikely cases. However, modern conflicts contain many such scenarios. For example, at the famous siege of Khe Sanh in Vietnam in 1968, US marines were surrounded by a force of 20,000 north Vietnamese. The battle raged for 77 days, and the US troops, who were under constant shell fire, were resupplied sporadically by the valiant efforts of their airmen. Under such appalling conditions and constant tension, how would the Bill's provisions be enforced? The simple answer is that they would not be.
<P>
The Government must decide whether they agree with Baroness Symons that the Bill will be applied even in the most dreadful circumstances, or whether the matter could be put to one side until it was practical to do something about it. The Government have sought to maintain both positions, but they cannot have it both ways. Are we witnessing an effective derogation from the European Court of Human Rights? Has the MOD discovered, courtesy of its excellent lawyers, that it may be possible to slip through a derogation without its being noticed?
<P>
Grave difficulties will be associated with the application of the provisions in active service conditions. If the Minister cannot accept our amendments in principle, will he undertake to reconsider the matter? He should try to reconcile the Government's conflicting positions and consider the Bill's application in operational conditions. I am sure that the matter will be raised on Report by hon. Members who do not serve on this Committee. For the sake of our service men and women, the Government must decide where they stand on the issue.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I have a simple but profound question to ask before we agree to the clause. The clause states that Army personnel could be held in military custody, that Air Force personnel could be held in air force custody and that Navy personnel could be held in naval custody. Three Acts are relevant in that regard, but I shall consider only the Army Act 1955. Section 178 of that Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any ... member of the ... naval or air forces--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
who is serving with the Army--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall be treated as if he were a member of the regular forces of corresponding rank.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, section 179 states that any Army personnel who are attached to the naval or air forces<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall not cease to be subject to military law by reason only of attachment in pursuance of this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Personnel in each of the three branches of the armed forces are subject to the discipline of those armed forces. They will not be removed from that jurisdiction if they are serving with other forces, although they will have similar rank if they do so.
<P>
My question is this: can someone serving with the Army, Navy or Air Force be treated as subject to the discipline of their own branch of the armed forces while they are serving with another branch of the armed forces, or will an air force man, for example, fall subject to naval custody when he is in the Navy and Army custody when he is in the Army? It is a simple issue that should be covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> My brief intervention may give the Under-Secretary extra time to find the right answer. My hon. Friend has raised an important and practical point. In these days of purple service, RAF personnel are deployed on aircraft carriers for months at a time--long tours--as well as operating alongside each other in activities on a practical and daily basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I raised the matter as a point of pure inquiry, without malice aforethought. I have great confidence in the staff advising the Minister. I am sure that they will give him the answer and I shall be made to look stupid.
<P>
I want to know whether an Army man or woman serving with the Navy or Air Force remains subject to Army discipline, or falls subject to Air Force or naval discipline. That is important, because the person who is responsible for the disciplinary control of that individual will need to know exactly which Section to quote from which of the three Acts. Legal advisers to the Ministry of Defence have so far been unable to bring forward an homologation of the Acts, so we still have to deal with all three. Individuals in each branch of the armed forces will be interested in the answer to the question. I hope that it will be extremely simple, and that I shall be persuaded and reassured.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I have a good reply to this one. Individuals remain subject to the discipline of their own services, but can also be subject to that of the service to which they are attached. I have no further explanation than that at the moment. However, I promise that I shall look into it in more detail, because the system appears to be complex to operate. It would be interesting to look at a couple of cases to see how the law has been applied.
<P>
We are back on the subject of derogation. The convention generally takes precedence over discipline. However, flexibility is built into the Bill to take account of the fact that in certain operating circumstances there may be difficulties in complying with the letter of the convention. The obligation will always be on the commanding officer, where practicable, to do so. There will be no excuse for him to say to a man, "I'm sorry, I just didn't do it." If it is considered on review to have been practicable to have complied with the convention, he should have done so. He would have to have a genuine reason, not just an excuse for not doing so.
<P>
The services clearly want one code of conduct, and one phrased in such a way as to be flexible enough to be applicable in every situation. We will not help the cause of the Bill by being over-prescriptive and trying to define what is and is not practicable. It is better to leave it as a matter of general guidance, which can be followed up in practice when the Bill has been enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The Minister said that it will be incumbent on the commanding officer, where practicable, to operate under the convention. I am sure that the Minister understands that the summary justice system operated by the commanding officer--which is what we are trying to protect--is not compliant with the convention, because it is not administered independently of the chain of command. That is a deliberate element of the system. I am sure that there is not a general injunction on commanding officers to operate within the convention. For most of the time, in operating the summary justice system, they will knowingly and properly operate outwith the convention. That is the vital ground that we are seeking to protect, not least under this Bill.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It is difficult to see how the hon. Gentleman can have it both ways. If the intensity of conflict were such that it would become impossible to comply with the convention, I find it hard to believe that a commanding officer would be wasting his time with summary punishments. He would have other things on his mind. That is a layman's view, in the legal and military sense, and, I hope, a commonsense view of what would prevail. If, on the other hand, there were not such intensity of conflict, commanding officers would have to comply with the convention through the means outlined in the Bill--through the use of a local officer, for instance. Alternatively, video links could be used, which the Opposition might dispute, but which we have been advised will be adequate.
<P>
Flexibility is the key to ensuring compliance. Although the procedures seem rigid, they should be made as easy to apply as possible. Service chiefs and their advisers have taken into account the practical considerations, and they are convinced that they will work. I am happy to take their advice on that. I cannot provide further enlightenment. I do not believe that more detail would be helpful; on the contrary, it would be over-prescriptive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I should like to press the Minister a little more on the word "Practicable". It can often refer to the priority given to carrying out the review. Does it mean that normal operations would have to be interrupted for the review to be carried out?
<P>
I want to raise a further point in reference to the provision that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At subsequent reviews the judicial officer need not hear arguments as to fact or law which have been heard previously.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The accused might not have been legally represented up to that point. When he is legally represented, his representative might want to adduce an argument that had already been made by the accused, although perhaps not persuasively. His representative might want to go over the same ground, but introduce more evidence, for instance. In those circumstances, would the judicial officer usually hear that argument? The Bill says that he "need not". Would the judicial officer usually hear the legal advice advanced by the representative?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> As things stand, that would be a decision for the judicial officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Would it usually be the case?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I think that it would. Without experience of the system in operation, it is difficult to work out what would occur in practice. However, I would expect that to be the case. A judicial officer's role is to act impartially. Although he "need not", I would expect him to do so if he considered that there were the slightest need for such action. The other point--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should try to avoid sedentary questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister asked me what other point I had made. I was trying to help him with a sedentary reminder, which was not supposed to be on the record.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I was really asking myself.
<P>
I am happy to give my definition of "practicable", but it might be more convenient to do so at another time.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Unfortunately, our amendments to replace judicial officers with duty officers have not been selected for debate, but I have no quarrel with that because we dealt with the matter earlier and lost the vote.
<P>
The clause allows any judicial officer to conduct a custody review until the date of trial and during adjournment. It is important to emphasise our fears that the introduction of judicial officers into the military discipline process will undermine the status and authority of commanding officers. In its report on the Bill, the Defence Committee noted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the special circumstances of military service, there are obvious reasons to be concerned about the risks to operational effectiveness of introducing a more "litigious" atmosphere to the world of military discipline.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister for the Armed Forces told the Committee that the Bill had been introduced precisely
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to maintain the authority of the Commanding Officer and Service discipline.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He would say that, would he not? However, knowing the Minister as I do, I am sure that he also meant it. He said that ensuring ECHR compliance would strengthen a commanding officer's authority by protecting it from challenge in the courts. He added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Indeed, I would argue that if we were not bringing forward this measure it could very satisfactorily be argued that we would be contributing to the undermining of that authority because if there were questions over the authority of a CO in a number of circumstances that is far more likely to undermine authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take the Minister's point, but I do not agree with him.
<P>
Our concern is that the Bill undermines the integrity of those who command. It is an invitation to barrack room lawyers. Our disciplinary system clearly demonstrates that unit morale is supported and bolstered by the application of quick and firm justice. The procedures set out in the Bill remove part of the control of a commanding officer and the timing leads to delays in getting a problem dealt with and finished. The Government might agree that that is a risk, but believe that it is a risk worth taking in the interests of our obligation. However, it is damaging to put in place a disciplinary process that allows soldiers to complain about their commanding officers, thereby reducing their authority. Soldiers have always complained about their commanding officers in a ripe old way, to say the least, but they have accepted their authority and shouted afterwards.
<P>
No one can doubt that the upholding of a commanding officer's authority and trust is vital to the efficiency and morale of a unit. That is especially so in active and combat operations. This technical measure strikes at the heart of operational effectiveness.
<P>
On Second Reading in the other place, Lord Inge said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I cannot stress strongly enough, as has already been said, the critical importance of the commanding officer, both in peacetime and in war; indeed, you cannot separate the importance of the commanding officer in peacetime from that of the commanding officer on operations. Anything that undermines his authority must mean that the great majority of people in his command will suffer. I am quite clear that the proposed changes . . . will affect--and have a bad effect on--the authority of the commanding officer.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 684.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Burnham, for the Opposition, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The judicial officer, who plays such a large part in the Bill, will take away much of the control and authority that a commanding officer has over his unit. The amended Section 75C of the Army Act proposed by the Bill states:
"If, on an application by the commanding officer of a person arrested . . . a judicial officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the continued keeping of that person in military custody is justified",
he may authorise it, I presume the commanding officer has no say in the matter at all and the periods for which custody may be used are very short.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 672.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Burnham and Lord Inge are former senior Army officers.
<P>
I understand that The Officer magazine is conducting a survey of its readers' views on the Bill and I hope that the Minister will read the results carefully. Has the Ministry of Defence carried out not just soundings but surveys among officers of all three services--not just senior officers? If it has, will the Minister undertake to publish the findings? If it has not, I hope that he will consider doing so. The Ministry of Defence carried out a vast and comprehensive survey of the views of service men of all ranks on homosexuals serving in the forces. The results were evidently very helpful, even if the findings ultimately had to be discarded by the Government.
<P>
I wonder why the Government have not carried out a similar survey or pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill as requested by the Defence Committee. The argument has been made in various forums and the quinquennial Act procedure is very appropriate for this sort of legislation. Such a process is immensely helpful, particularly as Parliament is legislating in an area with which we are increasingly unfamiliar. The Opposition are fortunate to have two hon. Members who have served as regulars in Her Majesty's forces, but they are the only two on the Committee. When I served on the Committee considering the previous quinquennial Bill, it was of immense value to me, under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport, to visit a wide range of Army bases and institutions and to learn a great deal in the process. I regret that the Bill has not received that pre-legislative scrutiny.
<P>
The Defence Committee noted that the Leader of the House had backed up its view on pre-legislative scrutiny on many occasions. The Committee further noted that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> although the MoD's view was that the present Bill is a technical measure designed to meet an externally imposed requirement of compliance with the ECHR, nonetheless as this brief examination has shown, it raises a number of issues of principle and wider questions about the need for military law to recognise the special circumstances of military life, especially on active service. Such questions would benefit from calm consideration and the opportunity for reflection.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are giving the Bill calm consideration and the Government could take an opportunity for reflection, but that is not the same as pre-legislative scrutiny.
<P>
The Select Committee shared our view on the importance of consultation and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> An opportunity to canvass more widely the views of COs might also have been useful, if only to allay some of their anxieties.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee asked the Minister why this legislation had not been published as a draft Bill. His view was that both the Ministry of Defence and the Committee had missed a good opportunity on this occasion and recommended that on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> future occasions the MoD will see the benefits of introducing legislation in draft form so that we can take up the opportunity to comment on proposals before they are formally introduced into Parliament as Bills.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given the fraught progress that this so-called technical measure has had so far in both Houses--we are conscious of the looming October deadline--I hope that the Minister will consider a consultation exercise even at this stage. I should be grateful if he would set out the Government's position on that and tell the Committee whether there has been any consultation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Perhaps I can assist my hon. Friend on the attitude of the armed forces to this issue. One hopes that most soldiers, NCOs and officers are exposed to military law only occasionally. It is tiresome to be on the receiving end of the justice system, and it is also tiresome to administer it. No one wants to get involved in the duties that are necessarily imposed on officers and NCOs who administer Army, Air Force or Navy justice at the sharp end.
<P>
If the Army's views on the manual of military law were surveyed, there would be a nil response, because people do not understand the technicalities. I should tell those Committee members who have not had the benefit of military experience that the manual of military law comes in a fat red ring binder, a copy of which can normally be found in each squadron or company. Periodically, in its wisdom, the House produces a large number of amendments to it. The unit clerk has to ensure that the manual is up to date by inserting the new pages and discarding the old ones. Most of the ring binders were produced in 1955, when the Act was introduced. Over time, the Act has expanded under the weight of legislation, and the ring binders are no longer big enough to accommodate it. Indeed, there have been three Acts since I left the Army.
<P>
That is probably as much as most members of the armed forces know about the Act, and I fear that a survey of attitudes to legislative changes would not produce the same reaction as a survey of attitudes to, say, homosexuality. Clearly, people have views on homosexuality and, according to their experience, the effect it would have on the system. In considering the Bill's impact, it is the responsibility of Committee members to protect the interests of the armed forces. I am not as sanguine as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury about the benefits of conducting a wide-ranging survey, but it is clear that it might be useful to survey the attitudes of commanding officers, who will be trained in the new procedures and will be affected most by the provisions.
<P>
I have tried hard to understand what subsection (6) is designed to achieve, but I cannot. Before I decide whether the clause should stand part of the Bill, I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would explain subsection (6) to me.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I think that subsection (6) is purely technical: if it does not proceed, all further provisions are automatically dissolved. I shall deal with the matter in detail during my winding-up speech, but it appears to be one  of those technical provisions that has to be included in legislation to take account of all eventualities.
<P>
Will the availability of the appeals process undermine the commanding officer? The chiefs of staff advise us that commanding officers feel threatened by the European Court of Human Rights. They and their men are subject to its provisions, and they know that their decisions can be challenged, which could undermine their authority. The Bill attempts to give their authority back to them by ensuring that the Army's decisions in this regard, which are not cast in stone, are fully compliant with the law.
<P>
The availability of appeals will undermine the commanding officer only if he gets the matter wrong--but if he does so, frankly, he deserves to have his authority undermined. He should not get it wrong--that, after all, is why he is in command. We are entitled to expect at least that standard of enforcement from him.
<P>
The commanding officer's authority will not be undermined by the availability of appeals--quite the reverse--or by the functions of the judicial officer. It should be a comfort to a commanding officer to know that a statutory procedure is available and that he does not have to make the difficult decisions himself. His pitch to the judicial officer would be based purely on his experience and his view of what occurred. The more that I consider the matter, the more I realise that, far from undermining discipline, our approach will help it. Nothing that I have heard so far has changed my mind. It is the fact that the present situation is untenable that undermines discipline.
<P>
I do not take as much notice of surveys as others might do--they can be intensely unreliable. We have not conducted a formal survey of opinion. The chiefs of staff consulted widely on the Bill with senior officers and decided that it is the best way forward. Ours is a consensual approach to the extent that we have consulted. Frankly, however, we do not interfere with senior officers' activities to such an extent that we know how wide consent is, who was consulted or what they were asked. The chiefs of staff said that they have consulted, and we take their word for it.
<P>
Perhaps we should consider consulting more widely. We should have preferred it if the Bill had been subjected to wider scrutiny before it was published--that is always the case with legislation. However, it takes an inordinate length of time to prepare legislation on a subject as complicated as this, and we did not have time for such consultation. The hearing before the Select Committee on Defence and our debates in Committee have been conducted on the understanding that our approach was force majeur--it was all that we could do. We were advised on the matter in December 1998 in the wake of the Hood inquiry. It takes an inordinate length of time to put such legislation together. We did not want to consider draft legislation until we were sure that we had a slot in the legislative programme. For all of those reasons it was not practical--I use that word once again--to do so.
<P>
On subsection (6), a court martial is an ad hoc court with an appointed judge advocate. Once the court martial begins, the judge advocate will deal with the review of custody, but if the court martial dissolves, we require a further review by the judicial officer. I hope that that is clear--I am not sure that I have understood it fully. I have no more to say on the subject. For the reasons that I have outlined, I believe that the provisions of the Bill will strengthen the powers and authority of commanding officers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The Under-Secretary said that commanding officers would be undermined by the provisions of the European convention on human rights unless the Bill was introduced. That is an interesting construction.
<P>
However, the Under-Secretary's most telling comment was "We have not had time to do it." That says a great deal about this legislation. How often has that happened before? I put up my hands and say that, under the Conservative Government, from time to time, legislation was introduced in a rush. That led, on some occasions, to the tabling of amendments. This Government have done the same thing; it is the nature of the legislative process that that happens occasionally. However, in this case, the implications of the European convention on human rights have been under consideration for a very long time. The military have certainly been working on the issue for years, as they told me when I visited Trenchard Lines some years ago.
<P>
I smell a rat. About 90 amendments have been tabled, but only one of them is a Government amendment. I am not cynical, but I am deeply suspicious of any Government who introduces a Bill, then table only one amendment to it. That tells me that something is up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I fear that my hon. Friend may have--I am sorry, I cannot find my notes.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Right at the end--[Interruption]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not quite sure where we are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> My hon. Friend has now found his notes.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The Bill has already been through another place, and has been amended there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> That makes me even more smelly of rats. [Laughter.] Perhaps I should say more suspicious. In my experience, the fact that a Bill has been through the other place does not necessarily ensure that no more amendments are needed.
<P>
The Ministry of Defence has carried out neither surveys nor pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill passed through the other place very fast indeed--I believe that fewer than 10 hours were spent on deliberations--and has come to the House of Commons with one Government amendment, which proposes to leave out subsection (4) of clause 28. We look forward to debating that, and to discovering exactly what happened between the Lords and the Commons to necessitate that amendment. The Bill was first printed without that subsection, then reprinted with it. That is fine, but we still have only one Government amendment.
<P>
There will be many occasions on which the Government will wish that they had taken more trouble over the Bill. It will have to be amended substantially, and I suspect that that clause will have to be amended quite quickly thereafter. For the reasons that I mentioned in my opening remarks, as well as those that I have just given, I cannot recommend to my hon. Friends that we support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> In my hon. Friend's narrative of the passage of the Bill through the other place, he did not mention the weight of military authority that was deployed against its proceeding, and the fact that considerable reservations were expressed.
<P>
It is unfair that the chiefs of staff should be quoted as supporters of Government policy. Increasingly, Ministers are stating that the Chief of the Defence Staff or the chiefs of staff are in favour of a certain piece of legislation, or this or that change to, cut in or expansion of its provisions. Of course, they have to say that they are in favour of Government legislation, because if they were not, they would, as men of honour, resign. I find it offensive that they should be quoted and called in aid to support political actions.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I too am unhappy that very senior military officers--the Chief of the Defence Staff or the chiefs of the various services--are increasingly paraded on television to say that they endorse a particular Government policy. They also write letters to newspapers in a similar vein. In my constituency, I am, like my hon. Friend, never short of military advice, and I know that people are waking up to this. They are asking "Why can't Ministers stand up and justify matters for themselves rather than continually fall back on the people who have to operate the system for them?"

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Indeed. I recall the example of an admiral who wrote to The Times to say that the government are caring and compassionate.
<P>
One should exercise a degree of diffidence and respect for members of the armed forces, and not seek to embroil them in the political dimension. I am convinced that, in overwhelming numbers, they do not wish to have the Bill imposed on them. It circumscribes, albeit in a limited way, the powers of commanding officers, and increases expenditure on judicial areas of operation rather than the armed forces per se. We owe a great debt of obligation to those in our armed forces, and should avoid circumscribing their activities as much as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Several points should be addressed before we allow the clause to stand part of the Bill, because it has potential flaws.
<P>
Subsection (3)(e) of new section 75H seems to be a charter for an accused to be held in custody no matter how many times his court martial is postponed, or for how long it is postponed. Does the Under-Secretary agree with the dictum that justice delayed is justice denied? One would normally expect a court martial to be concluded as soon as is reasonably practicable--whatever that means--but in any case one would not expect somebody to be remanded in custody indefinitely.
<P>
Moving on to subsection (4), why is section 75F(3)(d) struck out in the case of an accused who is awaiting sentence before a court martial? That may be contrary to the convention. New evidence may come up in the course of a court martial, which might work either to the detriment of the accused or the other way round. It might strengthen his case in favour of acquittal, or make it even more pertinent that he be remanded in custody. If a judicial officer is to review whether somebody should be held in custody, he should be able to consider the strength of the evidence.
<P>
I turn to subsection (5). If somebody is not convicted of a particular charge at a court martial, but he appears to have committed a serious offence and a new charge is brought, why cannot he be held in custody? Under subsection (5) if he is not sentenced by a court martial he cannot continue to be held in custody. What happens in those circumstances? Does he have to be released or can a new charge be brought immediately after he is convicted at a court martial, so he can be remanded in custody? That might apply in certain serious circumstances.
<P>
Finally, I have read subsection (6) several times, but I am not sure what it means. It seems to be written in especially contorted legalese. Perhaps the Under- Secretary could explain it before the Committee decides whether to press the matter to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I listened to the Under-Secretary's explanation of subsection (6), and I understand all the parts that are not in parentheses. I want to clarify the effect of the part in parentheses. I presume that it refers to the sentence passed down by the court as detention. If it is not the sentence, what is it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend merely amplifies what I was trying to ask the Under-Secretary. I seek answers to my three queries in relation to subsections (3), (5) and (6).
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The answer to the first question is that the court martial has already made a finding on the evidence before it. If there is new evidence, the guilty party should then appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No, I will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It is pertinent.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Under-Secretary is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I shall give way after I have finished answering the three points. On subsection (5), after the individual has been sentenced he will be given his punishment, whatever that is. That is why the conditions thereafter do not apply. If a new charge is brought, the individual can be remanded again if necessary. On subsection (6), I can do no more than read out the explanation that I have already given. It is not my fault that the hon. Gentleman does not understand it. Perhaps repetition might help. A court martial is an ad hoc court with an appointed judge advocate. Therefore, once the court martial begins, the judge advocate will deal with the review of custody. If the court martial dissolves, a further review will be undertaken by the judicial officer, as the judge advocate is no longer presiding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Under- Secretary for giving way. It was a pity that he did not do so when he was dealing with subsection (3), as my intervention would have been more pertinent. With respect his answer is not entirely correct, The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the accused's case has been adjourned for inquiries or a report.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that the court martial has not passed sentence, which is precisely my point. The court martial can be adjourned any number of times, but the accused can still be remanded. That seems to be a case of justice delayed is justice denied, which cannot be a good thing. How many times can the court martial be adjourned and the accused still remanded?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I suspect, although like the hon. Gentleman I would think that it is against natural justice, that the answer is as often as is considered necessary. After all, non-military trials frequently have to be adjourned. It may be that a witness has not appeared or something else has interfered with proceedings. Unfortunately, that is one of the risks of taking part in trials. I would expect our system to attempt to deal with charges as timeously as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In a civilian context, a legal representative would, after it appeared unreasonable to remand somebody, apply for a writ of habeas corpus and ask for his client to be released.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> If it were considered unreasonable, that would of course be so. The question is whether it is considered unreasonable.
<P>
I cannot provide a further explanation. We have had a thorough discussion of the clause and I have tried to deal fully with all the points that were raised. I shall certainly support the principle that the clause stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Release from custody after charge</center></H4>
or during proceedings
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 24, line 23, leave out from 'imprisonment' to 'or' in line 24.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 59, in page 24, line 48, leave out from 'imprisonment' to 'or' in page 25, line 1.
<P>
No. 60, in page 25, line 26, leave out from 'imprisonment' to end of line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The amendments are straightforward and would make the Bill more robust, given the conditions in which it may have to apply. The Bill will be used by the armed forces on operations and in times of war as well as peace. It has been drafted in the luxury of permanent peacetime conditions--or, at least, conditions short of war--and assumptions have been made about a civilian equivalent. Given that we cannot predict the circumstances in which hearings may occur, it would be appropriate to change the weight of punishment available to courts in cases where a person absconds during a hearing.
<P>
It is clear that one cannot anticipate the circumstances in which the Bill will apply, and it must be robust enough to meet the conditions of war and peace. In giving evidence to the Defence Committee, Brigadier Ritchie, the director of Army personnel services, pointed out that detaining people and arranging their custody during wartime imposes a burden. When one has to conduct proceedings in an emergency, one does not want to detain people if one can avoid doing so. In those circumstances, if someone who had been released and who was required to attend proceedings chose not to present himself, he would have committed an extremely serious offence, which would not be equivalent to going absent without leave, although it might be treated in that way under normal peacetime conditions.
<P>
If one has a duty to attend such proceedings because one is subject to military law by virtue of sections 131 or 205, failure to attend in the most extreme circumstances would involve not going absent without leave but desertion. The amendment would allow the court to impose the appropriate sentence. The punishment should not be limited to a maximum tariff of two years' imprisonment.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment recognises that the armed forces occasionally operate in extreme circumstances. They need to ensure that in extremely demanding conditions people who are required to attend will do so and that the proper penalty will be imposed if they do not. That is why I want to remove the two-year limit. People should be aware that in certain circumstances--for instance, during active service or when they face a charge that would result in a sentence of more than two years' imprisonment--absenting themselves is not an option that they should undertake lightly and that doing so may be equivalent to desertion. The response should involve sentences that are appropriate not for being absent without leave but for desertion.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> This is an interesting group of amendments. The 90 or so amendments that we have considered involve two main groups, which amend one word in the Bill. It would be misleading to suggest that there are 90 Opposition amendments and one Government amendment.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment, which would reduce the punishment that a court martial can impose on an accused for failure to appear at a hearing, is unclear.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B> Mr. Blunt:</B> I hope that the amendment is correctly drafted. My intention is to remove the relevant limit. Subsection (4) currently states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction by court-martial to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or any less punishment provided by this Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the amendment is agreed to, it would state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction by court-martial to imprisonment or any less punishment provided by this Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would give the court the flexibility to reflect the relevant circumstances. When someone who has a duty to turn up absents himself from proceedings, the courts can establish whether wartime or normal peacetime conditions prevail--in the former case, the offence would be equivalent to desertion.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The clause will not apply to personnel who are still serving; it will apply only to those who have left service but who are subject to a charge from a previous period of service. The hon. Gentleman may have a different intention, but the amendment would have the effect that I described. The offence applies only to persons who are no longer subject to service law, except for the purposes of being dealt with for having committed an offence under the service discipline Acts. Those are persons who are ordinarily civilians and could be liable to a sentence of imprisonment imposed by a Crown court if they had committed the same offence.
<P>
The maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment specified in the Bill is to conform to the maximum for the majority of service offences. That does not mean that offenders normally receive the maximum sentence. The court obviously takes into account the gravity of the offence. It should be remembered that we are talking about individuals who have been released on bail in the confidence that they will turn up for their trial. Failure to attend trial is not a trivial matter.
<P>
I cannot see any need for the amendment, and would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. Having taken into account what he said, and in the interests of the Committee making progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The clause inserts a new section into each of the service discipline Acts. Subsection (1) inserts a new section into the Army Act 1955, dealing with release from custody after charge or during proceedings. New section 75J applies when an accused is released from custody either at a custody hearing or at any later review of custody, and provides that he shall be released from custody forthwith. It also provides that certain persons have to comply with conditions, which may be imposed by the judicial officer or judge advocate, relating to their subsequent attendance at any hearing relating to the offence charged. Anyone who does not comply with those conditions will be guilty of an offence punishable by up to two years' imprisonment. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate would remove that two-year limit.
<P>
The clause relates to the powers and responsibilities of judicial officers. The amendments that we originally tabled were consequential to others that we were seeking to make with regard to the substitution of judicial officers with duty officers. Those amendments were aimed at limiting the adverse operational, administrative and budgetary impacts of the Bill.
<P>
The Human Rights Act 1998, which comes into force on 2 October, is one of the main drivers behind the Government's reasons for introducing the Bill. As the Committee is well aware, the Act incorporates certain provisions of the ECHR into UK law. On Second Reading in the other place, Baroness Symons, the Minister for Defence Procurement, made this illuminating comment about the Bill:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes, it is part of the Government's human rights agenda, but it is no part of the Government's human rights agenda to undermine Armed Forces discipline.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c. 701.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was revealing that the Minister should admit that this "technical measure" was part of the Government's human rights agenda. Her comments seemed to set her apart from the Minister for the Armed Forces, who, in his public utterances on the Bill, has given the impression that the Ministry of Defence has been forced into it by the exigencies of European law, and that we are putting our system of armed forces discipline at risk if we do not take this course of action.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary clarify whether it is now Government policy to introduce a culture of rights into the forces? I am not party politicking; many people, including those in my constituency, are genuinely concerned about this. They fear that the British Army, in particular, will never be the same again, and will lose a great deal more than it will gain. Of course, the military will make it work--they always make things work when that is what the law requires--but, I share the fears of many people in the Army that this will take the shine off the British military tradition. We have already heard about soldiers who might sue commanding officers if they disagree with orders. The Under-Secretary endorsed that when he said that if a commanding officer gets a decision wrong, he should be penalised for it.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will be aware that article 11 of the European convention on human rights--that pertaining to freedom of assembly and association --gives individuals the right to form and join trade unions. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That article goes on to state that the armed forces are effectively exempt from that provision. However, given that so much of the convention--which was clearly never intended to apply to the armed forces--has been applied to military issues, I wonder how long it will be before such an exemption is challenged. Will the Under-Secretary reaffirm the Government's position on trade unions in the armed forces?
<P>
The trade union issue highlights our feeling that we were misled, perhaps unwittingly, during the passage of the Human Rights Bill through both Houses of Parliament. During its consideration in the other place, Lord Campbell of Alloway recognised the danger that it might have for the armed forces. He tabled an amendment that suggested that the armed forces should be excluded from the classes of person covered by the Bill. At that time, assurances were given by the Lord Chancellor that it was not intended or anticipated that the armed forces should be affected, and if it appeared likely that they would be, special legislation might have to be introduced to correct that. The Lord Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I urge your Lordships to be of the view that the convention is a flexible instrument. It poses no threat to the effectiveness of the Armed Forces.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to attempt to allay the concerns that had been expressed about the possible effect on the armed forces. He indicated his willingness to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>consider designating military courts as the appropriate forum for the consideration of complaints on convention grounds by Armed Forces personnel.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Most interestingly of all, the Lord Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Defence takes the view that the Bill raises no issues which are special to the Armed Forces. --[Official Report, House of Lords, 5 February 1998; Vol. 585, c. 768.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Little more than a year later, this Bill is dumped on the armed forces. There has been no blanket, or partial, derogation for them from human rights law. Lord Robertson has now moved on to NATO, and I imagine that he is rather relieved at not having to explain away those comments now. However, there is no doubt that Ministers made a mistake either in not telling the House about their evident concerns, or in not ensuring that the legal position of the armed forces was properly scrutinised by lawyers at the Ministry of Defence and other Departments before the passing of the human rights legislation.
<P>
Is the Under-Secretary satisfied that the legal advice that his Department received before the passing of the Human Rights Act 1998 was adequate? Although the judgment in the Hood case was not made until February 1999, the Government must have been aware of the case and of its possible implications. They often talk about joined-up government, but that clearly was not applicable here. We were led astray, wittingly or unwittingly, by the Government over the impact of human rights law on the armed forces. That view is shared by many people in the forces. Will the Under-Secretary clarify the Government's position on that fundamental question, before we decide whether to support clause 5?
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I find myself in difficulty, having withdrawn my amendment on the advice of the Under-Secretary that the provision did not apply only to those who were no longer subject to military law. My understanding is that paragraphs (ea), (eb), (g) and (h) of section 205(1) of the Army Act 1995--as referred to in the Bill--apply to the Territorial Army and to members of the reserve forces. If they have been called up, they will probably be subject to military law and the same penalties should apply to them as to members of the regular forces.
<P>
I have a further difficulty in that I have failed to declare my interest. I am a member of the regular army reserve, and these measures would apply to me. I am aware that in proposing the amendments, I was proposing a stiffer sentence for myself. I hope that my failure to declare an interest at the time can be forgiven, as I was proposing a stiffer sentence rather than a more lenient one.
<P>
I want to take further advice on the Under-Secretary's direction and he may be able to help me when he responds on clause 5 stand part.

<P>

<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I was minded to support my hon. Friend's amendment to clause 5, but I was reassured by the Under-Secretary's categorical statement that the provision applies only to individuals who are no longer in the armed forces. However, section 205(1)(ea) of the Army Act 1955 states that the persons subject to military law include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>every officer of the Territorial Army who is a special member when in permanent service, in full-time service or undertaking any training or duty (whether in pursuance of an obligation or not).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was dissuaded from supporting my hon. Friend's amendment by the Under-Secretary and now feel that the Under-Secretary may wish to reconsider his advice to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am sure that that is the case. I understand from the procedural advice that I have been given that we must return to the matter on Report if we want to reconsider it. I suspect that the Under-Secretary's advice referred to section 131 of the 1955 Act and not section 205.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> May I make two quick comments? First, that is precisely why I asked the Under-Secretary at our sitting on Tuesday for clarification on exactly to whom the Bill applies.
<P>
Secondly, the awful thought has crossed my mind that I may also have an interest. A long time ago, when I was a student, I was a member of Cambridge university air squadron, but for too short a time, regrettably, to acquire my pilot's licence. I recall that when I left the air squadron, I received a piece of paper saying that I was a member of the Royal Air Force reserve. There has never been any follow up since that day in 1964, but in case I should have declared an interest, I do so now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> If my hon. Friend has reached the advanced age of 50--he probably has not--his reserve service will have lapsed. I have another 11 years as a member of the regular Army reserve and in my regular communication with the Army reserve centre, I have made it clear that, if needed, I am available and happy to be so. However, I have a certain concern after last year, when I took a dim view of the activities of the Chief of the Defence Staff in writing articles for three newspapers in support of Government policy. I made it clear that it was inappropriate for the Chief of the Defence Staff to take such action. The question arose of what advice he was giving to the then Secretary of State and I thought it best that he should resign. The thought of being called up to serve under that Chief of the Defence Staff made me pause to consider whether I had been wise, in my own interest, to take the position.
<P>
That takes me to the question of adducing chiefs of staff in support of these measures and I fear that they have been invited to overstep the mark. The case being made for the provisions is too weak and I draw the Committee's attention to how far the chiefs of staff have been leant on to come quietly.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are having a general debate and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will relate his comments to the clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I accept your guidance, Mr. Malins, that we should return to the matter later and not discuss it with clause stand part.
<P>
With the inadequacy of the punishment in the clause and because my amendments were not accepted by the Committee, I do not believe that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. The Under-Secretary may have given a reply that was not factually correct in response to earlier amendments. Clause 5 applies during court martial proceedings. The clause heading is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Release from custody after charge or during proceedings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is therefore clear that the people affected might still be subject to military law, although the Under-Secretary said otherwise. If he has inadvertently given us the wrong information, thereby causing us to withdraw the amendment, would we be entitled to return to the matter at a later stage, perhaps by reordering the clauses?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If during a Committee a Minister gives an answer that is inadvertently accurate-- [Laughter.] I mean inadvertantly inaccurate; inaccuracy would of course be inadvertent--the Committee would expect a correction in due course. The decision having been made, we cannot reopen the matter in Committee, even if an amendment has been withdrawn on the basis of an incorrect statement. However, it is entirely possible that there will be an opportunity to return to the matter on Report, with a similar amendment, or during more general debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Malins. Could the Minister clarify the matter before the Committee finishes its consideration of this clause? If my hon. Friends and I are right, could we return to the amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is for the Under-Secretary, who has listened to this exchange with great care, to decide on what he says in response. Clearly, he would like to correct any incorrect statement that he made earlier. Whether or not that is necessary or desirable, the Committee cannot return to amendments that were debated earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Malins. Could the Minister clarify the point before clause stand part? That would help the Committee to decide whether to vote for or against the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is up to the Minister to decide whether to respond. He may feel that an early intervention in the stand part debate would be a useful approach, which could guide hon. Members in their further comments. It is for the Minister to decide what to say and at what stage. It is not a matter for the Chairman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I therefore ask the Under- Secretary whether he wishes to intervene to clarify the matter.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Under-Secretary refuses to clarify the matter.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> At this moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> That makes it difficult for me to know how to phrase my clause stand part speech. I shall have to do so on the basis that the Minister will not say anything helpful. An individual might abscond during a court martial proceeding. Some very serious offences may need to be dealt with--very rarely, I hope-- including murder. The judge at the court martial in such a case might want to take into account the fact that the accused had absconded and add more than two years to the sentence. It would therefore make thoroughly good sense to amend the clause as my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate suggests. I shall urge him, if we do not receive a satisfactory response from the Minister, not only to vote against the clause--because we cannot vote for a clause that we view as inherently flawed--but to take the view that we should return to the matter either in Committee, by way of a new clause, or on Report, by way of an amendment.
<P>
I should like clarification from the Minister, if he is listening, of a point that I raised under clause 4, which also arises in connection with section 75J(2)(a) that clause 5 would insert into the Army Act 1955. That provides for the accused to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>released from military custody forthwith<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
after the court martial verdict. If, in the course of the proceedings, it became clear that the wrong charge had been brought, but that an offence had been committed serious enough to warrant prosecution under the correct charge, would it still be possible to remand the person concerned in custody? What would happen if an accused person committed an offence while awaiting a court martial verdict--such as seriously assaulting an officer while in custody--and a second charge needed to be brought? That offence would seem to warrant a remand in custody, because someone who had committed an assault while on remand in court martial proceedings might commit a further assault.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I follow the line of thought of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) but want to add another "what if?". The Minister has said that he does not like to ask "what if?". He does not like exploring all the possibilities. However, a lawyer drafting legislation or a contract tries to envisage all the circumstances that might arise. One possible relevant circumstance has occurred to me.
<P>
If a person was charged with manslaughter in circumstances where there was considerable mitigation, and was released on bail, facts might then emerge to show that he had mens rea at the time of the alleged manslaughter. That could give rise to a charge of murder instead. The accused person might weigh the two years maximum penalty for absconding, which my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate considers insufficient, and decide that it would be worth while not to surrender. I am not satisfied that clause 5 has been shown to be a necessary part of the Bill and I oppose it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It might help if I explain again. I guarantee that if I have misdirected the Committee in any way I shall correct myself when I have looked at the record. That will not allow the hon. Gentleman to resubmit his amendment at this stage, but he will be able to do so later.
<P>
4.30 pm
<P>
The clause is directed at people who are no longer subject to the service discipline Acts but who are being charged for an offence committed while they were subject to service law. Such people include those in reserve forces, civilians and regular service personnel who have been discharged. In the reserve forces, only officers are subject to the service discipline Acts. I have been informed that they must be under 50 and not in the cadet force. Other personnel are subject to the Acts only when on duty.
<P>
People who have left the services but have a continuing reserve liability are subject to service law only when they are called up for duty. Civilians are subject to service law only in specific circumstances overseas, as defined by the Acts. The Acts provide that persons no longer subject to service law generally will remain subject to it for the purposes of trying an offence committed while the alleged offender was subject to service law. If people belonging to any of the categories that I have mentioned are being tried for an offence under the service discipline Acts and are released from custody pending or during a trial, they cannot be required to attend the hearing or trial under current legislation, which is why the provision is necessary.
<P>
I admire the ingenuity with which the hon. Member for Salisbury hung a great deal of extraneous matter on his solicitor's inquiry about the clause. His questions have no relevance, however, and I have already answered them on several occasions. I shall consider the particular point made by the hon. Member for Reigate, and I shall set the record straight if I have missed anything.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Would the Under-Secretary be kind enough to comment on the two examples that I described? Will somebody sentenced under court martial have to be released forthwith, notwithstanding the circumstances that I outlined?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> If an additional charge is to be made as an alternative during the trial, the prosecution can apply to the court under section 83 of the Army Act 1955 for that additional charge to be tried, and it would remain subject to the proceedings. The whole point is that once the proceedings have begun, they are considered to be ongoing even if the charges change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Opposition Members pointed out circumstances in which a two-year sentence could be inappropriate and could provide a perverse incentive to abscond. It would create such an incentive in the circumstances described by my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport. If the amendments are seen to be merited, the matters will have to be dealt with on Report. Indeed, I should be happy to see the proposals appear in  Government amendments, which I would be delighted to support. When the Minister has considered the advice  that he has given me and taken further advice, will he let me know whether such proposals will be made?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It might be helpful for me to say that even if the hon. Gentleman's reading is correct, I would still oppose his amendment. We consider two years to be a perfectly adequate upper level for the sentence and do not wish to change that limit. I shall endeavour to set the record straight on that in future, but I see no reason why the clause should not stand part of the Bill.

<P>
</FONT>Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. When a Committee member clearly expresses a vote, do you and the Clerk not accept that as his or her vote?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The answer is that the Clerk took it as a change of vote, because it was so expressed before he moved on to ask the next hon. Member to vote. I hope that is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Indeed. It is clear. I observed the hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (Mrs. Heal) express her vote. She then put her hand to her mouth, but she did not say, "On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, I wish to correct my vote." She did not express a different vote.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let me make it quite plain to the hon. Gentleman, who is an experienced member of the House and the Committee, that if an hon. Member says, "Yes, no", for example, but the Clerk who is calling the vote is satisfied, then that is how the matter stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Malins. Can we be clear about this? Is not the ruling of the House clear that if an hon. Member inadvertently makes the wrong vote in Committee and wishes to change that vote, he or she must rise on a point of order and request that the vote is changed?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The ruling is that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A Member who has voted (or failed to vote) by mistake will normally be allowed to alter (or record) his vote provided that he makes his request before the numbers have been declared from the chair, but he cannot do so after the declaration.
<P>
The method by which an hon. Member may alter a vote is a matter of judgment for the Clerk and Chairman. If it seems, as it seemed to the Clerk in this case, and as it seemed to all Committee members, that the hon. Member voted in error and wished to correct her vote, the matter is in the discretion of the Chairman and the Clerk. That is how the position rests.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Key:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Malins. We are most grateful and because the hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis is so nice, we shall not take the matter any further.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We shall leave it there.
